Ive had many friends from the UK over and they all say its pretty much the same. They depict Norway and Norwegians as more laidback and chill.. Norway is about as good with written and spoken English as the UK. Some elderly people would probably struggle with English but the younger part of the population is not a problem to stick to English. As far as your classes go thats a different issue. If your schools teacher teach in Norwegian youd have to have a grasp on the language. Id just like to point out that unlike most of Europe television programs and movies ARE NOT dubbed into Norwegian which means we learn English as soon as we start watching porn..

1668578,0,t3_2ddhdl,Ive travelled abroad with my dog several times. Many people have listed the paperworkshotsother requirements but basically The dog must not be of any illegal breed or even part bred. If the police even SUSPECTS that the dog is a part bred pitbull or other illegal breed they can put it down on the spot. If the dog is purebred and is registered in the American Kennel Club with a pedigree it is easier. If its a mix or rescue of some sort the breed is nearly impossible to prove. The dog must be healthy and comfortable in a cagekennel alone for a long time to be allowed to fly with most airlines. Check with the airline!  You must travel with the dog. You cant send it in advance or on a later flight. Dog needs a passport or official veterinary certificate You need proof of ownership. You must be the dogs owner and your name must be in the dogs passport. Dog needs micro chip. Chip number must be in passport. Dog needs necessary shots and worm treatment within the time limits. This must be entered into passport and stamped by a vet. You must make Mattilsynet Norwegian Food Safety Authority aware of your dogs arrival within  hours of entering the country. They must know when and where youre arriving and they will check not only your documentation they will investigate the actual dog as well. If you make serious mistakes you will either  be refused to enter the country you have to go back home and hope the US will let your dog back in.  Be offered to have the dog put into quarantine. This is EXTREMELY expensive. Around   kr for one dog.  The dog will be put down then and there.Although some minor mistakes CAN be allowed dont count on it. For instance some places you can give your dog worm treatment after coming back from Sweden into Norway as long as you go to the vet IMMEDIATELY after crossing the border. After you come to Norway it is expected that you follow a regular vaccination plan although it is not legally required.I always get nervous about doing everything right. Read Mattilsynets pages or mail them. Ask the American Kennel Club or dog breeders to help you. Ask the airline as well. Mattilsynets website is really good in Norwegian. Have your girlfriend help you check off all the requirements of the list they give you specifically traveling from the US.Also if you have to change flights during your travel make sure you are allowed to enter all countries on your way!,Norway,cjphi62,2,t5_2qwrb

Why the fuck would you give them money if they arent working? What do you think will happen if you have such laws?I think you should do these laws the same way Australia and Canada did. If you have useful skill and experience you can come and work not fuck around on taxpayers money. I am  and currently in Poland. I am learning norwegian in  year and certainly wouldnt qualify since I have no special skills yet and this is fair. If you would need unqualified workforce that is able to communicate I will be right there.I also wonder why the fuck you have right wing parties if they are not even slightly on the right side? Hyre got  more votes than  years earlier but I dont see how they are any different than left wing parties. In Poland right wing wants to reduce taxes to  and just keep VAT  because in UE you cant have it lower. Why the fuck would anybody want to punish people for working with tax on your salary? People will get more money so they will spend more and you will get your share and investors.In my opinion Sweden is fucked already and Norway is trying its best to follow. If you dont have any barriers for immigrants they will take advantage of you and your tolerance for every shit they pull. In my opinion scandinavians often pay people for shitting on their country and they make excuses to not punish them in any way. This is retarded.Sorry for my english I know that there are normal immigrants but you can filter bad ones and kick them out of your land if they complain.

You could check Finn to see if someone need a temporary room mate or you can post an ad there yourself. When you find a more permanent place to stay remember that every land lord wants at least  months rent deposit  you have to pay for the first month in advance.I would try to line up some interviews before you come. Often hiring people take some time in Norway so it can be a wait before you know if you get the job and before you start. So make sure you dont spend all your money.Linux jobs on the two largest job sites in NorwayYou can apply for jobs that want Norwegian skills. Dont lie about your Norwegian skills but do write that you are starting to learn Norwegian and will work hard on getting fluent when you move to Norway.A friend actually got a job that required Norwegian skills even though she at that point spoke very basic Norwegian. She was the perfect candidate and far better qualified than the other applicants except for the lack of Norwegian. She made a deal with the employer that she had to learn Norwegian quickly which she did spending many hours every evening and weekend the first couple of months. This of course only works for someone who is very qualified and for jobs where its difficult to get  good applicants. If you are one of many good applicants they will choose someone who know Norwegian.Make sure that your applications clearly states that you are an EU citizen. EUcitizens are much easier to hire than nonEU and many employers just delete the nonEU ones.Do target each application carefully to that specific company and job. Make sure it looks professional is easy to read and has no spellinggrammar mistakes. Just these easy things will make it stand out. A friend used to work as a IT recruiter and they got tons of awful applications especially from Indians that was full of mistakes and they had obviously sent the exact same one to tons of companies.Good luck!,Norway,co6o7j3,2,t5_2qwrb

The prices on living are very helpful though. Ive been to a few sites and the variance is huge on price range for living so I couldnt make much use of it. The license thing isnt a big deal as I anticipated using more public transport without having immediate access to a car I would be more than happy to wait a few years before going for my Norwegian license. By the way thanks for all the relevant links you posted they are very helpful and I have been reading them quite well.The main reason I asked for culture is because of one reason.If people asked me What are Australians like on Gold Coast QLD I would probably tell them Most people are kept to themselves in a hurry dont initiate solcialization are quite kind and giving. If you try to talk to one of us in public we would definitely take time to listen and help you but we dont socialize as much as we used to in previous years at least from when I were younger people never stopped talking haha. We havent really got the strong Australian accent you see on Crocodile Dundee but those accents do exist in small and infrequent amounts.

3836959,0,t1_cqthfvu,gtgtThat an r often merges with the next sound if its a consonant is simply a rule in some dialects.gtFTFY.Officially you are right. Norwegian is supposed to consist of a variety of equally acceptable dialects and the written form is independent of any specific dialect and comes in two variants. This is very much true for nynorsk which is probably the main problem for that variant but it is de facto not true for bokml anymore. You refer to my spoken language as some dialect implying that there are other dalects of equal status and that there is nothing special about my spoken language. Well like it or not but there is. Since samnorsk was abandoned the spelling changes of bokml has been made to adapt it to the pronounciation of Norwegian as used in the western parts of Oslo. If my dialect and I think it is correct to call it that changes the spelling of bokml will change in time as written language is usually more conservative than spoken language a main reason for why samnorsk failed.gtgtSomeone learning to read and write bokml could speak just like me and many others!gtOf course because what they are learning to speak is Norwegian. No they would speak my dialect not some general Norwegian language. This is politcally very incorrect to say since it gives some sort of precedence to the dialect of the traditionally most powerful area in Norway and the only place in Norway it is socially unacceptable to be proud of being from but it is still the truth.edit trying to learn the markup of reddit...,Norway,cqtnaej,0,t5_2qwrb

SASNorwegian flies all the other routes.Wether or not to book direct or via some other web site In my experience there is little to no price difference between the two.

After the expansion of NATO in the aftermath the ball is now on Russias .The closer NATO gets the more threatened Russia feels. Considering the total shitshow we would start by going for the touchdown I feel we are too close as it is.Putin is probably thinking that NATO is in fact going for the touchdown. What other reason for the creeping expansion right?Say we get to the ten. What is then keeping Putin from going cover zero all out blitz on us?Having a slight advantage is great but tipping the scales too much is unwise. Unless NATO is mad enough to actually try to win the game this constant creeping closer is counterproductive.I think Putin has no ambition whatsoever of expanding outside the old Soviet union and his current allies or to a NATO nation. Russia is the crystal clear underdog in this conflict. Putin is trying to not lose any more ground. He is defending. NATO is attacking. Or at least they have the ballConsidering Russias  The Soviet unions recent history I have full understanding for its uncomfortable position. They have good reason to be a bit paranoid in contrast to NATO  the US.I can see absolutely zero point in a show of force on NATOs part. Putin is smart if nothing else.

This is an assumed taxrate however based on predicted earnings calculated from previous years. At the end of the taxyear the actual taxrate is calculated and any deductions taken into account. Adjustments is then often made and most people find that they have paid too much tax this year and are due a payback from the state. ,Norway,d5dpae5,13,t5_2qwrb

Im afraid a lot of the regular jobs students have like in a kioskconvenience storegrocery store usually want people who can actually speak Norwegian. Not all of course but most. Id try walking around at daytime as the general managerboss tends to be there then asking around at cafes pubs clubs and the like where its not that important to know the language. Ask if you could speak to the manager and explain your situation and that youre highly motivated to work a little here and there perhaps bring some general workapplications in case theyre somewhat interested. Ask at the Uni as well if they can help you out or know anyone who needs help. Never hurts.Its not that easy to get a job even if youre Norwegian these days as the unemployment tends to increase a little so good luck!P.S For buying food Kiwi Rema  and Coop Extra tends to be a lot cheaper than the other grocery stores.

The climaweather is one thing  and the darkness in the winter. With the increased income for the city after the gasproduction started a few years back there are quite much modernization. At the same time it has become quite expensive to live there. But I guess my main problem is the culture. Very hard to explain but you kinda feel it is a small town where many know each other and how you present yourself is extremely important  and want to be seen on as important successful have money... strongfitpretty etc. Overall impression now is that Im glad I dont raise my children there.  my guess  this is why you are going there  work related to this?I think you can be surprised about how many that are into fitnessbodybuilding. For youth its said that this is the place where boy do steroids to get big while girls do amfetamin to stay slim. Hammerfest is close to the top when it come to reported violence crimes in Norway  taken the population into account.  If you are into outdooor life there are some nice areas. For the summer there are places on the island that are very nice. In the winter time there is not much to do on the island itself but  going to Skaidi and the further areas in that direction there are  from february and out very nice. A LOT of the people living in Hammerfest will have cabins in this area.I guess some of the stuff Im now reacting to with the town are maybe typical for small towns.

Watch out when walking from Fuglenes the area with the hospital to town or back as if it is quite windy the waves may reach the sidewalk and you will get a shitty surprise.    If you like going for hikes there is hilly terrain availble in the immediate vicinity of the town  there is a narrow trail called Sikksakkveien that goes from the center of town to the nearby hill.    There are a few pubs in town youll find out soon enough which ones to visit. There are  gyms one located in the center of town the other right by the airport. The one by the airport is probably the better choice if you wish to lift weights only and they also have much better policies regarding contracts.    What kind of information are you really looking for? Theres not much to the town really so if you have specific questions it is much easier to answer. Life is like in any other town I guess but considering the vast distances in the county and the size of the town you may need to travel if you need to buy something special.

Your out of money but get the minimum covered at least.You start learning the language while trying to fill your time with whatever there is to do around the place.Then after months or even years of waiting not being allowed to work and make any income you get the final blow and get deported.So much time and money wasted for nothing but a return ticket to a camp in your shitty homeland.Wouldnt you try to escape? To try living a normal life while on the run knowing its at least better than the camp?Its a delicate operation to deport someone so the least we can do is treat these desperate people with understanding and respect of their situation.

I have taken subjects both at the faculty for Stems subjects as well as the faculty for social sciences . Subjects like Physics applied maths and computer science have more males probably going from around  to  Male in the  first subjects. But even in the stem subjects its becoming more and more balanced due to government and non government drive for equal representation of genders in traditionally male Engineering  and female nursery dominated fields. While these has resulted in a more balanced gender environment in engineering subjects. It has totally failed in terms of recruiting enough males for health care subjects and studies.The faculties for humanities social sciences and law are all pretty much around  women  while law is probably around  at least at my university. ,Norway,de9wux2,1,t5_2qwrb

11087504,0,t1_deor23v,Alternatively you can get yourself the head of a sheep stick a heated metal rod up its nose melt out the brain through the nasal canal and then cleave the head in two  sear the sides of the head. Put it in a bathtub of salt for a week then put it in a smokehouse for two weeks and then boil it for four hours and voil you have smalahoveBut Ill be honest thats a bit more time consuming. ,Norway,deorbte,1,t5_2qwrb
11091965,0,t1_deojfig,I think its more than just an experiment. At one point the EVs sold in Norway was a very big percentage of EVs sold in all of Europe. Considering that Tesla was just hours from bankruptcy at one point its plausible that Norway has been the deciding factor which has kept some EV projects alive. EVs would still be developed but the growth could be significantly slowed.Buyingsupporting EVs is still not really about climate gasses yet. It needs much higher market share to even make a dent and other countries need a cleaner grid to amplify the effect. Right now its about building up the market technology and factories and the local environment benefits. Im against thinking of EVs in term of climate short term because climate is about the long term so we need to think about where well be in  years and how what we do today affects where well be in  years. Some countries might have mostly electricity from coal today. But with the astronomic growth of renewable energy its reasonable to assume that all countries will have more clean energy by the time EVs make a dent in global CO emissions.If someone EV proponent or opponent mentions numbers for CO emissions of EVs today or even this decade. Call them out on the fallacy. For us personally its currently a bit of an economic burden. But as EVPHEVs come down in price I think it will be a benefit for us that were ahead on EV infrastructure. With such cheap electricity driving mostly electric will save norwegians a lot of money. ,Norway,dep9izn,4,t5_2qwrb

11256412,0,t1_df7rqs5,Im going to prefix this by saying that I deeply love Norway and think that it does most things better than the rest of the world shops are my only problem.I find fruit and veg to be rotting on the same day that I buy it in multiple shops.Certain stuff can be like  higher price in different shops so you have to go to many shops to keep the cost down. The quality of ready made meals is very low. Where I am from the ready made meals are almost restaurant quality.The prices are around .  x higher than most advanced european countries for even the cheapest shops.The variety of brands is minimal unless you go to high end shops like Jacobs which can be double the price of even the high Norwegian prices.Then there are the layout of the shops  most of them have aisles so thin that even a single cart has trouble getting through.The products are frequently mispriced or dont even have prices. The interiors are often badly lit with mazelike layouts.The internet shopping options are often twice as expensive again as the high end shops making it really only a thing for the richest. In other countries it can cost the same amount as going to the shop itself.Its no mystery that the richest people in Norway own supermarket chains. Norwegians are being royally ripped off and underserved.     ,Norway,df7wb8o,6,t5_2qwrb
