Because its   dolars too? to switch from gb to tb... I personally would have gb and spend another  on a Tb USB. powered portable hard drive rather than spend the  bucks on tb internal...That being said its Quad Core vs Dual Core Dedicated Graphics vs Integrated Graphics portability vs real estate etc... It really depends on how heavy is your workload.Im going to talk for myself and then you think of this Im a student at Computer Science so I need something that can handle Windows amp Linux Virtual Machines. Im a gamer but I have a desktop for that. Although having a GPU is nice to play League of Legends and Counter Strike which are litterally what I mean  of the time Im playing. outside the house defenitly . I sometimes makes some videos  take some photos with my canon D as a hobby only and I want to edit them so some horsepower albeit not being a requirement its nice to have.That being said Ive had  inch notebooks and  ones. I like the portability of the  inch ones but I always end up getting back to  inch because its so much more usefull. Most of the time I leave my house with my laptop on a backpack and when I arrive on the university I put it on a table so  isnt really a requirement for me.This all being said and the Macs having everything non upgradable If I were you I would go for something with at least I stress out the at least gb of storage and Gb of ram.The midtier  inch being the lowest option viable. .Ghz i Gb of storage and Gb of RAM.Personally Im lazy and like to have my PC filled with stuff and as I use the aformentioned virtual machines I will probably will go for a Quad Core gb gb storage macbook pro.  inch for me is a no brainer.

Ive been watching the refurb store and its down to four  MBPs. That being said I havent looked that closely at the  non touch. Its a newer processor i think faster hard drive ram and probably some other tweaks. The price is pretty close if you get the same size ssd. Remember the  has limited ports so...

10361167,0,t1_dcihh9i,Actually the MacBook Air  with the . Ghz i is slightly faster then the i in the  MacBook Pro not to mention it has much much better integrated graphics so gaming will be a lot better.  You can check benchmarks if you dont believe me.    The MacBook Air also has insanely better battery life. I am talking  hours and if you ever need to replace the battery the MacBook Air is user replaceable. It isnt glued in like retina MacBooks. Just a couple of screws you have to remove.Lastly from the sound of your usage  GB is not needed.  I personally an a IT professional who frequently uses virtual machines and some pretty heavy apps and only use  GB of Ram in my new  MacBook Pro.  I understand future proofing but nothing in the next  years is going to change to drastically that  GB isnt going to be enough for the average person. You can do whatever you like but I would strongly recommend not going with the non retina MacBook.   years in computers is a long time and assuming you graduate college in  years it will be  years old.   Id recommend at least this or looking for a used MacBook  if you cant stretch your budget anymore but please do not spend  on a  year old laptop.  Your better off looking used.

10931240,0,t3_5w5rks,Hey guys! My girlfriend and I both purchased a MacBook Pro  no touch bar about a week ago. Hers on the right have a whitish screen from most angles while mine on the left have a reddish screen when viewed from most angles. None of us has made any screen calibrations and the comparison is of course made based on the same brightness settings on the photo maxed and the same white wallpaper which is a default option. Just to make sure I checked that they are set to the same screen calibration and they are e.g. use default white balance .. And like I said we have changed nothing so everything should be default settings. Its a coincidence that I noticed it really. Interestingly when not viewed from an angle but with the screens right in front of you her screen looks a little reddish while my screen looks whitishgreyish. Since these are both purchased in new condition and are not refurbished models or something like that I wouldve expected them to be completely similar. Is this something to worry about? Should we bring them back to the store and show them the difference and ask for them to take a look at it? Should we try calibrating them ourselves somehow beforehand? Actually Id prefer not to make any changes myself so as not to give the store any excuses for them being different if theyre not supposed to be. I have compared them from various angles and the difference is there always.,macbook,de7hazk,2,t5_2qkjr
