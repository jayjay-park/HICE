6952715,0,t3_4axbvf,I could see some uses for a smart connector on an iPhone if it opens up some of the possibilities LG just made with their new phone. Guess you could use a battery case while leaving the bottom open for lightning headphones attach game controllers or camera gadgets.             As for simplifying the iPad line a Mini and Air line for average consumers and two sizes of Pro would seem simple enough. But of course they would still want the older models to cover the price points which would kinda ruin the simplicity.              If they are introducing new MacBooks I could see a new Thunderbolt Display being the One more thing. Razor made an external GPU for their new laptop I could see Apple stuffing such a solution in the Thunderbolt Display and killing the option of MacBook with a dedicated GPU hope not though. However I think I read the TB standard didnt really support the k resolution Apple probably would be gunning for so Apple would have to make a proprietary solution on top of TB. ,TheCultCast,d14f7tl,3,t5_3d1kr

Apple puts a lot of detail into their bands and the metal is meshed together much better on theirs so it is much less likely to pull hair on your arm all jokes aside.,TheCultCast,d15w6i4,1,t5_3d1kr
