6206769,0,t3_40kbun,I know you are aware of the CDMA GSM difference but NOT ALL IPHONES support both.Ex iPhone . A iPhone  does not support Sprint and other carriers. Supports Verizon att and tmobile. If you put a Sprint sim in this phone you get service and the xg band of data. No g and no Lte.A iPhone  is the SprintBoostVirgin and the SIM FREE version when unlocked. In fact the a version is the one apple sells as Sim free. This one supports all bands. Now take the iPhone s. Tables have turned. The Att version is the sim free version and all others are missing band  for Lte.So watch yourself. The boost version is the Sprint version and may not work on tmobile.,BoostMobile,cyv561s,0,t5_2uor8
6896049,0,t3_48y8l5,From what i know its should be able to activate as Boost is basically Sprint. Generally the phone can have a  balance owed on the former account   ETF or Financed balance  which is why they need the meid number to the device your trying to activate.  Even if the device doesnt have any balance due remaining its still up to them if they would allow to activate on Boost Mobile or not.,BoostMobile,d0xzhtq,1,t5_2uor8
6896104,0,t3_48nm71,Technically Boost isnt totally accountable for the kiosk workers and what they said. A rep for Boost should have took down the info to report that kiosk as a similar thing happen to me. Most stores ive dealt with are honest. I only had  stores run some bs promo deals that they wasnt gonna honor and also sold devices well over what Boost has it set on website. If a rep didnt help always call back and speak to a rep who will help you report the store or kiosk.,BoostMobile,d0xzpwp,1,t5_2uor8
6939353,0,t3_4a6vdg,Honestly you can grab a Sprint phone and get it reSkued over the phone. The Sprint S is . Or do what my sister did and grab a Sprint S for  on Swappa. The G is a nice phone but it is kind of ... slow? Yea. Slow on some tasks. ,BoostMobile,d12wl6p,1,t5_2uor8
10282156,0,t3_5n6x9q,Its easy to find out. First put on your MEID number the IMEI minus the last digit into Boosts activation site to find out if you have to re SKU it Boost has quietly redone their re sku system recently. If it recognizes the MEID youre good to go you just need to get the correct sim. If the MEID isnt recognized try calling in and and tell them you want to re SKU a phone using the DNA tool then activate it. If none of those work then the phone cant be activated on Boost.,BoostMobile,dc9jen3,2,t5_2uor8

11310808,0,t1_dfcgikw,You dont even need to re SKU iPhones anymore since Novemberish. When you put the MEIDIMEI of a  series iPhone into Boosts website or bring it to a store it adds it to the database immediately.,BoostMobile,dfe29mq,1,t5_2uor8
