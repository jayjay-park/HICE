34100,0,t1_ceib4ud,Thanks!  For nightlife I meant to ask whether people are generally out and about at night dont care so much about clubs.  At many universities in the US  there are lots of student parties going on at night but not much to do for people who have graduated.The k number was pretax.  I have no idea how taxes work in the UK what might I expect the net value to be?EDIT  This site indicates that k gross turns into k after taxes.  Does this sound about right?,cambridge,ceibav2,2,t5_2qh8u

3335730,0,t1_cp8geco,We are pretty close to the A so it takes about  minutes to get to the bases from here. Not too bad and traffic typically isnt that much of a problem except on Friday evenings. I just looked up the OHA for an E and it looks like youll get  pounds a month. With that you can get a  bedroom flat or a studio but probably not a lot more space than that. Without a dependent you should be alright. You can check out this site to browse what you might be looking at ,cambridge,cp8hz1w,1,t5_2qh8u
3491247,0,t3_308ls9,The simplest way to lose weight is to go swimming for a hour every day. Michael Phelps was eating  calories during his olympic run and the dude was trim as can be. The colder the pool the more weight you lose.I had a buddy who must have been  stone went swimming every morning for six months dude turned up and I didnt recognise him. I said Youre half the man you used to be!.So yes swim a ton. If you can avoid foods with grain in bread pasta cereal. Itll fall off.,cambridge,cpq86sg,2,t5_2qh8u
3965984,0,t3_35vzt0,Erm. All I can think of is Moss Bros. Although thinking about it Im not sure if its rental only. Im fairly sure you can buy though. It used to be located just outside the Grande Arcade Market side just down the road from EAT and the Disney Store. Its been a long time since Ive been down that way and I know the store was having financial issues I had to hire a Tuxedo from there for a charity event and the lady I spoke too was uncertain of the stores future. That was over  years ago though. ,cambridge,cr8cttc,1,t5_2qh8u

4041706,0,t3_36roxi,Brett Ward have a pretty good accommodation board for short term private lets. RightMove sometimes have some too but any short term private lettings tend to get mixed up with the letting agencies who typically have a  month minimum lease. You can also try speaking to the HR department for the hospital if they do short term lets often they may also have some suggestions.As mentioned Cherry Hinton is a pretty good place to live close to your place of work close to the supermarket bus routes into the city and within cycling distance of all of the above if you dont drivehate the bus.Fulbourn itself is also pretty close unsurprisingly and is probably a better choice if you prefer somewhere a little outside the city. Theres still a bus route available and its only an extra mile or two out of town from Cherry Hinton. Not as many places for rental as far as Im aware but a few do spring up on occasion.A little further afield from the hospital is the area between Queen Ediths Way and Cherry Hinton Road towards the Cherry Hinton end  there are also bus routes available on both of these roads and they are also within easy cycling distance.Do yourself a favour and buy a cheap second hand bike and a Dlock if you plan to live in these areas I work around the same area and the cycle is pretty easy and if you were thinking about driving traffic can be horrendous during rush hour. If you do choose to get a bike a Dlock should be the minimum you go for as the high cycle usage in Cambridge means that bike theft is pretty high compared to other cities. Cheap locks are about as secure as tying your bike to a post with a piece of string.,cambridge,crgzhf9,2,t5_2qh8u

You could buy one off Gumtree but you might find that frustrating if youre in a hurry... I did! Another option is to buy one second hand from a shop and negotiate to sell it back to them when you leave. And dont worry about people trying to put you off cycling. If you choose quiet roads and dedicated cycle paths youll be fine!,cambridge,dbn31iu,4,t5_2qh8u
