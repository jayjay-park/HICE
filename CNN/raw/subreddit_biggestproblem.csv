6007030,0,t1_cy71369,gtAgain I never said it was. I implied that we dont really know what direction theyll take with this movie thats why I said they could approach it as a remake or do something different.Fair enough my understanding of your comment was that you were assuming it would be a remake of the original but with women. A lot of people have been quick to dismiss it citing this very argument which never made any sense to me. I just dont think there necessarily has to be a correlation between something being a cash grab and a movie sucking at least not all the time. gtYou can tell the prequels were made solely so Lucasfilm would have new material to merchandise.Are you sure about that? Obviously there was big money involved again like with every Hollywood movie but I wouldnt necessarily say that it was a lack of effort that was the prequels undoing. George Lucas had his hands all over the trilogy and he wanted to make them. In fact he even wanted to make another  and was allegedly starting prep work on a new trilogy when Disney approached him. Its just that his flaws as a writer and filmmaker were exposed. He lost everything that made the original trilogy great he made it a set of films about his own grievances as a rich guy who was mad about paying taxes instead of sticking with the themes of the first trilogy and he forced in themes of family when it didnt really fit what made Darth Vader so cool in the first place. Yes the CGI was a mess too keep in mind this was when CGI in general looked pretty bad since they were just starting to do it on a mass scale as were both Annakin performances and plenty of other things about all three movies but I dont think it had as much to do it just being a cash grab as you say. I think it had a lot more to do with George Lucas being misguided and completely out of his element as a filmmaker.Compare it to Episode  which is purely a cash grab. A public corporation bought the rights from George Lucas and instantly put Star Wars films into mass production. JJ Abrams is a hired gun he just happens to actually care about Star Wars and happens to be pretty good at rebooting franchises. Yes Disney made a conscious decision picking him someone who cares over someone who would just do what they asked same with picking Rian Johnson for episode  Gareth Edwards for Rogue One Lord amp Miller for the Han Solo movie etc. But inherently when you think about it thats part of the cash grab.Never mind that I dont see how picking Paul Feig to make a movie about girl Ghostbusters is the best scenario for it to be a cash grab... its historically a maledriven property and its already facing heavy backlash from the internet.,biggestproblem,cy71wih,1,t5_35pdv

9035320,0,t3_52xs3d,Im catching up here.... Apparently theres some people who still dont believe Obama is American. There was clips on The Daily Show of real dumbasses but the new team is so inept it somehow wasnt funny to watch people talk about how they dont want facts or proof.. Marriage is a problem. It shouldnt be recognized by the government at all. I was hoping that during the gay rights thing we could get together and decide that the issue is that straight people have unnecessary privileged instead of gays being denied rights. Boning definitely isnt rational because otherwise everyone would want to fuck women.. Dunno about this one. People have been proven to be too stupid to have forethought thats why we have social security. Meh.,biggestproblem,d7xwhyx,1,t5_35pdv

9099549,1,t1_d85kwns,I didnt meant it that way. What I meant was that Dick is taking advantage of Maddoxs attitudes to bring gossip to his podcast which in turn would attract listeners.

9181001,0,t1_d8foe8d,Lol I dont get how you guys compartmentalize when you know the only people who know these guys that refuse to work with one or the other are themselves. This whole thing was just some big gay personal fight and no one outside of them that knows them seems to care. I think many dumb turns have happened along the way since then but thats bound to happen when a gay couple breaks up and starts seeing other podcasts.I had this same shit happen to me in my first year of podcasting. My cohost left the show in a very abrupt way. All our friends thought what happened between us was dumb as shit and didnt pick sides either.,biggestproblem,d8frcez,1,t5_35pdv

The network gets  weekly listeners sponsorship opportunities and has native content subscription services. Nothing is precluding you from throwing a few hashtags around on twitter though if thats all you think it takes to make a successful podcast. Nobody is forcing you to be a part of the winning team.,biggestproblem,daznw47,8,t5_35pdv
