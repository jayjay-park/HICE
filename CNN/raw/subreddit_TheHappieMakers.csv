9670885,0,t3_5df34p,UE can be quite a complicated beast.  It has a ridiculous amount of functionality and is in no way meant to be easy to learn use or comprehend.  That said many things are not very difficult to do in UE provided you can actually figure out how to do them.  There arent many tutorials and the documentation doesnt really cover a lot of things.  It really is intended for AAA game devs and it just assumes you know some things.I usually recommend Unity to people looking for an engine its very easy to work with but completely opaque when it comes to how it works.  Seriously Ive been using Unity for years and I still dont know exactly how it does some things.  Its closed source and they dont tell you how it works so you generally just have to guess.  This is not what you want if you want to be poking at internals.I dont know much about it but check out Godot.  Its a much smaller and simpler engine than UE or Unity its open source its getting madly popular over the past year or so and I think it might be a good fit for you.,TheHappieMakers,da550zh,3,t5_39kcy
