153308,0,t3_1vucps,Im not sure but I think it has something to do with the heating rate of the coil how even that is across the whole coil and whether or not theres juice on top of the coil itself. If the coil quickly heats up in a spot and vaporizes the juice making immediate contact with it I think you have the potential for a pop. that vaporized juice wants to move upwards and away from the coil and if pressure builds up under a spot of unvaporized juice it may prevent that juice from reaching the coil to get vaporized until the pressure is great enough to send a shot flying off. For what its worth i see this phenomena every time i run my IgoW with the cap off. this would seem to agree with my theory since juice further away from the coil would stay cooler due to the increased cold reservoir provided by open air contact. ,RBA,cevw61e,2,t5_2v8ns
159008,0,t1_cewj56i,thats a great thought as well and definitely something that should be included. I was trying to say that the post holes should accommodate the natural flow of the wire.

425764,0,t1_cfoism2,Depends. Sometimes when subohming particularly with heavier gage wire it takes a bit of time for the coils to be amply heated up. I would wager that people blow into the atty to get a quick estimate to check if the coils are primed. Also any residual juice from a cool coil will pop and spatter so inhaling heated droplets can cause tiny burns as it goes down your throat. So the idea would be to have the coil to be in sizzling mode and the wick to be flowing instead pooled on the coils when the coils are cool.,RBA,cfow90e,1,t5_2v8ns

Well I held the whole thing upside down for a good  minutes and the juice barely got to the coil.  Even after priming I could only get  hits before it went dry.

865124,0,t1_ch2m02z,This build has the wraps going around two pieces of mm silica so the wraps are good sized and Im making normal spaced coils not contact coils.  With  ga start at  or  wraps and give it a go. You wont have room to put much more than that. That is why I go to ga if I want more resistance  there just isnt much room to put more wraps of ga. There are so many variables that no general recommendation is going to be perfect. You will need to use trial and error to determine what works with the build materials you have they way you build it the juice you use the way you vape etc.All I can say is the build in that video with mm silica rope and  ga Kanthal made . Ohms for me last time and it feeds well with my  liquid tastes great and has decent vapor production for a tank. If I was going on a road trip it is what I would take. At .

My rule of thumb for wicking is if it starts to taste burnt and the wicks dont look dry there is still some liquid left in the cotton you have too much. For dripping I do mg VG which is really nice. A lot of times when you see people blowing clouds another big reason besides the crazy coils is that its most always VG juice. ,RBA,civvq57,2,t5_2v8ns

I still can fit dual  gauge with room to spare especially side to side but theyre not quite as massive as some others although as wide as anything around. You might have to tone down your clapton builds but you can go with for example triple parallel dual coils all day with ease. As far as macros and stove tops itll fit whatever you throw at it. With all this said I havent used the latest CLT just the first version. The latest one looks really promising though.Edit Actually I dont think the Zenith would be a good atty for claptons I just dont imagine the slots are tall enough I havent tried though because Im more of a parallel guy. ,RBA,cm7b6z6,2,t5_2v8ns

5276417,0,t3_3n8z8r,Youd be better off with a kanthal build done right not twistedspaced than a half done nickel build twisted and unevenly spaced.,RBA,cvm4euf,1,t5_2v8ns
5278008,0,t1_cvmbd2z,Yeah i ways check and if they dont i fix them till they do,RBA,cvmbr7l,1,t5_2v8ns
5382767,0,t1_cvyr3ai,So try making smaller diameter coils. Go for .mm diameter instead of .  Also try using less cotton in the coil.  If your coils are glowing evenly then its definitely your wick.  From what I understand with Nichrome Ive never used it is that has a much lower resistance than Kanthal It heats up faster.  It seems to me that You need to be able to get enough juice to the coils fast enough that they dont burn the cotton.  Once you juice your coil and wick fire it and check for hot spots.  If you get hotspots then its your wick. You can also look on youtube for Nichrome coil wicking methods.,RBA,cvzpjjk,1,t5_2v8ns
5407337,0,t3_3p2wqq,I freaking love this RTA. When I first got it I used the single coil deck for TC on my mod. Unfortunately that device had to get sent back for a warranty issue  but that made me use the dual coil deck. Its insanely good once you figure out how to wick it! In my experience if I DONT put wick down the juice channels the flow will be too much and will come flying out those channels and into my mouth lol. That was one of my worries because my other tank Lemo  had terrible juice flow for a sub ohm build. So all this being said I love this damn tank! Glad to see its getting love elsewhere ,RBA,cw2uiwp,1,t5_2v8ns

5457876,0,t3_3plkf0,If you scroll down youll see a dozen other similar questions if you want more recommendations. Many of us get tired of typing same thing over and over My favorite overall is the crown tank it does have a RTA head. Im not so much a super high watt vaper but Itll chain vape at w my max no problem and has great flavor.The Billow V seems to work great also dual coil RTA rebuild only no purchaseable coil headsBoth are under .Enjoy!!,RBA,cw9an7x,1,t5_2v8ns
5496616,0,t1_cwc2f7a,Got dual chimney fused claptons ga kanthalga n in there now with scottish roll wicks and its pretty fucking great but at super high wattages  it can take some time to wick since only one side is drawing liquid.,RBA,cwe8tq0,1,t5_2v8ns
5503111,0,t1_cwehi63,You have been up voted for this I agree there would be less room. But to make this a mm Atty it would mean removing .mm from the radius of build deck  I dont think ANYONE would notice this difference that is just my gut feeling!,RBA,cwf2o4v,1,t5_2v8ns
5537013,0,t3_3qy7j7,I like doing a triple parallel with g. Comes out around .. on a mm screwdriver. Thats the easiest thing to do with g. Three strands of wire and do like  or  wraps. I thinks easier than a regular parallel cuz theres more wire to hold onto. Once done crank that bitch up to watts and blow cloudsOr you can take that g and get some g wire and start learning to make fused Clapton coils like I did. After about  or  tries youll get the hang of it and now I sell mine. ,RBA,cwjehoq,2,t5_2v8ns

6041594,0,t1_cybjku7,You need grub screws not Phillips head. Phillips back out and cut wire all the time. I never buy an RDA if it doesnt come with grub screws anymore. I use the CLT V. Check it out. ,RBA,cybka1o,-2,t5_2v8ns
6236691,0,t3_40wu6b,Im having decent luck with horizontal builds in mind using  and up or  claptons in mind by putting a little more wick through than you would think you need.  Then trim the tails like you would for rayon.  Thin tails that barely lay on the deck seem to help the most for me.,RBA,cyyjlkd,1,t5_2v8ns
6297294,0,t3_41u8gf,I know to test any builds i do but the dual battery set up is all new to me.

10495144,0,t3_5q7kmn,I dont know anything about the CSMNT but ever since I have gotten my goon I have been extremely satisfied with my purchase! It has been my everyday RDA since I got it it is a little harder to build than a velocity style which I came from to the dual gold plates that the goon offers. The drip well is very large and I find myself dripping loads of juice without any leaking. ,RBA,dcxqgri,5,t5_2v8ns
10520103,0,t1_dd0jwb3,The . ohm just hits it for so many people.  BIG thing both my SO and I rock ns gen Sigeli W regulated mods.  Do your math if youre running those batteries straight.  . is low for mechs not running series? god its been a long time since my EE courses cant remember which is current additive or mAh additive but a . build i near the max for A batteries.  . is the lowest you should EVER attempt regulated or not.The  clieto coil specs are... vague.  Nothing on gauge.  But if you can shove W through them being . Id guess g.  Just be safe know your batteries know to give electronic a min  head room.
