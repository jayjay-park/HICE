2289837,0,t3_2lh21l,My six year old is a giant Minecraft and Skylanders game. We bought the first Disney Infinity and are currently trying to sell it lol. We both hated it. It tries to do the platform adventure gaming of Skylanders but fails with boring landscapes and villains and an idiotic rule against having characters from other movies play in certain play sets. It tries to have the world building of Minecraft but fails because everything is prebuilt and doesnt have much to do other than placing it down and then sort of like looking at it. I dont get the love the game got at all and my son didnt enjoy it either.,DadsThatGame,cluqnla,0,t5_344y8
