416095,0,t1_cflfps1,I dont see the problem with collision resistance for your application of course it has its uses. Many times its good that the hash is non bijective because for a small price you get a its hard to find a collision b the hash is small c an attacker with unlimited computing cannot recover your message. Also if e.g. youre encrypting a weak text low entropy the attacker will be able to brute force it anyway just by brute force encrypting with your random private key.,cryptography,cfnw73j,1,t5_2qiib

1128531,0,t3_26ir8t,For triplefucks sake stop using Von Neumann whitening on bits with serial correlations!The algorithm and all its elaborations work only if all bits are completely uncorrelated.  They may have bias but they must all be independent and identically distributed.  That is a fundamental assumption clearly stated in the original formulation but which everyone seems to forget when seeing opportunities to apply it.And assuming zero correlation when reality is nonzero can get you in a lot of troubleAlmost no realworld generator satisfies that property meaning that all this algorithmic complexity is snake oil of the most putrescent kind.In security its all about the weakest link.  A superpowerful technique for solving a problem that I dont have is worth nothing at all.To start with it I had such a bit source I could measure the bias because it doesnt change ever! and feed the bit stream into an arithmetic coder.,cryptography,chwkhwu,2,t5_2qiib

2874556,0,t3_2szqns,You cannot directly map to ASCII. The bit ASCII code features  chars. SHA returns a series of bytes which also range from .You will end up using special chars like tab or backspace when directly mapping.The recommended way to display a hash is using its string representation of hexadecimal bytes each byte occupies  chars. Storing this would double your space requirements.You can use base to map to ASCII but base encodes groups of bytes. changing  byte in the hash changes multiple in base.Storingprocessing and transmitting should still be in byteform.If you do not mind the size or if you simply want to troll people you can map the bytes to a language that has  printable chars like Arabian or Chinese. Choosing similar looking chars also prevents bystanders from easily read your hash. Not really useful but interesting to experiment.EDIT It also prevents the western world from typing your hash.,cryptography,cnuu5oo,3,t5_2qiib

9815368,0,t3_5fsz6r,Im not a cryptographer by any means either  but Ill try and and provide some info. Most ciphers are based off of somewhat similar ideas or architectures. For instance lots of block ciphers are based on the Feistel architecture e.x. DESDES Blowfish etc.. Other algorithms ciphers like AES are based on substitutionpermutation networks in a more general sense.Claude Shannon who is known as the founder of Information Theory identified  properties in a paper he wrote  the properties are confusion and diffusion. Confusion refers to making the relationship between the key and the ciphertext as complex as possible. Diffusion refers to dissipating the statistical structure of the plaintext over the ciphertext. Secure ciphers will have these properties.I think the process of coming up with a new secure cipher takes a lot of mathematical knowledge knowledge of other ciphers and finally a lot of imagination and creativity,cryptography,damykxi,5,t5_2qiib

11352316,0,t1_dfhwwk5,Id just use whatever ASN decoder already came with your platform For instance Go has encodingasn and try to parse the file at each possible offset. Since an asn sequence always start with the same byte you can save yourself a lot of time.Start by writing a small script that just prints out each correctlyformatted key in the file and check which ones the right one later. Good luck!,cryptography,dfiriiv,3,t5_2qiib
11481432,0,t3_63vkth,Because the encryption method uses math operations that are difficult to reverse. Specifically the modulus remainder gets used a lot. Well represent modulus as  so  and . Now if I tell you x you cant just do the math backwards to figure out what x is because there are multiple correct answers. This video explains it pretty well ,cryptography,dfxf1u4,5,t5_2qiib
11537266,0,t1_dfp4p09,Yes ShaweTaylor and Maurer both wrote papers showing how one can use simple primality proof methods e.g. Pocklington BLS theorem  or BLS theorem  to build up proven primes.The normal way those proof methods work is to given an input n partially factor n andor n prove primality of the smaller values and run some simple test to show that n must be prime if the factors are prime.  Its a recursive process where you keep drilling down proving smaller numbers until you reach some trivial threshold.With some thought one realizes the whole process can be reversed.  That is we select some small random prime k which we can trivially prove.  E.g.  bits.  Then look at ctk for random t values within a range that has to do with which proof were using how many bits were generating and how usual we want the results which is the big difference between ST and Maurer algs until we find one that looks likely.  We immediately know that k is a big proven prime factor of c so we just perform the easy steps of PocklingtonBLSetc.  If they pass then c has been proven prime.  Repeat cranking up the bit size.  Its much cheaper than taking an arbitrary input and trying to prove primality.,cryptography,dg3r255,1,t5_2qiib
