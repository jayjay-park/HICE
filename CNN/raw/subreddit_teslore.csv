14648,0,t3_1uahh7,Nice though a few things. I suggest you replace the mention of Kynareth with Tava as it fits better and theyre similar anyway  you use Tava later also so it makes sense.. Im not sure where youre getting the term Raga from unless you have a good source on that and its not a misunderstanding you might want to change that to the traditional term Ra Gada. The use of the apostrophe in Raga seems an awful lot like TaagraKhajiiti and so it doesnt seem to really fit in my eyes.. On the godofnomoresailingtoday got a source? While revering lesser spirits isnt unusual for the Redguards take Diagna though he is sometimes considered a fullon god if there isnt evidence that the Warrior Wave ever thanked such a spirit I dont really think it belongs here.

125088,0,t1_cesiq5o,Yes but the war of the Red Diamond and the Stormcrown Interregnum are fairly isolated periods of disruption in  years of Septim dynasty rule.Contrast this to historical Rome.  Between Augustus and Severus Alexander  BC to  AD the average reign was  years.  Of the  legitimate emperors  were assassinated.  Those were the good years.Between  AD and  AD there were  legitimate emperors and  usurpers.  There were  emperors of a breakaway state in Gaul and  rulers of a breakaway state in Syria.  There was an average reign per legitimate emperor in this period of  years and  months.  All but  of the legitimate emperors and all of the challengers died violently.From  until the end in  it settles down a bit but not entirely.  Over half of the emperors manage not to die violently and the length of the reign increases.  However Rome has more numerous enemies the Germanic and Central Asian people and powerful enemies the Persians.  They also never really recovered from the crisis of the third century.   Oh and Rome was sacked twice.So the  years of rule by the Septims was extremely stable in comparison to the source material it is based on.,teslore,cesocgq,3,t5_2t5ay

More than he even dislikes ALMSIVI who he knows is responsible for his first death. All he says about the Tribunal is freeing the cursed falsegods but he outright states he doesnt like the Empire several times IMO because its Talos empire. The Aurbis is an extension of Ur in his head and there is no one who has had such control and power over Dagoth Urs own self than Talos how dare he act so disrespectfully to the Sharmat just because he wills it? Hence Dagoth Urs intention on defeating Septims Empire not just because they clash in their little conquests but because Talos is the biggest upstart sonofabitch in the world to Ur worse than any hooker ladyboy turned Royalty.Good stuff though my only problem being Vivecs stating Dagoth Urs all about treachery and deceit. I trust Vivec over a lot of things but this is clearly biased. If theres any reason for Ur to expect deceit itd probably be from that being the cause of him dieing the first time and likely why he says Come to me openly and not by stealth to even the playing field AND Nerevars death one of those times.,teslore,cf2yu4g,6,t5_2t5ay

Destruction is always percieved as a negative force but just like a pheonix greater things can rise from the ash.My point is that every form of morale is individual.

You can insist that everyone use the scholarly approach.  I know the notion that it would turn into a shouting match is frustrating except that shouting matches are how things get done.If anything one can stay in that niche of conventional scholarship and build a viable subcommunity out of it.  The problem is as Ive learned the literature suggests that that is not necessarily accurate to the way the universe is constructed its more of a perspective within the universe.  A perspective that changes reality but nevertheless is subordinate to metareality.If anything once we sort out all this NuAmaranth stuff there ought to be a return to more conventional lore.  The whole point of Akavir is that its not a place to spend much time in.  Tamriel is a great place to spend time in.  In fact its where I think were supposed to be.

Its not certain if they predated Dwemer but both races existed alongside one another for a very long time. By the time the Atmoran people began trickling into Tamriel the Falmer society was already advanced and powerful. Unlike the Dwemer the Falmer followed a traditional Aldmeri way of life. Auriel was the chief deity of their culture. Magic astrology and genealogy were big aspects just as with the Altmer. It actually took centuries between the Night of Tears and the final push that destroyed the last Falmer settlements in Skyrim. The Nords attention was diverted by the Dragon War during the middle of the conflict with the Falmer. Most of the Snow Elves who didnt fall under Nordic swords formed alliances with other Mer. The lucky ones found their way west or south. The rest became Dwemer slaves.Rieklings Rieklings are snow goblins. Their exact origin is anyones guess. They could be devolved remnants of the Kamal fleet. They could be devolved Rieklings. They could simply be aboriginal goblinken native to the island. They could be none of the above or a genetic blend of all.TrollsGiants Yes of course they are. Pretty much anything alive on Nirn except the Hist have at least some blood relation to the Ehlnofey. Even the Argonians are descended from tree lizards descended from them  but mutated by the alien magic of the Hist.Imperial Cult Skyrim has been a part of the Empire for a very very long time and I suspect after Martins transformation into Akatosh the Imperial Cult grew immensely in power in all the human nations.

One shall rise among them and shall spill the blood of a Daughter of Coldharbour upon the Bow of Auriel. With it the Dragons eye shall be blinded and the Tyranny of the Sun shall be broken.Serana plays the central role in the prophecy while the Dragonborn plays a supporting role. Granted the Dragonborn is a secondary protagonist if we look at this as literature but his decisions dont really effect the outcome of the story all that much. The Dragonborn makes a grand total of one significant choice and it doesnt really do all that much. He chooses Dawnguard or Volkihar and that does a grand total of nothing in the grand scheme of things. The Bow is still found Harkon is still killed the Snow Elves get a bit of hope for the future and Serana comes out alive.Serana on the other hand makes a ton of choices. Theyre the same in every playthrough from our perspective since Seranas character and history never changes but they are choices made with the full liberty to choose their fates that Heroes enjoy.

In the th era there are some serious issues with Time and Space so they send Pelinal back in time to somehow stabilize the Mundus by assisting in the emancipation of MAn.Something goes wrong when he is crossing through time probably when he is passing through the th Era and he does help emancipate humanity and prevent their premature destruction but he also goes rogue and commits genocide which was not his original mandate.Tragedy and sadness ensue.,teslore,chcz29g,1,t5_2t5ay
963191,0,t3_2553bc,In simple terms the Thalmor want to return the state of Mundus back into the formless state of Aurbis by erasing humanity and mortality which would theoretically return the elves to a state of ascended cosmic immortality with the gods by restarting the kalpic cycle.A Kalpa can best be thought of as a cycle of time sort of like an alternate universe. When Alduin devours the world it resets the linear timeline of Aurbis back to the Dawn era where there are minor changes. In a previous Kalpa Nirn was comprised of a vast ocean which was ruled primarily by the Dreugh.The Towers are Mundus anchors of reality that stabilize its existence. Theyre not literal towers of course.As for actually destroying the towers this is achieved by destroying the respective Towers Stone. The Heart of Lorkhan was originally the stone of the Red Tower Red Mountain. Then it got whacked by the Nerevarine in Morrowind. The destruction of a Towers Stone deactivates the Tower and the deactivation of a Tower basically destabilizes the entire concept of Mundus reality.,teslore,chdrvf8,2,t5_2t5ay

1307085,0,t1_cigh1s4,Excellent thoughts though I would hesitate to place a direct causal relationship between the Ge and their overlapping counterparts outside of Aetherius.  Something in me wants to preserve the Ges agency I think theyre something more than mere reflections on the water so to speak.  I mean they are that but theyre willful spirits in their own right too.Its like...  consider an Ada as part of a continuum.  The Space continuum has Lorkhan Shezarr Shor Sheor Sep etc.  It would also have ScarabFramer.  But perhaps ScarabFramer was part of the Space continuum that fled from Mundus along with the rest of the Ge.  Some of Space was directly tied to Nirn as an Aedrothlike being but ScarabFramer wasnt.ScarabFramer would still be Space though and act according to that nature while in Aetherius.  The key difference is that ScarabFramer left while the others that made up Space stayed.  Daubella and Nana Null would seem to be in the same position portions of the DibellaMaraKyne continuum that didnt stick around.But there are some continua that left entirely these would be the Ge that seem utterly disconnected from anything weve seen elsewhere in the Aurbis.So the stories of Aetherius sometimes play out in ways that mirror stories of Mundus but sometimes they dont thatd be because some of the characters overlap in nature and even name but not all of them.  Which is precisely why I take Aetherius as a symbol of Amaranths that are connected with the Aurbis through Memory but I dont think thats all Aetherius is or that it was designed to be that way.  Sometimes symbolism just happens without design a happy accident for the person doing the looking such as mortals on Nirn going through the Endeavor.Edit  Also this directly contradicts my earlier statements about the YSigns being the Serpent because I think the Serpent happened after the Ge left as the Void Ghost sneaked into Aetherius to make Sovngarde and Shezarrines.  Which Im okay with.  I kind of like the idea of Void Ghost meeting up in some sense with ScarabFramer maybe going What the hell dude?  Whyd you leave?,teslore,cignwg4,1,t5_2t5ay

A Breton or Altmer may have more magical aptitude his actual blood lineage than say an Orc or a Redguard but if an Orc practices day in and day out and studies all the old tomes hes going to be a superior mage to an Altmer who doesnt study magic. A lot of fans like to pigeonhole the races into extreme stereotypes and imagine that all Orcs are mindless brutes who can only swing  lbs hammers and all Altmer live in wizard towers mixing potions day in and out. While theres a grain of truth to every stereotype theyre just that  stereotypes. There are Altmer who make a living raising horses or soldiering. There are Orcish arch mages and master enchanters.

I said thisgtThe power of Thuum seems to me to be evidently entirely in the meaning of the words as understood and tapped into by the shouter.You said thisgtNo the words themselves dont matter.I can take this in two ways. I can assume you understood me and though your statement isnt precisely contradictory to the words that I said I can take you as contradicting what I said in spirit. This is the nonpedantic path and the one I elected to take. Otherwise I could go with the less charitable conclusion that you didnt understand what I said and I could clarify tortuously thoroughly in an extremely patronizing way. I did not elect to do this. Should I have?gtAs for your obnoxious FTFY i didnt say what is i said what i believe as supported.Your collection of statements regarding magic was not hedged with any I thinks or I believes or I see it ases. What am I to have concluded? Should I have taken them as implied? Because when people dont take steps to hedge their statements its not usually because humility is meant to be taken as a given. Rather its generally because they think they are objectively correct. I clarified right away because I wanted to make sure that we were on the same page that I was looking for a discussion on what might be true. If you are certain that it works the way you think it does there can be no discussion.gtevidence for your beliefMy belief? On the nature of the magicka bar? I dont really have one. I rather like the idea that I proposed in which its merely another health bar which measures strain on the Aetheric pathways of the magicattuned subject but I dont believe its true.

And when Time started so did Space. Its not separate its SpaceTime. Aka is the Anuic aspect and Lork the Padhomaic. Fast forward to Convention Aka has remained distant and stoic to Nirn but decides the Chaos of Dawn is too Padhomaic and slams Nirn with Adamantia. Here we have Lork the Red Dragon of SpaceTime meeting with the Old Ehlnofey leader Auriel who is just Ehlnofey at this point. Things turn violent and Lork is overpowered. His Wings are ripped off and Auriel dons them upon his back eager to escape the Mundus. Trinimac is ordered to rip the Wingless Dragon apart and the body is flung skywards. Left is the laughing still beating Heart and in anger Auriel shoots it Eastward. Auriel now uses his stolen TimeWings to fly through the Sun and becomes AuriEl. His twin brother now shattered Aka is unbalanced and Shatters into all the Dragons spreading the Anuic aspect  of SpaceTime throughout Mundus. Linear Time is just another Broken Dragon. So AuriEl is Auriel covered in Lork. The Dragons and Time Gods are exploded Aka and Linear Time is the Original Dragonbreak. Dragons are not Eagle and Snake combined Eagle and Snake are Dragons torn apart. Now jump to the Middle Dawn AuriEl is pulled down into a Padhomaic Dragonbreak and AuriEl has Auriel ripped out of him and tossed to the Side. A piece of the Broken Lorks spirit is put inside the shell that was AuriEl and Akatosh is born. He returns to the Heavens and now Time flows both forwards and backwards.

2390616,0,t1_cm62vxd,Id say their more next to eachother. In fact I dare argue that it would go AkagtPeryitegtKyne in terms of sphere relation and concept overlap. Im claiming Peryite to be among Aedra as he has been said to have been one of the original Ehlnofey along with three others who are now gone but to clarify they are not Aedra because of the fact that theyd left. MK has said repeatedly that the etAda themselves are tonescolorsemotions and when he refers to the twelve worldsEhlnofey of creation I cant help but think of a color wheel which is made up of twelve colors.Aka is yellow as his aspect being wreathed in golden flames Lorkhan red for his hearts blood which is given detailed notice in CDA and Magnus blue for its frequent association with magic and the fact that his eye is glowing with it. Essentially theyre the primary triad first to spring out from the union of black and white as stasis change and staticchange between which all other colors form. So that would place Kyne on green and Peryite yellowgreen which might explain his constant dragonic form.This may also be why MK chose to depict Kyne far left as a dragonwoman close to Akas sphere but still more distanced and thus only halfdragon. Also examine the relations of their spheres Kyne is the first Earthbone first to provide an order to the whitenoise of early Nirn close to Akas order but not as irrationally strict unlike Peryite. Hes the brutal order of nature dominating yet blind in selection as disease does not care who it infects so long as it continues in its effect. Remember Kyne is blinded as well by her own tears of grief unable to see her children clearly in her constant depression. Nature is cruel at times because her mind is stricken with crippling sadness shes old and lonely and its hard for her to give to her to interact with her creation let alone have the effort but she does it when they truly need her. Come to think of it Peryite is pretty crippled to as is Aka. Peryite is just Oblivions bitch now banished from or escaping Mundus for whatever reason Ive heard a theory he could be Pigmus and forced to take the last and weakest places in the void filling in the cracks as Ive heard someone say. This is why he is mentioned as a shadow of Aka he was a shade of Aka that was cast into the dark stricken from his former state as an Earthbone and forever weak. Aka himself is just so goddamn loving of order that hes irrationally rational blinded by his own logic and on top of that through the creation of Mundus the impossipoint his head just couldnt take it. It was so unnatural to him and the timelines on it split as his head split so hes just a mess to. Its interesting actually. Its like Lorkhan was born with a maddening hunger and satisfied it with Mundus yet Aka was sane in the Dawn where it made sense to him until Lorkhan broke his mind for his own sake. This ignites Akas own hunger the dragon eating its own tail to survive linear time and like Lorkhan Aka will rebel and his hunger will swallow the world in return to stasis. Aaahh I am rambling. But its just fun to think about. So yea these are all my theories involving Kyne Peryite and Aka. I hope they were interesting for you.,teslore,cm76r6y,2,t5_2t5ay

This is why some accounts have conflicting details of Tiber or why he can be in many places at once.Talos is a name given to Hjalti after he lead a battle with Wulfhart in the form of a cloud over head that means storm crown. however this name is more likely to refer to the god that Tiber Septim became. You see after the activation of Numidium the three mantled Lorkhan Auriel and Magnus. Their souls got a little mixed up and eventually after some timie wimie stuff the souls were combined creating Talos the god a being made up of a BrettoNord dragonborn a Nibinean an Atmorian demigod shezaarine AurielAkatosh Magnus Lorkhan and possible every Emperor and Aylied King.

3006159,0,t1_co9g56d,I think youre on to something.I think being eaten actually implies transformation by some sort of process.  For example its not totally clear the Tsaesci are literally serpents or if the just resemble them I am inclined to think the later although that is less interesting.  Perhaps the same is true for Malacath.Trinimac is an interesting character in that when one reads Shor son of Shor and understands hisMalacaths later relationship to the Nord and the Aedra pantheon overall there is great conflict and betrayal.  IIRC Trinimac starts out as a knight thane or equivalent in AuriEls court but is seen at the end of that same piece as a member of Shors camp having appeared to have spent the night in Dibellas tent.However apparently at some point Trinimac had a falling out with Shors camp since since he is known in the Nord pantheon as Orkey not to be confused with Arkey who is more or less a separate deity an adversarial deity who famously called on Alduin to eat down Nord lifespans to  years.So perhaps Trinimac being eaten was merely his conversion into a Daedra his disavowal of the Aedric rivalry between AuriElAlduin and ShorLorkhan and perhaps the creation of Mundus itself.  Who knows maybe Boethiah was toying with him all along and his crosses and doublecrosses were just him dancing on that Daedric Princes string.This is all kind of boring to me right now but I mainly wanted to write it for the TLDR Malacath is the Ben Linus of the TES Universe. ,teslore,co9l47g,1,t5_2t5ay

3328879,0,t1_cp7ksfx,gt The reason Bosmer are the ones that most prominently mention this in their myths is because their ability to shape their surrounding plantlife has direct ties to the pact they made with Yffre. The other races dont talk about it as much because after Yffre became the earth bones they became ordered and that was that. They had no need to make a pact with him to shape their surroundings.I dont buy that at all Im afraid.  The Bosmeri myths do not say that they made the pact with Yffre in order to gain power over nature.  They specifically say that they couldnt keep a constant shape without Yffres pact and the same goes for the Khajiit and Azura.  They also consistently place themselves and not other races as the beneficiaries of this intervention.  Its not just a matter of other mythologies not mentioning it its also that the Bosmeri and Khajiit mythologies claim it was only them.For example in Words of Clan Mother Ahnissigt But Nirni soon forgave Lorkhaj for Nirni could make children. And she filled herself with children but cried because her favorite children the forest people did not know their shape.gt And Azurah came to her and said Poor Nirni stop your tears. Azurah makes for you a gift of a new people. Nirni stopped weeping and Azurah spoke the First Secret to the Moons and they parted and let Azurah pass. And Azurah took some forest people who were torn between man and beast and she placed them in the best deserts and forests on Nirni. And Azurah in her wisdom made them of many shapes one for every purpose. And Azurah named them Khajiit and told them her Second Secret and taught them the value of secrets. And Azurah bound the new Khajiit to the Lunar Lattice as is proper for Nirnis secret defenders. Then Azurah spoke the Third Secret and the Moons shone down on the marshes and their light became sugar.gt But Yffer heard the First Secret and snuck in behind Azurah. And Yffer could not appreciate secrets and he told Nirni of Azurahs trick. So Nirni made the deserts hot and the sands biting. And Nirni made the forests wet and filled with poisons. And Nirni thanked Yffer and let him change the forest people also. And Yffer did not have Azurahs subtle wisdom so Yffer made the forest people Elves always and never beasts. And Yffer named them Bosmer. And from that moment they were no longer in the same litter as the Khajiit.Here we have Ahnissi specifying forest people who became Bosmer or Khajiit.  Nobody else.Likewise The Ooze speaks only of wood elves of Bosmer as being subject to the Pact and thus able to have a Wild Hunt.  The Bosmer have this ability because they were of the forest people that Ahnissi mentions not because they started out in a Dragon Break.  If it applied to anyone who was in a Dragon Break then it would apply to nonelves too like humans!  And Im fairly sure it doesnt.    Varieties of Faith does claim that they believe the first mortals were shifting but Im much more inclined to trust the actual Bosmer and Khajiit tales than an Imperial scholars interpretations.Additionally all of these events happened after linear time had already begun during the Merethic.  Nothing happens on Tamriel until after Convention so the forest people that became Bosmer and Khajiit werent subject to the nonlinearity of the Dawn.  They had trouble keeping their shapes for entirely different reasons which is made evident when you consider that Yffres Pact and the Lunar Lattice apparently do not protect them or their lands during other Dragon Breaks if Dragon Breaks even do carry with them shape changes for everything Id need to see more convincing texts than Ive yet seen to believe that.  And also consider that theyre descended from Aldmer who hadnt yet suffered their schisms until well into the Merethic.Re  All mer having this ability  Mer is also just a word that means personpeople.  That statement doesnt mean that all elves have the ability notice that he said the Bosmer were going to call it.  I think reading that as saying any elf can take part in a Wild Hunt is a bit of a stretch especially considering that would be the only source to ever mention it if so.  And plus the Wild Hunt is specifically the result of going back on the Pact with Yffre the Pact isnt just about being able to tell stories about nature its very much related to the Wild Hunt specifically.  If the other races didnt make the Pact in the first place how can they go back on it?Re  Stuhn and Tsun and Trinimac  The Aedric aspects are a totally different thing and Nord storytelling isnt the most trustworthy.So yeah all in all I do not find this case very convincing.  From what I see the forest people couldnt keep their forms during the Merethic Era and two gods helped them become two peoples.  The other races had their own things going on.gt Yes but you wouldnt say something like a car also known as the engine or a human being also known as the brain or something like that. It very clearly refers to AdaMantia also being known as the Zero Stone. And yet in the very same document it also says that Stones are different from Towers that every Tower has a Stone and that their forebears saw the erection of Adamantia UrTower and the Zero Stone.  Like I said NuHatta is playing fast and loose with the nomenclature after establishing that Towers and Stones work together to produce their effects and are distinct objects.gt AdaMantia UrTower and Zero Stone could simply be different aspects of the same structure.Its entirely possible that Adamantia is being used as a name for the conjunction of UrTowerDirenni Tower and the Zero Stone that is together they form the mythitectural structure known as Adamantia.  But I still very much doubt that the Zero Stone is one and the same as UrTower.  NuHatta is quite clear that they are different objects and so is Once.  If the Zero Stone were a wall theyd call it a wall if it were the Tower itself every other Tower wouldnt be imitating it very well at all!At this point though I feel like were just going in circles.,teslore,cp7pwnr,1,t5_2t5ay
3350976,0,t3_2yjmou,CHIM has multiple benefits.  One of these which people tend to concentrate on is the ability to change the universe around yourself.  However while thats the most dramatic and flashy aspect of CHIM its not the main advantage.  There are other far easier ways to change the universe even when you have CHIM.The main advantage rather is that you become immortal and not in the doesnt age or cant be killed by normal means senses but in the cant ever be destroyed or erased ever sense.  Having CHIM means you never die or at least never permanently die no matter what.  It is the Eternal I the unbreakable Will.  And this is why its often regarded as the first step toward Amaranth  Amaranth requires that you be able to persist even in the absence of a universe to persist in and thereby become a universe yourself.Learning of CHIM and achieving it are different things.  Vivec learned of it from Molag Bal and either achieved it on the spot or attempted it later.  urottendeadite would be able to tell you more there.  I would personally theorize that Talos learned it from Vivec and achieved it sometime after the enantiomorphic event between Hjalti Wulfharth and Zurin but before finishing the conquest of Tamriel.  This is because the enantiomorphic event would have prepared Talos well for achieving CHIM which itself can be characterized as an enantiomorph and he would have required it in order to persist as a distinct identity from Lorkhan after having taken the steps of the dead conquering Tamriel to take Lorkhans mantle.,teslore,cpa8ihr,29,t5_2t5ay

3443941,0,t1_cpktvmr,Yes.gtAedra and Daedra are not relative terms. They are Elvish and exact. Azura is a Daedra both in Skyrim and Morrowind. Aedra is usually translated as ancestor which is as close as Cyrodilic can come to this Elven concept. Daedra means roughly not our ancestors.So the terms are Elvish ampndash Aldmeris in all likelihood ampndash and almost certainly predated the Sundering of Aldmeris and refer to where the spirits stand in the layout of Creation.gtThis distinction was crucial to the Dunmer whose fundamental split in ideology is represented in their mythical genealogy.And here we see the Dunmer adopting the Daedra as our stronger better ancestors due to ideology. The Dunmer dont hold that the Daedra are ancestors in the Aldmeris sense of the word ampndash having sacrificed theirselves to give to Creation ampndash but as an adopted set of guardians and role models.The Dunmer may have run away from home and moved in with Aunt Alice and Uncle Bob but that doesnt retroactively change actual mpaternity and the Dunmer dont pretend it does. In Dunmeris idiom Daedra means a precursor spirit stronger and better in their estimation than their literal mythic ancestors but it doesnt mean a precursor spirit from whose essence they are wrought.The only case where theres a huge difference between not ancestors and not our ancestors on Tamriel is for the Hist though since everyone else is made of Aedra.,teslore,cpku26k,5,t5_2t5ay

However the Argonians despise the catmen of Elsweyr just as the Khajiit in turn hate the Argonians. The roots of this animosity can be traced to the Khajiit belief that an Argonian shaman was responsible for creating the Knahaten Flu which plagued the species and its infrastructure.

While one can believe that Ocato was most certainly in control history shows this was indeed the case it is plainly untrue that Uriel was dying reduced to a figurehead or not involved in government. Moreover Ocato was extremely loyal to the Imperial line. They dont even get the number of sons right or the number of heirs  heir the Crown Prince  sons  Bastards  Chancellor. And Uriel was in perfect health when we met him.The Elder Council was probably heavily suppressed by Ocato and not very powerful at all during Uriel VIIs reign. After Uriels death Ocato was unanimously given control of the Empire until Martins arrival and after Martins death he was again given rule of the Empire.

3918132,0,t1_cr2uzzb,Nice finds! As for evolving into current TES lore it seems the golems were mostly replaced with atronachs in Daggerfall with the Stone Golems becoming gargoyles and perhaps Homonculi becoming Flesh Atronachs given the nature of homonculi as essentially animated flesh. I suppose it would be possible to build a flesh atronach in the form of the Arena one like how the Gatekeeper was distinct from other flesh atronachs. It does seem a little strange that homonculi are depicted as large as they are when it means little man and refers to an alchemically animated miniature person. Iron Golems are probably Dwemer Animculi now. The art direction of the Arena ghouls still makes me think undead goblin resurrected by necromancer Goblin clans via shamanistic rituals Think Oblivion Goblin Shamans with all their skulls but the flavor text paints them as standard ghouls.I also just thought of another idea for ghouls. Ghouls are rooted in Arabian folklore and are described as desert dwelling so they could perhaps be the Yoku answer to the Draugr maybe with a more Yokudan sounding name. That is supported by ghouls primarily showing up in Hammerfell and being around goblins too supports the other part to it.Edited the original post to include that aspect of ghouls from Arena.,teslore,cr2wimf,5,t5_2t5ay

I meant to imply that it was a contributing factor. My brother Fror has found this to be a noticeable difference however. Since he left to join the Stormcloaks he has sent me letter upon letter griping that he cant keep up with the easterners talent for longblades. Perhaps the magical effects build up over time and this along with their culture are the reason for the doublehanded weaponry?I do have records of the Dragons Tongue throughout Tamriel even so far as the jungles of Tenmar. This I believe is due to its heat resistance as you said. I suspect that each variation is slightly different especially because my correspondent in the Niben valley reported quite different effects than I have found.I was originally in Aalto to study Jazbay but I couldnt find enough samples and collecting them is looked down upon.

4069217,0,t1_crk3slu,gtTalos role in all this is that Talos mantled Lorkhan. This makes Talos like the pin that is keeping the Dragon coiled keeping the rules of Convention in effectThe rules of convention are kept in effect by Lorkhans heart and not by Talos. The realm owner decides which rules his plane obey e.g time works different in daedric realms because the princes want it so. Thats why the numidium is able to break the dragonlogic. It manipulates the realm owner. Talos is a tower build by Lorkhans heart trough the use of the numiduim.In addition to that it is more likely that he is just a part of Lorkhan.In order to understand my statements  you need to read the following article  gtOF COURSE not. This speculated much in this sub. My interpretation is Talos mantled Lorkhan and also brought some Akatosh into itremember how Auriel ripped out from Akatosh similar. He became a tower and protectingmaybe controlling or isolating the timeAkatosh and Nirn. Remember that Thalmor want to kill Talos and make dragon theirs to bind.I would see a Talos as a experiment of Lorkhan. Let me explain Talos was created by the numiduim during the events of Daggerfall. Why is it important to note this ? It is quite obvious that the Numiduims actions contributed to Lorkhans plan to a destroy mer b create an worldwide empire which is heavily influenceddominated by Lorkhan  through his aspectsaKagrenac tried to activate Numiduim by using his tools on the heart of Lorkhan. It is generally believed that he made a mistake or that it was his ambition to use the Numidium in way in which the dwemer would have their own sphere of existence on the Brass Gods skin . I say he underestimated the heart of Lorkhan. The heart of Lorkhan is more than just a soul gem. It has a character and therefore it is capable of influencing his environment troughby magic or willpower  compare the monomthy  The heart of the world . Good examples of this are Almalexia and Dagoth Ur who became mad trough their connection with the heart. So in the moment the Numidium was activated the heart took over the control and destroyed the dwemer race on Nirn. Why is the on Nirn so important?. The Numiduim uses the powerenergy of the heart which is restricted on mundus realm. Now you might ask your self The Numidium breaks logic so why was the destruction of the dwemer limited on Nirn?. I have an explanation  The numidium actually doesnt break logic. The numiduim is bound to the rules of the Godhead. This can be seen by the fact that it still need a soulidea of the Godhead to function. The time breaking aspect of the numiduim can be explained by the fact that the Numiduim manipulates the realm owner  which is of course Lorkhans heart. The realm owner decide how time works on his plane. He also has an huge impact on the rules his plane obey. The numiduim is also responsible for the destruction of the dunmer society in morrowind. The Creation of the numiduim lead to war of the first council in which the tribunals action brokeor had an huge negative influence  up the chimer relationship to azura. The build of Alukhan  the second Brass God forced the return of neverar who freed the heart and killed Dagoth Ur as well as Almalexia. Almalexia was manipulated by the heart in way which made her kill Sotha sil. Vivec  the last remaing God in morrowind  was probably captured by Daedric forces during the red year. Neverar left morrowind . So in the end nobody was there to protect the dunmer from the harm that the red year which might was influenced by Sheogorath who has a strong connection to Lorkhans heart caused.b The numiduims power is based on manipulation of relam owner Lorkhans heart. So how is it possible that Numiduim can warp space time with a soul of a ShezzarineLorkhans heart? Shezzarines as well as the heart of Lorkhan are parts of Lorkhans soul. I think that there is connection between them. The Numiduim might uses the Shezzarines as a bridge to Lorkhans heart. The heart then takes the control over the Brass God.It is also important to note that the Numiduim never killed a shezzar.Why is Talos an experiment ? In my previous thread   i came to the Conclusion that Lorkhans goal behind the creation of mundus was it create a stable body for himself. The several aspects of Lorkhan  moons  shezarrines  are born from his instability. Talos is a god which is combination of three shezarrines. Lorkhan wanted to know if he can recreate himself. His heart represents mundus. Moreover he needs a powerful force in order to defeat the aedra who recant the process of implantation. This force is Talos  the  empire and the Numiduim  the only problem is that the numiduim is captured by elvesEdit  The numiduim is Lorkhans way to use his from him separated divine spark. ,teslore,crk4adg,1,t5_2t5ay

It is unstable because you can separate it from his energy source. The dwemer are the Brass Gods skin. They are meant to be the earth bones. Lorkhans attempt to change him into a stable being.  i would recommend this for better understanding  Dagoth Ur is jyggalag. The numidium is based on order due to his structuremathematicstonal architecture. That why he supports it.Dagoth Ur  heart equals Sheogorath. The aura of the heart made him mad. Dagoth Ur was instructed by Neverar to protect the hearts chamber. In this regard neverar represents the daedric princes who cursed jyggalag. In addition to that he defeated Dagoth Ur like the princes did with Jyggalag .Neverar and Dagoth Ur  are members of the same folk like jyggalag and the other princes.Edit  Thanks for contributing to my theory.Edit Kagrenac is Sithis because he created a thing which was supposed to the destroy. The dwemer who achieved divinity by the use of Lorkhans heart are meant to be the aedra. The dwemer and the aedra become dead in terms of the ability to change. The Brass Gods Skin is the house of Sithis. In fact it is not nothing. But it is hugely different to thing which existed before. Divinity become mortality.

4258677,0,t1_cs53z1d,These are all great points. Ill try my best to refute them but the connections defienetly arent concrete. We are talking about a secreter organization made up of some of the greatest thieves in the world who serve the literal embodiment of that which is unknowable. So I doubt more than conjecture will be found.  Real Barenziah does state that Jagar Tharn is the Nightingale and Gallus addresses this in his writings. Keep in mind that the books author is unknown. Given the deep and personal detail in the writings I would say that either a the book is fiction loosely based on the life of Barenziah or b Barenziah wrote it herself. Lets presume the one that best helps your criticism and say that Barenziah wrote the book herself or had it ghostwritten. If that were the case then on the topic of the Nightingale its still useless. When Symachus and Barenziah are talking about Tharn its Barenziah who proposes he might be the Nightingale. She doesnt really have a reason to think this though there may be more to the suspicion than she lets on. Either way it shows that she is inherently biased against Tharn. I imagine she is also feeling pretty guilty about letting the Staff be stolen so this projection might be a way of taking the blame off of her. Again assuming that Barenziah wrote the book herself lets examine the dialogue between her and Nightingale. If you read through the introduction he gives there is one word that jumps out again and again know. Specifically the Nightingale affirms over and over that he is Know Not and that he is from Knoweyer. Basically he says that he is unknown. This is a really weird thing to say especially when you want someone to trust you. The only reason I can see here is the poetic irony of telling the person both what you are a Nightingale and who you serveNocturnal. I have another theory on this but I wont bore you with that. The other evidence that Nightingale wasnt Tharn is the line He knew the Staff lay there not the Horn and that he must teleport to safety for the Staff is not a weapon that would have seen him clear unlike the horn. We know what the Staff does. It traps people in a pocket dimension of Obvlivion. The thing is how could that not be used to escape the caves? Maybe it can only be used for a single person at a time and that Tharn wanted to save it for the Emperor but I think its more likely that the Nightingale wasnt able to use the Staff. Either because he didnt have the understanding of it or because he didnt know what it did the Nightingale teleported out with the staff instead of using it to escape. Thats point  and already is pretty long so Ill split this up into  different comments to make it easier to read. ,teslore,cs5o68i,2,t5_2t5ay

4374838,0,t3_3b33di,I really doubt he means a new Era. The different Eras are a purely Imperial notion. They sort of just decide on when the Era will change based on the rulers. The End of the First Era coincided with the fall of the Reman Dynasty. Tiber Septim declared a new Era after uniting Tamriel. And the rd Era was ended by Octato out of respect for the Septim line. Without the Empire there are no Eras. The death of the Potentate and the start of the Interegrum really should have signaled a new Era but there was no one to do so. ,teslore,csis39q,3,t5_2t5ay

4398328,0,t1_cskzrqf,You seem to be arguing from how things run in the game but the war as depicted is not the war from a lore perspective much like how Whiterun should have a couple thousand people not a couple dozen. And a lot of the civil war questline was left on the cutting room floor but apparently still is still there in the data because a theres a mod that restores a lot of it. Anyways point is the game is not an accurate depiction of the war so its nigh impossible to analyse as tactically.Given what really happened is essentially pure speculation untilunless TES VI goes into detail with books. Id tend to think its results that matter we have to imagine the actual events that led to them. For example if things seem quite before the Dragonborn picks a side... well the game also starts with the Civil War all wrapped up but for a deus ex drakon setting Ulfric loose. Unless you suppose the Imperial just got luck which Tullius presence in the field argues against IMO then that ambush you hear about probably didnt just happen but was the completion of a campaign. And Ulfric of course had whatever plans he was running kinda dashed by getting captured. So it makes sense nothing big is going on as the Dragonborn enters the fray both sides have to regroup. Now for others parts yes after Imperial victory there are plenty of Stormcloaks still around as Tullius will tell you seems to be a missing quest to wipe out the camps they tell you to but dont let you kill the commanders hes going to be in Skyrim for a long time after the victory Elisifs throne isnt secure etc etc. Insurgency is never fun but without a central leader there is only so far things can go.On the other hand once Ulfric goes independent... well hes probably going to have an economic meltdown happen while all the new trade agreements are worked out. And suppose the Empire gets petty and leans on the EEC to pull out of Skyrim or just installs high tariffs?Ulfric conquers that more difficult task and launches some golden period for Skyrim. Well for Tamriel its still a net loss. The Thalmor dont have to do anything in Skyrim... they go to now isolated High Rock and chop the Empire down to one province with some scheme. Then its time to march on the Imperial city. Ulfric hes what in his s the elves can wait a few decades and then go after the neverquiteadequate successor with their even bigger resource base. Or wait until they have the rest of Tamriel. Long term enough Ulfric looses. Unless one really believes Ulfric could not simply rule Skyrim but revive the Nordic Empire as a competing power and start swallowing up the Empires corpse for himself. I doubt with its iced coast Skyrim has the makings of a great naval power so hes cant take the fight to the Thalmor otherwise. Game changer to all of this is Hammerfell of course but indications are they are pretty rekted themselves thus not in a position to lend alliance for an offensive war ,teslore,cslfcr5,2,t5_2t5ay

4490805,0,t1_cswp0dt,Oh I know. I probably worded it badly. I was implying that Akatosh suffers instability as well from AKAwho I referred to as the same mess. For the most part there seems to be a system that the shards of Aka are at least nodding to and Akatosh seems to have come to some solid conclusion on whats going to happen next despite how unstable everything is up there. He seems to be in charge of the Dragonborn business and hes always helping mortals adjust to some cosmic strife.I was also under the impression he wasnt too much against Alduins fundamental purpose since another theory states that Lorkhans involvement in the whole thing may have led to Alduins role as a world eater which may help give more opportunities for mortals to achieve realization as well as help stabilize things. Right now theres a lot of varying theories on the whole Aka business and exactly what each part of Aka ultimately intends. I felt Akatosh was more aligned with Lorkhan so if Lorkhan did indeed support the idea of multiple kalpas Akatosh would too. Whether or not hes to blame for Alduins change I dont know. He waited a long time to introduce an attempted solution to Alduins greed via Miraak.

In ESO the Altmer infiltrate the ranks of Ebonheart Pact by turning into alternate versions of their highranking officers. This all relates to the Ooze because its implied that the Ooze is the result of alternate versions of the same story. Obviously the Altmer arent turning into shapeshifting monsters but theyre using the same concept.gtTheyre not a random mashup though?People that are part human with octopus tentacles for legs crab claws for hands and spider legs growing from their back. If that doesnt sound like a convoluted amalgamation of different animal species then I dont know what is.gtThe humans dont have Yffre at all. The other Elven cultures do not talk about the Ooze. Thats my point.And? Humans still acknowledge the existence of Earth Bones and most elven pantheons have Yffre.Perhaps I should put it this way. The reason we dont see other races talk about the Dawn Era being a shapeless mess of alternate realities is because they only believe their version of the Dawn Era happened. The Bosmer are the only ones that seem to acknowledge that everyones version of the story is true.gtNo Im saying that a particular source is more credible because it lines up with many other observed facts. Many other observed facts according to you and your personal interpretation of the same source according to me.gtUnless they are writing and speaking this tale in the context of a fable to young children about Valenwood which it seems to me they are This is a story the Wood Elves of Valenwood tell their children from a very young age.That argument would work if it said This is a story of the Wood Elves and Valenwood. The only context here is that this is a story all about how my life got flipped turned upside down that Bosmer teach to their children. Thats it.gtIm not saying that the forest causes it. Im saying that the region itself causes it and then Yffre settled the region to be a forest in spite of it.But why would there be a specific region during the merethic era that constantly shapeshifted for no reason before the multiple roaming towers of GreenSap were even established?gtAnd humans? Why arent they mentioned?If I had to take a guess I would say humans are not mentioned because of the elven cultural bias against humans. gtAnd why dont the other elves agree about there having been an Ooze that they had to escape?Well for one thing if the Ooze is the Dawn Era then most Elves wouldnt see it as an escape but rather a cruel trick. And as I said before the other cultures only believe in their version of the creation story.gtNo accounts of Dragon Breaks describe ceaseless shapechanging which is the primary feature of the Ooze.Because most accounts of Dragon Breaks focus on specific individual realities and not the big picture. gtWhat it really boils down to is that I dont see any convincing reason for nonlinear time to equate to shapeshifting Ooze.I dont think it has anything to do with nonlinear time anymore. Thats what I learned from ESO. I think it has to do with the fact that you have multiple versions of reality running at the same time. Nonlinear time is just a sideeffect.Im sorry youre tired of this debate. This is just one of my favorite topics in the Elder Scrolls lore. I also realize I didnt address a few things but Ill edit them in latereditgtWhy would Yffre give unconditional stability to others even in Valenwood and yet keep the Bosmer under his thumb?Because from what I could gather in ESO the Bosmer are their own enforcers of their pact. If a Bosmer shifts they hunt him down and condemn him to the Ooze. If a foreigner takes a bite out of a plant in the ground the Bosmer kills him on the spot which actually happens in a random encounter with a Khajiit eating a flower. Yffre himself doesnt seem to do anything to enforce the pact.gtIn what province? What actually happens to them? And what precisely does the textdialogue call it?If I recall correctly its Greenshade in Valenwood. The Bosmer lady tasks the Vestige with bringing the heads of the Wood Orcs that killed her loved ones. The heads get put on spikes and she performs a ritual. The ghostly forms of the Orcs appear in pain and disappear presumably to the Ooze. Which proves that it is not only Bosmer that can revert to it. This is what she says in ESO. I would link to a screencap but my internet is too slow to upload pictures at the moment. So youll have to take my word for now.gtThere is a stone circle sacred to the Faithful not far from here. Go there mount the heads and touch the center stone. This blood sacrifice will complete an ancient ritual to Yffre. Gorzesh will watch us commit his family to the Ooze.,teslore,ctlato9,1,t5_2t5ay

Note that Orcs seem to adopt a variety of different armors depending upon region the the samuraiesque armor only appears in Morrowind. There are certain connections between Redguards and the Akaviri as well. A lot of this could be explained by ancient trade or the time travel theory.

In fact the next ESO expansion will include an Akaviri armor motif. The actual picture of the samuraiesque warrior I posted is an ESO Akaviri set commonly used by the Fighters Guild.

I am under the impression that Sheogorath came into being long before Lorkhans death and that Lorkhan is not nearly crazy enough in life to mantle Sheogorath in death.That being said I think you are missing out on a crucial piece of lore that could really help your argument both characters are stuck in a loop that they cannot escape. The cyclical nature of both characters is fairly interesting. When one kalpa ends another begins and the beginning of each kalpa is marked by the death of Lorkhan. There is no telling how many times this cycle has been repeated and it is easy to imagine that this sort of repeated trauma could cause even a god to go insane.At the same time Sheogoraths realm is ripped apart by an outside force every era Im not convinced that it occurs every  years. Add to that the widely held belief that Daedric Princes are their realms and you have some pretty uncanny similarities between Sheogorath and Lorkhan.,teslore,cuts0ay,2,t5_2t5ay

5198535,0,t3_3m3ceq,There is a difference between resisting corrosion and being totally immune to corrosion.  IRL Aluminum doesnt rust at STP because it develops a very thin hard oxide layer on the surface that acts as a barrier between the metal underneath and oxygen from outside.  The same goes for Nickel Chrome Titanium and others.  Nothing resists oxidation like an oxide.  That oxide layer is not impervious it can be scratched chipped or dissolved.  Once its gone the metal underneath can be oxidized and if a new barrier doesnt form or if it is likewise removed the entire object will rust away.Perhaps there is normally some barrier between the airwater and normal dwarven metal but its possible for that barrier to be breached under certain circumstances.  If the ash from Red Mountain is chemically similar to IRL substances like Potash or Soda Ash which can come from geological sources as well as literally burning some plants that would make it pretty caustic.  A strong caustic solution say rain falling on a buildup of ash could very well eat away at such a coating and corrode the metal underneath.  I seem to remember hearing that Red Mountain ash is quite corrosive somewhere in lore but I cant find a source for it right now.So its possible that Dwemer ruins nearer to Red Mountain are more corroded than those found in Skyrim because they have been exposed to more of the ash.

Not so much due to power level but because Daedra are supposed to be descended from Padomay while Aedra and mortals are descended from Anu and crossing over from one to another is much more difficult.This distinction was made during the formation of Mundus those etAda that became Daedra rejected taking part and werent affected by it while those that did take part were devolved into mortals Ehlnofey with the most powerful becoming the Aedra. Because of this Daedra are largely incapable of creation and can only modify which could also explain why theres a large number of mortals living in the Shivering Isles. They also have their influence on Mundus restricted by the liminal barrier which was only truly breached twice the Planemeld and the Oblivion Crisis although other events such as the Imperial Simulacrum may have been other attempts to breach the barrier.tldr Daedra arent necessarily more or less powerful than Aedra but theyre fundamentally different.

5292362,0,t1_cvntham,I can flatly contradict it with a knowledgeable source which isnt backing you on it per se but seems relevantgt This is a good question with which to start for answering it enables me to address some misconceptions about the Elder Scrolls that are common among the  er  commoners. The Scrolls are often described as tools of prophecyindeed the Aedra Prophecies is another name for them in some quartersbut the fact that the Scrolls speak of future events is merely a sideeffect of their intrinsic nature. The Scrolls tell of our future because they are woven into that futureas well the present and the past and every other aspect of this reality we call the Mundus. It is a mistake to think that events prophesized in the Scrolls are fixed and unchangeable again and again we in the Order of the Ancestor Moth have seen the prophecies alter as the future changes in response to the acts of mortals. Future events foretold in the Scrolls may be deemed likely to occur so likely as to seem almost certainbut no event is fixed in the Scrolls until it actually happens.gt gt Though the great events of history garner the most attention think not that the Scrolls solely commemorate acts of lasting significance. The Elder Scrolls are bound by threads of time to the warp and weft of the entire Mundus and every soul great or otherwise has a place therein. Many speak of heroes as if they were born great and the key roles of history were fated to be enacted by them. But is that so? A careful study of the Scrolls leads me to believe that no mortal is born great but that a person becomes a Hero by making choices and taking actions other mortals refuse. The Scrolls do not select such people but they do record and reflect their actions and note the difference made thereby.In other words there isnt such a thing as destiny to be defied in the first place.  The future is in flux for everyone based on their actions and circumstances and Heroes are just people who choose to confront great Events.,teslore,cvo5syo,5,t5_2t5ay

5362221,0,t3_3ogujm,Colovian culture is a blend of your CyroNordic culture. They are seen as being a forward and direct people Also they seem to be much more rugged and hardy people who take honor and oaths very seriously. Having Nordic roots the Colovians also borrow from the old Nord pantheon in dealing with Kyne Shor etc. They most likely blend this with the more typical Cyrod gods and cultural heroes. Their judicial system also is quite unapologetic In typical Colovian fashion there was no trial no accusations of treason no jury no judge. Only an executioner.As for military and armor I am of the opinion that they have operated with the structure of Legions since the earliest days a Cyrodiil controlled by men. Their armor is a matter of debate but I hold that they looked like hoplite infantry in the very early days and moved towards a more modern look in the style of the ancient Roman legions. Thats my strictly my opinion though.The difference between Colvia and Nibenay comes from the fact that the Eastern Nibenese see themselves as culturally sophisticated and progressive in the schools of thought rhetoric magic and political theory. They see the Western Colivians as a bit backwards primitive and rebellious. No doubt the Colovians view the East as arrogant haughty decadent and too focused on trivial things rather than whats practical. At the end of the day though they are all Imperials and this blend of sturdy and upright Colovian values mixed with the progressive Nibenese has made Cyrodiil a force to be reckoned with. ,teslore,cvx31xe,10,t5_2t5ay

Thus their life as written in prophecy and the events of fulfillment serve as the crucible in which their Will is proven for the destiny they select meaning that they probably have Will in spades to do what NO OTHERS can.As for zerosumming it follows that a Hero would have the Will to attempt CHIM  the Love to obey a higher Will while maintaining ones own would be the issue and probably subject to the ability of the individual. I would presume most Heroes wouldnt bother attempting CHIM either way when they themselves are probably treading one of the other paths. Ive always assumed Heroes tread the way of the ancient road as spoken by Vivec in his Sermons. His Sermons presumably addressed to the Nerevarine himself give us gt I give you an ancient road tempered by the second walking way. Your hands must be huge to wield any sword the size of an ancient road and yet he who is of right stature may irritate the sun with only a stick.The implication if you follow this logic is that Heroes are tempered in the forging of their own Destiny to realize a potential that exceeds what is presumed of other men and actually makes them beings elevated as Heroes. Ergo a sword the size of an ancient road and a path that cares nothing for ones origin but everything for ones potential he who is of right stature may irritate the sun with only a stick.I think the better question here is why would a Hero pursue CHIM when they already walk the way of the ancient road of a Hero? Its not to say your theory isnt valid but I just think you have your missing ingredients reversed.,teslore,cwq9izs,1,t5_2t5ay

And if I understand you then the rest of this post should make sense!On that note Jubal may moreso be King than Rebel. The thought being that Talos set loose Numidum during his campaignRebelling and Jubal is the King to smite the rebellion down during CDA even if Numidum vanished for a great deal of time. Although being thegtKing and Rebel between themselvesis likely how the two can be interpreted as either one or the other. Vivec can also be viewed on a stretch as one or the other maybe lending to the thought that all three are difficult to distinguish between in the grand scheme as all three are born from the same Destructionbased magics?Also thats a good way to think of Mankar and Lorkhan failing but I believe Mankar did achieve it in some light in some sort of timeline? I dont have that source but that also goes with there being no limit to the amount of people achieving CHIM and the top three are in fact simply representing the Enantiomorph!edit Somewhat you said and going against a couple of things I wrote myself   Shock Mage   Fire Warrior Prone to angerThe Firmanent bookIce Leaving the Thief thus observing from shadow?,teslore,cwuvgte,2,t5_2t5ay
5718616,0,t1_cx5ttv9,gt First off the Khajiit are not tied to Lorkhan.Well agreed and disagreed. From an outsider perspective that is from any culture that gels with the Lunar Lorkhan theory the Khajiit are fundamentally tied to him. From an insider perspective the Khajiit are not associated.Yet if the Lunar Lorkhan is true regardless of mortal belief the Khajiit are tied to him whether they believe it or not. I honestly dont like saying this but because its the best way to explain my perspective I have to. Itd be like a fish denying the existence of water. The position of the moons which would quite literally be Lorkhan if the theory holds true have an incontrovertible effect on the physiology of the Khajiit.And Im not entirely sure that The Lunar Lorkhan conflicts with the Lunar Lattice when they saidgtWe curse you noisy Lorkhaj to walk Nirni for many phases.That could be interpreted as having a dual meaning. Its an obvious nod to the Shezzarines no doubt in my mind whatsoever. However it could also refer to the phases of the moons. Please dont shoot.gt If they detested him so much then they wouldnt have a temple dedicated to him.Perhaps repulsed wasnt the best word. They seem to be meraligned on the role of Lorkhan. They view him as a deceiver which isnt quite how a culture that appreciates his role in creation would view him.Not saying they cant view him as a Lokiesque trickster whose status as a hero or a villain is evershifting. Perhaps their mythology leaves it vague because of their inherent Khajiit knowledge I imagine its more a gut feeling for them an intuition as to the true nature of the world and they realize that sometimes Lorkhan has to be the villain and sometimes he needs to be a hero.Important EditI had hunch and typed moon Khajiit and Lorkhan into google. gtgtWhen true cats commune with the moons and their spirits climb the Lunar Lattice then can a Khajiit see the Dead Moon sailing behind Jone and Jode. This moon is the corpse of Lorkhaj. After he made the world for Nirnis children to live in the Darks in the heart of Lorkhaj also made a prison of the worldfor he did not know the First Secret. Thus his heart was cut out and buried in the Dark Behind the World and his body was hurled on high to follow the moons forever. This all true cats learn from their Clan Mothers.So theres that.

Esbern himself might not be very antiImperial in fact IIRC he recognizes the fact that the Blades were overconfident and that is what led to their downfall and why the Empire had no choice but to essentially disavow them.Delphine on the other hand... While she might not be overly antiImperial from what we see she hates and despises both the dragons and the Thalmor and is often blinded by that hatred such as refusing to help you any longer so long as Paarthurnax lives or immediately blaming the Thalmor for being responsible for the Dragon Crisis.  She is the main reason why I do not think Ulfric would so quickly try to disband or outlaw the Blades.  Ulfric and Delphine know each other which means Ulfric is no doubt aware of Delphines hatred towards the Thalmor.  With her as Grandmaster the Blades represent a valuable ally to Ulfric and his Stormcloaks a force trained to combat dragons which remain an ever present threat and led by someone who shares his views of the Thalmor and could likely be convinced to help fight them should it come to that.gtAnother thing If Parthunax was spared as the OP mentions then the Blades would cease to help the Dragonborn as they see him sparing Parthunax as a mistake.Thats assuming of course that the OP decides to follow that course.  After all its his story and version of events.  Whos to say that his LDB didnt convince Delphine and Esbern to sparegive up on Paarthurnax or to focus on other issues?

There is literally no difference then between this and a soul going to another realm. That would make it so one can say Paradise Mankars realm isnt actually a plane of Oblivion because he didnt use the starlanes of the Ge but used a Welkynd Stone as his source for aetherial energies. The thing that matters is the aetherial energies not where the energies are gotten from. I do not see how this impacts the argument per se.Lorkhans heart has shown sentience. Lorkhan has even appeared after his supposed death like at the battle for Red Mountain. This makes it so I believe the case can be made that Lorkhan isnt dead. His heart is a part of him and the other part can come back just like how Lesser Daedra come back after a while. It makes me think that Lorkhan is just in a weakened state which any Daedric Prince can be in just look at Vile in Skyrim not dead.Lorkhans heart has also been called the Heart of Nirn. You even said that Lorkhans Heart gave Nirn its divinity.Does that not mean that just like a Daedric Plane is centered on the heart of Lorkhan?So the only way you can differentiate Mundus from a Daedric Plane is by saying that Lorkhan is entirely separate from his heart. I do not think that case can be made.Mundus has its divine center at its Prince Lorkhan. More specifically at Lorkhans Heart.I imagine that if one were to rip the heart out of any Daedric Prince and kill the rest of him that there would still be the divine center of that princes Plane at their heart.I imagine that someone more invested in Lore than I am could explain this better than I am trying to but I still see no reason not to say that Mundus isnt a Daedric Realm.,teslore,cytcrgy,2,t5_2t5ay

Say your Dunmers father married into his or her mothers clan. Then that fathers parents would be of a different clan and they and their ancestors would not be in communion with your Dunmer. More importantly the connection of the Dunmer to their ancestors is not just through blood but also through ritual. That is why they have that connection and other cultures which dont practice those rituals dont.Therefore that Imperial ancestor would have had to become part of the Dunmers clan through marriage and ritual and then be buried according to Dunmer rituals. Basically that Imperial would have had to be assimilated into Dunmer culture.Now that is possible in theory. However Dunmer are as a society rather on the racist side of things and they are especially concerned with keeping their bloodlines pure  especially because of their bond to their ancestors. So the clan who would allow an Imperial to become a full member through marriage and then bury that member with full rituals would be rare.

I have a lot of thoughts about how Amaranth and CHIM work so what Im about to say is predicated on that materialAmaranth is an individual fully entering the Dreamsleeve divorcing themself from all other realities and yet persisting because they possess Will the ability to be permanent to be unerasable.  Without that the Dreamsleeves random infofoam static would tear them apart as they wouldnt have a stable reality in which to exist but because they have Will they are their own stable reality.Will can be achieved in the Aurbis through the process known as CHIM though this is not the only way for example the Hist have their own called the Striking which relies on symbolic magic and manipulation of your own soul through conscious meditation.  Are the same symbols involved in CHIM the Wheel the Tower and the Triangular Gate relevant to Anus original Dream?  They could be but by the same token could also not be.  So maybe Anu underwent a similar process in his original Dream or an identical one or a radically different one or no process at all we cant really say because regarding Amaranth the important thing is not how he acquired this permanence this Will but rather simply that he did.,teslore,cz5egcs,1,t5_2t5ay

6587579,0,t1_d00np6u,I think there is definitely a difference between PCs and NPCs. Whenever a PC enters the world it is a dragon break. I dont think there has ever been a case where there wasnt. The OOG purpose was originally to explain how everyones story was equally valid so Bethesda didnt have to anger players with their sessions not reflecting canon. It extends further than that of course but that was the initial reason. Beyond that players can save players know they are playing a game they can cheat they can mod etc etc. None of these things are normally accessible to NPCs however some are if they achieve CHIM. For example there is evidence in Vivecs sermons that he accessed the morrowind creation kit. Because of that reason I think that PCs have by default a CHIMlike state although I wouldnt necessarily call it CHIM. While CHIM started as an OOG explanation for using the console and mods it has taken on a more metaphysical meaning especially in game. PCs arent awake while dreaming they never were dreaming. They are from the outside of the dream. At the point the analogies start to break down but the way I see it at least is its all a metaphor for players entering this fictional world created by Bethesda. The  dream is really just a representation of the franchise lore as created by MK Todd Howard and others. Because what is a fictional world but a dream? NPCs achieving CHIM is them gaining some form of self awareness about their status while still being figments of the imagination. I as a player am not. I am real and MK didnt imagine me characters like Vivec can only hope to grasp what its like to actually be alive. I see it a lot like the TNG episode ship in a bottle. My explanation is probably poorly organized and hard to read. I didnt expect to give a description of the way I think CHIM works today so if you want I can clean it up later. ,teslore,d00pju7,1,t5_2t5ay
6627456,0,t1_d04s0m8,Also meh!For one thing Auriel is described as a dragon in multiple texts but I dont think hes ever been described as a bird.  The statue in Oblivion doesnt count the bird and the humanoid figure cant be assumed to be the same being and theres no actual confirmation that its Auriel in the first place to my knowledge.  We have an actual statue of Auriel as a humanoid elf in Dawnguard which displays neither draconic nor birdlike features.  Given that the Chantry was entirely dedicated to worship of Auriel youd think itd have some kind of bird imagery if that actually were part of his general schtick.  You could say that the Falmer emphasize that hes an ancestor and so depict him as shaped like them but considering Altmeri emphasis on ancestors it would be bizarre if they chose to break from that in favor of depicting him as a bird.For another Bat  Tiger  Dragon has far more mythic weight behind it.  Tusk of the BatTiger as the sigil of Jubals lineage?  Tosh Raka the tigerpersonturneddragon and possibly the first of the NuMen?  And yet people arent saying that all dragons are some literal combination of tigers and bats resulting from some kind of oversoul transformation!For yet another there is no evidence that dragons ever were anything but dragons and no I dont buy that it was retroactive.  The idea that theyre birdsnakes was invented to fit with the claim that Akatosh is the combination of Shezarr and Auriel its not evidence that was found independently and so it doesnt lend more strength to the original claim which again also has zero textual support.Also its important to mention that Akatosh was worshiped by the Ayleids before the Rebellion apparently under that name so its not like humans invented that bit either.  This would make it doubly odd to believe the Ayleid statue in Oblivion is somehow supposed to be Auriel and not Akatosh if its even either of them.Oh and also it strikes me as very odd to associate Auriel so strongly with birds when Kyneareth is explicitly represented by a hawk while Auriel isnt.,teslore,d04u3y0,3,t5_2t5ay

In the real world nobody would tell you what happened in history the culture of different countries or scientific development like they are teaching you in the cases where these are discussed everyone assumes that you know the basics. It is the same in TES games your character as an inuniverse character knows the basic things such as deity history and racial cultures so having someone constantly explaining to you without some clever delivery device is just gonna be a expositionfest and breaks immersion so to speak.

6645070,0,t1_d04kmfp,I think it might be better to look at it as activepassive versus offensivedefensive. The manifestation of the HD seem to require action against an enemy that is threatening the Redguard peoples. Its why we see the HD manifest when Cyrus actively goes against Richton but not when ATor stands his ground in the harbor. Or when Hunding and co. were conquering Hammerfell for themselves  the natives being a threat to their manifest destiny  an awkward phrase but the best I can do on a phone in a reply but not when the Redguards were part of the Daggerfall Covenant and wanted to place their own guys at the head of the Empire. The HoonDing also seems to require the joining of two mythical opposing? parts the Sword of ATor and the Crown of Cyrus... or the Sword of Cyrus and the Crown of Ator. Now the latter part of the Great War when Hammerfell was on its own against the Thalmor and when Crown and Forebear were united seems like it should fulfill these critetia. As I said above this sort of thing isnt something that would be on the radar of anyone but the Redguards but should we see a game or book etc. set in Hammerfell I doubt that it will go undressed. I think its also important to note that the clearest text on the issue is an Imperial one.

I think you are on to something here but perhaps the seas are more chaotic than the impression I am getting from this image.

6858359,0,t3_49lxzk,gtMy first question is this  what are the exactly realworld inspirations for the Nibenese and Colovians? I know that the Imperials are typically seen as inspired by the ancient Romans but I imagine that both subgroups would have their own unique inspirations for each culture. I heard the Colovians have Slavic aspects while the Nibenese would be... well varied. Some posts I read mention the Nibenese being Holy Roman Empire or even GrecoRoman with hints Asian from Akaviri influence and possibly Indian influence as well. Or is it something else for these groups.There are a real range of influences here. The devs went wild with it. Overall the idea were supposed to get is some alien Imperial culture from another world with slight superficial similarities to a hodgepodge of real world cultures who also had Empires so youll see a bit of Prussian a bit of Chimese a bit of GrecoRoman etc. a bit of English French Spanish Dutch. gt Question two focuses more on the Nibenese  what exactly are the ancestral roots of the Nibenese? I know Colovians have Nordic ancestry along with Nedic  also would they be considered CyroNords or would those be ancestors to Colovians as well?  but what exactly are the ancestral roots for the Nibenese Imperials? Are they expansive and vary from family to family?In the early days a melting pot of various Nedic tribesmen recently liberated from Slavery. In the modern era a real mix. Colovians and Nibenese intermarry more in the Third and Fourth Eras. Theres also admixture from Elves Bretons Nords and others. gt Question three  are there differences in Colovian and Nibenese naming conventions? I read that names such as Rislav Hassildor etc. are Colovian naming styles only while the Nibenese are typically the Roman with some changing to Italian as shown in the th Era names we typically associate with Imperials. Is that correct or would both group have Roman names as a whole?Youll see Romanstyle names in both places if you go by Oblivion but some famous people have nonRoman names. Not really sure where they were going with that. gt Question four... I know the Colovians and Nibenese both have different cultures ancestries religious views Colovians being strictly Divines while Nibenese are more lax in their religious views but are there also any physical differences between them? Ive seen some posts saying that the Nibenese are darkertannedolive skinned while the Colovians are more fair to pale skinned but I personally dont buy it. The Imperials are a diverse group considering Cyrodiil is a melting pot of cultures and people and Clivia Tharn and Abnur Tharn of the nd Era  both coming from the known Nibenese family  are both very fair skinned as are a couple other Tharns in Online I believe. To be honest theyre fairly light across the board with slightly Olive skin. The really tanned ones are genetically different  probably intermarried with Redguards around Anvil and Sutch  or they do a lot of farm work. gt Question five ties in to question four a bit  would a pale to fair think Breton skin tones Imperial Nibenese especially be rare in a province like Cyrodiil? Or would they be just as common as a olive skinned tanned or just generally swarthy Imperial of either cultural group?If you go by Oblivion theyre everywhere. If you go by common sense theres probably a lot of pale people there because many of the tribal bloodlines theyre descended from were pale jungledwellers and many of the modern ones are mages and shopkeepers people who spend a lot of time indoors. gt And my final question... regarding the Nibenese only is there any idea on their stance regarding Daedra the Daedric Princes or necromancy? I know Corpse Preparation the book in Morrowind mentioned that in Cyrodiil the Empire would donate corpses of bandits and traitors to necromancers as a way to dissuade crime but there anything in the lore that might mention the Nibenese and necromancy or daedra?Nibenese are big on magicka but Necromancy itself is frowned upon by major magical institutions. Youre not gonna see people practicing casual necromancy or daedra trafficking especially after the events of the Oblivion Crisis and Mannimarcos resurgence. ,teslore,d0tpcn9,1,t5_2t5ay

7646300,0,t1_d3b1tkz,A few of my own inputs  Id think that this would be a mostly heartlander system at its root with its presence and its derivatives presence amongst colovians and nibenese stemming from the same sort of reman onwards dominance held by the heartlands in general over the elements of both societies heartlander being the culture of the rumare coasts and islands that many outsiders would simply consider part of the nibenese.  Id imagine old colovians and some of the more rural colovians would just use the sort of two name systems common amongst the nords and bretons and dunmer specifically bastardized from the nordic personal name and the clan name.  Similarly many of the notsoheartlandized nibenese would bear many diverse systems some similar to the nordic others entirely unique to their river branch others mirroring the heartlands in nature.In general I like where youre going with this but it needs clarification and diversification.Id also note that I imagine Remus Catullius Cyrodiil to be a later invention or a name he held later in his rule Reman was his birth name after all.  I do want to know what the reason for catullius in his name is though.I like your reasoning of Tiber Septims name.Edit  Didnt mention this at first but I like that you mention the distinction of heartlander from colovian and nibenese at all.Edit Edit I really dont at all agree with the statement of them pooling from the same  first names.

The one WW I would say that could have helped ALMSIVI with powerlevel would be the Sixth Soul Fusion where if they acted together they would be using the combined power of three very powerful souls and possibly reaching for more because of such state but more as a sideeffect than an objective reward of sorts for the Walking Way.,teslore,d4yaq23,3,t5_2t5ay

8182017,0,t3_4qvnvf,Its still possible to worship Trinimac but its like trying to obtain Roman Empire citizenship. You can say you have it all you want if you live in a formerly Roman territory but the fact is Romes changed and now its a bunch of countries in Europe Africa and the Levant.Theoretically someone COULD resurrect the Roman Empire and someone COULD try to take the Trinimac mantle but theyd have to do it like the Sheogorath case. First kick out Malacath and take his job. Then assuming you keep fending off the old Malacath and do his job well maybe he might be able to find his way back into being Trinimac. First take over Italy. Then assuming you keep fending off the countries currently sitting in Romes territories and all their friends and do your job well you might be able to conquer Romes old lands.Unlike with Sheogorath however there isnt a Trinimac who shows up every now and then demanding to be let out as far as we know... and Malacath has to keep beating him down. Furthermore unlike with JyggalagSheogorath Malacath isnt Trinimacs opposite hes Trinimacs perversion. Not the popular meaning of perversion where Malacath has weird fetishes but where everything Trinimac stood for and embodied is still there just tainted twisted and sullied.Sheogorath is the polar opposite of Jyggalag. Its torment and torture for Jyggalag to be the Sheogorath and Jyggalag is able to escape because the Sheogorath role isnt Jyggalag. Its a prison and burden forced upon him from which he cant escape on his own.Malacath is not that to Trinimac. Malacath is Trinimac in exile alone and tainted. If Trinimac is the Strong Knight in shining armor fighting for the good the true and the beautiful Malacath is that same guy hulking and scarred in rusty patchy armor fighting for food a view and whoever will let him hang around. Trinimacs Sheogorath would be a coward and a sycophant. Jyggalags Malacath would be a hoarder who cant organize everything they own anymore but wont throw any of it away.Malacath is Trinimac changed both in spirit and in role. There isnt an empty spot where Trinimac used to be that could be refilled because both the spiritself of Trinimac and the idea of Trinimac were changed by Boethiah to Malacath. There just ISNT a Trinimac role anymore. The Strong Knight lost. You cant mantle something that isnt there.Lorkhan is dead but his corpse still occupies his spot. You can follow in a dead leaders footsteps and be heralded as a second him ampndash to borrow from Rome some more the emperors were all called Caesars despite literally none of them being from his family German military leaders were called Kaisers when they mantled ol Gaius Iulius and the Russian monarchs were called Tsars for running a bigass empire ampndash this is what Talos does.Jyggalag was evicted and imprisoned with an empty void in his old spot. You can liberate an imprisoned spirit and return them to their old job although that may require you to take their place. Sorry buddy.But you cant find a disgraced knight whos been publicly exiled and shunned and get them back in everyones good graces. This is who they are now. You can be as nostalgic as you want and long for the Good Old Days when they were shiny and the kings right hand but theyre over. AuriEl is like Elvis the king is gone. Everyone saw his knight get beat up and thrown in the dirt and thats all theyll accept of him now and thats all hell accept of himself.I like to believe that the Orcs bettering themselves in the eyes of the Empire and Men will take Malacath with them that theyre not cursed to forever be bandits and scum and outcast that they can claw their way back out of the dirt and be their better selves.But unlike the first time where godly struggle drug mortals along this is a mortal struggle that will have to drag their god with them.

The Fall took place in the previous Kalpa according to Tatterdemalion. During the Fall the Towers are pulled down the upstart vanishes the Princes are said to unite for the first time ever in recorded history and Molag Bal becomes prince of Coldharbour. That would seem to imply that the Fall of Lyg was the start of one version of the Dawn and thus the end of that Kalpa caused by the fall of its towers.Its also possible that Alduin is the Fall of the Towers or rather its personification manifested by the beliefs of Nords with mythopoeia or made real by manifest metaphors. ,teslore,d56etdf,3,t5_2t5ay

Instead of an Imperialdynasty it would most likely be a Nord one. The human races probably wouldnt care but Elven ones might have... issues.The capital would still be in Cyrodiil but now the Emperor would also be for a time the High King of Skyrim. That would solidify Imperial as in Empire not Cyrodiilic control over Skyrim.The Thalmor might object but if it was a peaceful revolution the Empire wouldnt be any worse off than if they won the Civil War in Skyrim seeing as Stormcloak soldiers would probably be folded into the Legion while the Thalmor would still be pretty battered from the Great War elves dont reproduce nearly as quickly.Morrowind might also be a little peeved but Skyrim has done some really good things i.e. giving up Solstheim so its a bit of a crapshoot how theyll react. ,teslore,d5kdndv,1,t5_2t5ay

8360004,0,t1_d5lmc1j,I interpret the statue as two waysWhat you said with the metacommentary. Talos usurped Shors place as the protectorherogod of Mankind. Lorkhan typically equivalent to Shor is heavily associated with the serpent eg. he is literally the Serpent constellation. So Talos metaphorically kills Shor and takes his place in the pantheon. Seems solid. You can also try to see it like this but its much weaker Dragons are typically associated with serpents in real world mythology Talos was a Dragonborn and as a Shezzarine Talos was also partially in opposition to the Anuic Time God Auriel or whoever. So the Dragonborn HeroofMan kills the Dragon.

8373544,0,t1_d5o5ult,gtBecause we saw  of them. Ok? How is this argument even remotely relevant?Lets go over the completely valid reasons why we only saw  in the game. Guards already make up over  of Whiteruns population. Adding in more would make the city even more disproportionate and would make attempting crime hugely difficult if Bethesda just doubled the amount of Guards in Whiterun just for one quest.. There are only  Guards in the city of Whiterun.  Guards is over  of the entire garrison. Sending many more would result in leaving the city open for attack if the dispatch failed.. The game difficulty had to be scaled so that you would be able to kill a Dragon on your own. If you required the help of  Guards every time you fought a Dragon you would barely make a dent in the questline before giving up. .  Guards plus the PC would be way too overpowered if we look at the ingame difficulty and mechanics.. NPCs are the singlemost heaviest dent in your performance each one requires its own script its own navmeshes its own AI and its own polygons. Performance would drop heavily as well because you are fighting a Dragon which has more polygons that human NPCs and has more intense scriptingAI and you are in Skyrim not an enclosed city meaning more to render.. Lets look at the Battle for Windhelm. You have  Imperial Soldiers on your side plus Rikke and Tullius. Does that actually mean that a group of  Imperials took the capital of the Stormcloak rebellion? It wouldnt be a civil war if you had sieged Windhelm by yourself and it wouldnt be a challenge if there were  Imperials and  Stormcloaks in this scenario they had to make as many NPCs as possible. To aid the performance they disabled all of the civilians of Skyrim and made sure it happened inside a city to reduce the strain on performance. When you are taking a fort NPCs periodically spawn to replace others you dont face the entire force at one time otherwise it would severely reduce performance.. Bethesda isnt perfect. They couldnt make a game where each city has  NPCs. They couldnt make  cities the size of Novigrad and fill in all the open space between them with hundreds of caves they lacked the technology and the money. Skyrim is the size of Poland in real Tamriel literally over  times the size of our ingame version. They had to improvise to make sure that everything was the right difficulty and that every person can play the game with minimal performance loss.,teslore,d5o8r5l,12,t5_2t5ay

8430038,0,t1_d5v8qz0,I see no reason why bias or propaganda would be useful in that part of the PGE and it is quite correct most of the time so it still stands as a valid source.gtConquering one of the largest provinces along with its warlike and daedric race is just far too unlikely to be taken as fact instantly.You must consider that they were never a united land they were a tribal society before the rise of the Hortator and the following rule of the Tribunal. They were isolated from each other and often went to war against themselves. They were fractured disunited uncooperative and not at all a Daedric race they were elves and the Nords have already proven their efficiency in dealing with such kind so while not something that can be taken as fact instantly it holds as a valid source. The PGE itself is mentioning their own sources in the text its not simply stating and making us take only its word as fact it was based in Nordic oral tradition and not only the PGE but we have other sources as well like the Legendary Sancre Tor and King Edward which while dont say they conquered all of Morrowind wouldnt make sense if they had just conquered a small portion of the Chimer lands and for the Chimer to have to unite to fight back and even forge an alliance with the Dwemer to be able to survive as a nation should also serve as evidence to the Nordic very established domain over Resdayn. And even the Sermons only mention the days of Resdaynia when Chimer and Dwemer lived under the benevolent rule of the ALMSIVI and their champion the Hortator after the war with the northern men so there wasnt even a nation there before.I dont know why you think the Chimer are so invincible they arent a superbreed they have no Daedric blood in them the only Daedric thing they have is their gods and some of their values that help them survive as individuals because their precepts scorn any form of social stability or working hierarchy. Before being united by the flag of the Hortator they were scattered and easily turned against each other making them quite vulnerable to conquest. The Imperials conquered the largest Province with an army of slaves against the very wellstructured Ayleids much more organised than the Chimer so why wouldnt an army of wellprepared Nords and their Tongues be able to conquer the Chimer?,teslore,d5vanle,6,t5_2t5ay

We also know that Shor hates elves with a passion which is why only humans can be found in Sovngarde namely Nords. This is because its no secret that Shor favors Nords above all other human races as theyre the most human of the human races being direct descendants of the Atmorans. After you kill Alduin you get told by Tsun that one day youll be welcomed to Sovngarde.

8679632,0,t1_d6qk2y5,But here is the thing...If being bitten or scratched by a vampire was enough to turn you into a vampire then how exactly do you have the blood of the vampire that infected you flowing within you? no blood transfusion took place sure the vampire probably drank your blood but he didnt inturn give you his you still have your regular old blood only know you bare the curse of the vampire.If being bitten then force fed the vampires blood was how you became a vampire that would be because you contracted the Curse that was carried through that blood the blood you drink doesnt replace your own blood and I can prove that using simple logic. If that Blood you drank would somehow become your own blood then that would also mean any blood a vampire drank would also become their blood and if that is the case then how exactly do pureblooded vampires stay pure without having to forever starve themselves? If Harkon drank the blood of a High Elf wouldnt his Pureblood now be tainted by Aldmeri Blood? so their for the blood a vampire would force feed you in this scenario cannot be the same blood that would flow in your own veins upon becoming a vampire.So if anything the whole concept of PureBloodHalfBlood is a metaphor you wouldnt really have the blood of the one who turned you flowing through your veins.

They werent exactly pushovers in their own right Almalexia and Sotha Sil were able to fight off Mehrunes Dagon Sotha Sil was able to bind the Daedric Princes to an agreement to not be summoned by casual conjurers Vivec consorted with Molag Bal like it was nothing... For a time ALMSIVI were kings of the world with no equal.But then Dagoth wakes up and stomps on them pretty handily stealing back two of Kagrenacs tools forcing Vivec to swoop in and save Almalexia and Sotha Sil from almost certain death and he basically forced the oncemighty Tribunal to live in solitary confinement. Remember the whole Armistice thing where a weakened ALMSIVI pretty much immediately surrendered Morrowinds independence and the Numidium itself to Talos? Thank Dagoth Ur for that. ALMSIVI used virtually all of their remaining energy in maintaining the Ghostfence but even then Dagoth was able to circumvent that and was still spreading his influence. He was controlling the weather infecting dreams had hordes of loyal servants... Dagoth was kicking ass and taking names and was well on track to continue doing so until the Nerevarine showed up.Miraak got punked over by a Dragon Priest who are at the end of the day over glorified Tongues with some fancy enchanted masks and staves and only survived that encounter because he was whisked away at the last second and agreed to live in indentured servitude to a Daedric Lord. Everything Miraak did happened because Hermaeous Mora humored it. As we see at the end Hermaeous Mora couldve impaled and killed Miraak whenever he wanted but Mora was playing Miraak into his own hands because Mora saw that Miraaks antics was attracting the attention of an even more powerful Dragonborn. Mora let Miraak play his little games and continued to let Miraak think that he was on the verge of escaping and kept up the ruse until the last moment when it was clear that the Last Dragonborn was the prize that would suit Mora better. At the instant that became clear Miraak was thrown out like yesterdays garbage.Dagoth Ur was a boss who stood against gods and threatened to remake the fabric of the universe in his own solipsistic vision Miraak was a puppet who couldnt even achieve his basic goal of escaping from Oblivion.Thats also part of the reason why Im not  on board with the whole Miraak  Sharmat bit. Its an interesting theory but honestly it would just make the Sharmat look bad. Dagoth Ur was legitimately terrifying but Miraak was a scrub. If thats how far the Sharmat has fallen resorting to the likes Miraak then theres really nothing more to fear from it.,teslore,d7kzfzs,1,t5_2t5ay

Theyre going to go out of their way to at least appear like everythings business as usual. That means maintaining a presence and not shutting down their trade and infrastructure.

You have Almalexia a powerful noble from Mournhold who Nerevar marriesperhaps to legitimize himself as he might have been just a caravaneer. Sotha Sil who might have been Nerevars mentor and is a skilled mage and very well could have been a Psijic before his apotheosiswhich would make a lot of sense with the Psijics in their role of advisors. Then we are left with the glorious warrior poet. Ze is the only one whose story in the  lessons is strange. Ze is born to a common farmers wifehis father is never mentioned unless you count sermon zero. Yadayadayada he merges with a robot version of his mother. This completely skips over childhoodyoung adulthood. This is where What My Beloved Taught Me comes in it is supposedly an interview of Vehk by Nerevar himself.

He speaks with a lilting feminine voice and is usually identified as female by those who care about such things. Ulmesh sometimes manifests as a Chrysanthemum flower.Domain Ulmesh is the Prince of Hope which is the driving force behind all conscious change for good or ill. She represents the fire of hope that allows mortals and gods to strive and achieve their goals but also the temptation to take rash and foolish action. Because false hope can lead even the wise to ruin she is sometimes called the Herald of Despair a title she dislikes. Once she was Lorkhans champion and muse but she was seduced by Sheogorath and did not take part in Creation. She became a vassal of the Lord of Madness who prevents her from acting directly upon Mundus except through him. This is why hope became a rejection of reason. She strains against the divine oaths she swore to Sheogorath and helps foment the Greymarch in a bid for freedom.Realm and denizens Her realm is the Opal Spire also called the Bright Path. It is a winding marble staircase of enormous height surrounded by the darkness of Oblivion. Pilgrims ascend the stair in search of her throne which they believe to be at the summit. If any have ever reached the top none have reported back but few can ever abandon the climb once they have begun. Her servants are the Yidama fourarmed beings with alabaster skin and sapphire eyes who foretell bright futures but are incapable of anticipating bad things.

Kuru a debilitating Prion based affliction endemic to several Peloponnesian and south Pacific cultures particularly in Papua New guinea was spread in most regions through cannibalism. While not outright fatal until your s it does cause potentially debilitating spasms am d neurological damage and has led to a shorter life expectancy amongst afflicted populations.The problem is if youre looking at an infectious disease that is outright fatal rather than degenerative youd need to have a significant incubation period and a lot of initial infected. Relying on cannibalism alone would be inefficient because it would require the initial hosts to die enmasse to trigger the initial spread. If youre looking at a disease which is generationally degenerative like Kuru youd require decades or centuries for it to substantially take root but it could significantly cripple the Bosmer.

The True effects of a being like him whos been separated from its divine spark is hard to comprehend. Dead is an analogy at best. I think there is some connection to the Lunar sphere but not the literal split body. The connections to the Sumerian Ishtar are too great to ignore entirely. Also theres the Mankhar view that Nirn itself is Lorkhan.gtAnd in a way I think imperfect incarnations does Lorkhan a bit of a disservice. Hes already quite imperfect enoughFrankly I disagree imperfect could very well be a compliment especially towards Lorkhan. Ppl always see the mortality part of his sphere but Imperfection is as much a part of it. His Mundus was made so the spirits could be shown their imperfections so one might overcome them for all.gtLacking an ingame manifestation I think Id be happy to dismiss him as a Vivec metaphor or possibly some weird metaphysical echo such as Sheogorath is supposed to be.Metaphysical echo would probably be closer Seht is the missing element of the Tribunal not Vivec. A lil something from Esos Seal of the Three questgtWe are the imperfection of Sotha Sil excised from his being yet never truly apart. We measure the indulgence of inspiration against the necessities of progression. You will never know. You are not Sotha Sil.gtPerfection can never truly be attained. By testing ones consonantly degrading mechanism against this unknowable goal you reveal the imperfections of your own device. Can you accept this necessity?The Imperfects you find in the Clockwork City are often viewed as failures I dont see it that way. Sil valued imperfection and gave mechanical birth to them and the husk you find is what was left after all his imperfections were free. After all are we not the sum of all our imperfections? And his child Memory is memory itself not imperfect recollections?Seems like a tangent I went off on but consider Seht was the one who understood Lorkhans divine center better than his comrades in order to draw from it. Vivec who along with Neravar was a student of Sils also claims the Aedra too are imperfect in his lessons calling them the eight everlasting imperfectionsBut then again my thoughts on the Doom Drum are shaped by seeing him as the gifter of knowledge archetype union of both Prometheus and Bob oh wait not Bob I meant serpent in the garden fighting The Long Defeat on his gamble that only by going down to the farthest lows can your imperfections lead to something better. ps the title of the album of that gives my view on the Void Ghostgt I dont think Pelinal is an imperfect Lorkhan hes just Lorkhan at his worst.So a piece not all of him then.

Harkon also has other ways of spreading Vampirism he could use a ritual spread Sanguinus Vampiris through his blood drain or by having a servant exchange blood with a mortal.

9685022,0,t3_5drflj,To my esteemed colleague in the clevercraft JacquesEtienne DuceppeWhat a grand goal you are pursuing! I salute you in your hermetic search for knowledge for such endeavours are the worthiest of all. And while most of your assertions ring with the essence of truth there is one fundamental point your studies seem to have overseen the language that came with the Northern wave is quite different from the dialects spoken by the native peoples of the Rock.The Nedic peoples dont stem from frozen Atmora if much it could be said that Atmorans came from one of the Nedic tribes native to Tamriel and they certainly were not the only tribe. Various Nedic tribes inhabited Tamriel during the years of prosperity in Atmora all throughout what are now High Rock Cyrod Hammerfell Morrowind and even southern Skyrim lived countless different tribes of humans some subject to Elven overlords many independent.Bretonic culture is an admixture of both Direnni and Atmoran influences but also mostly of the original peoples that inhabited the region. And they werent a single tribe far from that and this aspect has been carried down in their society by their completely fractured society divided in hundreds if not thousands of subcultures all with their slight variations compared to their closest neighbours.As such I would suggest you to delve deeper into these indigenous language and dialects for they are certainly the main cause of such oddities in modernday Bretonic speech. I believe there are many archaeological sites that may yield marvellous evidences and conclusions to your research all throughout the Rock if you Bretons havent destroyed all of them in your seasonal feuds that is.Not that Nordic language cannot be traced back to a same root as both the lexical and syntactical conglomeration that are both Breton and Cyrod languages but those connections are very thin specially after the long period of isolation and independent development that each of the dialects that gave origin to these three modern ones had and may not be such a great premise to draw conclusions from.May Jhunal guide your endeavour and may you find the hidden truths you seekBrynjar the Ironbane associate of the College of Winterhold.P.S.

9730145,0,t3_5dvlf0,Primarily the reason would be it is by imperial law an open revolt. Technically in De Facto territory controlled at the start of the game it is mostly divided in two. However by the De Jure law of the land it all belongs to the empire and the Stormcloaks are usurping territory. Feudal rulers especially Empires arent just going to let territory just up and walk out without a fight. The other side of it is the simple fact as is mentioned before Ulfric is laying claim to all of Skyrim. Not just his little divide. He wants to become High King and cut off ties with the Empire. And I dont personally think its a matter of tradition in the massive distance from the interregnum and the th era in time is more than enough to explain it. Skyrim has been unified for so long the concept of it being divided would be as incomprehensible as say Texas becoming West and East Texas.

What Im trying to argue here is that Daedric Princes or any nondraconic being for that matter has  control or power over draconic essence but that doesnt necessarily mean they cant aid in the creation of draconic entities just that they cannot directly create them.

An argonian wouldnt call it a monster for an argonian this is normal. gtQueen Alessia wasnt a giant monsterher son was. gt I cant find a source saying that she WASNT a giant tentacle monster and everything else is now BATW. s Just that you are conflating two different things.For example you could argue Belharza wasnt a Minotaur because its not stated originaly that he was.Well guess what we know that Minotaurs are the offspring of el esh and morihaus thus we can conclude and since ESo it is confirmed that belharza is a minotaur.And at the same time we know that the Hist remade Argonians into better warriors. In ESO we also see the Hist remaking Argonians into Hulking forms.

9910151,0,t1_daz5x35,Something you may want to consider is the idea that Nords dont care that much about Akatosh. Akatosh is an Alessian God and preHjalti there are no Dragonborn Septims popularizing this. The early Nords had Akatusk instead. In addition Kyne is pretty much their most revered God other than Shor who takes the place of Cyrods missing God which is still in play here as Talos has not yet been made Emperor. So it only follows the everything that is the height of divinity in Skyrim would be related to Kyne just as it is in Cyrodiil with Akatosh. Relative mortal belief shapes these things and you have to really take them into account when making comparisons between all these famous figures and their gods. You do make such observations about Ysmir though.I like that the premise of Wulfharth is seeing some challenge but I think trying to look at Dragonborns as only a facet of Akatosh and needing Akatoshs intervention to have a dragon soul seems like the wrong approach at least to me.,teslore,dazbdqh,2,t5_2t5ay

From what I know of the treatment of homosexuality in Tamriel it seems to be a nonissue and widely accepted in pretty much every culture. Dibella or whatever godgoddess of love exists in the given culture operates off of a love is love policy. Hell the Temple of Dibella in Markarth is strongly implied to be staffed by lesbian priests and there are countless other instances in other games where homosexual relations are not only seen as normal and acceptable but are actually points of interest for various quests e.g. the quest in Online somewhere in Reapers March where a Bosmers husband is dying and he asks you to gather flowers for his beloveds funeral. Im not crying youre crying shut upBosmeri cannibalism however could be a huge sticking point to such a prim and proper culture like the Aldmers. I especially like the devotion to the Thalmors unassailable sense of superiority with the lines Cultural sensitivity and mutual respect does not mean accepting the barbarous traditions of the ancient past. It means understanding and empathizing with how these practices became so meaninful even as you strive to erase them. It really drove home how the Thalmor see themselves as conquerors and superior beings even where their allies are concerned.Id absolutely love to see some kind of executive order from the Thalmor discussing the use of moon sugar andor skooma in Elsweyr.If youre butthurt because you think this is making light of the current or past issues IRL with homosexuality Im going to need you to calm the fuck down.

10101902,0,t1_dbnuydk,For posterity his exact words RL Someone felt uncomfortable having a portrayal of a god in the game. Daedra Princes dont count I guess. Bethesda has always been reticent to show off a fullblown Aedra like Shor and the exceptions are already discussed in that thread. I sincerely doubt its for fear of upsetting Christians there are so many Jesus parallels to the Nerevarine and the Dark Brotherhood in Oblivion and Skyrim is explicitly inspired by Catholicism and its more about not ruining the mystery. The moment you show off your big gods in their full form and have a conversation with them they lose a little bit of their authenticity. For lack of a better word.The Daedra are kind of an exception because one of their main differences with the Aedra is how directly they meddle with Mundus and even then most Daedra you dont get to see in their full forms. Avatars of the gods are OK too as long as theyre still sufficiently mysterious.,teslore,dboah4f,5,t5_2t5ay

He stops he admits that the rebellion was about Talos and the hes seen as the man who made the Empire turn to its roots he keeps fighting and he admits the rebellion was just him seeking more power while using the Talos excuse to rally men this would cause him to lose soldiers left and right because why fight when your leader isnt what you thought he was  and his clan goes down in shame until their name are nothing more than a tale of shame and betrayal.

Another way to put it is Only after being torn down completely you can rise above. Its a theme used not only for the Dunmer but is also seen in Mankhars torturing of his acolytes to have them achieve Eternal Paradise. Bal represents the cause of all of Vivecs past trauma and tribulations prior to becoming a god and a boastful victory and source of authority post.As to the children and Azura at the Trial how I worded my thinking some time ago in the post is my stance on the metaphysical importance of Muatra as well.gtStriking with a weapon of both fetalizing will and and nurturing womb is to dominate them with the essential force of identity and to take them into yourself so they can be truely unmade. Apply it to the Pomegranate Children shed aspects of himself he had to overcome and you might be able to see it as both an outward and inward act of striking will. They are struck down changed and taken back in to where they were birthed thus unmade.gtAlso when brought against Azura at the Trial I got the sense what Vivec was doing was forcing the Daedric Prince to experience by force what it meant to be truely Mortal and it is important to realize that a key aspect of the living mortal condition is not only looming death but having been birthed as well which is the other side of the coin immortal beings cannot understand or comprehend.,teslore,dc0cb3h,16,t5_2t5ay

Dragonborn itself is a form of dracochrysalis whether being made as one or by the name implies born with the soul and blood of dragons. I dont care how many want to seprate blood and soul as different things. They are respectively interconnected if you have one then you must have the other.

And does nothing to explain why they specifically can shift and others cannot. Or how the Khajiiti origin plays into their common heritage.

It was tragic carried with it an element of hubris and explained the desperate adherence to an extremely radical lifestile. Now... what?

The Khajiit do say that Lorkhans body is indeed a moon but not Masser and Secunda but a third one the Dark Moon. The player can visit it in an ESO quest.gt Shazah Weve walked the Two Moons path the path of Jone and Jode. But there is a third moon The Dark Moon the enemy of the Khajiit. Lorkhaj the Missing God. This is the secret at the end of the Path...we must travel to the Den of Lorkhaj.gt Vestige Its going to be that bad?gt Shazah It gets worse. Legend says that the Missing God is dead. That the Den  it is his body. The great emptiness of the Den is the decaying corpse of a dead god.As for the Lunar Lattice I dont understand. Nirn? Daedra leaving creation? Until now Ive been under the impression that it was the sphere of a singular Khajiit deity JaKhajay.gt What does that mean? Set M. and S. aright? Who is they? the Khajiit or the moons? Fail to do what?The writing in UESP is certainly a bit confusing they is the moons Masser and Secunda. Check the original source Words of Clan Mother Ahnissigt And Fadomai said The Khajiit must be the best climbers for if Masser and Secunda fail they must climb Khenarthis breath to set the moons back in their courses.That part has always reminded me of the Void Nights as described in Skyrim.

AuriEl is the closest to manhating Aka ever got and he never sought to free himself. Personally I think he realized he couldnt get all that power back and eventually came to embrace the mortal realm as a fantastic thing in one way or another. He couldve easily been convinced by other Aedra after all Kyne and Dibella took sides with Shor. Also Magnus regrets leaving Mundus and built a library in the Sun to tend to the Scrolls.

One is a strong leader and the other is a smart scholar.gtIn the nd era Cyrodiil was supposed to be a rain forest before Tiber Septim came in. but in ESO it looks like it did in oblivion.Do you think that a god would only change the future? gtThe invasion of Molag Bal was never mentioned in any book or dialogue in any other game. despite the fact that it SHOULD. They just basically made up some shit and went with it. As a result people put ESO in a dragonbreak and say it doesnt have anything to do with the main timeline.You have to remember theres pretty much two wars going on during this time The Alliances versus each other versus Molag Bal. Additionally according to my head canon Tameriel will eventually end up how it is in Daggerfall the game making the war and wartime suffering worse. During these times very little people are likely to be recording the events that are happening and those records that are made are likely to be lost.gtThe Alliances make no sense. The Dunmer have been enslaving the Argonians for thousands of years and the Nords have been constantly trying to take the land of Morrowind for centuries. These  provinces teaming up makes no sense. Orcs also have been treated for thousands of years like beasts and mongrels by EVERYONE in the empire and yet the Daggerfall Covenent suddenly accepts them into their ranks only to treat them like dogs again once ESO is over.With my head canon the Ebonheart Pact was the last to form this created a sense of forming out of necessity for the Nords Dunmer and Argonians. Additional like you said the Nords have problems with the Dunmer the Dunmer have problems with the Argonians. I believe that the Nords offered an invitation tot he Pact to both the Dunmer and the Argonians causing the Argonians to join quickly and forcing the Dunmer to join to protect themselves from a NordArgonian army.With the orc problem its like you said they are beasts and mongrels.

11007479,0,t1_deflhwx,There is no telling who she is referring to right here though I can think of several people off the top of my head who Maven would want dead as well as consider dangerous enough to warrant hiring the Dark Brotherhood.My first guess would be Sibbis missing fianc Svidi. Her disappearance was recent enough to match up with when Maven performed the ritual both shortly before the game begins. She is missing meaning that a professional assassin would be needed to locate her. And she poses a threat to the family having witnessed what theyre capable of as well as having a personal reason to despise them Sibbi killed her brother. Moreover it isnt in the nature of successful crime lords like Maven to leave loose ends. She had Sibbi arrested for what he did meaning that she herself wanted to take control over the situation. Seems logical to me that her next step would be to have Svidi killed discreetly.Another candidate would be Aringoth over at Goldenglow Estate. When spoken to he directly states that hed always known that Maven and Mercer would not let him get away with what hed done. Mercers agent the player character ultimately gets there first but it seems likely that Maven wouldve eventually had someone deal with Aringoth if we hadnt.Lastly and most broadly it could be someone in Cyrodiil. She has numerous contacts down there and one backstab or double dealing could result in her seeking revenge. Unfortunately hundreds of miles and mountains make sending conventional thugs to deal with these folks rather difficult. That would explain the use of the Dark Brotherhood.As for why Maven wouldnt use the Dragonborn or some other killer well frankly she has no reason to trust them. The Thieves Guildmaster Dragonborn may be a thief but she doesnt know if theyre capable of true cold blooded murder. Same goes for most sellswords. And as the note suggests she may very well resort to a different assassinmercenary if the Dark Brotherhood continues to ignore or more likely not hear her requests.,teslore,defo0pf,5,t5_2t5ay

While the information is scant to say the least Dagoth Urs attempt to create a second one within the very same halls while somewhat visually unique is the only real marker we have for the process and it shows that its likely to have been built around the Heart of Lorkhan. Its also highly unlikely that the Dunmer would have endeavoured to finish construction of the Numidium after the battle especially with the newly ascendant Tribunal covering up the secret to their power. So we can assume that the Numidium was complete at the time.Its also reasonable to assume Kagrenac wasnt trying to do what the Nerevarine did as that sequence of strikes was to unbind the Heart which would have done the Dwemer no good. We cant be entirely certain what he intended but Destroy my lifes work seems a stretch especially since he had started a war over it.

Cause and effect are not separate they are a single event regardless of the duration between the events denser nodes.

She boils down to jealously hating the Tribunal and wanting them gone thats it.I do believe the Tribunal had the best of intentions problematic as heck but they meant well and in the end knowing he was going to lose his divinity and likely even die I dont think Vivec had any reason to lie about his sincere love for the people of Morrowind wanting to be gods who truly cared about the people unlike the daedra and his regrets about everything that happened. Azura in her vanity clearly did not appreciate being cast aside for better gods. So no matter the consequences to the Dunmer people the Tribunal had to be defeated and she had to be their god again. Shes not good. Shes not even a good villain honestly. Flat dull. My least favourite daedric prince for sure.In summary though what Morrowind does so well is have a mix of characters that are neither completely good nor completely bad even the main antagonist  theyre just real.

In the ES universe magic is a powerful force and common enough that even most peasants are likely to have at least some tangential encounter with it in their lifetimes and the world can be reshaped on a whim. Obviously a Briarhearts heart isnt replaced by a briar through mythopoeia  its entirely too small a scale. We do however know that Hagravens have powerful magic at their disposal. Also relevant is the Dwemer race. They realized that the world was imperfect and inconsistent which is what lead to WalkBrass  their attempt to escape the Dream.

The Order of the Black Worm Worm Cult serves Mannimarco primarily who sought to become a god himself.

The general goal of the Worm Cult was to make necromancy as accepteddominant in Tamriel as possible both to increase their own power and to aid their master Mannimarco.
