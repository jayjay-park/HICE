5682628,0,t3_3sye8x,Incredible end to the show.Id been down the middle with a lot of the matches as I wasnt emotionally invested but when it came to the main event I was a mark again.Logic dictated that the face who has been built for a year should go over at the biggest event of the year but you never know for sure. As soon as that bell rang I was praying for a Grado victory.As the match came to a close I could have been in a room with  person or a million people and I wouldnt have noticed. I was into that I wasnt paying attention to the other  people around me.Near falls that werent even that near had me jumping up and down the RKO had me chanting Holy Shit and when Foley came out  I turned to my friend and said This is it. Grado is going over and when he did it was like watching Daniel Bryan beat Orton and Batista at WM all over again.I jumped up I cheered I ran into the crowd to get a closer picture and it was amazing. Simply the best ending they could have went with.And the match itself sure it had a couple of rough spots but it did everything it was meant to do.It showed Grado taking shit seriously showed the darker side of Galloway. It was brutal it was exciting there were no slow moments I was hooked from the opening of Grados music right until they turned the house lights on. maybe not by Meltzers standard but to me it was the match of the year so far.,ICW,cx1hhrd,7,t5_2ufn7

I was pretty surprised by Ravie Davie I honestly thought he was going go to be crap but he was actually better than expected ,ICW,d2gehfc,3,t5_2ufn7
