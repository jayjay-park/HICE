2743440,0,t1_cnfon1z,I only have studied San Soo so I am not qualified to say San Soo is the greatest martial art.  However its the greatest for me.  From my continued study one principle behind the art is to flow and continue meaning that you should adapt to the situation as it changes and keep attacking.  As Ive spent time within the art Ive found that within the fight it becomes a chess game that you feel.  Learning where the opponent is off balance or week and changing your approachtechniquestancestrikehold to get the advantage.So in the instance you mention having counter strategies for a throat strike we should always assume our opponent is always better then us. So if my first strike doesnt phase the opponent or I miss or they dont react to the strike as I expect I would keep the attack going and flow into a new opportunity that presents itself at that moment. So lets say I hit him and it doesnt phase him kicking out his knee or gouging his eye might be a solution depending on the nature of the fight San Soo is street fighting so dont do it unless there are no alternatives.,SanSoo,cnfx1n9,2,t5_31hs9
