The  is the best though theyre typically always faster than the AMD top of the line equivalent.

If you do a search on ebay for s check the box on the left that says  Sold listings then sort by End Date recent first to get a good idea of what they are actually selling for. Ebay s look like they are closing for anywhere between  and  now assuming that you manage to close at the high end with  after ebay buttfucking you with fees youll only clear about  all said and done. Its almost worth the hit to sell it on here for a bit less rather than to let ebay pocket gt off of you.Quick sell on here if you price it  but you might get more if youre patient and list it on the Amazon marketplace and undercut some of the obscene prices of the used cards The lowest price for a PowerColor  as of this posting is  I doubt youd sell for one for anywhere near that even on ebay before fees.

Im guessing another few months the ASICs combined with those not using their rigs as heaters anymore will start to unload them pretty good.  More likely when the asics start shipping and the difficulty of mining begins to skyrocket.     Ill also say that KnC has a VERY strong reputation with the Bitcoin asics they put out over the last several months.

1297339,0,t3_28xrzf,Welp maybe I can help. This is a very ghetto method that you can try if you have no styrofoam or original box.Get A large box lots of tape something to cut the carton hopefully sharp bubble wrap and that cheap brown paper used for shipping. So you have two choices tell them its a monitor and might be charged and extra free or expensive insurance. Since we are all frugal here then this is something I would consider doing.Assuming you are shipping a  monitor cut these pieces in carton pieces of  x depends on monitors height   x   depends on monitors thickness  x Stack  and  of the big pieces and tape them together to protect the monitor from sharp edge boxes and such that could impact in the middle of the screen or back. You could skip the back. Wrap the monitor in bubble wrap to protect edges and screen from scratching although try to look for something better this is guetto remember Wrap the whole monitor with a lot of the wrapping paper and you want it to be a little loose but not too much. complete the box and tape everything. I estimate  pounds of shipping materials  your monitor  cables. Total around  bucks minimum. Put fragile signs saying dont drop and dont stack with your screen facing up sometimes if there is a picture of a screen in the box the mailman will be more considerate.The nicer you pack it the better your buyer will feel.You can also carve down some styrofoam that you can get cheap at a hobby store.This is why I keep a reasonable amount of shipping materials from my orders that shit gets expensive if bought at retail.,hardwareswap,cifkfsp,1,t5_2skrs

2174443,0,t1_clg6t0v,I ordered the XFX on March th .  Both cards have been mining crypto .  I overclocked the core on the XFX to MHz to match the other card and also undervolted it a bit.  Stock voltage was .v it mined at .v.  I never tried to see how high it would go but based on overclocking and undervolting with great temps I assume it would be a good overclocker.  At  load temps are usually between  and C with the fans at full speed.

2183987,0,t3_2k2tcx,i work with computer hardware since  and not using any ot these things when its cold outside and the air is dry thats when it gets more dangerous with ESD but i used to touch a large metal object that is grounded and then started to work with the hardware. I didnt had any computer part fail in that process or afterwards. Hardware that is produced today is more resistant that it was back then in the s. I wouldnt worry about it so much its overreacting.Much more dangerous is running a computer hardware that was just shipped and opened and put in the machine without letting it ease to the room temperature and humidity very important for used hardware since its probably not in the esd bag from factory instead its wrapped in some paper and shipped in cardboard box that is an insulator but a very good sponge for humidity.Peace out. ,hardwareswap,clhfrqp,2,t5_2skrs

2391530,0,t1_cm79mu0,gtI like that winky face at the end somehow implying that your response wasnt aggressive.Its only aggressive if you take it so mate  I tend to use a lot of smilies in my post. If youre a quasireligious fanatic who cannot take criticism my post is aggressive in the sense that it contradicts your beliefs. If youre just a PC enthusiast like me who enjoys being a hardware nerd you shouldnt take it so at all a discussion of hardware shouldnt become emotional unless you have an unhealthy obsession with hardware that goes beyond purely dry facts of hardware specs. gtI helped my brother throw together a build with an apu and an r  that can run almost any game on high and still get  fps.Thats rBestOfBaPC material there heh. Do you think the XB has a magical consoles are shit switch that makes it perform magically below its hardware and  firmware characteristics?gt I dont understand how you might think PCs arent accessible if you work in IT. Ask ANY IT support tech about how they view people and PCs. Every one of them will be pessimistic. Computers are like cars theyre easy if you know what youre doing they seem really easy if you grew up tinkering with them but to everyone else theyre magic mystery boxes. PCMR is a very toxic reddit circlejerk that began as funny satire but turned into a toxic teenage forum for people with an illusory sense of superiority little person to person interaction and a total lack of perspective insofar as understanding other people in general. The fact is that most people arent great with PCs and neither are you for that matter quite likely the more you work with PCs the more you learn but also the more you see of bizarre issues that just show how fickle computers can be. I would not recommend a gaming PC to anyone who isnt good with computers. Believe me I made a lot of PCs for friends but after much experience I came to the conclusion that for most people consoles are a much better form of gaming. gtTheres nothing wrong with it but for the money there are far greater performance possibilities on PC. This is a fact.Youre comparing PC you build yourself to a prebuilt finished machine with support. If you want to have an equal comparison compare prebuilt PCs to consoles. People who do DIY will make their own PCs but  of people will want a finished product either because they arent comfortable building a PC or value their time more than the PCMR community the majority of which btw is under  according to their own surveys as of late. Why is it that PCMR cant keep its own interests to itself? Reddit makes fun of anyone who tries to convert others to their cause vegans feminists religious people but PCMR is somehow OK? Its not OK its annoying. If your friend wants to build his own PC by all means help him. But on PCMR I hear a lot of brothers help me convert a peasant I know.

3590473,0,t1_cq1j9wq,Well the Dell just hasnt held up in the build quality department. The damage I mentioned all happened within the space of a month where my very first laptop a thinkpad t is still kicking with little physical damage after  years and loads of abuse. I try to take really good care of my laptops but for me build quality comes first even if I loose a little RAM and a few CPU cycles in the proccess. Plus all I do is shitpost on internet forums and program so I dont need great specs anyways.For example the t went with me everywhere for  years straight was dropped times acted as a monitor stand for a very heavy flatpanel for many more then sat under a TV and streamed anime to my tv up until a few weeks ago when I replaced it with a dedicated streamign box. I stuck the Dell in my backpack one one my way to school one day and it went from mint condition to where it is now.,hardwareswap,cq1ji6a,1,t5_2skrs

But a lot of listings just call it a Latitude Slice Battery. You need the  compatible one. You may just benefit more from a  or  cell extended primary battery. It will be cheaper and you can swap them out when they die. The slice battery costs basically the same as three extended primary batteries or  standard primary batteries.

The correct analogy would be you saying These look suspicious and the watch seller saying its cool I understand which the seller in this case actually told uSpynjess he didnt have a problem with it with the mods being a passerby yelling at you because you were being mean for simply voicing concern despite you nor the watch seller having an issue between the two of you. Having someone call you a jerk especially a mod for something neither direct party had a problem with is not how you handle this situation nor give advice on how to talk nicer to someone.

5556650,0,t1_cwl7p3r,I would say this build is going to be your best bet for that price. Literally if you had to replace half the stuff in this it would still be under your budget with good parts.But I can give you the lowdown on why I planned this build as I did...The Naze is a wellknown flight controller that many use plus its cheap. Its considered the best for its price. The ESCs for each motor are Afro A. Its a good brand they arent noname. Dont skimp out on your ESCs. I went with A ESCs because the biggest voltage battery I have is S which is what A ESCs handle well. If you go with a more powerful battery youll need higher amp ESCsThe motors are EMax ones I got from Amazon because I didnt want to wait  weeks for HobbyKing to deliver them. Theyre OK but can be destroyed on installation by tightening the screws too much beware!Props are  meaning a  degree pitch and  inches long. Theyre cheap and by god youre going to need a LOT of props. The frame is a ZMR a very common beginners racing frame. Its carbon fiber and designed well. Ive flown straight into a tree at about MPH and after replacing the props she still flies fine. Not even a scratch on the front can send more pics if you want. I should have gone with a PDB but didnt need one for this basic racer as I didnt need FPV yet. Saved some cash but I would recommend getting one if you plan on doing FPV in the future. The Turnigy x is an amazing controller and its what many starting the hobby use until they can upgrade to a FrSky controller. The battery charger is very nice and a worthy investment. You can get cheaper batteries but you do NOT want to skimp on a charger that could very easily blow your LiPo. This one is absolutely perfect and will keep your batteries in good health. It takes a w mPower cord which is also listed in the sheets page. There isnt much more than that. If you want Id be willing to part out some. Maybe if you want the Frame ESCs Motors Props Controller Batteries and charger ie all except the Naze and the Reciever you just need to order those  parts and youre ready to fly. ,hardwareswap,cwluqjg,1,t5_2skrs

5593176,0,t3_3rq320,A case is about  to ship within the US alone a monitor is about .  You can usually pickup these locally for their shipping prices...  For my friends PC i built we got a  mid tower from Frys and a  x monitor from craigslist.  Let him buy these locally.As for the rest if you can manage to just gift it to him please do this.  When I built my friends PC it really put a strain on our friendship and sometimes he wasnt able to make payments and I wanted to keep him as a friend...  I ended up just absolving him of the debt by switching out his  X build for a  AM one that I picked up after I built his.  The tradeoff in CPU performance was significant as well as futureproofness but gaming performance for the time being was close to the same on nonAAA titles.,hardwareswap,cwqdwlq,1,t5_2skrs

5665007,0,t1_cwyvrs5,Oh I forgot about that last time I heard about it it wasnt out yet. Not entirely sure actually I cant find any benchmarks comparing the two. The X and  seem to be pretty evenly matched both having the same core  and core clock but the X does have a decent amount more stream processors. The  has better VRAM though so in scenarios requiring core power the X is better but requiring VRAM the  is better. Of course any scenario requiring more than GB of VRAM will be much better on the . Also the X may have more clock headroom with its AIO cooler. You could be right but in any case the Fury X will sweep away both and should be out soon. ,hardwareswap,cwzas8k,1,t5_2skrs

5703592,0,t1_cx42jba,There is no card on the planet that is going to demand a kw PSU for OC unless you are doing hard mods with zombie boardsadditional VRMs and doing LN runs. CPU overclocking isnt going to pile up the wattage to warrant the PSU either. Platinum efficiency can be had at nearly every wattage. Just an FYI by all means do what you want. Im just saying if you can save  going with a w PSU you could jump up to a more powerful GPU or CPU still overclock and end up with much better performance. ,hardwareswap,cx4346i,1,t5_2skrs

5822269,0,t3_3b1gdw,Hey not sure if youre interested but I have the QNIX  p that you can check out hereIf youre interested in doing a swap or something like that just let me know.  Ive been looking into getting a BenQ for my FPS gameplay and wont really need a  p monitor as a secondary so if I can knock  birds out with  stone that would be excellent.  So if youre interested just let me know and we can try and work something out and Id be happy to answer any questions you have about the panel or send you any pictures of anything youd like to see.EDIT I have also successfully overclocked this panel with no issues whatsoever.  This monitor looks amazing for games like Arma  Fallout  etc and the colors are amazing right out of the box.  I do photography on the side so that was a very big deal for me and like I mentioned before if you would like to see any pics of the panel or anything like that just let me know and Id be happy to send them over.,hardwareswap,cxitoyk,1,t5_2skrs

5868916,0,t1_cxoxo7z,Yea I actually think youll have better luck on the forums just due to the fact that audience is slightly different theres a lot of overlap but I think those that bother to make accounts on overclock.net or anandtech or wherever tend to tinker with their machines more whereas hardwareswap is more open to everyone who wants deals on computer parts at least this is my impression.

5972025,0,t1_cy2f3i5,RAM is RAM.  Brand what its for who made all does not really matter since it all functions the same.  If your server can take Dual rank GB ECC RDIMMs then all the buyer cares about is price because the brand and all is insignificant and all that matters is the price because all dual rank GB ECC RDIMMs will function the same if your server can use dual rank GB ECC RDIMMs.  The listing you refer to has been relisted several times and has been up for  months.  You are severely overestimating what its worth based on what you paid and based on a listing for a like item on ebay when you have to realize that RAM works or it doesnt and who made it or what it was originally for makes no difference to the buyer because all a buyer cares about is price and if it will work.  That  listing I pointed to has sold over  sticks.  If you look at the seller of the listing you linked to he has sold zero sticks of that ram.  He has several listed.  When people search for server RAM on ebay they sort by lowest price and only care about if it will work and how cheap is it.  Here on HWS its even worse since we also kind of look for a price maybe even a bit lower than ebay.  GLWS but you wont sell any at that price when you can get it on ebay for rd of what you are charging.  ,hardwareswap,cy2gp2e,2,t5_2skrs

6691816,0,t3_47ae8v,Im not going to claim to be an expert here but I dont see any reason why that HX wouldnt power the Fury just fine. Requirement is W max draw in this test is W. That would leave you with just shy of W of headroom for the rest of the system. Based on the chart here looks like you CPU is maybe pulling a bit over W at load. Add in the rest of the system and I wouldnt expect you to cross W total. Now I could be totally wrong. But I dont think lack of power is your problem. Now we wait for someone to kindly correct me and point out a flaw in my approach or some bad assumptions here .Edit as pointed out by uSongodan the problem is probably driver related.,hardwareswap,d0bhqi4,1,t5_2skrs

6696852,0,t1_d0c048x,Ebay is really high youre absolutely right. Ebay is a last resort. Id rather sell something for a  surcharge and give someone a deal here rather than deal with those crooks. Overclock.net has a decent marketplace much smaller than reddit though but you have to earn your way into being able to sell there. You have to get  iirc reps which is to say you have to contribute to the forum in other areas and be helpful to your fellow members. It can be frustrating when youre trying to get to  but it discourages people who might just be there to sell stuff. I have more than  confirmed transactions there and have never had a problem. Hard Forum has a good marketplace too. Ive always found that pre built rigs and laptops sell best on craigslist. It can be kinda grimy and sketchy but if you word your ad well and really harp on why your laptop is so badass and take some good pictures it can work out well for you. The craigslist community is just generally much more apt to overpay than the people here who really know their hardware for the most part. Lots of time wasting tire kickers on craigslist but if youre determined it will sell eventually. ,hardwareswap,d0c0gfk,1,t5_2skrs

Lol man dont just make that up yourself and assume it applies for everyone here. OP did say he refunded you to full amount. Thats fair and square. Its his stuffs and heck he can sell it to whoever he wants. If the other guys is local and selling the stuffs to him can save OPs time and hassle of shipping hes obligated to commit to you to any extent as long as he refunded you full amount.

Xeons usually have much higher price to performance in the used market. You can get  cores on Sandy bridge for  bucks although you need to find an x board. Or there are the super cheap lga  xeons. You can mod a  board to take those xeons. ,hardwareswap,d1wihcs,0,t5_2skrs

So dont be afraid to sell it for parts if you dont want to fuck with fixing it but heres what I did when I got that error on my old phone...Error  is firmware related. Should be fixable. Have you tried restoring it? I had this error before a long time ago and iTunes couldnt seem to restore the phone.

Until I see actual nonvaporware titles that utilizeneed it the whole async compute thing is secondary to how much actual performance Avg FPS Frame latency can I get out of x gpu.Your prerogatives may be different from mine but I stopped buying into future hype with AMD.

7784621,0,t1_d3r0xgm,Sure thing. The cooler is a US and I would definitely be sure to get the second fan if you go that route. I didnt think having the CPU intake right above a hot GPU would be good but it ended up giving me better results in the pushpull config. Because the GPU and floor fans blow upward I think the CPU is recycling that hot air and would benefit significantly from the air being contained by a blower style GPU. Thus far Ive only played Witcher  at x fps so keep in mind itll vary by game and monitor.Depending on the fan settings Id get  on the CPU and a pretty consistent  on the GPU. I know these are acceptable temps but Im kind of OCD about having my stuff run comfortably. If you look through my history youll see someone mentioned high s is the cut off point for safe temps. Plus the floor fans are much louder than the CPU fans so if I could ditch one or even both thatd be nice as well. ,hardwareswap,d3r1ols,1,t5_2skrs

8009659,0,t1_d4clj16,MicroCenter is a good example of a distributor with generally widespread locations across the United States at least and it proves a point by offering new processors for a very low price and open boxes for even lower. If you care about the tax you can always go to a state with minimal sales tax. Mainstream sellers are compromising on price. A couple hour drive is also not the equivalent to China...If youre interested in getting a good price then youll go find it at a local seller or online. If not cry about it and pay more. Its not our problem if people cant go find a deal for themselves. Things like this are just another excuse.,hardwareswap,d4gczzh,1,t5_2skrs

10515140,0,t3_5qjj9p,I have a couple theories. You see I had this z and an i that I decided to trade a friend for his z and i because of the msata and i had a tb one.  We swapped hardware and because the orientation of the boards were different in his custom case a lead fell off the power button and dragged across the board while it was on. It shut off never to boot again. Upon further inspection I also found a transistor like youd find on CPU embedded in the padding on the CPU cooling bracket. Strangest thing. So it also could have been shorted out from that. I was thinking of doing the bake I just never have gotten around to it. I have him his board back apologized and we moved on. ,hardwareswap,dd0056u,1,t5_2skrs

Plus at the mid oerformance tier such as the rx you might as well get a p freesync monitor that those cards can power so nvidia and paying for gsync frankly doesnt make sense. I think this is common sense to the common redditor here didnt think I needed evidence. What are you trying to argue? What is your point? So what if newegg had a new  for ? Would you buy it?? Would you expect anybody to buy it? Is that its value? Or would you just buy a  and a couple games for the same price? Ill dumb it down in one statement performance dictates price this post underperforms at that asking price. It only communicates greed.

I just thought you might like to go check it out as they have more lenient rules than rgamesale.All I ask is that you read their posting rules and follow the proper format before posting.For instance for different items you can post once every  hours as opposed to the  hours on gamesale.Thanks and happy swapping!,hardwareswap,deq8rri,2,t5_2skrs
