2596090,0,t3_2pipa1,Really interesting! Ive put together a similar library  for my frist year students which somehow forced me to use italian for the documentation and method names. My library is less complete fewer musical objects can be modeled with it but it can actually play some music using the default javax.sound.midi package.It would be nice to consider the possibility to merge the two efforts.,coolgithubprojects,cmxg2bz,2,t5_31g1m

3187748,0,t1_cos6ite,Well I cant prove that it isnt safe. Until someone more experienced that me can decide whether its implementation is secure or not its safe to assume that the generator is secure. The readme statesgt Please bear in mind that deterministicpwgen is a young piece of software. It may contain unintentional flaws that compromise the security of your passwords. We would recommend using deterministicpwgen for lowpriorityexperimental purposes until it receives a proper audit from someone more experienced in the security field.,coolgithubprojects,coserzb,1,t5_31g1m

For instance you want to add support for searching by timestamp but only you have the knowledge of how diary entries are stored so for anyone else its just guess work Itd be good if you could atleast put the output of a DESCRIBE statement in the repo.,coolgithubprojects,czjl3hp,1,t5_31g1m
