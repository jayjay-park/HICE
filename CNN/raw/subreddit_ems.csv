14240,0,t3_1ua7bx,Yeah I feel like carrying any more than gloves and and a first aid kit is a little overboard. The only reason anyone on our department has personal jump bags is because we had a bridge out a couple years back and response times to the far side of the bridge could be as much as  minutes of travel. A few of our people lived on the far side of the bridge so they were given full jump kits. After the bridge was back they just decided to hold on to them. I dont plan on stopping at a car accident and doing much more than stopping major bleeding and making sure an ambulance is on the way but I suppose thats just me. ,ems,ceg20df,5,t5_2rmg0

As for price I cant speak for PA but mine was around  so expect anywhere from  this is for the EMTb basic. They are about  hours probably a little more. Paramedics can offer a higher level of care so there program are much longer and in depth. But they usually cost upwards  dollars give. I dont know as much about the costs associated with them.

What are the qualifications?You can probably forget about Chicago unless youre related to a Chitown firefighter.For the burbs you can either pick a department and ask them at which point theyll probably say Were not hiring right now but when we do well list the selection criteria when the selection process begins or you can look for open positions check websites indeed.com for example and see if you meet those criteria. I have no idea how it works in Chicago. Round here they require EMT. Some SoCal departments are requiring paramedic. Most want nothing more than a HS diploma in terms of education. More may help you it may not.What normally happens is you sign up to take a test. Sometimes they limit the number of people who can take the test due to overwhelming popularity large departments. They may ask to see credentials to get in to see the test EMT diploma etc.. Tests are usually math verbal engineeringlogicpersonality inventory that sort of thing.You take the test and therell be a waiting period. If you meet whatever bar they set Were going to interview everyone that did better than X you go in for the first interview. Suit and tie. You will be required to answer questions that have no good answer the panel usually  firefighters or similar will gauge your responses.If you manage to pass that you will probably have a second interview. This will involve higher brass asking you questions. If you pass that you get to the academy provided you can pass a physical exam.Somewhere in there before the written test before the interview before the hiring you will probably have a physical test or be required to show proof of the CPAT.It all depends. Every department is different different parts of the country are different departments can change over time its not always the same recruitment process every time they hire and you may be put on a pick list that is good for months even years. It can take a very long time to get hired on.

717246,0,t1_cglqtx6,Thats a pretty cynical and piss poor attitude to have towards your EMTs. Stretcher jockey and Carry shit and drive is all they do? That is heavily based on what the service allows the EMTs to do the environment management sets for EMTs and how the other workers paramedics like you encourage and involve them so they can develop themselves. I worked primarily IFTs for two years and I can think of just a few things I gained like assessment skills exposure to the health care system exposure to medications and uses patient interviewing and communication and basic equipment use on the ambulance. Id argue those count for something if youre trying to decide if EMS is for you before dumping money into a twoyear degree. EVERYONE develops bad habits in one way or another and if youve FTOed medics then Im sure youve seen bad habits they gained from school without ever working as an EMT. The bad habits you see could also be because people have different ways of doing things then you would do them.Im not saying there arent crummy EMTs but there are also some pretty crummy medics too so I dont think you should be so harsh on your EMTs. They likely pursued certification for the same reason you did and are trying to get their foot in the door. Id hope you dont treat EMTs in your service as you seem to talk about them here on Reddit because as an EMT Id hate to work with paramedics that see my job and the experience I gained from the job as bullshit and pointless.,ems,cglsymp,21,t5_2rmg0

756406,0,t3_22t5w3,Think about the anatomy and the position you spend all your awake time in. The diaphragm is shaped like an upside down bowl. When you breath in it flattens out and gravity helps. With that said lets think of different situations. Obesity If you are supine the diaphragm has to push all the body mass from the abdomen out of the way in addition to the extra weight on top of the chest. It makes it hard to breath. CHF If you are supine all the extra fluid on the lungs spreads out over a greater surface area and causes less  to cross over in the alveoli  that are filled with fluid. COPD The lungs are often hyper or hypoinflated from the chronic disease. These patients already have difficulty ventilating themselves. Some may use accessory muscles as a baseline. They often tripod for positioning. Asthma A Neb treatment will really do them the most good however a few points from above apply. Trauma Shallow breaths move less air so less O is available to exchange. Lots of times anxiety and the general situation causes you to use more O. If you backboard someone you are placing them in a less than ideal position to breath so it complicates things. For other situations just put together good positioning and supplemental O as needed based off the patients SpO. ,ems,cgq9dfn,4,t5_2rmg0

1257136,0,t1_cib1a6b,If you have mechanical capture that means the heart is beating with the external pacemaker now controlling rate instead of the hearts conduction system.  If its beating strong enough to generate a palpable pulse than yes its much better than CPR.  If you cant palpate a pulse than you in the field cant really say you have mechanical capture and thus CPR continues.  In the hospital with dopplers and art lines we could get mechanical capture with a lower pressure and then treat with pressors and other meds but thats likely not gonna yield a great outcome.Now it may in the long run be worse for the heart tissue as its now being forced to beat thus increasing myocardial oxygen demand with maybe only a small increase in perfusion so you may be making the underlying ischemia if present even worse.  However worse than a bigger MI is death which you have during CPR so its not a huge deal.  Until you unnecessarily start increasing the rate at least.,ems,cib1jtc,2,t5_2rmg0

1479102,0,t3_2b4bpe,There seems to be two main opinions on what constitutes a save. The first group of people will tell you that getting ROSC counts as a save and theyll start patting themselves on the back about a job well done and how theyve finally run a call that legitimately matters. Hey man we got their heart started again and gave them the best chance we could. Theres nothing more we could have done its out of our hands now. This is a very understandable view. So much of what we deal is either complete bullshit or terribly sad and its important to hang onto the little victories or the big ones as it may be. I think that people who hold this view do it more for their own mental health and well being than anything.Personally I dont agree with that. As far as Im concerned a genuine legit save is when the patient is discharged from the hospital and goes on to lead a somewhat normal life afterwards. If  you get ROSC but then they spend a few weeks in the ICU as a vegetable...sorry but you didnt save shit. Ive had a handful of ROSCs but only one real save that Im aware of and I will cherish that memory for as long as I live. I was so incredibly proud when I found out they were discharged and went home and even more so when we got word that they were doing okay. You see enough dead people and its extra special when one of them actually wakes up again.As far as your call goes dont feel guilty. Theres nothing wrong with wanting to save lives. I would advise you follow up on the patient if possible though try not to get your hopes up. I did that once with a ped and it hurt beyond words when I learned they didnt make it. And finally why do we consider saves special when were just doing our job? Because our job is not an ordinary one and even though it sometimes feels like were going through the motions we really do make a difference at times.Congrats on the save...just dont get cocky.,ems,cj1ojb7,9,t5_2rmg0

1936342,0,t1_ckmf9yf,Thank you. What Im most afraid of really is the instructor not believing me. My partner saw the whole thing and asked if I was okay after I sort of started shaking but telling my instructor that some random volunteer firefighter grabbed my groin and groped around my crotch is going to be one embarrassing and two isolating. I know that those arent correct reactions to an action like this to be embarrassed about describing my humiliating and uncomfortable experience to someone but Im just incredibly shy and a bit shell shocked from the ordeal. Im still dazed. I dont want to create any drama or get negative attention but my participation in the activity was extremely poor afterwards and I stayed at my desk instead of going around the room to take everyones blood pressure like we were supposed to be doing and then I left  minutes early. I just NEEDED to get out of there and now the instructor probably thinks Im a slack off and I dont take it seriously or respect his time. Which I do and hes very kind and a terrific instructor. I was already nervous about touching strangers and it went from touching my desk partners wrist to some stranger stuffing his hand between my legs... Zero to wtf in  seconds. If this had happened on the subway or bus I would have screamed but this guy was supposed to be teaching us. So I thought if I reacted I would have looked like a fool. I dont know Im rambling.

My class initially had a very competitive attitude but once we got deep into pathophys and pharm we all decided to put away the testosterone and help each other out.We had a great dynamic in that we took it upon ourselves as a class to make sure everyone passed. It was a point of pride since our instructors told us about the rate of attrition. Study groups email and text chains etc..Get to know your classmates you will be going through hell together.For didacticObviously you will need to study and spend a lot of time in seclusion in order to fully comprehend. I found that after a long day in class a beer or cup of coffee and a quiet place to just read my notes and text was effective. Read your books ahead of time and ask questions.For clinicalsGet to know the nurses!I worked nights where a lot of the nurses were fairly new and eager to teach and let you practice.Get to know the doctors!Most ER docs want to teach and learn and if you can demonstrate that you are an eager student they will go out of their way to hook you up. I got to do some Needle Ts Chrics and high risk airway treatments because I was warm and willing to do the BS eager to learn and ask questions while not being a nuisance.For internshipKnow your protocols inside and out.Get to know your drug box. Whether it is an ambulance or a fire engine make sure you know where everything is.I have seen many preceptors with the attitude of internship is to prove your worth not a learning experience. That is complete hogwash.Ask questions play with equipment ask for legit feedback. My preceptor was very tough on me but was also a fair unbiased source of feedback. He told me flat out that he has nothing to lose or gain by taking me on.

BCG vaccination may cause a falsepositive reaction to the TST which may complicate decisions about prescribing treatment. The presence or size of a TST reaction in persons who have been vaccinated with BCG does not predict whether BCG will provide any protection against TB disease. Furthermore the size of a TST reaction in a BCGvaccinated person is not a factor in determining whether the reaction is caused by LTBI or the prior BCG vaccination.

2330568,0,t1_clzmglz,Actually the two companies mentioned above SeniorCare and Transcare both have  divisions. NYC EMS is strange. You have two main divisions the FDNY Municipal Units and the Hospitals also referred to as the Voluntaries. The FDNY runs the game they maintain the system they dispatch the jobs they establish the rules and guidelines. If youre looking for a long term career in EMS they should be your goal. But if youre looking for the short term and planning to move on to a different field in the future I would suggest the hospitals. Hospitals units have existed since they s. They are dispatched just like the municipal units utilize the same system and everything the only difference is our paycheck is covered by the hospital as are our internal rules and regulations. NOW stick with me the hospitals themselves are divided. You have two or three divisions depending on how you look at it. You have the hospitals that maintain their own units at just that hospital. Examples are Lutheran Medical Center in Brooklyn St. Lukes Roosevelt in Manhattan Richmond University Medical Center in Staten Island etc. These units tend to be part of a union . Then you have the hospitals that contract out their  units. These include the majority of the private hospitals in the Bronx transcare operates all of them and some hospitals in Manhattan Brooklyn Hospital and Kingsboro Jewish in Brooklyn Operated by SeniorCare and New York Hospital Queens Operated by Hunter Ambulance Red. A somewhat third division exists and that belongs to the health systems. There are few large health systems operating within New York City that have their own  ambulances located at multiple hospitals and interfacility that include critical careneonate units. The two big players are Cornell Columbia Presbyterian Health System and the North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System. You also have the Jamaica Medical system which includes Jamaica and Flushing.So basically what Im trying to say is EMS in the nations most populated City is a complex being so apply like crazy and see what happens. I believe the FDNY is still accepting applications for EMT so it never hurts to try. ,ems,clzrrta,6,t5_2rmg0

2842081,0,t1_cnr428d,I completely agree. But you have to understand that this is serious. To even start a conversation about progression we need the capitol of respect. Without the initial support of specifically EMS physicians nothing else matters. Nurses have a vested interest in keep EMS out of the ALS game as much as possible and are unlikely to be our allies. Many nursing unions already make strong political plays against EMS. Doctors run healthcare nurses administrate it. Doctors are serious people and take this seriously which is why so many of them wouldnt touch EMS with a  foot pole. Do you know what a joke it is to be an EMS medical director in the physician community? Its a joke. Because of the i maturity lack of professionality and all the other crap people lump under fun. Fun is great its just an afterthought. If we could have the perfect system but it wasnt fun thats a bummer but fun isnt a concern its a benefit. No one will listen to you about policy as a Medic because no one respects medics it is the first and most important thing we could focus on the professional respect and manner in which those people of authority view us. Until we affect the perception in a positive way no one is going to change any policies about anything. The policies are there because we arent professional enough to work under better ones. I do agree with you  I just think everyone will look at us and say how cute about anything we would want to do  change as I see happen all the time until we deal with the respect and professionalism issue. ,ems,cnr54wb,1,t5_2rmg0

3035449,0,t3_2uu56x,There are a very. Very. Rare subset of the population that is just rotten and ugly and no matter what you do they will be abusive and make your blood boil.  Of that very small population a good percentage of them cant help it. So as ugly as they are you take it. There are healthy ways to decompress and thankfully these are rare patients. If you cant take it find another job. For the ones that are just ugly for no reason. It sucks. But thankfully in ems we have less than  hours with these patients and at the very least will get a break. In the ICU setting Ive spent months with them.  hours a week. Every week. Believe me it could be worse.  But keep in mind a lot of providers assume a much larger group of patients fall into this category than actually does. A lot of patients are scared. They are serially mistreated. And so on. I challenge you to recognize that and actually try to reach out to these patients. Ive had some of the worst patients open up to me by the end of a transport or a shift. Ive watched other providers give them maybe  minute before dismissing them and just being negative and ugly. Thats shitty patient care. This isnt an easy job but sometimes those patients that are the most shitty are the ones who most need help. After a lengthy transport time with a patient that was verbally dismissive and abusive by just talking to her I was able to find out that as a result of her increasing medical problems she was feeling more helpless and suicidal. Never know what you might find out from these people if you dont try. ,ems,cocmgoi,1,t5_2rmg0

3469626,0,t3_2zyqaa,Hey there I am yo junior at my University and I have been an EMT for almost  years now. I have served on my collegiate squad for  years now. Like some people have already mentioned it is a good idea to do some ridealong time before going to get your certification as an EMT. Working in EMS takes a special kind of person it is not for everybody. Do not take this as either encouragement or discouragement. It is simply a fact. Not everyone can handle it. And just because you may not be able to handle EMS does not mean that you wont be a good Physician or PA later in life. That being said collegiate EMS is awesome. If you find that EMS is for you you will be hooked immediately and spend a lot of time volunteering with the squad. But remember you need to balance that with your social life and academics as well. Working on a collegiate squad you will not get paid. Minnesota looks like it is comprised mostly of student volunteers and it looks like they do more standbys then  response so you will probably get a lot of exposure to sports injuries. I would try to contact them and see what their deal is and see how you can get involved. EMS is a great place to get experience before MedPA school. It will let you get real hands on experience with medicine and will help you to determine if you really want to go into medicine or not. My college squad is full transport we do  response. We also do standbys for the school when requested. Let me know if you have any questions.

3576218,0,t1_cpztkd2,Looks like uAntwelm cited some sources.  Id also point you towards Google where you can do your own research critical thinking and draw your own conclusions.I want to emphasize that I said that CISM has a mixed track record. Obviously some people do find it valuable otherwise we wouldnt still be talking about it after socalled experts have debunked it.FWIW in my own personal experience I think CISM tends to suffer from  main problems.  Granted some agencies may do CISM differentlybetterworse than others but heres my general experience after having gone round and round with this for many years.The first issue is that CISM tends to be conducted by folks untrained with therapypsychologyetc.  For a while that was actually perceived as a good thing in that we wouldnt be dealing with outsiders who dont understand the realities of our job.  So youd get goodintentioned but completely untrained and unprepared people basically trying to provide a level of mental health care to folks with an acute mental health problem.  I can give you some realworld examples of how that can go if you want.  I think CISM was also conceived of prior to the mental health community developing a good understanding of PTSD and how it works and how to treat it... so you often ended up with people who said I did this CISM thing and I still feel like shit.  Gawd I must be really fucked up!The second main cause I think is that CISM tends to happen on an arbitrary schedule.  A few agencies even had a CISM must occur within  hours of the incident rule.  Other had a rule where if one team members wants CISM then CISM happens for EVERYONE on some arbitrary timeline.  This nonsense completely disregards the simple fact that different people react to stress and grief in different ways and at different paces.  Just because you might be ready to rehash this whole nasty situation right now doesnt mean that I am.  Done poorly it makes someone feel like less of an individual and more of just a cog in a machine and they need to comply with just another nonsensical company policy.  Also not good if youre dealing with someone in need of legitimate mental health intervention.All that said... obviously CISM can be valuable for certain people in certain situations.  If youve personally found value there at various times then Im certainly not trying to confront you or diminish or devalue your experience.  CISM has some good ingredients in terms of incorporating just a general debriefing what went well what could we do better on? and creating a venue for people who really DO understand what our job entails to speak their minds in an honest way.  But theres some drawbacks that have been getting more attention lately.  Just something to be aware of.,ems,cpzwzsb,1,t5_2rmg0

You know when youre driving in your car and you see some big commotion going on on the side of the road and you wonder to your self what the fuck is going on over there? I get to go over there and check it out.Some times I pull people out of wrecked cars. Sometimes I do cool medical procedures like fixing abnormal heart rhythms or placing advanced airways. Sometimes I give powerful pain killers to little old ladies and chat with them while theyre stoned. Not everyone gets to do those things.EMS is also intellectually engaging. Every patient is like a puzzle that you are trying to solve. We are always asking ourselves what is going on with this person? What could explain their symptoms? I find it really engaging to form an impression of a patient treat them based on that impression and then later find out what the hospital diagnosis is. There is an endless amount of medical information to learn so if youre a life long learner type its a great field to be in.So there you go thats why I like my job.

I found that I could basically go through most college courses in a lecture hall on autopilot but that I had to be much more mentally present for EMT if that makes any sense. You will probably have a smaller class size than you are used to and you will probably interact with your classmates much more. Going to class and spacing out then reviewing the chapter in the book later probably isnt a good strategy.As far as the actual anatomy and physiology material its not too complicated. If youve done AnP or biology in college then youve probably covered a good chunk of what you will be learning in EMT.Some people struggle with application style questions that you will encounter i.e. what is the best course of action where none of the options are necessarily wrong.As far as preparation... its been a little bit since I took the course and Im sure every instructor is different but we spent quite a bit of time on basic anatomy. We had a fill in the blank quiz of a skeleton and all the major organs at the start of every class. If you want to review some basic anatomy then that could be helpful. We also had like one chapter that was an overview of some very basic cell biology.Its helpful to know some basic medical terminology. Maybe take a look at what anatomical position is and familiarize yourself with terms like proximal distal anterior posterior and so on just so youre able to communicate easily. The hardest part of the course for me was memorizing exactly the checkoff sheets for skill labs. Conceptually the class is not hard and if you put in the effort I am sure you will do fine.,ems,crbo8y9,2,t5_2rmg0

If canada utilized a model similar to that of the states and I already had a career perhaps I would be interested in a volunteer service. However barring the lack of volunteer EMS in Canada my situation did not exactly make the thought of volunteer EMS attractive. I needed a career I had an interest in this one.

4791016,0,t3_3ghq6y,I see a lot of EMS professionals and nurses tbh falling prey to the trappings of pseudoscientific medicine and it is a damn disgrace. We are supposed to be championing and supporting science based progress in medicine. It is the reason we are getting rid of aggressive spinal immobilization pre hospital post cardiac arrest hypothermia protocol is going away for similar reasons and even epinephrine is being studied for its potential lack of efficacy. So it is shocking when I see people take homeopathicnaturopathic remedies support antivaccine causes or seek the care of a chiropractor.Literally the best thing that can be said of chiropractic manipulation for the treatment of back pain is that it seems to be about as good as a placebo. It is not risk free increased pain headaches vertigo are all adverse effects and patients suffering vertebrobasilar artery strokes were  times more likely to have seen a chiropractor in the week prior to their stroke than control and provides no meaningful benefit. If you have pain take an NSAID light exercise take it easy and see your GP.As for preventing back injury? Proper lifting technique building up core muscular strength through working out calling for lift assist on heavy patients and maintaining proper weight with dieting would probably remove most of the minor back tweaks and pains that afflict our profession.Proper technique also extends to gear I wish I could find the study but I was reading that you are more likely to injure yourself lifting monitors and bags from the ambulances than patients.,ems,ctyg37b,1,t5_2rmg0

4831976,0,t3_3gwb1n,As a former NJ EMT I feel compelled to comment here. NJ is as far as I know the only state that runs a completely two tiered EMS system. State licensed BLS ambulances must meet specific standards pass inspections be staffed by a minimum of two EMTBs in addition to other requirements for the agency. I dont know much about ALS requirements other than they are always part of a hospital EMS system.The problem with BLS in NJ is an organization called the NJ State First Aid Council NJFAC. They are a hold over practically from the days were an ambulance was nothing more than a quick moving hearse with someone inside who wasnt quite dead yet.NJFAC is constantly pushing to loosen requirement on EMT training Con Ed requirements protocols and other programs. BLS in NJ is NOT required to provide services in a licensed ambulance. This is common for volunteer services. When responding in an unlicensed ambulance there are almost no set rules on what is required. Ive seen ambulances pull up to MVCs and the driver is wearing a stained reflective shirt that says TOWN NAME DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS and the passenger is wearing a tanktop booty shorts and flipflops. I was technically still am long story a member of one of the more progressive volunteer EMS agencies in NJ. We ditched the NJFAC brought our units people paperwork ect. up to snuff and obtained state licences for all our trucks. It was by far the best thing weve ever done.The NJFAC claims that they want to ensure that being a volunteer EMT remains easy so more people are encouraged to do it. This is nonsense as far as Im concerned. Being an EMT shouldnt be easy to be a quality competent care provider you should be challenged to learn practice and continue to educate yourself.I know theres a lot of people out there who think volunteers are on the way out and agencies like the NJFAC are only helping those people prove their point. I for one am proud to be a volunteer EMT especially one who can stand against any career EMT and truthfully say that we are held to the exact same standards.,ems,cu3lzae,5,t5_2rmg0
4833210,0,t1_cu3r382,TLDR Im basically a nurse that isnt lazy. I guess more autonomous too.One of my major purposes and one of the main reasons my hospital adopted paramedics is Im there to figure out which chest pains are legitimate and need a doc immediately and which can go on the back burner. Because apparently  leads are too complicated for nurses.The consequences for misseddelayed STEMI activation are pretty severe so every chest pain gets triaged with high priority which used to mean doctors would be getting pulled out of exams  from charting constantly. Now I can eyeball the  lead and decide if I need to get it to a doc immediately or if I can just put it in their todo pile. Im also given privileges to order and administer medications for patients that havent yet been seen by docs  midlevels which is something nurses cant do. The purpose there is to expedite treatment.I can also order actual tests. For chest pains I put in the orders for the trop and other blood work and the  lead and ro CXR. For sepsis activations I order their blood cultures lactic and cbc etc. For stroke alerts I put in the order for the stat CT and blood work and can have the patient on the CT table or even have the CT resulted before a doc is even made aware there is a stroke activation active. For the septic patient I can have them lined and labbed their blood work resultinged and have them on their second liter before a doc is even available to see them. The doc can walk in glance at their labs and order their antibiotics and get them out of the ER.Also for less serious things like a broken arm or whatever I can put in the order for the xray and radiology can pull them from the waiting room before a doc  midlevel has seen them. That way they dont wait for two hours in the waiting room to get eyeballed by a doc to get the same order to wait sucking up a room for it to be resulted only then to have treatment. I can just eyeball them in triage go yep thats fucked. put the xray order in and by the time we have a room ready the same two hours later at least their xray is already done and can be immediately eyeballed by the doc so they can be like yep thats fucked. and then we can splint it can get them out of the ER.I can technically put in any order that a physician can. Though attending physicians cosign all my orders so it kind of depends on the docs working that day exactly how much I do. Im expected to put in orders for life threats or emergency  high acuity stuff without the need for a doc to actually see the patient. But ordering more differential stuff that is generally more in the purview of the docs and they generally like to eyeball the patient first. Some are touchy if Im in triage ordering ro thyroid screen blood work or things like gallbladder ultrasounds. Some dont mind and actually like when I do. Its mostly who is working that day and my relationship with them. For cardiac arrests Im a person who isnt afraid of the IO drill like all the nurses I know what drugs need to be given and when for when the nurses are shitting a brick waiting for orders I know how the monitor works unlike everyone else in the hospital and Im a back up airway manager though that aspect is usually handled adequately by the doc or respiratory therapy but obviously I can intubate  assist with intubation  ventilate or set up a ventilator.I also suture and splint because ortho cant be fucked.Oh yeah and despite all these privileges the nurses still make over twice what I do and even the ones with lower degrees than I have still make nearly twice what I do. Im assuming its for their expertise in the extremely labor and intellectually intensive task of administering antibiotics omnipaque and laxatives which are out of my scope of practice and sitting around at the nurses stations on facebook and texting. That said I love the ER.,ems,cu3rkb4,4,t5_2rmg0

5227049,0,t1_cvfzoy7,gtYou cant rule out a STEMI just because you dont see reciprocal changesYes that is correct. I was just making the point the absence of reciprocal changes could be a clue to start thinking about nonSTEMI causes. I was not saying that the EKG was definitive proof the patient had a normal heart.I think were in agreement but since you made me look it up Im going to write down what I found The EKG is a terrible tool for ruling out MI. Some studies    have placed the specificity of the EKG between . Roughly speaking a coin toss would be better at telling us which patients are not having an MI.gtOne thing to watch out for especially referencing this EKG is to look for concave or convex ST segmentsYes this is one pattern to look out for. There is some evidence supporting the predictive value. Again the presence of concave or convex waveform cannot rule out MI but if present in a clinically appropriate patient should raise the index of suspicion. Just as you cant rule out an MI based on EKG alone you cannot rule out MI based on reciprocal changes or convex ST segments. That means you are likely to have patients having acute MI without ST segment elevations convex ST segments reciprocal changes or any variation of the above. Like the EKG you linked. Heres the data I found on convexconcave ST segmentsgtAs mentioned above the ST segment is normally isoelectric. ST elevation with convex or straight pattern is traditionally considered as indicative of STEMI in contrast to a concave pattern which is typically considered to be secondary to nonischemic etiologies. The  ACCFAHA guidelines supported this belief however this recommendation has been omitted from the current  ACCFAHA guidelines.gtWang et al also emphasized the importance of the concave tracing in establishing the male pattern left bundle branch block LBBB and LVH forms of STE over STEMI. However concavity verses convexity must be analyzed carefully and should not be relied on as the sole criteria for distinguishing NISTE from STEMI. Brady et al reported  sensitivity  specificity  positive predictive value and  negative predictive value for a nonconcave STE morphology in acute MI diagnosis. Given the use of ECG for screening such suboptimal sensitivity would yield poor patient outcomes. Figure Figure depicts an ECG of a man with acute anterior wall ST elevation myocardial infarction presenting with concave form of ST elevation in the precordial leads. Angiography of the coronary arteries revealed total occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery LAD and the STE resolved after pPCI. SourcegtFive hundred ninetynine CP patients were entered in the study with   individuals having STE on their ECGs. Of the  patients who had STE  had AMI  had unstable angina pectoris USAP and  had noncoronary final diagnoses. Fortynine patients had nonconcave STE  with AMI and three with USAP no patient with a noncoronary diagnosis had a nonconcave STE morphology. The sensitivity and specificity of the nonconcave STE morphology for AMI diagnoses were  and  respectively the positive and negative predictive values for nonconcave morphology in AMI diagnoses were  and  respectively. Interobserver reliability in the STE morphology determination revealed a kappa coefficient of .. SourceAnd reciprocal changesgtThe sensitivity specificity positive predictive value and negative predictive value for the electrocardiographic diagnosis of AMI were    and  respectively. Clinical diagnoses were as follows  AMI  USAP and  noncoronary syndrome. When all CP patients with electrocardiographic STE are considered the presence of ST segment depression is not helpful in distinguishing AMI from nonAMI. If one considers only patterns which lack electrocardiographic ST segment depression caused by altered intraventricular conduction the presence of ST segment depression strongly suggests the diagnosis of AMI. In these cases reciprocal ST segment depression is of considerable value in establishing the electrocardiographic diagnosis of STE AMI. SourceIn general they both suck at ruling out MI but in the right patient can predict the presence of MI. The EKG and these specific changes in general have poor specificity but good sensitivity.,ems,cvg1tz3,1,t5_2rmg0

RA shifts only have two digits  the first denoting the geographical zone and the second denoting the specific RA assigned to the zone.

CCT shifts use the prefix letters RN and use the same numbering scheme as RAs.Central California private  serviceCallsigns are assigned to the vehicle itself. The callsigns denote the order in which the vehicles were added to the fleet. In this case the scheme is  straightforward.

Best practice go to your operations manager the person who runs your base and calmly talk about your concerns. Try not to be agitated or demanding. Maybe over time he or she will see things in your vision. Key here is to not be demanding. Next step call nys doh ems bureau. Leave a voicemail asking about state policy regarding this issue. They are super nice and will return your phone call in a day or two. Ive done this before to address best practice for transporting peds. Find out what you can from the state and then go back to ops mgmt. Maybe they are just ignorant from years of unsafe practice. Also try speaking to your dir of education if you have one. Usually these people are good to talk to and usually have a sphere of influence that might change things. Last step apply elsewhere. Gtfo of that private ,ems,cwh2sec,1,t5_2rmg0

The instructions I found did not discuss the use of Kelly Clamps gtA six foot piece of  inch latex surgical tubing can provide an effective tourniquet by  making at least four parallel turns of the tubing around the leg.  Starting  from the injury and working away The end first turn is overlapped and anchored by the second turn and the last turn is anchored by the next to last turn.

5894955,0,t3_3vx40x,This is a really interesting question. A few of my thoughts...from reading lots of news accounts and knowing several ambulance crash survivors.  Ambulance crashes happen with distressing frequency. So often that we could probably post  or  ambulance crash stories per day on EMS. Most of the crash stories we find we dont post because the injuries were minor seatbelts! there was no patient on board so no unbelted medic to get injured in the patient care compartment and or there was no rollover. So sadly to be EMS news there usually needs to major injuryfatality odd collision today it was ambulance vs bus Friday it was ambulance vs dump truck Thursday it was a rural ambulance struck by a vehicle turning left that it was passing on the left or some other hook.  Significantcatastrophic injuries in an ambulance crash usually have one or more of these characteristics again from my everyday reading and looking for ambulance crash news Speed greater than  mphFatigued or sleeping driver ambulance or involved POVDistracted driver ambulance or involved POVRed lights and sirensSwervingPoor driving conditions  snow rain or fog  are occasionally a factor but not that often  Emotional and financial injuries can be as catastrophic as the physical injuriesMany EMS providers again from the news I see and regular emails I receive are uninsured or inadequately insured. The EMS provider if they survive are left with medical bills and possible funeral expenses they are unable to pay. Requests to publicize GoFundMe efforts for ambulance crash victims and survivors are sent to me every week.  Driver behavior can change much faster than the ambulance configuration. A safer ambulance better designed for the realities of patient care and highway operation include design for minimizing the impacts of crash is important. But for most EMS providers this is what you can actually controlSlow downUse the lights and sirens as rarely as possible Drive and drive only No radio phone or food when you are drivingNever swerve for anythingIncrease your following distancePerform as much assessment and provide as much care as you can in the patients home driveway or officeWear a seatbelt all the time. If you cant do something belted it should not be done while the ambulance is movingTo sum it up....the crew...has a lot more control over preventing catastrophe than the configuration of the box.Greg EMS,ems,cxsd2hm,3,t5_2rmg0

Doing the math and finding the optimal time to apply to an ACP program if this is your goal is left as an exercise to the reader. That said a lot can happen in a couple of years. Theres probably one more bulge of retirements coming inside of the next  years I know of at least a halfdozen so who knows. If ugingerbeef really wants to work here keep applying.

6268417,0,t1_cz1ylx4,gtEMS was is and always will be about providing field care to keep patients alive until they arrive at a hospital regardless of how much techniques or standards will change.This is a very narrow definition of what EMS is and really only relates to your experience of EMS. Furthermore it is extremely shortsighted to believe that EMS will always be about driving to the hospital. In the UK and Australia EMS only transports patients to the hospital if it is necessary for the patients care. In the USA transport to the hospital or refusal of transport is our only options thanks to shortsighted beliefs about what EMS is for. Community Paramedicine is directly contradictory to your definition of what EMS is for. My point being that EMS and Paramedics goals have changed over time and will continue to do so as societys healthcare needs change.gtDue to many factors EMS rescue and firefighting are irrecoverably linked together whether one likes that or not.Getting people out of trickylifethreatening situations is not the same as providing prehospital healthcare. While there may be some overlap in rescue when the victim may need some amount of care it does not mean there is a unbreakable link between rescue and healthcare such that those doing rescue must be healthcare professionals.Saying Fire and EMS are forever linked because of rescue operations that fire departments typically do is a false association. The reasons for many fire departments doing EMS varies by community. Some do EMS because there was no one else providing the service some others because they were replacing an under performing service others do EMS because they needed to protect firefighter jobs.The authors angers and criticisms of FDNY has a lot to do with the false claims FDNY made about why they wanted to take over NYCEMS. FDNY used the classic story of improved response times and care that have been used across the country from DC to Kansas City. In most cases the promises of improved response times and care are never fulfilled. There are good firebased EMS systems but that doesnt mean that firebased is always the best way to provide EMS. There are plenty of excellent EMS systems that provide care even rescue that have nothing to do with firefighting. ,ems,cz25dq5,17,t5_2rmg0

For instance this study compares physicians with fire in France but says nothing about the difference in mortality between physician and ACPs. I would be interested to know if physicians lead to better outcomes in a prehospital setting because from that you might be able to take away why MDs have better outcomes. Is it greater availability of medications is it simply training and recognition is it something else? From a policy and education standpoint it would be interesting to see. Maybe the wrong things are over emphasized in ALS training and this could be a step into correcting it.On the other hand maybe ALS is truly less effective than BLS because after a certain point all that matters is they get to a hospital fast.,ems,d0snk6b,3,t5_2rmg0

7007609,0,t1_d1agd0h,Ahh I gotcha. Sorry my initial comment was a bit snarky.So there is growing evidence that high flow oxygen is not as acrosstheboard helpful as we have thought in the past. For example its not recommended now for resuscitation of newborns or patients having heart attacks. And if you think about the mechanisms of shock they usually dont affect the blood oxygen saturation. Of course if theres something going on that is ALSO knocking their SpO down thats worth treating.Personally I adjust oxygen to keep someones SpO above . Most patients can maintain this with a nasal cannula. But if the sats do dip usually Im looking to correct the underlying problem  by bagging starting a neb starting CPAP narcan hey buddy wake up! etc. I will put someone on high flow O before an elective intubation  but thats L by NC and a whole different story. Patients in shock really need the underlying problem fixed  the bleeding stopped or infection slowed or MI cathd  and most things we do in EMS are temporizing measures at best. Chest decompression for pneumothorax pressors for distributive shock and IV fluid for dehydration are the closest we get. All that being said follow your local protocols and your training. But its never too soon to learn about the underlying physiology  and if your sats are  and youre breathing extra oxygen probably isnt going to do that much. ,ems,d1anoy7,1,t5_2rmg0

He puts our rig in the driveway.Get inside and find a s male altered mental status secondary to DTs with some agitation.  There was a loaded shotgun with reach of him.  I told my partner to back out.  He didnt.  Later he said It probably couldnt have punched through the wall anyway.  Upstate New York gem I asked the family to secure the weapon and got the answer of Youre not taking our guns!.  I could spout off about that for a while.At the end of the day I think Ive been lucky.

I was stationed in telaviv in early  which was a very peaceful place and time but the majority of the medics I worked with had been around for the second intifada durring the early s in which  Israeli civilians were killed in terrorist attacks throughout the country many of which were IED attacks that came with secondary explosions aimed at first responders and you could really sense the psychological impact that shit had on the EMS community.  Most started out as army medics and the violence in civilian life seemed to keep them in that agressive no bullshit mindset.

Every student is different and so is every project  working in a high volume urban system you can get the same experience in a year that other providers dont get in five years. I find that the medic students that do best have enough time to be comfortable with their skills while still enthusiastic about the job.The trouble with jumping right into medic school is that youre at the disadvantage of trying to learn the job while you should be focusing on learning to be a paramedic. But medic students who have worked BLS for a long time are often burnt out from the getgo and cut corners because theyve picked up a lot of bad habits at work.I worked BLS for two years before I started medic school and I worked urban BLS the entire time I was in school. I felt that I was very well prepared and that school was still enjoyable for me. The hidden benefit of delaying medic school for a year or two after you finish your EMTB is that you meet a lot of fantastic resources on the job. The medics that I became friends with while working BLS did a lot to help me while I was in school and helped me get the most out of my program.,ems,d3eo61i,2,t5_2rmg0

I know my bosses randomly watch the video to hear if garbage is being said about them so if you really need to vent about the administration save it for after work or do it away from the truck.

There is a HUGE homeless population where I work and most of them carry some kind of self defense usually some kind of knife. Most of them have mental health issues and dont have much to lose if they decide to go psychotic and try and stab one of us.

8251724,0,t3_4seijl,Heres my two cents. Hopefully this helps. You need a serious attitude readjustment. You have no idea how much or how little you will use it in the future as you have not even worked a single day as an EMT yet. This is a mandatory skill that every Emt advanced Emt intermediate Emt and paramedic before you has had to learn and display proficiency in. Skating by without learning how to use one of the tools in your extremely small toolbox is unacceptable. How would you feel if your family member was in an accident and the person who responded did not know how to use their equipment and apologized to you saying I was told we would never need to know to do this in class. Or even worse how would you feel if you found out you were being claimed in a lawsuit because you inadequately immobilized a pt and they ended up paralyzed for the rest of their life? I think you need to reevaluate why and how much you want to be an EMT. If this is something you honestly care about than you need to think about how you let yourself get to the end of your program without learning a basic skill that is required. Assuming you want to continue and your post was not an adequate representation of your maturity I would immediately contact the instructor of your program. You need additional lab time to practice with an instructor before you take your skills practical. This may require you to stay late come in on a different day or practice with another class.As you know by now if you perform the same way you described in your post you will fail. You have a very short amount of time to fix things. I hope you the best in whatever you decide to do.,ems,d590s1s,2,t5_2rmg0

Sinus tachycardia is not an arrhythmia its a symptom. Sinus tachycardia can be caused by hypovolemia cardiogenic shock hypoxia thyroid storm cocaine intoxication alcohol withdrawal or massive pulmonary embolism.Dont block the AV node in sinus tach.gt So this patient had a clearcut sinus tachycardia. Adenosine was not indicated  in fact it is contraindicated. Your paramedic preceptor should have been encouraging you to look for the cause of the sinus tachycardia. And it isnt just adenosine  you dont want to use any AV blockers in this situation.gt  Metoprolol is only indicated for the treatment of sinus tachycardia in a few unique circumstances e.g. thyroid storm.gt  Calciumchannel blockers are almost never indicated in sinus tach and the potential to harm is significant. For example if you give diltiazem to a patient in cardiogenic shock and sinus tachycardia you might as well have shot them in the head. Yes I have seen this happen.

You get EMTs who want to hop on the fire truck for an MVC because they dont wanna deal with patients that day so then the one EMT out there has to deal with  patients while the other EMT that didnt wanna be an EMT today is over dumping speedydry on some oil or pushing debris with a broom.

9678967,0,t3_5dhdw1,Theres a difference between hot zone warm zone and cold zone.Cold zone is an area known or presumed to be safe. No known access by a hostile. Down the block and around the corner.Hot zone has a current active threat. SWAT team only.Warm zone is an area which isnt currently secure but isnt likely to involve combat directly or immediately. It falls into the maybe category. For people with the right training and equipment it might be doable.The problem is that from what Ive read of the Pulse Nightclub shooting the main part of the nightclub would still be considered the hot zone. The shooter was right around the corner in the restroom. Now SWAT might have been able to secure that and if so you might be able to pull it off. But given that the attacker was  seconds away from being able to shoot up the room again I certainly wouldnt consider it safe.,ems,da64x8g,2,t5_2rmg0

My organization has banned photos in uniform in front of apparatus  I know it seems silly but when Im not even allowed to take pride in my organization or even take a photo in front of my rig with my significant other andor my kid and post it for my familyme... it just takes something away.  The Army taught me how important unit pride is and my organization has taken that away. EMS consistently lags in nearly all aspects of medicine.  We JUST got C.A.Ts the quick application military developed tourniquets a year ago.  Still no combat gauze.  Would have been nice to have on an arterial bleed I had last week.  Also how many places backboard despite the mounting evidence of why its far more harmful than good.   Education.  My training requirements in the degree program I took for my Medic were far more stringent than the certificate program around here  but I get paid the same.  The disparity shows also when medics from the degree program consistently progress much higher in rank faster vs their certificate counter parts.  Also the lack of degree progression in our certification.  I wish we had a structure like nurses in this respect.   Tied with number  old skool medicsdirectors that never want to change because its how theyve always done it.  We are highly resistant to change.   BURN OUT IS A REAL THING.  They will not take you out of service to allow shift change  Ive stayed after  hours past my shift because of this on a heavy volume truck.  This combined with spreading trucks out meaning every shift is a slammed high volume day... it really wears you out.  So those are the reasons for me.  Ive been doing this  years.

The nurses I work with are mostly very experienced and willing to impart knowledge while also valuing the skills and knowledge I already have.

I would say the military will give you the basic skills you need to succeed the rest is on you to apply yourself. Will it help you in the civilian world to be a successful emt? Yes if you apply yourself. Will it give you a head start for when you get out? Well yes and no. Yes if you go for Emt A or P some of the skills you learn can apply to those levels of training IE sticking. You will be able to stick the ever loving shit out of a vein if you get good ncos that will make you practice. You will know some pharmacology however keep in mind the army uses different medications sometimes than the civilian world. The same can be said for procedures I remember when in civilian ems Georgia you had to go through like a thousand steps before you could slap a CAT on someone and call it a day. In the army TCCC says see some bright blood some would say any excessive bleeding of the lower extremity hike it high next to the baby making parts and call it a day. This is to speed up an assessment on a pt. Sorry for the rambling but all in all I would say it gave me experience confidence and the ability to take control of a very shitty situation.

9988941,0,t1_db9iyhc,I agree that there is definitely a time and a place for involuntary transport. Medicolegally Im obliged to transport anyone who is at risk because I cant make any clear judgement on the support theyre going to get at home. Its a system that saves lives but Im not sure it deals with mental health.On a personal level Im often disappointed with the hospital management of these patients. Im certainly no psych expert but giving a lift home to a mate who was kept in a Mental Health Emergency Wing for gt hours being then classed as low risk and being turfed out at  in the morning has given me a bit of perspective. I hear it a lot from patients the hospital never helps and my GP does a better job and I come out feeling worse but it never truly hit home until it was personal. Sometimes a mental health crisis IS transient. Sometimes its better managed by your closest and dearest until a softer approach can be made in the morning. I get that the hospital is a safe place with no weapons and professional staff to stare at you all night. But they rarely have anyone staffed who is interested in long term mental health. Most anecdotal stuff Ive heard sounds like the goal is to make sure youre not going to kill yourself then letting you loose.Im happy to stay up all night with my mates take anything dangerous off them and out of the house and talk it out until the morning when their private facility opens. Id rather take the responsibility than they come out of hospital feeling like theyve been diagnosed as crazy feeling like a caged animal and objectified.

You can confirm if your treatment for Asthma is working in those cases where air entry was reduced and your treatment improved the situation but it now makes the wheeze actually louder and more prominent.  In a patient in respiratory arrest use capno again to confirm airway placement and then bag them a little quicker and more forcefully to bring CO down.  Last but not least in an arrest you do in fact check if chest compressions are effective and if an advanced airway is placed correctly. And a sudden sharp rise indicates ROSC.

10176167,0,t1_dbxfls3,LOL sadly its not the great story it could be.  Local high school doing one of those relay for life carnival fund raiser things.  Asked us to park an ambulance on site and hand out band aids.  Whatever.Anyway one of the student clubs or sports teams or something was running a pieintheface fund raiser where for a couple bucks you could lob a pie tin full of pudding at a willing volunteer high school student.  Well one of the willing volunteer victims catches the edge of the foil pie tin wrong and gets a good sized lac above his eye.  And he isnt so good with blood.  So his friends waddle him over to our truck hes bleeding woozy and covered from head to toe in chocolate pudding.  I dont want him in the ambulance obviously so we kind of prop him against the side.  And since hes lightheaded and nauseous we cant just tell him to hit the showers and come back when hes clean.  So it was a good opportunity for my brand new EMT partner to work on his problem solving skills while he got the kids face cleaned off and bandaged and I stayed a safe distance away looking authoritative holding my clip board and asking critical lifesaving questions of this young man and his friends.All in all it was a pretty funny call other than it appearing that someone let loose a bout of explosive diarrhea all over the side of the truck.

Sometimes people just make mistakes and you can reach a state of drunkenness where you are really and truly helpless. These people die all the time not from alcohol poisoning but from exposure injury or any combination of events. Yeah they suck but thats the job.

Again its limited but good enough that you cant just write this off as bad data or studies.
