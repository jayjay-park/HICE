7256272,0,t1_d22yy5v,I was only giving you my opinion based on what it sounded like your goal was. I havent done any research and I dont know how your stuff is selling already. If its hard to get Supreme and Bape in Canada and youre providing that service that works. If youre selling Supreme and Bape at a cheaper price than people can get elsewhere that works too. I think you just need something about your site that makes it worth going to. I got the impression your goal was to fill the niche of providing smaller Japanese brands that you cant get anywhere else in North America or certain pieces that you cant find anywhere else in North America. If thats your goal my opinion is it makes the most sense to just start with that market it as best you can and let it develop naturally. Then youll know whether it was a good idea or not. But do whatever youve got to do that works. If your shit is selling at a fast enough pace it doesnt matter what our opinions are because were just speculating.,japanesestreetwear,d22ziqn,1,t5_33vxy

8447937,0,t1_d5xcfh1,Ive always liked JohnUndercover better than mainline Undercover. John tends to focus more on playing with proportions and reimagining wardrobe staples in lieu of the graphic heavy mainline Undercover. Id agree that John seems a little more mature due to the lack of graphics but its really the same aesthetic as Undercover catering to a different audience.,japanesestreetwear,d5xj28i,2,t5_33vxy

10593546,0,t3_5rmyhs,Usually designers dont do gimmicky accessories like that because they arent based on graphics or branding so your best bet is a street brand like bape or maybe undercover. Although I did find this CDG affiliate zippo ,japanesestreetwear,dd8n4x8,2,t5_33vxy

11605267,0,t3_65masq,YesAsia is a pretty good option. Youre still paying premium prices for the magazine itself but shipping is much more palatable.Theres also sites like CDJapan which sell lots of Japanese magazines and collectables to an international market. The magazines will be cheaper because youre buying direct from Japan but then youre still paying for international shipping.A few brick and mortar shops carry magazines but I cant think of any with as good a selection as Haven. Need Supply has a few as do Independence Chicago and Unionmade. These are only the ones that come to mind but most lifestyle stores with a focus on Japanese clothing would probably keep a small selection.,japanesestreetwear,dgbgt6e,2,t5_33vxy
11763398,0,t1_dgtd6y8,Simple referencing the T as their a higher quality tee and rarer outside of Japan. Oshmans sold all sorts and is in the exact location your describing. Shinjuku is like... km from Harajuku? You can walk it in like  minutes. Plus theres another Champion store there. Dont be lazy and explore that shit.,japanesestreetwear,dgtesby,1,t5_33vxy
