But what is a very grey area is the health issue. the problem is people are random and very very different. this means studying how things affect people is difficult. so its the easiest ground to argue because there arent a lot of pure undeniable facts.even if you win the its healthy argument by some magical intervention theyll argue its too bland and you cant enjoy being veg.

Your healthier diet can be just as diverse and delicious but you can still indulge with friends on things like pizza and sweets. Although fresh local fruits and veggies are relatively expensive once you stop buying meat as a staple food your grocery bill will plummet. Also on the budgetfriendly menu beans rice pasta etc. There is no need to worry about protein black beans have more protein by weight than beef.

569144,0,t1_cg4wsjq,I think thats the right approach. Thats why I like Michael Pollans rules for a conscious and healthy diet. If you heed this advice youll most likely end up eating less meat . Dont eat anything your great grandmother wouldnt recognize as food. When you pick up that box of portable yogurt tubes or eat something with  ingredients you cant pronounce ask yourself What are those things doing there?. Dont eat anything with more than five ingredients or ingredients you cant pronounce.. Stay out of the middle of the supermarket shop on the perimeter of the store. Real food tends to be on the outer edge of the store near the loading docks where it can be replaced with fresh foods when it goes bad.. Dont eat anything that wont eventually rot. There are exceptions  like honey  but as a rule things like Twinkies that never go bad arent food.. It is not just what you eat but how you eat. Always leave the table a little hungry. Many cultures have rules that you stop eating before you are full. In Japan they say eat until you are fourfifths full. Islamic culture has a similar rule and in German culture they say Tie off the sack before its full.. Families traditionally ate together around a table and not a TV at regular meal times. Its a good tradition. Enjoy meals with the people you love. Remember when eating between meals felt wrong?. Dont buy food where you buy your gasoline. In the U.S.  of food is eaten in the car.,vegetarian,cg4yte5,11,t5_2qm7x

890561,0,t1_ch5541f,If there were no downsides to taking vitamins Id agree with you. Unfortunately they can cause harm. Some vitamins like A and D can accumulate to harmful levels if you continually get too much of them. Too much calcium can cause gall stones and interfere with thyroid function. Theres some evidence that taking selenium and vitamin E can increase mens risk of prostate cancer and speed up the progression of the disease. And even if none of these things happen to you youre still spending a whole bunch of money on a product that does nothing to improve your health.Obviously its a different matter if someones taking a specific vitamin or supplement for a medical condition B for pernicious anemia tyrosine for PKU etc. But theres no scientific support for the idea that taking a multivitamin every day has any benefit for a healthy person and most of the people who take supplements fall into that category.,vegetarian,ch5iegu,0,t5_2qm7x

1506830,0,t3_2bgejl,Cats are actually obligate carnivores which means they need their diet to be mostly meat for them to be healthy.  This is because cats are unable to produce the essential amino acid taurine something that is found almost exclusively in meat.  Deficiency in this animo acid can cause severe medical problems.  There are some vegetarianvegan cat foods with chemically synthesized taurine but these arent recommended by veterinarians or cat behaviorists.  Cats do not have digestive systems that can obtain sufficient nutrients from plant material.  Its very unhealthy for cats to be on a vegetarianvegan diet.  I feed my two cats meat.  First for the reasons above.  A carnivorous diet is pretty much the only healthy diet for cats.  Secondly I would be forcing my beliefs on them if I was to not give them meat.  They do not have the capacity to make the decision for themselvesbuy their own food so who am I to take away their right to a healthy diet?  Most veterinariansexperts think that not giving your cat meat is actually a form of abuse.  If you arent comfortable with it dont get a cat.

They took laboratory animals and they had one group that was a pure vegan nothing but vegetable material grains and fruits and vegetables and nuts the other had the same basic diet with all the supplements but they just added some veal powder some ground up veal some ground up bone meal and so forth and the rats that were vegans or vegetarians lived  days and the rats that ate the omnivore diet with meat as well as the vegetables and grains lived twice as long  days.  So thats kind of interesting but people say Oh thats just laboratory animals and theyre not spiritually elevated and all that kind of stuff so lets keep looking here.There was a great study that was published in the Denver Post in May of  and this study was done by the State Social Services in Colorado and they identified all the  centenarians in the state of Colorado living at that time.  These are people over the age of  the oldest was   of them and they sent a social worker out to each one of them gave them a hot meal to get their blood sugar up and then sat there eyeball to eyeball and asked them all these questions on  pages of questionnaire.  They were looking for things they could point to and say this is why these people live to be .  They found out that two thirds of these  centenarians were women one third were men so you fellows can live to be  if you do everything right.  They found out that every religion every culture was represented in these  centenarians so no group no religion no race no culture had a monopoly on living to be .  The only one that was  they were all heavy red meat eaters.  Everyone of them ate red meat twice a day there was not a single vegetarian in the bunch. Now there had to be something wrong with this theory that being a vegetarian is healthful.  At any rate number   were all heavy red meat eaters number   still worked after the age of  and they did primarily paperwork for family businesses and babysat and did the dishes and gardened and things like that.   took a nip of whiskey everyday.

1904246,0,t3_2gf1j1,Im going to guess youre in the US. Throughout undergrad I had almost no money so I survived on rice black beans and tofu in general. Rice is pretty cheap and is often a fire and forget food when it comes to cooking if you get a cheap rice cooker. Some of them come with steamer inserts which make it even easier to steam veggies and potatoes in them. Potatoes are great as well as a cheap supplemental calorie source but you probably already eat them as a meat eater. Dry beans are a cheap option for protein but they cost you in time so Id recommend that you consider buying the no added sodium canned beans from the store. Rinse those beans when you are using them takes away more sodium reduces gas and combine them with other base ingredients to make a good meal. Spinach is great too since it doesnt spoil quite as fast as romaine seems to in my experience. To give some perspective I would often get a pot of rice going in the cooker and then Id cook some spinach kidney beans and tofu crumbled in a pan with some spices. Then Id serve that on the rice and eat it as a meal with soy sauce as well. I am one of those weirdos that can keep eating the same things so it never bored me.If you have a bit more room in the budget quinoa is a good source of proteins and is pretty tasty as well. I also favor soy milk bought in bulk from a store like Costco if you have access and easy snacks can be made with any type of bread and the big tubs of hummus you can buy at wholesale places. Chickpeas can be directly bought and combined with some tahini to make your own but sometimes if you dont have time it is best to just get it premade. Veggies are important so try to see if you can buy cheap inseason produce at stores near you to add more vitamins to your diet. As a last aside I usually cooked in bulk so that Id have spare food to store and eat the next days. EDIT Also oats. Oats are awesome and can be varied as a breakfast food. Good for staying full and easy to make. In addition Depending on the age of your children wouldnt recommend for under  or so you should get them involved in cooking. It will give them valuable skills let them help take time and stress off of you give them a sense of responsibility and give you a chance to bond when you cook together. My parents used to cook with me and now I love cooking and baking as an adult and I typically eat healthier for it.,vegetarian,ckineuw,2,t5_2qm7x

Some people are able to cut everything right away even become vegan and not look back and some people have to start slowly usually by reducing sometimes by still eating some fish.The first thing is to start cooking all your own meals. Not only is this good for sticking to your diet but it helps you to learn more about your food and gives you practice. I think all vegetarians need to really learn how to cook the things they learned about food growing up need unlearning and they need to know how to prepare some good veggie meals well.

B in commercial vitamins can be animal derived so if you want to avoid this if you are a strict vegetarian look for the word cyanocobalamin on your ingredients list as this is a bacteria derived B option. ,vegetarian,cnikh43,2,t5_2qm7x

3427751,0,t3_2zhmxi,Honestly you want to eat nutrient dense foods.  You will also be lacking a large source of protein so replacing meat with legumes tofu tofu has high estrogen levels so eat sparingly vegetables contain a lot of protein but to receive the same levels as meat you will have to eat a lot more.  Most vegetarians eat eggs eggs are great and pretty versatile with meals.  You also can snack on nuts a lot walnuts are great since they have high protein and those precious omega fatty acids.  Quinoa is very popular since it is also gluten free and had high protein and fiber.  You have to be frugal and shop around for sales and deals.  I also recommend eating organically mostly due to pesticide use.  Another benefit to eat foods as minimally processed as possible. For instance instead of eating common white sugar which has been bleached and refined go with eating honey.  You will also be lacking amino acids commonly found in meat. Most vegetarians substitute it with Braggs amino acid. Its similar to the taste of soy sauce.,vegetarian,cpizmah,-5,t5_2qm7x

I tell people Im vegan pardon the fact that your question is on vegetarianism for all the reasons one could cite  environment health and ethics. They all make sense to me now and gradually becoming aware of their interconnectedness is what made me switch.The What is the point? question is flabbergasting but as others have mentioned just pointing out the obvious fact that many societal ills would still continue today if no one ever broke the norm usually does the trick. Im shocked however at how many times Ive actually heard or seen such a juvenile question as that. I also say Who knows how many minds I can shift to my side? What if Im a successful evangelist for veganism or I open up a vegan chain restaurant and end up converting millions of people? Would My impact be small then? I think thats a good line of thinking and inspiring for people who may not know how passionate you are about it all.As far as nonvegan items like leather I dont worry about throwing those out  I just dont buy more of them.

I suppose you could say that the most common and pervasive cruelty to animals is in use for food and youre taking action there but arent ready to commit to doing all you can at this time. This is the one the key distinctions between typical vegetarians and vegans. Vegans simply go beyond dietary choices well and exclude dairy and eggs and exclude animal products from clothes and other products because they wish to do all they practically can to not contribute to animal cruelty.Like others have said its up to you what you do with your existing leather products but you may wish to look into alternatives for future purchases.

4144231,0,t3_385uqi,You need to know how to cook brown riceUse   cups of water for one cup of long grain rice or  cups of water for  cups of rice.  Simmer for  minutes and let it rest in the covered pot for  minutes.  Then fluff the rice with a long tinned fork.  When its been in the fridge overnight its good for fried rice.EDIT  Black beansRefried Black BeansThis yields about   cups of refried beans. cup dried black beans and   cups of waterA tablespoon and a half of ground cumin tablespoon and a half of chili powder teaspoon oreganoCrushed red pepper to taste I think I use around  tablespoon.A liberal dose of garlic powder or maybe  or  diced clovesSalt and soy sauce to tasteFirst sort through the beans for small pebbles.  Its gotten pretty unusual to find any in the last few years but it still happens and a minute spent looking for stones beats the alternative method of finding them which usually involves breaking a tooth.  Rinse the beans under cold water and salt lightly like you are salting a piece of chicken.  But go easy on the salt.Next add the cumin chili powder and crushed red pepper and pour in the water.  It will take about five minutes to come to a boil in a covered pot.  Reduce to a slow simmer and set a timer for  hour and  minutes.  When the timer goes off check to make sure that you have enough water left then restart the timer.After the second time the timer goes off the beans should be far enough along for a taste test.  They will be spicier but less salty than the finished product.  If Im sure that they need more salt I add soy sauce.  Now is also the time to add the garlic and oregano.  The beans should be just barely covered with water.  If theyre not add more water.Reset the timer for  minutes and continue.  Turn the heat off after the timer goes off the third time taste the beans and let them sit in the covered pot for maybe another  minutes.  I mash them in an oiled cast iron pan over a flame.  A large spoon may not be the best tool for the job but thats what I use.   Adjust the heat as you go so that you cook the mixture down as you work it into a paste.  When almost all the beans are mashed and the spoon leaves dry spots in the pan that dont fill back in on their own youre done.  It takes me about ten minutes.Total time is about  hours with about  minutes of handson time.I use these as a taco filling and as a base for a stir fry sauce.  For the sauce I mix the bean paste with just a little less water by volume.  For a single serving I use about  cup of beans and mix with a little less cold water by volume and about a level teaspoon of cornstarch and a fair amount of soy sauce.  My go to stir fry vegetables are onion green pepper and green beans seasoned with garlic.  Serve this over a bed of rice and the beans and rice make a nice complete protein.I havent used it as a dip but I think it would make a good one.  For a dip I would add maybe some diced onion and a little acid from lime or lemon juice or vinegar.,vegetarian,crsnr2g,8,t5_2qm7x

4335977,0,t3_3amsm8,This is what I would say because Ive had this discussion a few times and its one of the reasons that persuaded me to go veg. So personally I dont believe humans eating meat is fundamentally wrong. I do believe we have evolved to be at the top of the food chain and we have evolved to be omnivores. This used to be my rationale for eating meat before I went veg. The thing is just because we CAN doesnt mean we SHOULD. This is when I usually bring in the environmental implications of a meatbased diet in the present day. We are not hunter gatherers anymore most people in the developed world have access to plantbased foods that provide all of our nutrition something that wasnt feasible for our caveman ancestors. Combine that with the fact that eating meat is not as simple as going out and shooting a deer anymore for the vast majority. Eating meat involves supporting an industry that puts more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere than cars and is using up huge swathes of viable land to allow livestock to graze or to grow corn that is used to feed livestock. Meanwhile millions of people still starve. If we could use that land for growing more plant food products we would be feeding the world a lot more efficiently.So yes I would agree with these people that we are technically at the top of the food chain and have evolved as omnivores. But the planet simply cant support billionandcounting omnivores.,vegetarian,csee79n,2,t5_2qm7x

After learning about all the harsh consequences of eating meats and all the lives im killing I promised to change my eating habit for good.

Im not trying to be a dick Im trying to be legitimately helpful here but what you are demonstrating here is that you are absolutely fucking terrible at picking up on nuanced conversation.   Youre focusing too much on the I dont trust people that dont eat meat part and not enough on the are you trust worthy part.  Perhaps youve got too much invested in your vegetarianism to be able to take a gentle ribbing about it but I can assure you that there was little to no serious negativity here as evidenced by the followup question.    At the very least youre being asked to engage in conversation.  Keep in mind that youre not on crucifiedforyourbeliefs.com youre on letsmakeafewroundsofsmalltalkbeforewedecidetofuck.com.  Given that context if somebody says blah blah blah blah thing on your profile. blah blah talk to me? Theyre just picking a conversation starter and running with it because they dont know you and starting conversations with nothing to segue with can be awkward.    If you really want to read into it you could suspect that starting with a lighthearted question that identifies you as a vegetarian and this person as not a vegetarian is a roundabout way of asking whether dating a nonvegetarian is a nonstarter for you giving you a chance to abort mission before anybody gets too invested in a conversation.    At the very least though you should really be reading this as an attempt to get to know you better not an insult of your beliefs.  If there was no interest or if this person was really just trying to make you feel bad on a dating website for no good reason there wouldnt be a follow up asking you to reply.

4714580,0,t1_ctos5p7,It seems like a waste to break up tempeh for sloppy joes when small tvp pieces or frozen and then crumbled tofu by nature have a much more relateable texture for that dish. I mean making sloppy joes with firm half whole soybeans isnt the usual texture at all. Might as well just open a can of baked beans on a bun and call it a sloppy joe and it would be faster and cheaper and softer too. It seems better to try a new food like tempeh in a recipe that plays to its unique strengths instead of what may not be a very good version of a dish that even in its original form was kind of created to cover up low grade dry or off flavored ground beef sloppy joes that is. How did you prepare tempeh the second time? Maybe if you ever try tempeh again someday try it cooked by someone who knows tempeh well or as an appetizer at a restaurant that cooks it well if youre dining with friends.Id suggest a vegetarian friendly Indonesian restaurant or a vegetarian restaurant that makes something like a tempeh Reuben sandwich for example. Tempeh cooked as Satay is one possibility it could be described as the Indonesian version of shish kebab where marinated sweetened tempeh would be grilled on short bamboo skewers and served with thick sweet soy sauce or a peanut based sauce. At the very least it seems worth knowing that traditionally tempeh is soaked in salt water or a marinade before its cooked to balance the flavor. Use any other means of preparing it and a person could be getting too much raw tempeh flavor. Another option as some have already mentioned in this thread is to buy preseasoned tempeh for example with sweet or smoked bacon type seasonings.,vegetarian,ctot873,2,t5_2qm7x

5502873,0,t1_cwesmc6,Its still good to be aware of the amount of protein you are getting. If you are low in protein your body will break down the proteins in your muscles to compensate for the protein you arent getting so in that way you dont have to worry to much about being deficient in tryptophan or phenylalanine for example. Protein deficiencies may cause you to feel tired irritable depressive etc. because you are not able to synthesize Dopamine and Serotonin as readily.

5936607,0,t3_3wbrbj,Im currently eating a pescetarianfish approx once a week no eggs no dairy diet because I think its a good way to significantly reduce suffering.  We have lots of evidence that cows  pigs are sentient enough to suffer greatly and chickens as well. Even if chickens are less sentient they suffer more and have a poor sufferingmeat ratio because theyre small. The evidence on fish is mixed  inconclusive to me but I will do more research and eliminate fish as more evidence comes to light. I dont eat intelligent seafood like octopus and choose sustainably caught or farmed seafood with minimal bycatch. Some aquatic life like clams and oysters barely have a nervous system and likely cannot feel pain or suffer.Convincing people to be vegan because all lives matter equally without sufficient evidence is much more difficult than convincing people that farmed animals suffer too much for how sentient they are. Given the available evidence youd do much better educating your friends about the dairy and egg industry than telling them theyre hypocrites because they eat fish.,vegetarian,cxxtipu,1,t5_2qm7x

5978024,1,t1_cy2z14p,gtthat was pretty clearly a joke borne out of understandable frustration and not at all comparable to racism.Unfortunately I have to disagree. Strip out the labels and youll find those kind of jokes all function on the same basic principle they all rely on belittling people they dont like because of their beliefsgenderrace and dehumanising them so that they become acceptable targets  to be mocked or made fun of or looked down upon. Whatever the label of choice its just a joke  isnt a justifiable excuse for doing that  regardless of intention. The road to hell is paved with good intentions and all that.gtBesides why does everyone on rvegan need to be welcoming to nonvegans at all times? As I mentioned in my post earlier  they dont have to. Their sub  their rules. I only commented because there have been claims that it is welcoming and inclusive  and Im offering my perspective as an outsider on why it might not be felt as such to people from outside the choir. What they choose to make of it is entirely up to them. gtIts hardly representative of the sub as a whole which seems quite welcoming and tolerant of people.A vocal minority is not representative of a sub as a whole. But if say the mods allow it  the other sub members upvote it  no one says anything to challenge it... Im just gonna point out that in that case  yes it might just reflect on the sub as a whole to some extent.

Vegetables even organic are generally a lot cheaper than meat so you will save a bunch of money there. If your budget is tight then avocadoes for example might become a treat rather than a staple.Dried beans are way cheaper than in cans learn how to sprout its much much easier than people realize.  Also be aware that most veggies have their seasons so the price will jump if its not in season strawberries fruit in general are a good example of this.

In fact quoting from this article from Harvard Medical School   gtWhen you pour liquid cooking oil into a pan theres a good chance youre using polyunsaturated fat. Corn oil sunflower oil and safflower oil are common examples. Polyunsaturated fats are essential fats. That means theyre required for normal body functions but your body cant make them. So you must get them from food. Polyunsaturated fats are used to build cell membranes and the covering of nerves. They are needed for blood clotting muscle movement and inflammation.   For one small  medium sweet potato roasting in a pan I use about  tsp of olive oil or safflower oil. I cut the potato up place in a bowl drizzle the oil over it and stir to coat then place on a baking sheet at  in the oven for  min.

6649270,0,t1_d06w9hx,I think the point here and one that Ive tried to push in this sub is that to the average omnivore nitpicking of dietary labels is confusing and this confusion causes problems for people eg fish as a provided vegetarian option. I think whatever label you want to selfapply jn your dealings with others is fine as long as it doesnt compound confusion in society at large. If all the pescetarians go around saying theyre vegetariansaspiring vegetarianswhatever what a lot of people will take away from this is that vegetarians eat fish which will result in a lot of feelbad moments for actual vegetarians.

6661072,0,t1_d089z37,I think this article sums up why I believe reducing meat consumption better than giving up meat all together. Ideally giving up on meat would be great. However the number one reason for reverting back to meat eating is declining health so I believe taking it slow and letting them take the time to practice a easier way of absorbing nutrition is more beneficial than convincing them to throw themselves into the cutting off so many sources of nutrition immediately.I have had the pleasure of meeting people who have turned vegan immediately and they are absolutely my heroes but for the most part I dont think it works for everyone. My aunt tried veganism for a while but her declining health lead me to believe she wasnt eating properly during that time. Unfortunately she went back to eating animal products because she firmly believes she cannot survive without it. It is unfortunate but when I told her I wanted to be vegan for animal welfare I could see she really really wants it too. I just need to convince her that it can be healthy to be vegan hence why Im trying very hard to learn how to cook vegan nutritiously and tasty.,vegetarian,d08b8t0,1,t5_2qm7x

However if you look at more traditional vegan literature and academic essays you can see that exploitation was originally a key component.

6810222,0,t3_48z4k3,For me personally I feel it is morally wrong to eat meat when there are other options. So being vegetarian is as easy as going to a store and not stealing something since that would also be morally wrong to me. Keep in mind that you dont have to be  vegetarian. Eating less meat is healthier depending on what you replace it with and you shouldnt feel like its all or nothing.You really dont need as much protein as some people seem to think. And its easy to look up protein content of different foods. My favorites are tofu and nuts.My partner isnt vegetarian and I do all the dinner cooking. Fortunately he doesnt mind eating vegetarian for dinner. I buy him the stuff he wants for lunch and that usually has meat. Occasionally I will make him something meaty for dinner like  of our meal is the same except I have a mock meat thing and he has some sausage. So perhaps your SO can accept eating meatless dinners and having meat for lunch and at restaurants. If not its not too difficult to do something like I described. One shift in eating healthier is rather than seeing meat as the main course see it as a side. The veggies are the main and the starch and meat are a side.,vegetarian,d0o8hqh,2,t5_2qm7x

Here are my tips on getting started  There is a great plantbased diet you might be interested in its called The Starch Solution by Dr. McDougall      . Learning new recipes  It takes a few weeks to learn new recipes and get to know new products.  Also there is quite a bit of misinformation in the area of nutrition.  It will take a while until you see through the fog. Just hang in there    get their free guide on the homepage!        veg restaurants   . Doing your research health ethics environment  No worries  documentaries and books and you are fine        graphic  Watch these with your husband if possible so that he is part of your journey and understands the basics.        Also has a great TEDx talk here   I am not affiliated with amazon btw   Really no need to worry about protein      You can enter your meals into  just to be safe.  And finally some basic help on getting started        That will keep you busy for a month or two but it will also get you over the hump   Let me know if you got any questions or need help.

Its just not as advanced as other animals.  They have nerve chords and ganglion complexes.  And this whole thing leads back to my original point scallops move.  They move quite rapidly and purposefully.  As do Tridacnid clams amongst other molluscs.  So if Im understanding correctly youd eat an oyster because it only has a simple nervous system and doesnt move freely but not a scallops because while it has a nearly identical nervous system it moves around?

I looked it up and cows produce milk up to  days after a calf so I mean my question is that even if the cow had just the one calf and was milked during that duration where does it fall in having that milk during that period from a vegan perspective?

My kneejerk reaction is that it exists as guilt relief for people who identify as flexitarian. If its for health reasons why worry about the label? If its for moral reasons why not go all the way? There is lots of room in this world for lots of people to identify lots of ways but it seems that having a label like flexitarian could do more harm because it satiates some moral crisis a person might be having while not actually needing to go all the way with it. I will say that people eating less meat is certainly a good thing and I suppose that having a label like flexitarian might help move the needle but it just strikes me as being very fashionable which is to say something of an empty gesture. ,vegetarian,d6h317t,80,t5_2qm7x

9847838,0,t3_5gc90x,Something doesnt seem right. Thats no good that youre hungry all the time. What are your portion sizes like? A life time of meat eating doesnt really prepare someone for what vegetarian meal portions can be like if a person dishes up vegetarian meals with only their experience serving meat to guide them they will probably innocently end up under eating at least for a little while.For example if you cook up a cupml of dry rice and a cupml of dry lentils in your favorite style a filling portion is probably at least half of the cooked lentils and half of the cooked rice if not all of both of them but a life time of portioning those things as accompaniments or sides to something else can lead someone to feel like they only need a fourth or an eighth as a serving but thats usually way too small when its your main dish. It can help some people to have a bigger bowl that they eat certain meals with to let them know that its ok to eat more of that kind of a healthy vegetarian meal. If youre eating rice and beans or rice and lentils you need a big healthy bowl of them like an Italian pasta sized bowl or a big Asian noodle soup bowl a little cereal or side bowl just wont do unless you like going back for fourths or fifths.Also while they might not seem as glamorous compared to some more trendy foods potatoes and nuts are both very good at filling in gaps in ones diet as you transition to fully vegetarian. Nuts make a great snack for energy and even peanuts or sunflower seeds can help or they can be used in all kinds of foods as nut butters. Potatoes are more nutritious than people sometimes give them credit for and most of their bad rap is due to deep fried potatoes or where they absorb just too much fat but they go well in all kinds of dishes. For example a lentil soup with potatoes is twice as filling and has more vitamins. And you could make all kinds of Indian style potato dishes or side dishes.All beans dont have the same nutritional values either since you already like to cook lentil dahl you might want to look for some Indian chickpeas or chana dal which besides being delicious are so good at being a slow digesting source of energy that they are one of the best foods for helping to stabilize the blood sugar of diabetics. Australia is a major grower and exporter of legumes to India so you should be able to find a good variety locally. Dont forget the garlic even powdered to help make dishes more filling. Another dahl like dish you might like to try is sambar which basically turns dahl into a vegetable stew or chowder. By adding just a potato or two and some carrot a little tomato canned is ok and radish or summer squash or a small eggplant along with some premade sambar powder seasoning mix you get an even more satisfying one pot dish. But if this is too much like your curry situation last night you can also try making Indian meals that use all the same ingredients but make them into two or three dishes for more variety on your plate. For example just make your dahl as a thinner soup of mostly lentils water and seasonings first to cook while you make the other food and have a main of spiced vegetables possibly with one of the vegetables as a cold side dish or pickle along with a generous helping of rice and then you either have the dahl in a cup or you pour it over the rice as a sauce. You can top some of the dishes with sesame seeds or yogurt or chutney to be more filling too.Try some different combinations like Italian style pasta and beans Pasta e fagioli or pasta fazool in slang which is a fantastically filling stick to your ribs Italian home cooking dish of cannellini borlotti great northern or sometimes kidney beans in a rich sauce of onions olive oil or other inexpensive plant oil garlic herbs and tomato paste or tomatoes served over small pasta like elbow macaroni or ditalini but farfalle or bow tie shaped pasta can also be fun. Its another kind of comfort food people dream about and songs have been written about. You might also want to consider some more whole grains in your meals if you havent used them much yet brown rice is rich in B vitamins and digests more slowly than white rice because it has more beneficial fiber and whole wheat pasta is also good for a more filling change of pace and its fantastic with homemade pesto when basil happens to be in season and on sale and you have too much of it. Or with inexpensive whole wheat four you can make your own Indian roti flatbread to eat with other Indian dishes instead of rice. Masala potatoes cooked with coconut oil and spices wrapped in a whole wheat roti would be a good filling dish. Maybe with a side of shredded marinated carrots or cabbage. Hope this is able to help and we are always here for questions.edit a word,vegetarian,dar72cn,6,t5_2qm7x

9992756,0,t3_5inrll,Have you tried something like soylent If you can find a meal replacement shake that you like and can afford to have regularly I think that would make things much easier for you vegetarian or not.       In terms of ideas for vegetarianism    Cauliflower rice is something you could look at.    Do you like tofu? It seems like an extrafirm tofu baked would be the way to go.        I like to do a lot of simply prepared dishes which usually involves doing a quick blanching of a vegetable and then dunking it in an ice bath. Usually you would then sautee  fry  cook the vegetable further but you can also eat it at that stage. I think that would be an ideal cooking method for you  just with a little bit of salt or a dressing that you like. The vegetable will retain its crunch and color but will be more pleasant to eat than raw. You can add small amounts of additional flavors that please you as well.    Boil water and add salt and sugar  you can search online for recommendations here.  Have an ice bath ready large bowl of cold water with ice.  Add vegetables and cook for smin depending on vegetable  size of cut.  Remove from boiling water and add to ice bath.    Since you like walnuts and pistchios maybe a dressing based on walnut or pistachio oil would be good?  Have you tried sesame oil?    Its a little hard to make recommendations as it seems like you dont like strong flavors but you can always dilute these things with a neutral oil grapeseedsunflowercanolacorn oil.

10035554,0,t1_dbfmjny,Plants and animals are incomparable. I never said it was a cruel practice in fact I agree with you that its best to keep calf and mother together. However the calf only exists in the first place so humans can profit. Its a cycle in which humans have put their own wants as dairy is not a need in any sense of the word over the rights of animals to not be treated as machines. I get that youre the type who is motivated for environmental reasons so perhaps you dont have many ethical issues with farming practices but many folks on rvegetarian are here because they think its wrong to unnecessarily kill animals. That calf will be killed and so will her mother end of story. My comment was for them to explain that this is just another step in an unnecessary process. Regardless of whether or not it directly harms an animal its illustrative of our continued exploitation of animals. Do you really believe the excessive milking of cows doesnt harm them its only their babies causing them harm and gentle farmers just care too dang much to let that happen? Animal ag practices blatantly cruel or not are about maximizing profits. Calf drinks milk? Cant sell it. Selectively breeding animals to produce insane amounts of milk impregnating animals repeatedly until their production drops off and killing them when theyve become worthless to dairy farmers is harmful as well. Practices like these make more people buy milk from the farmer because we are apparently perfectly fine with impregnating an animal and milking her until shes worn out but separating her from her calf is when it crosses a line. ,vegetarian,dbfnqq9,7,t5_2qm7x

10359933,0,t1_dcicj1m,I think because Taiwan is so heavily vegetarian due to its population being nearly  Buddhist theyve developed a lot more commerciallyproduced mock meats than many other places in the world. Because its mainstream and not a niche market its really been honed to perfection.The texture of the Taiwanese mock meat Ive tried has been astonishing! A lot of Western mock chicken for example never gets that crisp edgeexterior. Its very soft  this is fine for things like tagine or stew or casseroles but for barbecuing frying or roasting its not so accurate. Taiwanese mock chicken in my experience stays juicy on the inside but develops a pleasing crispy exterior when fried.Same for a mockduck I buy often. I actually use it to make a mock ham roast on the holidays like Christmas amp Easter by studding it with cloves and glazing it with an orangemisobutterbrown sugar glaze. Its indistinguishable from real ham to me  the skin gets tough and chewy with a caramelized glaze just like real ham but again the inside stays moist and has a great slightly fatty texture. It really depends on how much you liked meat to begin with  I know a few vegetariansvegans who never liked it and so wouldnt enjoy these substitutes at all.

11417416,0,t1_dfq4pm1,Yeah its true I only started eating healthy about  years ago before that it was all pizza and pasta and Taco Bell lol.I got Candida overgrowth and had to go on a strict No Sugar No Starch diet boy was it hard. Everything has sugar and starch! Even things like tomato sauce have a rediculous amount.Ever since Ive readjusted my routine and now make more food than eat out. Portobellos quinoa kale garlic and olives are my favorite ingredients. Soy is something I definitely avoid it raises estrogen levels in men. One thing I must mention is that since Ive been a not so incredibly healthy vegetarian for so long my blood cells have taken a different shape almost entirely composed of ovalocytes and I have run into a couple of issues.I found this all out when my candida overgrowth was found According to my nutritionist I have no carnivorous enzymes to help break down any worms that may be in my bloodsystem we all have worms and parasites in our blood so the worms just die and decompose causing me the get sick because of all the bacteria they create from not being broken down by the enzymes.. So i take digestive enzymes to help with this and I also take BComplex with Folic Acid very important every day because i had a pretty severe lack of mostly B but also B.  Its a pretty long and heavy topic and I will most likely be posting the entire story soon on this sub but its long so I need some time lol. Regardless I wouldnt trade this lifestyle for anything.

11623524,0,t3_65spcb,Hey vegetarian currently in university in Japan. Some places have English menus but you may have a difficult time if you do not speak or know any Japanese. In Japan vegetarianism is associated with pescetarianism including shellfish. I can ask for something with no meat and they will offer me fish. If I say say no fish please and then they offer me shrimp ebi is often separate from fish in Japan.Im a student so I dont eat out much here in Japan and I also live super far up north in Akita so not near the big centers like Tokyo Kyoto and Osaka. However I would definitely check out Happy Cow. Tons of restaurants that are recommended there. I would also check out some Indian restaurants. I was in Jinchobo and saw an Indian restaraunt advertising vegetarian curry.Avoid shojin ryori  while in Kyoto. Its advertised a lot towards veg gaijin but its generally pretty pricey for lackluster food. Its specifically buddhist friendly food but most places that serve it are around  yen a little under  USD per meal. If you want to try it certainly but it really is overpriced IMO!Some helpful things to sayKore wa nan desu ka?  What is this?Kore wa niku  butaniku  gyuuniku  sakana  ebi?  Is this meat  pork  beef  fish  shrimp?There are more specific ways to say things but I assume you have no Japanese speaking ability so I gave you the easiest thing to say.Beware katsuobushi which is dried fish flakes used in just about every Japanese dish to give it flavor. If you dont mind this while youre there no worries but if you do care about broths you will need to ask if there is katsuobushi in the dish. While youre in Osaka you will probably want to try okonomiyaki. Enjoy but dont add the flakes on top as that is katsuobushi.I think Ive covered everything I can think of? Let me know if you need more help. My apologies if this is a little rambly its late here in Japan.,vegetarian,dgdjdf9,8,t5_2qm7x

11712914,0,t3_674ts4,Hello! Ive also been a vegetarian for three months. Up until I decided to be a vegetarian the only meat I regularly consumed was chicken. I quit eating beef in  I only really ate seafood during the summer and most pork products didnt really interest me didnt like bacon ate pork if my mom made it for dinner but didnt go out of my way for it. Unfortunately cravings go away with time. The Morningstar chikn patties are pretty spot on for crispy chicken the first time I had one I was a little scared about how similar to chicken it was. I know people use tempeh for bacon and Ive also heard people use mushrooms for bacon? Dont really know how that works.In any event keep trucking on OP!
