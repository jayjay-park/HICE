67464,0,t1_ceicy75,Im a Ph.D in synthetic organic chemistry.  Running the reactions is almost always the easy part purification and characterization of purity is the hard part  of the time.  It is illegal to possess assess purity or use these compounds without a license and any chemist found giving out information that helped with that has grounds for termination from ANY position they may have.  Its not an idle threat the DEA does not take this lightly especially with trained chemists.  Youre backtracking because you know Im right.  It violated the rules of the sub to say the least and involves a schedule  substance.  I agree that people will do drugs that doesnt mean Im going to teach them how to safely make them either.  Youre the one being childish grow up and get off your soap box.  Also you didnt even address the fact that I was completely correct that it is a schedule  drug and carries all the associated issues.

I wonder what would happen if I got inside the NMR.This is of course harmless as the NMR is just a radio and a magnet. So his research team reengineered the NMR so he could fit inside. It was all set up. It was time for the first human NMR sample. So he gets inside his team turns on the instrument everyone is gathered around to see the glorious results they look at the readout... and nothing happened. So everyone was looking at the data and trying to figure out what went wrong when one of his students turned to him and said Im not making this up ah... sir? I... uh... was looking at the data... and I think I figured it out.  Ah... well... it seems youre too fat.And he was right.So the student got in this new NMR they reran the experiment and it worked!Thus was the birth of what we now know as MRI.story only slightly embellished for dramatic effect.

There is a technique called MRM which is what tandem mass spec uses. My experience is with ion traps but the theory is the same for a triple quad. You sit at the expected molecular weight of your compound you collect those ions and sweep everything else through. Then you fragment the molecular ion and see what you get.  In the event you are looking to confirm a known compound with a high degree of confidence you look for a few known fragment ions. In the event you are trying to figure out the structure of an unknown compound you look at the entire fragment spectrum and try to piece together the structure based on mass losses.,chemistry,cg666k7,1,t5_2qhf9

640404,0,t3_21hg6j,Explanationstory Im a TA for the lab portion of an introductory general chemistry course. The wet experiments in this course are generally structured around identifying a vial of an unknown compound based on their physical properties density solubility reactivity etc. They are usually given excess reagent in the vial in case they mess up the first time and have to redo their experiment. After they complete their experiment they are instructed to dump out any extra reagent in their unknown vials into a waste container in the fume hood.Anywho today was their fifth wet lab thus far most people finished in under an hour and knew what to do with their unknown vials. One pair of students never seem to listen to directions  they are always the last to finish and I constantly have to monitor guide and babysit their experiments so they can actually finish within the  hour lab period. After refluxing my patience for what seemed like an eternity they finally finish  minutes after the last group had already left. One of them comes up to me with his unknown vial and asks me what to do with it. I told him to do the same thing hed done during the previous labs to clean out his unknown vials... but after seeing the look of confusion on his face I sighed and told him you need to dump out the stuff in your vial in the fume hood then rinse out your vial with water before you return it to me. So he off he goes.When they leave I pack up my things and walk around doing a last check of everything in the lab. When I got to the fume hood I notice a neat little pile of sodium carbonate dumped out on the bench next to a perfectly functional waste container for aqueous waste. This brought my experience with undergrad incompetency to a whole new level... I broke out in laughter whilst my heart wept at the thought of cleaning up the mess. ,chemistry,cgd2c2k,55,t5_2qhf9

Think of it as an advanced vocational degree its a bit of a pigeonhole but its more maketable by far than a basic science degree.  If you want to go Chem E. its a different focus.  However engineering skills tend to be more marketable expecially when it comes to programming experience.  Thats based on a group of friends who happen to be engineers.  Regardless of the path you take force some programming expeience under your belt it will ONLY help you.Edit One other consideration.  Basic chemistry is well understood.

1539982,0,t3_2bukhz,Yes they are very different concepts. The term conjugation simply implies an extended system of orbital interactions through which electron density is spread out of delocalized. It is most commonly a pi system made up of several neighboring pi bonds as in butadiene but could be more exotic. Delocalization does not imply that charge is actually transferred from one part of the molecule to another though it can facilitate it but rather the electrons are spread out. Charge transfer actually moves charge electrons from one part of a molecule to another. This is common in some types of molecules like fluorescent dyes where such a transfer is driven by light but this charge transfer is usually temporary. Sometimes you can get permanent charge transfer given a structure that favors it like azulene,chemistry,cj9b7th,4,t5_2qhf9

1567094,0,t3_2c3pzv,gtHowever I am also very dismayed at seeing the amount of students that essentially gave up last year.Tell me about it Im a study group leader essentially an unpaid voluntary SI leader and the test averages for last semester were in the mid s no curves by the way. I feel that Ochem sort of has to be approached like a math course in the sense that you cant just lecture the material but if you give lots of inclass assignments whiteboard work quizzes and homework for the sake of practice the students will be more likely to succeed.Organic chemistry isnt just definitions and various theoriesexplanations that you may get in inorganic or pchem. Ochem is a giant puzzle and the more the students understand the puzzle pieces i.e. reactions the more they will understand and enjoy ochem.gtI suppose the main issue here is that students just dont see a reason to try.And heres the root of your problemgt all of the discussionsSI sessions are optional.My sessions are also optionalhowever at the end of the semester each student in my group is subjectively graded by me on a scale of  where  is they didnt show up at all  is they showed up but didnt really interact  is they showed up and sort of interacted  has more interaction and  is pretty much  attention and interaction. These points would be added onto their final grade. Yup half a letter grade simply by going to SI sessions. And going to class and recitation? Another halffull letter grade. So just by attending lectures and sessions you can get over a letter grade. Of course I dont think you have the power to change this unfortunately.I believe that a grade for ochem should be spread out over lots of assignments and little things instead of just tests and a few percent from homework but thats just me. Its a lot more work for the professor and graders but ultimately you get more students that understand ochem and...god forbid actually like it.In the end however ochem is a difficult class for many. There will always be people that will give up and leave some having accepted defeat a mere  weeks into the semester. Remember that the majority of students taking ochem for the first time will more than likely be sophomores in Biology at least this is the case where I am who dont yet understand that ochem is one of the most important classes they will take. You also should realize that many of these students have probably never taught to teach themselves,chemistry,cjcpiuk,2,t5_2qhf9

1731749,0,t1_cjxg9fi,ampampamp Matrix chemical analysis sfw gtIn chemical analysis matrix refers to the components of a sample other than the analyte  of interest. The matrix can have a considerable effect on the way the analysis is conducted and the quality of the results obtained such effects are called matrix effects.  For example the ionic strength of the solution can have an effect on the activity coefficients of the analytes.   The most common approach for accounting for matrix effects is to build a calibration curve using standard samples with known analyte concentration and which try to approximate the matrix of the sample as much as possible.  This is especially important for solid samples where there is a strong matrix influence.  In cases with complex or unknown matrices the standard addition method can be used.  In this technique the response of the sample is measured and recorded for example using an electrode selective for the analyte. Then a small volume of standard solution is added and the response is measured again. Ideally the standard addition should increase the analyte concentration by a factor of . to  and several additions should be averaged. The volume of standard solution should be small enough to disturb the matrix as little as possible.gtInteresting Analytical chemistry | Xray fluorescence | Analytical quality control Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcjxglu oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecjxglu.

I was supposed to rank them In order or Most reactive to least reactive.My ranking from most reactive to least reactive was BgtDgtAgtCAnd apparently they were all wrong.My thinking went like thisBoth sulfur substituents are electron withdrawing because of the inductive effect triumphs the conjugation effects because of higher energy of sulfur P orbitals so both would be net EWG C being the least reactive due to the fact that the carbonyl attached to the Sulfur would make it even more electro positive ergo an even stronger EWG.Thus CgtAB has an ether group attached to it a really weak ERGD has a alkyl group weak ERG but it also has an amide a relatively strong EWG.

They say they arent accurate in this case but that is likely just clever marketing words referring to the inaccuracy of pH strips in general.Using an indicator and absorbtion spectroscopy isnt an accurate route to go in highly pure water either. The very small amount of aciditybasicity belonging to the added indicator is enough to alter the pH of the pure water sample a dramatic amount.They arent lying on the website.

2872626,0,t3_2sz55c,At a low enough concentration a solution of silicate probably is reasonably stable. However it depends on your definition of stable. Solutions of simple ionic compounds in water tend to remain stable more or less indefinitely provided that the concentration is within the solubility limits of the compound in question and the temperature doesnt bounce around madly.But several months is not really very stable. What will probably happen is that any silicate in solution will eventually precipitate out as silica gel. This happens when silicates get protonated. You can make it happen rapidly by mixing sodium silicate solution with hydrochloric acid. This yields pure silica gel  the only byproduct is NaCl which stays in solution so you can easily isolate and wash the silica gel precipitate.The way to get a much higher concentration of silicate is to dissolve silicon dioxide or silica gel in strong alkali. NaOH or KOH would do the trick although the result would be sodium or potassium silicate solution.It also wouldnt dissolve all that quickly  think glassware in a base bath for how long it would take. Of course using finely powdered silica speeds it up a bit but not all that much.One way to make a strong solution relatively quickly is to prepare your sodium silicate dry first then dissolve it in water. This can be done by melting sodium hydroxide in a steel crucible then slowly adding silica granules to it. This forms fused sodium silicate. Which can be poured while molten onto a steel plate to make a thin layer which is easily broken up into small pieces when it cools and solidifies. Then just dissolve these in water.,chemistry,cnum9to,1,t5_2qhf9

3053014,0,t1_coedgvi,Good question. I was lucky because I worked at a company going through a growth period. Lots of smallmedium companies will have periods of strong growth where they are expanding and hiring based on a projected need or for new projects. Its easiest to get into a company straight out of school at this point just be sure to apply often when you see jobs relevant to what you want to do. Dont be too picky at first  just go for the interview and be honest. You can always say no if you are offered a job below what you want but use the experience to better prepare for what they want.Very large companies take the top pharmabiotech companies will mostly be replacing employees that leave though a lesser number of jobs will be created when new projects come online. Large companies are often putting out the  years minimum experience required because they dont want to waste time training you on basic GMPSOP guidelines. Though if you ever had a chance to apply as an intern or summer student or even work with an industry partner in grad school I would strongly recommend looking into that The first step is getting your foot in the door and showing that youre not useless and that you want to be better. The second step is being honest with your boss about where you want to be in  year  years etc dont forget to be honest with yourself too. And the third step is making connections with others in your company. You dont have to go buy the CEO coffee but if you chat with people from different departments word will get around that you arent a moron and youll have a good chance at getting an interview for a better position if theyve heard your name in a positive way before!,chemistry,coefybp,1,t5_2qhf9

3431278,0,t1_cpir1xu,The reason you shouldnt put silicone fluid into a system designed for glycol fluids is simply because the two types of fluid dont mix. Glycol fluid is hydrophilic silicone fluid is hydrophobic  it would be like trying to mix oil and water.However if you completely remove all the glycol fluid first then you can replace it with silicone fluid. To get rid of the glycol fluid residue you could wash the pipes out with acetone then blow dry air or nitrogen through the pipes to evaporate any acetone residue away. Then the system will be clean enough to introduce silicone fluid.Im not sure about silicone fluids compressing more. Fluids of all types are incompressible  thats why they are used for hydraulic systems. However you would want to pick a silicone fluid with approximately the same boiling point as the glycol fluid you are replacing to ensure it can stand up to the same thermal stress.,chemistry,cpje3zp,1,t5_2qhf9

Basically you are looking to simulate a chemical system which is extremely difficult with any real degree of accuracy computational chemistry is a whole branch of science that works on this. It is not only conceptually difficult because molecules are pretty complex systems but its also computationally extremely expensive. As others have said the closest option is to find previous examples of similar experiments.Within AChems a large portion of them ignore energy and explicitly state reactions. So for example you define that ABgtAB and then A and B meet in your reaction chamber they just become AB.basically this is just grammers with a spacial component.

3784699,0,t3_33pvd7,I wish that there had been at least a brief mention of fblock chemistry even if it just covered a few notable deviations from standard dfun.I ended up doing my undergraduate honours project on an actinide complex and it would have been awesome to have everyone myself included know a bit more about them so that my presentation could spend less time introducing important fundamentals and more time discussing other important points.I really enjoyed our lectures and exercises involving TanabeSugano diagrams and would hope that every class would involve them they really helped develop chemical intuition for me.When we did powder xray crystallography there was a brief explanation in nd year a bit more of an explanation in rd year and it became much more in depth in th year with assignments and exercises involving use of VESTA and FullProf and I felt like the explanation given in later years should be mentioned earlier even though theres probably no time for it.  At the very least Id like to see a timeresolved powder xray experiment described earlier rather than later since it helps visualise the importance of the data.

3942410,0,t1_cr5cqy4,gt do u think that a single person during their masters andor Phd can keep or find himself in the position of exploring both traits equally organic synthesis and analytical characterisation ? if so what domain would that be ? toxicology ? any other ideas ? Toxicology is closer to biology in the sense you need to understand why certain compounds do what they do and also how to test for them rather than traditional chemistry so that doesnt sound like what you want to do.  Synthesis and analytical are two huge fields and you can choose to specialise in one.  The big difference between the two is specialising in analytical you dont get to do much synthesis however you get to learn the finer intracacies of maintaining incredibly complex and cool machines such as an NMR.  During organic synthesis solving your data NMRs mass specs crystal structures IRs etc are part of the job so you get to do analytical whilst doing full time synthesis which sounds like what youre after.gt And last but not least do u believe that nowadays technological innovation in chemistry is more prone to happen in RampD research than in academia? Im not qualified enough to say.  Having a shot at it though Id say academia as they discover something incredibly interesting which is then looked into by companies who tailor it to be a cost efficient and money making part of their process.,chemistry,cr5o2oe,1,t5_2qhf9

4232600,0,t3_39ecut,No they are not. Linear dichroism measures the difference in the absorption of perpendicularly polarized light and parallelLy polarized light. If your sample is isotropic it will no show any linear dichroism because it absorbs equal amounts of both kinds of polarized light. In a similar manner circular dichroism is the difference in the absorption of left and right circularly polarized light by a sample. Linear dichroism is typically displayed by anisotropic samples like liquid crystals which are aligned in on direction. So the absorption of either perpendicular or parallel polarized light will be different than the other and the sample will show linear dichroism spectra. Let me know here if you have more questions. Edit. Just to make it more clear in a typical ir absorption experiment the light used is un polarized. Also what I just described applied for absorption spectroscopy in all regimes of the em spectrum. ,chemistry,cs2pbi2,3,t5_2qhf9
4238558,0,t3_39hd22,Ive seen one and played with it for a little bit but not used one extensively. If youre the sort of lab that abuses your boxes and has to regenerate every  days I think a genesis could get very expensive. That said the reduced maintenance requirement is really appealing. Ive worked with some old boxes trying to troubleshoot air problems and it is ALWAYS a leak in the purification piping. There are a bunch of rubber gaskets held on with clamps between the two extreme ends of the purification systems and they do eventually fail. Usually what Ive seen is a clogged HEPA filter on the intake combined with a bad gasket between the intake and the blower. That combination seem to cause the blower to pull a slight vacuum in the piping between the intake and the blower which leads very rapidly to problems maintaining your atmosphere. If you can afford the replacement cartridges the genesis has a lot fewer points of failure.,chemistry,cs3dyog,3,t5_2qhf9

And if you are running a research group you want to get your materials from a reputable place and not have your students spending months trying to figure out why their experiment isnt working or isnt reproducible.When I was a grad student occasionally for equipment we could buy cheap things less than  on our credit card and get reimbursed.  We did this often if looking for software or optics on amazon or ebay.  On the plus side free bonus points on our credit cards Also one time for a class we were looking to purchase molecular modeling kits.  We could have got them much cheaper on ebay but institutional rules said that wasnt allowed.And if we wanted to buy more expensive things from someone who wasnt on the list there was a ton of paperwork involved especially if they were out of the country.So really why Sigma charges that much is because they can.

4723877,0,t1_ctpw1ds,Well the more information section of the website is a wall of incoherent text that is utter gibberish. When you google John Ellis Water you mostly get sites that debunk their claims. Also the company says all their profits go to the Ellis Estate in Shohola PA which they claim is some sort of boys and girls camp. When you google it nothing comes up so it apparently doesnt exist huge red flag. They also use vague and misleading terms and phrases Water cures anything is a meaningless phrase but sounds a lot like water cures everything. Also why do the machines cost so much? Ive been involved with in a lot of different research projects and nothing they describe a fancy still should cost anywhere near that much to make. It reeks of a scam.As for their scientific claims its hard to make a coherent argument against them since they are so incoherent. Theyre not even wrong. No heating water up now matter how fancily you heat it up wont change its average bond angle. Also note hydrogen bonding angle is not a scientific term. No adding an ounce of special water to a gallon  ounces of regular water will not make all of the regular water turn into special water. All of their evidence is anecdotal there are no studies no references nothing. If it really worked there would be evidence that it worked not just testimonials from supposed customers saying their water has more energy whatever that means and that they stopped taking their medications which is extremely dangerous.,chemistry,ctpzg7z,2,t5_2qhf9

5015662,0,t3_3jmp0i,There are two possible answers. kinetics vs thermodynamics. As you mentioned in your edit experimental evidence clearly shows that attacking the carbonyl is faster than deprotonation. Im not sure why exactly this is the case but possible reasons could be steric inaccessibility of the proton a very defined angle of attack for deprotonation the requirement of the carbonyl to adopt a certain rotamer which may be complicated by metal coordinating to the carbonyl oxygen.. A much better explanation is frontier molecular orbital theory which states that HOMOs react with LUMOs. Because CO pistar is much lower in energy than CH sigmastar the pi bond is going to be the first to break because its the LUMO.,chemistry,cuqkssd,2,t5_2qhf9

5091761,0,t3_3ko2n4,If you put in a drop of chloroform and swirl for a minute the drop will turn red if there is free bromine present. The red color is bromine so you have to pass the endpoint by a little in order to see the color. The carotenoid used to color margarine should not interfere with this. EDIT This only works in aqueous solution. I dont know if youre using an organic solvent for your titrations.The standard method of determining saturation is to add more bromine than is needed to react with all the double bonds. Bromine is more reactive and more reliable than iodine. Then potassium iodide solution is added to the mix and the unreacted free bromine reacts to form free iodine. The iodine is titrated with standard sodium thiosulfate solution with a starch indicator. The moles of iodine measured is equal to the moles of bromine added minus the number of moles of bromine consumed reacting with the unsaturated sample. ,chemistry,cuzqz1e,2,t5_2qhf9

Creating a new program can be somewhat complicated but again once you know how its easy. The instrument itself is good. We had some issues with the auto sampler arm and needed to recalibrate it frequently to get it to pick up the pans correctly but now that is resolved. Dont hit the arm out of position that will likely require arm recalibration. It uses quite a bit of gas and for that reason we turn the machine off on weekends. Having had no experience with a PE DSC I can say I like the TA DSC a lot and once you learn how to use it its simple. Also TA has AWESOME customer service.

Therefore the melting points are more dependent on the actual form they adopt whether they are metals like in the sblock diatomic molecules like oxygen or the halogens or even polyatomic molecules like sulfur or phosphorus and not so dependent on elemental properties like atomic number or atomic mass.

6266923,0,t1_cz1f41e,Another effect of hot water which I didnt mention before is that some fats and greases are solid in cold water. Therefore it is more difficult for soaps to dissolve them when cold. In hot water fats and greases melt so a soap or detergent can mix with them more effectively.Probably the main difference with laundry soap is the additives not the soap itself. Before laundry specific soaps were invented ordinary solid bars of soap were grated with a cheese grater into the laundry. The small flakes of soap produced by grating dissolved more easily than a large bar and made a more homogeneous solution.Modern washing powders exploit a similar effect though the granules are even smaller than grated soap so dissolve faster still.Traditional soaps are sodium salts of longchain carboxylic acids. But modern detergents are alkylbenzene sulfonate salts which are more soluble than traditional soaps. So these can dissolve faster and form more concentrated solutions.But the additives have a significant effect. Sodium percarbonate is added as a bleaching oxidizing agent. This is really just hydrated sodium carbonate with one of the molecules of water in the crystal structure replaced by a molecule of hydrogen peroxide.This acts as a stable solid source of peroxide. When it dissolves the peroxide is released into solution. The sodium carbonate also dissolves forming an alkaline solution. It is possible to wash clothes with sodium carbonate alone hence why it is also referred to as washing soda.Other commonly used additives are sodium phosphate sodium polyphosphate citric acid or EDTA. The purpose of these is to chelate to soluble calcium or magnesium keeping those ions in solution. This is for two different reasons. First it prevents calcium being deposited on washing machine heating elements as limescale. But more important is the prevention of soap scum. Once dissolved soaps can combine with Ca or Mg ions to form insoluble salts which float to the surface. This takes some of the soap out of solution and inhibits the formation of soap bubbles lather thereby reducing the cleaning effect.Modern detergents and the additives all dissolve more readily in cold water than traditional soap. So this accounts for laundry soaps and washing powders being more effective in cold water than traditional soaps.,chemistry,cz1z9tv,2,t5_2qhf9

6497336,0,t3_44n94k,OP I have a few questions for you and a few comments as well  Did you do your masters in the U.S. or U.K.Commonwealth programs? The reason I ask is that in the U.K. a masters is often a prerequisite for a PhD and is considered a probationary year even though youre likely already working on your PhD project. In those cases you get a mix of people who are in a M.PhilM.Res. program that is the probationary year of their PhD program and people who are only doing the M.PhilM.Res before going elsewhere for their PhD. In the U.S. its different because most people do their PhD programs in one go and get their complimentary masters in the process. Doing a masters by itself is very hard to get funding for because most funding HHMI NSF etc. is for PhD students. And most University stipends are also for PhD students only  masters programs are the cash cows for the universities. Thats why most people just do a PhD since its fully funded anyway.  I definitely agree with your suggestion to stop and evaluate. However I would say students should evaluate their situations before entering graduate school. Did you know why you were going to grad school or did you enter directly out of undergrad? Because its a hard  years if you dont have a very good reason why youre there in the first place. Thats why most of the graduate students I know have taken years off to work in industry etc. to figure out what they do. Coming back for a PhD program for them is just the next logical step in the advancement in their careers and they know why theyre there and where they want to go afterwards. The unhappy ones I know are the ones who didnt do that  who didnt have a very clear reason for being there in the first place.  As I mentioned above masters programs are cash cows for the universities in the U.S. If you elect to do a PhD program and quit halfway through to do something else one thing that might come out during interviews is whether your masters was a masters program or part of a PhD and if so why you didnt finish. Then it might be harder to get back into grad school later on since quitting halfway through would be a red flag to potential PIs. It obviously worked well for you and I commend you for it but this is just something that other students may face and may not be able to overcome. ,chemistry,czrdfnk,10,t5_2qhf9

Since the flow of air through the tube is in one direction the color change starts at the inlet end and works its way down the tube. In order for this to give reasonable results you need a pump that pulls air through the detector tube at a specified rate for a specified time. These pumps are expensive but its possible to build one. Google detector tubes. Theres lots of information there. Airway irritation is often caused by peroxyacetyl nitrate a common air pollutant generated by the reaction of other pollutants in the air.

Nowadays probably the most popular one is a rather organic one you mix a metal with manymany components ligand additives and see what is coming out from the soup. For this an example would be a putting MCl  L  AgPF together and use it in catalysis.Then you can have something where you have a focus on the metallic part. You isolate metal complexes and see what they do stoichiometrically and catalytically. With the previous example you take MCl  L to make LMCl and then do another reaction to form LMPFYou can have approaches where you focus on getting a specific product or you can have an approach where you are looking for application for a metal system.

Due to hydrolysis your isolated metal ion would be exposed in solution shielded only by the dielectric constant of the solvent etc. Its range of electrostatic  interaction with other species would be a lot longer than the range of its counterpart in metal bulk.A metal ion inside a piece of metal is pretty effectively shielded from the outside by the sea of electrons.That is why catalysts tend to have a high surface to volume ratio. Put another way isolated metal ions easily participate in chemistry. Metal ions in the bulk dont unless you are talking about rapid corrosion.You can estimate that even if you broke off a piece of the metal your bulk metal ions would still dominate.

Unfortunately the methods scientists use are often very different than the aquarium kits so I cant say for sure what is in your kit. I can make some guesses though. Do your ammonia instructions ask you to add bleach? The salicylate method Im familiar with requires hypochlorite. If so the second bottle might be sodium nitroferricyanide. I just looked this second reagent up....I use a different method for ammonia in my class so Im not very familiar. Nitrite is usually measured using the Griess reagent NED napthylethylenediamine and sulfanilamide. There is also probably an acid unless youre instructed to add that separately. We use HCl.

That surface doesnt want to exist it much more comfortable being glass bonded to more glass but now all of those glass glass bonds are bonds dangling in the air which makes them unhappy corresponds with a high energy situation. This is the reason why even an atomically thin crack requires some amount of force to open because you have to overcome the resistance of the glass to forming more glass to air surface. Those dangling bonds might be more happy in a liquid like bleach or water which could cause a crack that was already there but not large enough to propagate in air to open up when the bleach was poured into your jar. ,chemistry,d59y44p,36,t5_2qhf9

8482590,0,t3_4vvt92,So the further you get out of undergrad the less people will look at your GPA. Right now college is kind of the culmination of your career and so it is the easiest metric to just look at a GPA. For a lot of science related courses they only care about your GPA in the specific area and so it is possible to look decent if you did well in the classes that were most important to you. All in all I would say that graduate school may not be the best path  if you struggle with academia since so much of graduate school is learning how to present yourself and your research to other scientists. Sure the learning can be more problem solving but that is only a portion of graduate school and so I would talk to some of your professors seriously about the validity of graduate school.That said there are many other paths that can be very rewarding. Industry research positions are available and do not depend as much on GPA. Now finding your first job in your field is hard. Finding this job with a meh GPA is harder because there are so many applicants they can screen out a bit by GPA. You can do a few things. . Practice interviewing. Show them that you want the position show them that you are worthwhile and you are not represented by your GPA. I was able to get the first job I got an interview for because I practiced and was prepared and so presented myself well.. Dont be idle. It may take a while after undergrad to find a job in your field. I took  months after graduating to find a position in chemistry that fulfilled my problem solving nature. I was proactive I went through hiring agencies I looked for jobs to apply for every day I found a minimum wage job so I didnt have a blank period of time on my resume. Stay busy be consistent.. Focus on your strengths. There are many things you can put in a resume and put on a job application. Dont focus on your GPA but focus on the important skills and mindset that you gained. When I applied for my research job My BS was a single sentence saying I got degrees in Chemistry and Math. The rest of my resume focused on the research I did while in undergrad the instruments I used the types of skills I learned working in a group how to manage resources things like that. Depending on the position you want you can present yourself in very different ways.. Dont be ashamed or try to hide things. There is a difference between focusing on your strengths and hiding your weaknesses. Dont try to hide your GPA or lie about it. That is the fastest way out the door. Everyone has weaknesses and it shows character to be aware of them acknowledge them and work past them. It shows a lot of maturity and room for growth if you are honest.. Be patient. Finding your first job is hard. Getting away from your undergrad and getting a job is difficult. It will take time and persistence. Dont give up when you dont hear back from the first   or however many places it takes for you to get a response. Its not personal its their business. Give it time dont give up and youll do fine.,chemistry,d61v9w6,15,t5_2qhf9

Scientific learning among girls should be encouraged. I think that would work far better than a company saying you need to hire X amount of women. However Im not sure men are currently losing opportunities because of this. Although the ratio of men to women in certain STEM fields biology chemistry medicine is about  the number of women in authorityhigher up positions is drastically lower. There are less female scientist role models for sure as well as less female STEM professors. And then once you get to engineering computer science and physics its still very much of a boys club.

In the early days of NMR they used permanent magnets and to improve the homogeneity theyd use small metal shims to modify the magnetic field in certain places. This process was called shimming.These days weve switched to superconducting magnets which are really powerful and really homogenous but still not perfect. Instead of sticking small pieces of metal around the magnet we run electric currents through small coils of wire to generate small magnetic fields that modify the larger magnetic field. The process is still called shimming.,chemistry,d82vvge,9,t5_2qhf9

9540689,0,t3_5bjiq8,The actual silicon wafers inside microchips are extremely small and thin even for relatively large chips such as a modern CPU. Besides which these are made of ndoped or pdoped elemental silicon not silicon dioxide.The black material the silicon wafers are encased in to make chips is usually some sort of thermosetting plastic containing extremely fine carbon powder such as lamp black to give it the dark colour. Thermosetting plastics are inherently brittle and chemically inert. They can be burned but not melted or dissolved by any solvent.The major source for silicon dioxide is the actual circuit board substrate itself. These are made from compressed mica or vermiculite impregnated with epoxy resins giving them a structure similar to glassfibre reinforced plastic albeit on a much smaller scale. The casings of small surfacemount resistors and nonelectrolytic capacitors are often made of similar material.Mica and vermiculite are magnesium silicate  aluminium silicate minerals. These can be melted but have rather high melting points so these are most likely responsible for the glassy material you have formed. As you have found this will mix with molten borax but not particularly well.Silicon dioxide sodalime glass sodiumcalcium silicate or pyrex glass sodiumcalcium borosilicate can all be slowly dissolved by concentrated sodium hydroxide solution. They can be dissolved rather more quickly in pure molten sodium hydroxide though this procedure is extremely dangerous.Whether you can successfully dissolve mica or vermiculite in sodium hydroxide either molten or in solution I dont know. It may be possible though. If I remember correctly magnesium silicate minerals can be dissolved in sodium hydroxide but aluminium silicates are much more resistant to the same treatment.,chemistry,d9p36uk,3,t5_2qhf9

9859770,0,t3_5giezs,I ll start with the TLDR You first create an emulsion by slowly mixing the ingredients which gives it the creamy texture and by adding oil or overcooking it you cause it to separate into proteins and fat.  Now if you want to go into more gory details read on This is a much more complex process than you may think and strictly speaking it is not so much a result of chemistry very few chemical reactions take place as biophysics changes in the form of proteins but not their chemical structure. There are probably whole books about the food chemistry of cooking eggs....Egg whites are mostly protein and yolks are mostly fat and lecithin which allows the fat to mix with water. A brief description of proteins structure may help understand a bit what is happening. Proteins are made of aminoacids linked together in long chains. These aminoacids are either hydrophilic like water or hydrophobic like oildislike water. When the protein is initially produced it has a structure where most of the hydrophobic part is on the inside and the hydrophilic on the outside. This would be the uncooked egg.The structure of each protein is very specific and delicate. If the conditions of the solution change dramatically heat pH acid from lemon oil will make the protein want to be inside out mechanical force beating the eggs the structure breaks down and in most cases can not go back to what it was before. Think of the as the cooked egg that can not be uncooked.How the structure breaks down and what happens afterwards depends on the conditions such as how much wateroilair is around what the extend of the damage to the structure is how was the structure got damaged acid vs heat and so on. Each set of conditions leads to a different form. For example you can have cooked egg whites or yolk omelette  beaten egg whites merengue mayonnaise... you get the picture. All these are just different forms and textures rather than different chemicals.The two major events that are taking place though are emulsification and protein aggregation. In emulsification proteins and lecithin coat the fat making it into tiny droplets that appear to be mixed with water. This state is rather delicate and can revert back to the individual components if the equilibrium changes. For example if the ratio of oil to proteins becomes too high the two may just separate because there is too much oil to be covered by proteins. In protein aggregation many proteins become insoluble in water come together and eventually precipitate.Edit Thank you for my first gold!Edit   ureformedcarnivore is making a good point about mallaird reactions also taking place. ,chemistry,dasr1rb,14,t5_2qhf9

If this is correct you or a colleague should be familiar with simulated distillation ASTM D. A simdis reports the temperature for wt percentage distilled ie.  was distilled at C. This would be a more appropriate analysis for your samples because there will not be a singular boiling point. You will need to use ASTM D because the correlation will be inappropriate because you are analyzing alcohols instead of petroleum fractions.    ,chemistry,db262i9,3,t5_2qhf9

To the first point although ethanol is probably a slightly better fuel less oxygenated the really significant point is that its a C product that is much more challenging to produce. There are already phenomenal heterogeneous catalysts for carbon dioxide hydrogenation to methanol. As a result methanol production from hydrogen and CO is just not that exciting an area.On the other hand electroreduction is pretty interesting because it bypasses the need for the production of hydrogen. The Kanan lab at Stanford had a really nice paper a couple of years back on the electroreduction of CO to ethanol and propanol ,chemistry,dbrtdhw,1,t5_2qhf9

In fact the LD value for potassium ferricyanide  mgkg is about the same as the LD value for sodium chloride  mgkg. The reason that potassium ferricyanide is not very toxic is because the cyanide ligands are very strongly bound to the iron ion in the center thus making them unable to participate in harmful chemical reactions in the body. Also sodium ferrocyanide a very similar compound is even added to table salt as an anticaking agent!,chemistry,dbuvfhv,16,t5_2qhf9

And the same is pretty much true for th graduates of the research group in the US Ive worked in But thats all anecdotal.The first article you linked basically tries to get trends out of three data points and that data is just employment at graduation.The second article is largely anecdotal and imo shows the big problem if you expect to work in that exact field you did your PhD on you will have problems. But there are a lot of other jobs for PhDs out there which might not have anything to do with chemistry or whatever you did as a PhD. The last one is interesting. Is there an explanation for a  increase in engineering graduates? Its also much higher than the rest which sometimes means you started to count differently.

I feel like you must have excelled in high school to begin doing research as a freshman or maybe this is just something your universitydepartment does. I ask this because in my experience people that are used to succeeding in their life can find research a real challenge. Research is a cold hard bitch that doesnt care about how much you know or how hard you try. The constant failing that is research does not fit with every personality type. You kinda have to roll with the mind set that most of what you do on any given day isnt going to work out the way you plannedwanted it to. Additionally its not a reflection of your worth as a person. Lab workresearch is a trial and error process. Continue to ask questions learn from your mistakes and keep chugging eventually youll start seeing progress in your work.Edit What do you mean when you say your column doesnt work?Lab techniques are pretty person specific and have a lot to do with who taught a person. For many techniques there is not one perfect way to do it but a variety of permutations that are all acceptable and equally valid.

I was in a similar position with physics  actually Ds on both midterms and terrible quizzes. Ended up making it up on the final. I know its easier said than done but stressing over this will only make you perform more poorly. Now is a time to prioritize study less for other classes study more physics lose out on sleep if you need to not before exams though.Furthermore talk to the prof youre doing research with explain to them the situation and if you have been doing as good research as you have stated I would think they will be understanding then again i never did undergrad research.Furthermore if it comes to it why are loans not an option? No need to answer on a public forum like this but I dont think the future is as bleak as you think it is and this is coming from someone who has experienced personal tragedydepressionanxiety all throughout undergraduate educations.

11493151,0,t3_641eww,I did the exact same thing and took  before . Honestly that was a huge help for me since I took a  year break between high school and college. You should have a thorough understanding of the periodic table and how to pull information from it. The biggest thing I can recommend is to get a very solid grasp on stoichiometry. Obviously there are some more detailed concepts covered in  but if you dont have a good grasp on stoichiometry and conversions then you will struggle. In a similar vein make sure that your algebra skills are up to date. There is quite a bit more math involved with the stuff covered in  so if you struggle with algebraic concepts then you need to brush up on those as well.If you havent taken any basic physics courses you may want to try and read a little about that too as you start introducing energy into equations it helps to have a basic understanding of what those energies do otherwise it becomes just another variable with no meaning to you. For me its easier to remember when it actually relates to something Im familiar with.As far as memorizing things goes it depends on your professor. Mine abides by the rule of memorize how to use the references dont memorize the reference so we are given formula sheets and certain tables depending on what is covered in the test. Mainly our tests focus on the application of those formulas and laws and less on simple memorization of them dont worry though you will have them all memorized in no time!,chemistry,dfyqxat,3,t5_2qhf9

At some point along the abscissa is the activation energy of the reaction youre interested in. As the temperature increases the entire curve shifts to the right so the number of molecules with energy above the activation energy increases. The higher the activation energy on the other hand the more the activation energy barrier shifts to the right so fewer molecules have enough energy to make it over the top.
