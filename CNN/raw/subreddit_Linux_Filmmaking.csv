7528700,0,t1_d2x7htt,gt Note Lightworks is not has never been and is unlikely to ever be open source. Its annoying that they managed to generate so much goodwill and misinformation from a single press release in .My mispeaking sorry! I know its not opensource I always make that mistake of lumping Free Linuxavailable as open source when I know fullwell that thats not the case.Openshot exports to XML only so Id have been able to send a finished project to the colour guy for instance but not to the sound guy who wants OMF audio to bring in to Logic Pro X.I have heard something about Stem exports in KDENLIVE but I havent been able to properly find any instructions to do it  Ill take another look.Ultimately Id love to be able to use these various pieces of software and demonstrate why the opensource community is awesome... the workflow to the professional nonFOSS tools is incredibly limited it seems. Drat. Thanks for all your links Ill read them all over!,Linux_Filmmaking,d2xz5uk,1,t5_3b3rd

8784627,0,t1_d73qy0i,Kdenlive is something I actually gave up on. I must try it again then. It used to just crash for no real reason with no log of the event...just gone. It gets old fast. Blender is my option of choice even though using it is a far greater learning curve.Interesting workflow you have there. D,Linux_Filmmaking,d73r1n5,0,t5_3b3rd
9812645,0,t3_5fra4n,Well to be honest Im not sure this is the place to ask for constructive criticism about this kind of video.Very little editing was made you are not talking about GNULinux or free software related issuesIts an average vlog about life philosophy Im not really sure what to say more than unrelated ,Linux_Filmmaking,damm9v1,1,t5_3b3rd

10358583,0,t3_5oc1l4,Ubuntu Studio is all set up for artistic work but Im not sure most people will need all that if offers. For Blender and Krita I think most distributions would be perfectly fine. I use both on Linux Mint and have no problems.,Linux_Filmmaking,dci7fen,1,t5_3b3rd
