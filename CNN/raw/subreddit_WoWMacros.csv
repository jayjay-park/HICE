The second portion is modshift focus Charge. This is the first thing the macro reads and the brackets give it a requirement. modwhatever tells the macro that if you press what is after the mod do the following. the focus tells the macro that the target is focus. you can do pet whatever to tell it the target. All of it is in brackets because its the parameter. whatever follows the brackets is modified. in this case only when you press shift will you charge the focus. the  charge tells the macro that if the requirement wasnt met in this case being a charge on the focus target then do the following which was just a basic chargeI hope this answers your question.
