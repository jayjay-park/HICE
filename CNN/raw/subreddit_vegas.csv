883629,0,t3_247vm4,I dont know the specific rules in Nevada but in general private homes dont offer renters the kind of protection that multiunit buildings do. Basically outside of whatever written contract you have you dont have any rights at all. This situation is sometimes called a holdover.On the other hand giving you notice and actually evicting you are two different things. They do need to go to court for eviction and courts routinely give evictees extra time. That would cost the new owner both time and money. I would suggest you contact the owner and negotiate a fair arrangement.I had a friend who asked for  days moving expenses deducted from the rent and security deposit returned. The owner refused. Nine months later she finally moved of her own accord with the eviction still tied up in court no rent paid or due and a countersuit for  that she eventually won. That was a dumb landlord. ,vegas,ch4pzz1,1,t5_2qhrs

I took my rightful spot on the floor. About half an hour later drunkass Dave showed up but he was without his COX shirt. I myself had my own shirt accosted in return of a CCDC shirt fuck me for grabbing a clean  ICP tour shirt for a quick Walmart run and he said it was because they said it could potentially offend somebody. The couple other guys awake on our side of the room nodded their heads or chimed in but I was just laughed at for getting caught wearing an ICP shirt. It has nostalgia goddamn it.Anyway for one night I knew a drunkass named Dave and once he sobered up he seemed like kindve an idiot. But who am I to judge.

I play relaxing instrumental music that I wrote myself and most of my tips come from middleaged women thanking me for making the Strip seem peaceful.Recently Metro gave me a citation for using a small relatively quiet amplifier which I use for its chorus effect citing that they heard me from  feet away which is illegal. My amp cannot even REACH  feet outdoors.I went to court last Monday and had the option of fighting it and risking them upping it to public disturbance and risking mos. in jail or paying  fine and  hours of community service and staying off the Strip. I obviously took the deal.I went back to the Strip to visit family on vacation and walked by my old stomping grounds. On the bridge I usually play on were three panhandlers with signs and below was a guy with a fourstring acoustic guitar screeching punk music.Those are my replacements. Because theyre exercising freedom of speech but my tiny amplifier was a public nuisance.What we need is a permit system.You want to perform on the Strip? Pay  outline what your act is and get a license to do so that can be revoked if you dont follow the guidelines. Dont have a permit? Get fined. Thats what they do in Boston and it works beautifully.Without that you just have cops ticketing anyone they can for any reason thinking that if they get one random person off the Strip theyre helpingregardless of what that person is doing.When I would play a bridge the beggars would go elsewhere as I was making all of the money on that bridge.Now my old spot is covered in urine and cardboard signs.

1987166,0,t1_cksm2di,Nope it actually took me almost four years after my GED to be even close to prepared for Uni. What I would recommend emphatically after you get your GED or go to Desert Rose HS for your diploma if your only missing a small number of credits is to start this process at the College of Southern Nevada. CSN will go above and beyond to help you succeed all you have to do is put in the work. Plus getting your Associates degree at CSN means you can transfer in the credits you received to any university in Nevada as a way to clear out any general studies courses that are required for a bachelors degree which will save you a huge amount of money. Im going to level with you this process is going to be hard and you absolutely have to be committed to accomplishing your goals. When I started out I was in remedial everything. I had never written a single essay or got past Algebra  in high school. But I worked constantly and was willing to sacrifice pretty much all of my free time for the past five years to get where I am. That being said its okay to feel a little hesitant when you first start out. I dont know your situation but for me the idea of going back to school was as daunting as summiting Mt. Everest and I vividly remember wanting to give up the moment I sat down in my first class. It gets better though as you become more comfortable in a classroom and start to build strong study habits any trepidation you may have towards achieving your goal starts to fade away and before you know it your sitting in a dorm room browsing reddit while your roommate snores through the day .If you have any other questions feel free to ask,vegas,cksnk22,2,t5_2qhrs

2864762,0,t3_2sw2y9,Las Vegas has no history. As soon as something begins to qualify as such its either torn down or reskinned as something new. I promise that if someone came along with the right amount of money theyd have no qualms whatsoever about demolishing literately any building they wanted. Hell the Luxor is one of the most famous modern structures we have but the day they stop generating a profit that light will be turned off in a heart beat. Im not just referring to casinos either. Freaking city hall was gutted to become the headquarters for Zappos. Im sure there are a few old buildings around but I have yet to stumble on them unlike most cities where actual historic districts are fiercely protected. There is also no local culture except that of greed and easy money of course. I dont mean that as an insult either its just my personal observation. Any type of history outside of said greed is brought in temporarily by people who move here and then goes away again just as easy. This is the most transient town Ive ever been in and that alone makes it fascinating. I can have conversations with people from every corner of the planet on any given day but ask someone who was born here about Vegas and theyll pretty much just talk about leaving. Theres only a couple of families in town that were started here in the beginning and its not like theyre keeping any history alive. Please dont take my shitty attitude too seriously though. I love this town. Ive been here four years now and while Ill probably be moving on soon its the only place Im having trouble leaving so far. Honestly I fully encourage you to move here and enjoy it but if its some romantic historical tale that youre after Im afraid youre out of luck.

Tell them youre looking to propose and see if theyll let you in min before they open for the night. If the main deck best view in the city IMHO is too crowded or you want something extra private they have secluded themed backrooms that are stunning e.g. Imported wooden walls scuptures etc from a Buddist temple. On top of that they have dinner  you can get there or go to another restaurant at the Mandalay Bay. If you have some  to spend look into Fleur they have a private Chefs table that I promise will not disappoint.A friend just did something similar at the ghostbar another option. The manager at the ghostbar took their pictures and gave them free champaign. Another option would be to go to Redrock the Hoover Dam or do dinner at one of the restaurants in the Bellagio behind the fountains where you might have more privacy.Goodluck!,vegas,cq8uk9c,1,t5_2qhrs

3741636,0,t1_cqiqfog,i would say my general con advice is check the schedule now to see if there are any panels you want to attend.  most conventions i go to are much smaller than San Diego so ill check the line an hour or so ahead of time.  not really knowing anything about this one in terms of size you may even want to just do a quick check  hours ahead of time.  unless youre looking for something super rare on the dealer floor i recommend doing at least one full circuit to price check.  theres often a wide difference between dealer prices especially when the item is more common and dealers have to compete more.  and haggle!  as simple as seeing something you want for  and saying hey you take  for it?  it helps to have the cash youre offering in your hand at the time. if the dealer sees it it can trigger the deal centers of the brain and your chances of hearing yes goes up.  your ability to get a good deal also increases over time.  sunday afternoon is typically a great time to save some money here and there as dealers try to lighten their inventory before packing it all into boxes and make a profit on the weekend.also cash.  have it.  lots of dealers will take cards now that they can take them with their phones but you might get charged a small fee and cash is going to be faster and more efficient anyway.bring your own water if you can.  that  bottled water at walgreens is going to be  at the show and by the time you realize you want it youre likely to be in the middle of the floor trying to find that one place you saw where they were being sold when you first came in.  and when you get there  minutes later youll have to stand in line to get it. snacks too.  bring snacks.thats the important stuff the broad strokes based on personal experience.  if you have any specific questions let me know!,vegas,cqirrmq,3,t5_2qhrs

4411502,0,t1_csmsxzh,Not that Im defending Solar City in any way shape or form but some of your info isnt accurate. Some of it is but that doesnt justify the inaccuracies. Also your bias about the rebates is a problem. I think youre looking at this the wrong way. Solar City isnt stealing your rebate. A homeowner using Solar City to install a system isnt spending any money. You havent bought anything. What youre doing is leasing them roof space and agreeing to buy the electricity the system generates. They own and maintain the system not the homeowner. There is no theft involved when clearly it wasnt the homeowners to begin with. Youre giving up the rights to the rebate when you agree to lease Solar City the roof space  how else can they sell you electricity at a reduced rate while the homeowner contributes nothing monetarily? Remember what mama always said you cant get something for nothing and if it sounds too good to be true it probably is.As for getting your moneys worth out of the investment that is residential solar... Youre absolutely right  it takes years sometimes more than a decade to see any sort of substantial or quantifiable return. Even more so for houses that werent ever designed with solar or even high efficiency appliances in mind. The best you can hope to do with an existing house and todays level of technology without doing a major remodel is to partially decrease your monthly electrical bill. The problem is that most people dont want or have the ability to spend k or more to reduce their monthly electric bill and might be better off spending that money on a high end HVAC system or better insulating the house.,vegas,csmwsyc,1,t5_2qhrs

Be sure to use it though any time you are playing though even if it just lowlimit slots or just playing for a short while. You want them to see that you playing on their property. After you get home you will start receiving offers in the mail and your email. Some of those offers are pretty good even for a lowlimit player. In addition consider getting a Total Rewards Visa. I use mine for virtually every transaction from getting gas and groceries clothing cell phone bill entertainment and so on. I dont have to carry cash with me and I pay off the balance every month. In doing this I get about  reward point a month. In a years time that alone equals about  in comps when I visit Las Vegas.edit The Total Rewards Visa also gives you an instant upgrade to Platinum status.

5769442,0,t3_3u3we3,So there is other options. I work for SolarCity out here and you can obviously switch to them as your energy provider. Out here in Vegas sadly you cannot not go  off the grid. NV Energy has an absolutely dumb monopoly and its impossible. The most any solar company in the LV area can do is offset your power consumption by  and the last  will always stay with NV Energy. Its stupid I know but they wont change it anytime soon.If you own your home its the only other option out here. People are so tired of NV Energy changing their rates all the time and no if anyone pipes in and says that NV Energy is cheaper than solar youre HIGHLY misinformed.Right now SolarCity can do an absolutely  free installing of solar for you. They will maintain it monitor it and not charge you at all for the installation. What we do is utilize your roof to create power feed it back in to the grid and credit you with whatever power you create in excess for the month and apply those credits back to you during the months you need to use them.Outside of that option you can buy the panels lease em etc but most people arent too excited about dropping thousands of dollars on panels so the free option is what most people go with. This is all possible thanks to google just giving SolarCity Billion in funding to offer free solar to people.If you have questions feel free to message me or something. But like others said in Vegas sadly there is no other power company around outside of Solar. NV Energy has a crazy stupid monopoly out here. Thanks Warren Buffett.edit Also after reading some other comments there are people talking about going in excess of  power which you can do if you get the panels and install them yourself.

5868905,0,t3_3vd6f3,Ive said it before and Ill say it again Bachi Burger is one of the few places in Vegas I will never set foot in again.  Went twice had awful service both times despite it not being remotely busy.  Waited  minutes before a server came over to take my order and  minutes after I was done eating waiting on the check  BOTH TIMES and had an empty drink for  minutes.  Honestly I found the burgers overpriced and pretty plain as well.  Wrote a yelp review and the owner of the place went psycho on me writing multiple pagelong messages.  While repeatedly talking about how rigorous their training was for their servers he kept talking about how everyone else loves and raves about their burgers fries etc.  Sounds like they treat their employees like crap too Despite what someone else wrote about Bobbys Burger Palace having salty meat I probably think thats my favorite.  Cant stand Bobby Flay on TV and I think hes a total scumbag but the burgers are very good.,vegas,cxoy06r,1,t5_2qhrs

6643225,0,t1_d06as7d,I find that funding the subsidy for net metering by having the non net metering group pay for it equally unacceptable. Mr. Davies also completely ignores the facts about the incentives and net metering rates  they were never designed to be nor were they represented as permanent. The net metering rates incentives even the process for joining the net metering rate class has changed at almost every legislative step of the way. Since its inception in  this program was always designed to move toward little to no incentives. The program was also never designed for rd parties to come in subsidize all or part of residential on site generation system and then lock the current homeowner into a power purchase agreement. No real argument about how the PUC dropped the ball in regards to being pressured by NV Energy... But having been aware of the various changes to the program through out the years I can honestly say that the rate change decision wasnt over night. Its been on the books for years and everyone involved with this knew that especially SolarCity.

You can stop and visit Sand Hollow state park which is a must! Seriously one of the prettiest places Ive been. Then you can go into Zion itself which is just gorgeous. We decided to go another route home through Bryce Canyon and on the way there from Zion you drive in and out of Dixie National Forest. We camped in Bryce it was late April and still snowing after there we drove home and went through Duck Creek.

Whatever you do dont let it ruin youre tripwedding but if you really think it will be an issue look into staying somewhere off strip like red rock casino which is a higher end casino on the far west end of the valley. The westin at lake Las Vegas is another good place to look into and thats even further away from the nonsense of the strip. ,vegas,d1x2izq,-1,t5_2qhrs

I got free rooms at the rio but they are the crappy mountian view and its our wedding so i kinda want something nicer.  So why not. Worst they can say is no right?

From MGM you can take the monorail anywhere on the Strip. You dont have the budget to leave the Strip.Avoid walking on the streets around the Strip at night.

Apparently not aware theres a shooting range out there. gtA drug dealer moved in down the block.A lot of people have a neighborhood drug dealer. Around here we have an ice cream truck that comes by even in the dead of winter. Pretty sure ice cream isnt his primary product.gtHe could walk away from his mortgage and lose the  he has paid or he can keep pouring his savings into the same hole.He never would have gotten it all back anyway.  gtMichael Hutchings with his wife Terrisa SaporitoHutchings and their children Natalia and Maxim at their yearold dream home in Las Vegas.Of course not that I ever considered Sunrise Mountain a desirable neighborhood with great neighborhood schools. I guess he was always planning on trucking them down to Las Vegas Day School?gtfamilies who bought at the peak or borrowed against their homes say they may never see any return on their  starter home.Most of those people have already done the short sale foreclosure or bankruptcy. Thats why were back to only . of our available inventory is REOShortgtSunrise Mountain  miles east of the Strip.To someone in New York that sounds like a stones throw. In reality another mile east and theyd be in desert wilderness.gtA burnedout Las Vegas home under foreclosure now used as an illegal dumping spot.Oh noes a bad neighborhood appears. It is not effective.gtOne in four homeowners in the Las Vegas area owes more to the bank than his or her home is worthThis is still an improvement.gtthey owe about  on an overdue homeequity loan they used to remodel their house.A half million dollar remodel??? Could have bought a new house for that. Theres why they are underwater. How many of those  in  is because of homeequity loans?gtBut she said the bailouts had ended up favoring banks over typical homeowners.Yes that was obvious from the start for anybody who was paying attention at the time.gt Sad story about the Jansen family who can barely make their house payment and whose adult daughter and  grandkids have moved in ending with a sad story of nobody being on the short wave radio.Yay an anecdote.,vegas,d62nwfp,15,t5_2qhrs

9398068,0,t1_d96ctu6,I have only ever been concerned with the Las Vegas Bowl not the Pro Bowl. Both have lots of empty seats so maybe thats why you are confused. One event takes place in Las Vegas every year the other never has. Youre like at least  or  posts deep in conflating the two despite me trying to point it out.If the Super Bowl were to come to town restaurants raise their prices hotel rooms get more expensive uber and lyft have surge pricing table minimums go up and most importantly gambling revenue would increase by several multiples.If you add up all of the spending for a couple coming to Las Vegas for the Las Vegas bowl the average spend is somewhere in the k range for a  day trip. If you look at a couple who goes to the Super Bowl spending on tickets alone will be k minimum.But since you wont acknowledge that k and  are different numbers lets talk about what you want to focus on which is people in seats because you dont have a leg to stand on there.Even if we assumed that the average fan going to the Las Vegas bowl is the same as the average fan going to the Super Bowl would it matter if one game is consistently a sellout and the other consistently leaves  empty seats? You cited last years quick sellout as if it were an annual thing. And then I remembered that last year was a BYUUtah matchup the two schools with the biggest fanbases in town. Looking back at the attendance numbers as you might expect the game is heavily dependent on the schools that are playing in it this of course due to the fact that it is a thirdtier bowl game. Just going back to  even with Utah in the game it only drew  people. Furthermore since you are convinced that the only thing that matters is how many people come to town do you really think that people that go to the Super Bowl are going to be locals? And do you really think that no locals are snapping up cheap tickets for the Las Vegas Bowl? Its pretty clear that one event will bring way more out of town fans than the other which is what you are saying is so important all along.So here we are still at the same point with an unretracted and still laughable contention that the Super Bowl and the Las Vegas Bowl are in the same ballpark. ,vegas,d979rqc,3,t5_2qhrs

Its only because of this artist that I want to go since im a fan. And im not setting my expectations with seeing him super up close or anything.  questions...when you went did they have the outside open in the past they would have the outside open sometimes for the nightclub and other times it would be closed and how long was Trey Songz on stage for? In the end...its free for me and my wife to go...so we wont be that let down...not if I had to pay for tickets...shit well I wouldnt even pay to see an artist at Drais lol.,vegas,dcov56n,1,t5_2qhrs

I dont work for the Cosmo so it might be different although its pretty common in the hotel industry. It will raise red flags and will be considered a loss of revenue if someone comes across your reservation that you paid  for a room that costs k. The front desk agents I know dont like to take that risk.They should at least comp you your resort fees and an upgrade which should be cheaper than  depending on how long youre staying.,vegas,dcsxgu9,3,t5_2qhrs

11595997,0,t1_dgadhl6,The  trick very likely wont work since Luxury Suites International doesnt have a very large inventory of rooms at The Signature and the next class of room up from yours usually has a significant price premium. They dont have a ton of rooms available to switch anyone into hence the problem if theres a maintenance issue. Usually you save a good  a night booking through them instead of The Signature directly but they are quite limited in what rooms they can give you. Ive never had a front desk person take the money and not upgrade me though so the worst is theyll laugh or spout some corporate policy and hand back your tip.

Lets be honest its mostly locals who already dont frequent the strip that are going to be discouraged.  But as far as tipping its not the valets fault.
