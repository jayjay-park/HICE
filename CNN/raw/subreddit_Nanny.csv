Do you try to bring up  before you interview then? I dont want them to think it is all about the money but what a waste of time not to mention awkward to find out you charge much more than they are offering. Edit to add a funny story I had been talking to one lady and we were hitting it off so well I actually forgot to bring up pay. She wants me to come over this week this will just be for occasional parttimedate night care. I got home and emailed her. She was like I cant believe we didnt talk about that! to my relief she pays hr.,Nanny,cl805ey,1,t5_33toc

4087012,0,t3_37d4ai,Im currently on medical leave but took a job for  an hour which is about what youd be paying a nanny. Heres what I provide for that rate Limited televisionscreen time about fifteen minutes per four hours mainly to help with a transition or for some quiet time. Prepare lunchdinner for child. Take child on outings playground library pet shop etc. Make sure child is safe diaper is changed etc. Get child started with independent play. Read books to child.For comparison My regular job I make  an hour plus free private housing. For that rate I had full lesson plans for my charges they spoke a different language and I taught all three kids to be fluent in spoken and written english was available whenever my bosses needed hey were going to be three hours lateneed you to stay overnightwant you to come in at am had no screen timeelectronics with my charges and was always fully engaged with them not just taking them to the playground or watching them play independently  actively playing along with them and dealing with any child related concerns that came up parent teacher conferences doctor visits etc.So  your salary is reasonable but dont expect to get a nanny whos going to go above and beyond for that rate. But honestly for a six month old you really just need someone to love your kid and make sure theyre safe. Id go with that and keep your three year old in preschool I taught preschool for two years  kids get socialized much more than a nanny can help them with. Possibly consider a nanny share if you can find another family with a child in the same age range as yours  it gets difficult planning activities for kids of different ages but dealing with two the same isnt that much of an added burden.,Nanny,crm57u9,1,t5_33toc
4091759,0,t3_37ghfx,So if I were in the position you are in this is what I would do. . Decide if I truly want to watch both children. Asking myself if I am capable willing and qualified. can I do the job? Or will the children and myself be better off finding an alternative. So based on how you answer these are my going forward suggestions. For staying and watching both.Commit myself to understanding developmental appropriate information pertaining to both age groups I suggest online searches. Showing confidence to the parents. And talk about any concerns they may have accidents will happen....they just will so if the parents cant see that then its time to move on anyways. Talk about schedules and getting out for field trips taking baby along and sharing the time among the girls with age appropriate things for both. If you decide you do not want both.Talk with parents and find out if you can stay on watching the baby and have the girl enrolled in summer camps or the YMCA...something along those lines. ,Nanny,crmooxc,2,t5_33toc

4800245,0,t1_ctzlg9p,I think the pay is OK youll find someone but they probably wont be of the caliber that regularly posts to this sub. I think light cleaning is okay as long as your expectations arent too high and the cleaning is light. A parenting philosophy is just how you go about things. Are you strict? Do you really care about manners? If your child was throwing a fit in the middle of the grocery store what would you do? Yes you need to withhold taxes. Talk to an accountant. For a parttime job like this you might have luck finding someone on care.com or a fb moms group.

5171895,0,t3_3luiv5,I usually tell the parents the first couple of weeks are us getting to know each other and you discovering what they enjoy so youll try different things and then reintroduce things they didnt like off and on as they get older.  forts chairs and blankets or setting up a tent  throwing all cushions and pillows on the floor to roll around onjump on  stacking things for them to push down or crash threw  drawing  reading  climbing sliding running swinging etc at the park  just running in circles at home  hockey pokey simon says if youre happy and you know it and other songs with dances. Even if youre just doing it theyll enjoy it pushing kicking or just playing with balls  playing with cars going on walks talking about and touching many of the things you see exploring  getting in the dirt  play doh chalk puzzles magnetics and stuff where they can create something  independent play is important. Sit back and let them discoverplay with their toys let them play together do not always intervene. Remind them to be gentle or to ask if needed peek a boo  bubbles  let them help you clean.

I believe in positive parenting teaching the children to label feelings own feelings be independent and constantly be training for real life with out the shelter of mom and dad. I talk with the kids completely through a situation. It takes time and building a bond and trust level. I would explain how I understand their want and validate that want. I explain how Im there to provide needs and occasionally a want will be fulfilled. I will explain what is available as choices to the situation all choices the child will make not I. I will explain what is tolerated as far as acting out and what isnt. And I will help them to come up with a solution they have chosen on their own that fits within the boundaries given.

5913113,0,t3_3wacuy,It sounds like she really hates her sales job right now so it could be a phase or she might be contemplating a life change. Unfortunately you cant know unless you ask. When she makes these notsosubtle comments press her a little. Maybe respond with a clarification So are you thinking of being a SAHM? or Hm interesting none of my nanny friends work for SAHMs I wonder what that arrangement even looks like! Or start mentioning your future plans Oh when charge gets a little older a year from now I would love to introduce himher to this ageappropriate placeactivity! or Hey I know this is pretty far in advance but Fianc and I are contemplating a trip to totally made up travel plans  months from now I just wanted to check some dates with you guys! Itll let you gauge her reaction and might open up the conversation a little. But you might benefit most from simply being direct Ask MB andor DB if they expect your current arrangement to remain the same over the next year. One thing that my bosses do with me is when we review our contract we talk about plans for the upcoming year  Tiger will start Kindergarten next fall but your schedule with Panda wont change or MB starts new hours on January  so lets talk about how that will affect your work hours  and for my part I also let them in on my future plansintentions to continue the work relationship major travel plans my desire to remain in the nanny industry for several more years etc. So both sides are reiterating our commitment to the arrangement. Now life is life so things can change without notice and thats why I always have a backup plan in case things dont go according to plan emergency fund alternate streams of income keeping abreast of other possible employment opportunitiesAs a side note I dont understand these parents who talk about money in a woeful way with their nannies. Its uncomfortable and manipulative. You are not responsible for how much your boss brings in per month or her personal finance habits. She agreed to pay you a specific rate and she has an obligation to uphold her end of the bargain. Grrr.  Also moms who continue working while losing money to daycare do so to stay relevant and employable in their fields. Sometimes it just makes sense to ride out the early years taking a small loss in the shortterm.Anyway I would have a conversation with her on a level youre comfortable with. No nanny job is forever so its a good idea to have a backup plan for when the familys needs inevitably change! ,Nanny,cxuqpgm,5,t5_33toc

I accepted a  day per week  hours per day position with  month old bg twins plus their  month old cousin as a nanny share. I just want to say how appreciated and welcome I feel by my nanny family. In the states I was in a position for over two years and never felt like I was fully appreciated and always felt like I was being taken advantage of but now I dont! To begin with the mothers had me come over several times per week for a couple of hours so I could watch the infants alongside the mothers so I could get use to the new position and learn their schedule and parenting styles. Each time theyd always offer me coffeetea and make sure I had a time to take to myself for lunch or offer to pick me up something when they ran errands. Now Ive started my regular hours they make sure I get a cup of coffee before I get down to business by taking their babies and playing with them until my coffee is finished. They also have been so sweet to tell me how happy they are to have found me and how wonderful of a nanny I am. I just feel treated like a part of the family and respected as opposed to the help.

Theres definitely already been a lack in housework done on my part as Ive been tired and nauseous. Shes been awesome at picking up some of that slack within reason and without me asking. And I know dynamics will change when Im home and baby is here and Im sure shell be giving me a hand with the infant as Im down for the count after being sliced open. And my maternity leave will probably taper with me starting back one or two days a week and working my way up to full time so then we get weird pay calculations with different pay for different days whether Im home or not. And obviously one toddler whos testing his boundaries in addition to a needy newborn is a recipe for chaos! Were both a little nervous about juggling both boys at one time.

8300049,0,t3_4suapr,I love infants!  I want to calm your fear on SIDS a little bit.  Obviously I cant promise you anything but heres what we know Baby should ALWAYS be put to sleep on his back.  Once the baby can roll over they are fine to sleep on their tummy but they need to get there on their own.   Babies should use a sleep sack instead of a blanket. Pacifiers can help reduce the risk. Theories include that it keeps the jawmouthairway open or sucking on a pacifier keeps the baby at a higher level of arousalnot as deep of a sleep.  Crib should be kept clear of bumpers stuffies blankets etc.  In my state the only things legally allowed in a crib at a child care center are the baby a sleep sack and a pacifier. Im not counting the crib sheet obviously.  I stick to this practice in private care because its just safer. One of the biggest risk factors is smoking in the house.  If its a nonsmoking family youve got that on your side. While SIDS can and sometimes does occur during nap it is more common during the night.There are some good resources out there if you google it.  Just look for articles publishes as recent as possible.As for the boredom Im a big fan of audiobooks and podcasts. ,Nanny,d5f2bcg,1,t5_33toc

One of the reasons I do encourage you to leave though is these toxic positions drain us. They make it impossible to continue to give the great quality of care we are capable of.  I wish I could take every child with me when I leave a bad situation like you describe but I also know that for the sake of all the children in my future I cant.  It is extremely tempting to want to do more try to make up for the deficit the parents are leaving.  I would never fault anyone for doing so because it comes out of a loving and kind heart.  But its like trying to put out a forest fire by spitting through a straw and it will end up destroying us too. Im glad to hear the children arent actually in physical harms way but I am sad for them.  I truly hope that their path is stacked with loving teachers coaches guidance counselors and others that can continue to breathe life into them.

My boss and I touch base DAILY. it helps that he works from home but he often travels and will still check in and he is fantastic about bringing things up in a non confrontational way. An example would be the one day I forgot to empty the diaper genie after him being gone  days. I explained I simply forgot it because things were crazy twins and two overnights he understood and it wont happen again because I now know thats a priority from him. Communication is so key you must bring it up and let her know whats not working its easier to fix it than it is to start over.

My f almost  has had a few bouts recently of really missing mom makes sense mom was home for the whole week between christmas and new years so was dad and brother now its just me and her. I just give her a hug as we sit somewhere comfy. f I want mommy. I want to cuddle her and kiss her. me I can understand that. You must love her and miss her. Yeah. I want her to be here to cuddle. I want to cuddle ltbrothergt too. Wouldnt it be nice if she could be here right this second to cuddle with? ltBrothergt too? yeah Wouldnt it be nice to be able to teleport whoever we wanted right when we wanted them? yeah Finishing off with a quiet snuggle on the couch until shes ready for the next thing. If more was needed I might offer to help her write a note to mom or draw a picture for her so that when mom comes home she knows how much f missed her. I dont get this at the begining of the day though it happens in the middle of the day so it might work differently for you with the parents just out the door.,Nanny,dca03fj,2,t5_33toc

Part of the benefit of having a nanny is that you get a third perspective on your kids  a third set of independent interests third set of unique things to do with the kids third set of worldview for your kids to experience.

So if I need to I will.I am of the opinion that I am fine with cameras and if told they are there or they are in plain obvious sight thats all well and good.They grey area or black for me is if I am not informed of a camera and stumble upon it ie a true nanny cam in a toy or something.In those cases I would call the parents to come home immediately and quit on the spot. I do not believe in a private residence that I should have to tiptoe around WONDERING if there is a camera.

10738456,0,t1_ddngwkc,I think the concept of multiple kids is daunting to beginner nannies. As they gain experience theyll see that multiples are actually easier.

10955519,0,t3_5wga9h,First you need to stop getting a flat fee. Nannies should never work salary imo. Its best to work for an hourly rateovertime. And include a guarantee in your contractagreement that you are to be paid  weeks per year. Meaning that if families canceltake a vacation or otherwise dont need care you still get paid. Flat ratesalary pay only benefits the family. As they can get extra work and hours without additional pay.

11237945,0,t3_60egsd,Its rather simple in most cases. You put in your notice as you would with any job and while your notice is being fulfilled you say your goodbyes then end your employment and start your new position.However with a nanny position that has gone south sometimes it may become hostile or personal making it a bit more complicated.It sounds like if anything they may be the type to become hostile or handle things unprofessionally due to how many nannies they plow through on the regular. If you think this may be the case I would put in a short noticetwo weeks max. A week if its really bad. Just let them know that you need to move onto something that better suits your needs and schedule. You dont need to to explain yourself by any means and hopefully they handle things appropriately. If they do become hostile which I have experienced you have every right to collect your last paycheck and make a swift immediate exit. Good luck!

I wouldnt take him to the library until recently because he would make random super loud noises. I recently tried story time and I basically had to give him snacks the whole time just to get him to stay in one place. His friend came over to play today and even though he was excited all he did was bump into her with his car take toys from her and generally annoy her.

11449217,0,t1_dftr0lk,Damn. Were talking about prepubescent kids. Before puberty its ridiculous to say that theres any major difference between boys and girls. Your gender does not define your temperament. Your gender does not define your interests. Your gender does not define your personality. Put a train set or a hot wheels track in front of a girl. Shell play with it. Invite boys to teaparties. Theyll love them too. The problem is all to often gender stereotypes are put on kids way to young. ,Nanny,dftrc9g,2,t5_33toc

11708751,0,t3_6721hq,I work for a WAHM currently. I dont entirely enjoy it and I wont do another WAH parent in the future. My MB often insists on putting together Baby Boys food at  months its mostly purees but she still wants to dish it up and I cannot put him down for a nap without her because she prefers to breast feed before hand. It isnt the worst but I feel awkward during his naps and often awkward the entire day. Not all WAH parents are like this but I would personally wouldnt work for another WAH parent. The closest I am considering is working with a  month old whos mom is having a second child this summer. Shell be home for maternity leave for  months and then return to work. But some people dont mind WAH parents. The sick days though is a major red flag. I firmly think that if you work  hours full time for a family then they should offer sick time. I also dont call in often. I had to call in more this winter than I normally do in a job because my area had freak snow storms and no plows to clear the road but the dad also couldnt get to work so it was expected that I wouldnt and they wanted me safe. Everyone gets sick sometimes and refusing an employee any sick time makes me wonder what other ways they will be micromanaging and obsessive. ,Nanny,dgn7tb1,3,t5_33toc
