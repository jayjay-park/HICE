2808147,0,t3_2rzbiz,El Salvador is beautiful and youll be surprised of how much it has changed. Now for safety I wouldnt recommend going to Apopa since it has a lot of gang members although if you are staying with friends Im sure theyll know where it is safe and where not. I would recommend for you to stay a couple of days on the city and visit nearby places and your friends and family nightlife is great in Paseo El Carmen Santa Tecla and the malls are also a lot of fun. You HAVE to visit the beaches specially stay at least a night or two at Playa El Tunco in La Libertad it is fantastic and youll meet the best people there. Other places you cant miss include Ataco Apaneca Suchitoto Plaza Volcn La Palma Malecn del Puerto de La Libertad also if you can rent a house in the beach Rancho en La Playa a few days I would recommend Costa Azul Costa del Sol Miramar Salinitas etc. If you need more help PM me I am currently living in El Salvador and would gladly help you,ElSalvador,cnna0i0,1,t5_2qs3c

3767624,0,t1_cqlq9ti,Well my starting point is FL. I wanted to drive to Machu Pichu but heavy crime throughout Mex Sal Hond and Colombia is kind of deterring me. Maybe Im being paranoid... I just dont want to risk it. Plus if I fly I get more time in ChilePeruArg.,ElSalvador,cqlqjjm,4,t5_2qs3c
