3951975,0,t1_cr6r2ft,Right once again taking things maybe a bit too far the African Children yeah maybe a bit over the top but the paper round thing was a joke so this whole fucking thing. One guy made thousands of dollars asking people to donate him  to make a fucking Omelette. Did we owe him anything? No. Did people still donate? Yes. Im sorry but people are really not getting the picture here. THIS was a joke That Omelette thing was a joke people understood that. Also please stop being so fucking argumentative. Thats really not gonna get you along in life. Or maybe if youre a politician but nobody likes them so youll probably fit right in there  ,Crowdfunding,cr6rc05,-1,t5_2ti0q

4572462,0,t3_3dnv8x,Hi mmosh I represent the crowdfunding platform Deposit a Gift here on reddit so Ive heard this question a lot. All or nothing fundraising was the model made famous by Kickstarter. Basically it means that your campaign is on a timer lets say  days to meet its fundraising goal and if you meet that goal by the time that the  days are up you get to keep all the money that you raise. On the other hand if you do not meet your goal at the end of the  days you dont get any of the money you raise and your contributors wont have their credit cards charged. Other than keeping all your money if you meet your goal one of the big pros of the all or nothing approach is that your campaign has a sense of urgency so more people are more likely to donate. On the other end of the spectrum is flexible fundraising. This is the sort of model that we use. Flexible fundraising means that it does not matter if you do not reach your fundraising goal you keep the money raised during the duration of your campaign. This sort of model believes that you are entitled to the money you raise and should not be penalized for not hitting a goal. It is often difficult to determine how much money a campaign will actually raise why should you have to start all over again if you cant predict how successful your campaign will be?Hope that helped answer your question!Deposit a Gift,Crowdfunding,ct6yvxz,1,t5_2ti0q

I put that in there because I want my company to avoid the political scene entirely something I think every company should do. It is a last resort because it involves a political entity not because it has to do with Trump specifically. I would be equally opposed to a host from Sanders the NRA or the ACLU. Im not here to judge anyones political views vote for a ham sandwich for all that it will bother me. I started this company to stop the scalping of the historical firearms community by companies such as Middlesex Trading Co Discriminating General and Loyalist Arms and to make everbetter reproductions of historically significant firearms. My concerns do not extend beyond catering to the needs of the historical community with fairly priced product.That being said this posting is a rather personal one so I felt the light jab was appropriate. My company will certainly maintain its own accounts statements from the company wont be coming through Gunwhistle.Thank you for the warning though. It is duly noted ,Crowdfunding,d4qbn22,1,t5_2ti0q
9321322,0,t1_d8xj0v8,gt not really all has to be compliant with a Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards level . We will be using Stripe for our transfers and this is provided.Id recommend adding that very relevant information to your KS.gt Have you used any of the transferring services? paypal venmo sqaure cash ect. social based meaning your interacting with each other. You go to dinner with a friend instead splitting the bill you transfer your half to them via app. If I really needed to transfer money to my friend I could use my banking app and transfer the money. There is no need for a second app. Youre adding an extra layer that just isnt necessary.gtThe questions youre asking are valid but the stage we are at is typically funded by family and friends so the campaign we have I feel has sufficient information.Yet here you are posting on Reddit and using KS. You dont do that if you just expect family and friends to back you.gtThe point here is if you feel the info on the campaign doesnt interest you enough to contribute   or even a  you dont have to stick around. The title here says If you would like to share your experiences or suggestions on how to generate more traffic that would be greatly appreciated.You seem rather defensive when I bring up these very valid points. Your idea is lacking way too many details and you dont explain why youre better than everything already out there.You need the  second elevator pitch.,Crowdfunding,d8xjo3l,1,t5_2ti0q
