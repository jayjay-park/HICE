I feel like the guy has bricks for hands too with the way he misses scoring opportunities.

While shotblocking is a useful talent to have in a vacuum the stat is meaningless.

From what I could tell limited viewings he has a lot of raw skill but needs to get used to his height and put on some more weight he is also really strong in the faceoff dot and can surprise you with his hands. He was used in all situations this year but still had limited ice time.He is still a couple years away from even being considered a success or a bust. When he was drafted he was expected to take  years to properly develop. He is a very long term project and we need to be patient with him as fans.

2591916,0,t1_cmwvgdn,Exactly. I do think though that long term Backlund might be a better fit as the shutdown rd line center with offensive upside than Granlund being a more offensive top six forward. It obviously depends on how the other GMs project each player but I would rather move Granlund than Backlund at this point with Bennett and Monahan being the  punch up the middle. Having said that the only return on a prospect like Granlund would have to be huge since I do think hes actually underrated as a prospect. Hes dominated every level hes played at and quietly had an unbelievable world juniors pts in  games so obviously itd be a big blow to our prospect pool but good defenceman are so hard to find and even harder to develop so it would make sense in a Yandle type scenario.,CalgaryFlames,cmwwflc,1,t5_2roln

I dont think thered be any power struggle there is a deep and profound respect between Gio and Iggy and it seems very clear Iggy is a team player through and through.Iggy would be another sterling example for the kids to follow and heck a big body RW goal scorer is precisely what we need.I dont know how easy it will be however to pry away Colorados top goal scorer... If he was on a one year contract like he was with the Bruins I have no doubt thered be a great chance hed come home.

6721556,0,t3_47mljx,i for one think russell is underrated and i havent know russell since he was ..if you look at the top  teams in the league russell could certainly compete for a spot as the th defenseman on probably  of those teams.his puck moving abilities have not even been fully utilized due to our pairings over the last  years. he carries the puck up the ice at a more normal pace than say brodie with a speed that is in line with the forwards. this should technically lead to more successful dumps. it just so happens flames struggle with puck retrieval which leads to poor possession numbers. basically weve been spoiled by brodies abilities. this is not the way we should expect all our defense pairings to play. at some point our forwards should be equally capable of consistently breaking out and entering the offensive zone while retaining possession. we are starting to see this now but for the better part of the first half of this season it just wasnt happeningit would be interesting to see him play for a team like washington where their forwards are consistently the first  to the puck on the dump.,CalgaryFlames,d0ekf2a,1,t5_2roln

Thats not something to bet on thats just a fact.The point still doesnt stand  Arizona has made it clear that theyre in no position to lose two of their best assets for Matthews. Theyre either winning him in the lottery or hes probably just not in their cards. Theyre not going to trade Domird for st because Domi and a Finn will help them win more often than just Matthews.Youre right that Puljujarvi and Domi would be hard to pass up for Matthews.

7148553,0,t1_d1qf2p5,The point is that just because youre classified as a veteran under NHL definition does not necessarily make you a good leader.  And Im not saying those  arent good leaders either but in the context of this discussion they failed.  Either they didnt have the lessons to pass on or they didnt try to help or they helped in the wrong way or or or... Those veterans failed them as a team and as a franchise because almost  years later the effects are still being felt. Theres a reason teams hire behavioural psychologists on top of all of the various coaches a players mindset outside of hockey is just as important to nurture and foster as the hardest slapshot.  I hate that this is even a thing it seems way too hippie lovein to me but when youre pushing these guys to be their absolute best in the world eventually you have to look at how a person acts and treats themselves and their teammates outside of the confines of the locker room.The veteran leadership at that time did not do enough to guide guys like Hall and NugentHopkins and Eberle along the path of not just winning but being winners and eventually that mentality just took over and theyve unintentionally passed it along to the later guys. Thats what I mean by a culture of losing the idea that losing is OK if we get a good draft pick out of it is something the management originally pronounced and now years later has completely pervaded the collective psyche of the team.

7632237,0,t1_d39eq8f,All good points... to me the biggest difference between the two is the fact that Tampa needs to move SOMEONE whether thats Stamkos Bishop Callahan Filppula Carle etc. in order to get under the cap whereas the Penguins need to move Fleury specifically in order to protect Murray.  Tampa has options Pittsburgh does not.  I just think this idea that the expansion draft will make goalies basically worthless on the trade market is getting overblown.  The thing is youre going to lose someone to expansion  if you trade Bishop for peanuts and then lose someone else to expansion youre basically giving away two players for nothing.  Or you keep Bishop hope he gets taken in the draft and you only lose one.  ,CalgaryFlames,d39qsjk,2,t5_2roln

7891662,0,t1_d42yy1z,But Laine and Pulju will almost definitely be NHL ready and neither will be our pick Keller is committed to BU so its NHL or NCAA for him and Bellows wont be our pick at . Therefore when comparing the  CHL player we are most likely to get Tkachuk Dubois Nylander Nylander is the only one who can go to NHL AHL or CHL while Tkachuk and Dubois are NHL or CHL. Given the talent levels of these  imo the AHL will most likely be way better for their development over the CHL and I dont think that the NHL will be the best for any of their development at this stage even though Tkachuk and Dubois do have NHL size I dont see the Monahanesque maturity in them. Not to say they arent very mature  they are just a notch below him  but being  in the NHL is only for a select group of highly talented andor highly mature players. Imo Monahan was barely at that threshold AND he was months older than both of em at the same stage. Thus it is quite relevant in regards to our pick since those three players are all in the Marnerzone of too good for CHL but just a notch below NHL ready.,CalgaryFlames,d433h3c,4,t5_2roln

8120137,0,t3_4qgb0t,Bad decision.I reject the idea that Raymond is not at the very least capable of performing as a bottom  winger on a team weak at the wings just because Hartley said so when Hartley is not exactly the best authority to appeal to.  Raymond even if he spent the season on the th line and press box is not likely to take the spot of someone more deserving.  If he stays and plays in the NHL that gives the team more flexibility to decide whether the current prospect wingers need another season of development.  If theyre ready now they can just put Raymond on waivers and bury him again if hes not claimed.  There is no real downside beyond the cap hit.And yes the team shouldve bought out Wideman.  Whether Widemans an NHLcaliber defenseman right now actually doesnt matter hes a .mil cap hit with a NMC.  And unlike Raymond Wideman along with Engelland and Smid absolutely his holding back a better cheaper player from playing.  Wotherspoon and Nakladal both performed well in a bottompair situation.  Kulak did the same when he was up.  Jokipakka could potentially move up to the second pair.  And unlike Raymond Widemans NMC prevents him from being buried in the minors to free up a roster spot.  And thats not even mentioning the fact that buying out Wideman would save the team more in cap space.So why is it a one versus the other situation?  Because the team only gets  normal buyouts until the current CBA ends and spending one of them on a player that doesnt need to be bought out while keeping a player who does need to be bought out is a mistake.,CalgaryFlames,d4sryed,4,t5_2roln

9621668,0,t3_5crnj5,gtThe problem with this one is im not seeing anything night in and night out that is making me feel like anything is getting better with this team.This is absolutely the key with this season.  Even if they lose its how they lose thats important.  You want the best example of a good rebuilding team it was Toronto last season.  Now far be it for me to demand Babcockquality coaching from anyone other than Mike Babcock but he gave the Leafs a good system that had them maximizing offensive zone pressure while minimizing defensive zone time whenever possible.  When they lost and they lost often it was clear that it was because of their roster last season.  They made mistakes and simply got outskilled but the system in place was a great one and watching the Leafs last season gave the impression that they could be very scary with better players.Now again Im not going to expect Babcock from anyone who isnt Babcock nor am I going to call for heads to roll after  games.  But what needs to happen is they need to start looking better on the ice.  More offensive zone pressure less being hemmed in their own end less reliance on stretch passes.  You cant blame Wideman and Engelland or Johnny missing training camp forever.  Whether its the system the implementation of the system or the players buying into it they need to actively improve throughout the season in order to inspire confidence for next season.And make no mistake this summer is makeorbreak in terms of the teams rebuild.  Trelivings biggest weakness right now has been in terms of UFA signings.  Well this summer there will be no more Wideman no more Engelland no more Smid LTIR is not free cap space no more Bollig and most of all no more excuses.  How the team fares going forward is going to rest on what Treliving does this summer and whether Gulutzan can get the team to start looking better.,CalgaryFlames,d9z2hb6,7,t5_2roln

Its like the league is back in the s with the amount of slashing and grabbing there is this season. Something needs to be done the leagues star young players should be allowed to showcase their talent...not be chopped all game and hauled down.

I went to game  of the nd round series in  and I think the stadium was only like  full and it was shocking how quiet the stadium was too.

11428139,0,t3_632jka,This is the second threat to leave town in two days.  Thats faster than even I expected.gtgt...lets all agree that our primary focus is the Stanley Cup playoffs and the thrill of the hunt. Nothing including our fiscal challenges should interrupt the joy and community pride of a playoff run. So... Why are interrupting the playoff hunt with two threats to leave town in two days then?  Also what fiscal challenges?  The Saddledome has a higher than average capacity and one of the highest average ticket prices in the league.  It was bought for you by the city and insurance paid for the flood repairs. How can you not be rolling in profits?gtgt...  gtgtAll of which brings us to the news reports of threats to move. In response to a question are you going to use the threat of moving as a tactic I said we would not. I also said we would just move. Yes you promised not to threaten to leave town while simultaneously threatening to leave town.  Youre not dumb but apparently you think we are.  gtgtThe facts are we need a solution and if it is deemed that there is no made in Calgary solution we will have to make a decision at that time which logically could include deciding to move the team. It is merely one out of a few possible outcomes if we are unable to reach a deal with the City that will work for both sides.Since you already reiterated your previous threat to leave town this is technically the second threat to leave town just in this press release and the third in total but lets just call it a little bit of redundancy in BIG SCARY THREAT TO LEAVE TOWN .gtgtNo one including me should speculate on what the decision will be. Time will tell.And yet here you are speculating in a way that is calculated to scare people into doing what you want.  gtgt...  gtgt Since October  to now we have been meeting with City administration on the Victoria Park option. Recently we received their proposal in response to our stated parameters in which there are differences. We continue to meet for further discussion.Translation  The city didnt promise us enough free money and talks were going slowly so now were going to threaten to leave town a lot until the politicians realize they could lose votes go into a panic like the guys Katz played in Edmonton and then give us everything we want.  gtgtI hope this clarifies things a bit. Yeah I think we know what kind of game youre playing Mr. Katz ... gtgtWe can assure you that we continue to meet privately with senior City administration in an attempt to find a beneficial solution for all Calgarians and southern Albertans.Just one thats more beneificial to a few specific Calgarians and Albertans than others as well as one Londoner  ,CalgaryFlames,dfrd8ui,4,t5_2roln
