8070953,0,t3_4pj1qc,You got the tone and instrumentation down but the drums could be a little more repetitive. I know that may sound weird but the human mind finds comfort in repetition. So when your beat trails into the next bar keep it a bit more consistent and use a little less swing.Its fun to experiment though especially with beats. Take this with a grain of salt as there are many musicians who can have many different drum patterns in their music and make it flow well. I believe youd be great at it.,madewithableton,d4n92jf,1,t5_367uz
