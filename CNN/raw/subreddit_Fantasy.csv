I was picked to be a volunteer writer for a new worldwide campaign told that Id have creative control over the region I was being given and so forth.As it turns out every plotline and idea I proposed to the worldwide people got shot down with them what I eventually realized just wanting a puppet to write their story ideas for them. It didnt help that their ideas were crappier than crap on a toast but the root conflict was that I wanted to explore my own plots and ideas and had no desire to do it for other people.Considering that they werent paying me at all and in fact were trying to reserve all royalties for themselves there was absolutely no way I was going to go through with all that.

We cant do that for everything but in this hour several publishing veterans will shed some light on some aspects of the writing life that they learned the hard way. What makes a shorter fantasy epic?Christine Purcell Sam Sykes Elizabeth Shack Bradley Beaulieu Brigid Collinspm Saturday  ErieFor fans epic fantasy novels are more often than not identified by their sheer size. After all how could it be epic without being close to a thousand pages? This is obviously not the case with fantasy novellas capable of being just as epic as the meatier tomes and award nominated works like Throne of the Crescent Moon being scarcely longer than many and urban fantasy.  Without the page count what needs to be present for a shorter work to earn the descriptor?

It may very well be that historically speaking womanizing or heterosexuality has been associated with some conception of manliness. But its also important to recognize how harmful that specific conception of manliness is  it is a key part of the part of the subjugation of queer people. Although you obviously do not explicitly state that being gay is incompatible with manliness it is implied and as someone who grew up being told through innumerable media that he wasnt manly  couldnt be manly  because of his sexuality I find your position on this point upsetting.Your oversight at least I hope it is an oversight on this point is especially surprising to me considering your claims to have read all of the literature and to have gone to a very progressive and prestigious university.,Fantasy,celio4f,3,t5_2qknd

Something like I dont like writing about domestic work very much because I find it boring.  So in my next story Im going to write about a stay at home dad.What I find silly is that Mr. Kemp is essentially setting limits on himself and saying hes going to stick to them for the most part.  Especially in a genre like Fantasy where anything and everything could happen.  To go back to my other example it would be like saying I dont like writing about domestic work very much because I find it boring.  So Im going to avoid writing those kind of stories.And to be clear I am not advocating that Mr. Kemp be forced or pressured to write brave stoic violent women or quiet patient pacifistic men.  Creative freedom is important.  I am simply suggesting that embracing such a philosophy may hinder his growth as a novelist and stunt the body of his work.

You like following one protagonist or multiple do you like military psychological mystery grand epic humor?There are ton of stuff that is a must read but it depends on what sort of taste you have what tropes you enjoy etc.Something easy to get intoIf you wanna read something more light and humorous but with great undertone of multitude of themes read Discworld by Terry Pratchettdo research to see which story line you wanna read though.Riyria Revelations by Michael J. Sullivan fast paced easy to follow exciting story about two thieves who start to get into more and more trouble. Its not dark or gritty but its very well done. Coming from Brent Weeks work you should certainly enjoy this.Kingkiller Chronicles by Patrick Rothfuss is a great and easy coming of age story. Extremely likable main character just a joyand tears to follow him through his life. A lot of love for this one. Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson is probably the most accessible grand epic out there.A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin if you want a more complex gritty and heavy character development political story.The First Law by Joe Abercrombie if you still want dark and gritty but not having to worry about many plot threads like with Martins work. Has my personal favorite Barbarian type character out of any fiction.Gentleman Bastards Sequence by Scott Lynch if you wanna read fantasy heist novels. All great stuff.Dresden Files by Jim Butcher Wizard P.I. in Chicago with a big mouth heart of gold and absolute extreme talent for getting into shit over his head.Those are all outstanding books and rather frequent recommendations.

119246,0,t3_1vgczl, Brent Weeks Night Angel series first book Way of Shadows. I dont know if it was any passage in particular but I kept mentally rewriting his paragraphs to fix obvious mistakes... eventually it got to the point I couldnt handle it and put the book away. I still suspect that book never had a professional editor. The characters didnt help either. The book was filled with shallow unrealistic personalities. The main character is a street urchin who wants to be an assassin and has been surrounded by all sorts of unspeakable acts since the day he was born.... but in thought and action he is basically no different than a modern suburban slightly thick teenager. I Am Not A Serial Killer by Dan WellsThis one I do remember the specific passage. The book is about a boy who believes he is fated to be a serial killer for a variety of reasons and is actually a diagnosed sociopath oh and his mother owns a mortuary.It was early on when he is helping prepare a body for a wake. Apparently despite his age and mental condition his mother cant see why this might be a bad idea but that wasnt what made me put it down. So many people had talked about how subtle the book treats his condition and how interesting his perspective is... it got a lot of hype. And it was SO HEAVY HANDED. The protagonist its first person basically just goes on and on in the most obvious wayno subtext no underlying message no indirect lead upabout how he has lots of signs that suggest he will grow up to be a serial killer but how he doesnt want to be one. On and on and on. Its a cool idea but there was nothing else there. The writer was just spewing the message onto the page without any presentation at all. ,Fantasy,ces0d12,4,t5_2qknd

156237,0,t3_1vv0v7,I do think that the ability for these things to exist in a world as they are sometimes requires a great history to argue why a given race is an isolationist or what have you. Tolkien of course was pretty much the best at writing why a race behaved a specific way as he wrote the entire world history of his series. However even he didnt do a good job explaining the full impact of that Dragon horde of gold at the end of the Hobbit. It created a wealthier Dale sure but if it was all released at once it would have had a huge deflationary impact in the region and then as people moved with heaps of gold to other areas it would have slowly spread as a ripple. that didnt happen in his world. Any good could have been bought in Dale and it would have caused traders to flock there and then jack up their prices  because people could afford it. It would have been interesting to see the impact of that down the road in LOTR series. I think thats the sort of things that are being talked about here.I agree that for the most part they are simply lacking even in Sandersons work they arent there as well as they could be. Jordan tackles a lot of them GRRM covers a great deal as well as he mentions there are essentially depressions and what not across the realms. Even then there are only a few languages and most of the  Kingdoms speak a single language. So the great world builders are fairly hit or miss with these things. I dont think that it detracts from their work itd be impossible to write the perfect book from that standpoint. If you could then you should just write about how these things would impact our world and make boat loads of money off of it  or be an economist.,Fantasy,cew86j2,2,t5_2qknd

I suppose I could give it another read now but its quite the investment and to be honest most friends Ive talked to whore into fantasy have had the same kind of feeling I have even those that have reread it recently. Im enticed by Branderson at the end because hes really good generally but well see.Also ASoIaF I read till Book . I wouldnt say thats relatively early nor would I say  books into WoT is relatively early. Thats kind of in the thick of it. Thats not to say I dont like epic serieses I loved David Eddings as both a teen an as an adult and thats  books long. I love Recluce all  or so books thatve been written in it. The Stormlight Archive  Mistborn  all of Branderson while being a hidden epic is still an extremely large intertwined and incredibly complex epic fantasy series that I find absolutely fantastic.But anyway your point that my taste isnt exactly what hes looking for is exactly my point.

It seems like a better job for someone less attached to the novel who could make levelheaded decisions about what to keep and what to jettison.  Once I made the Golem responsive to peoples desires I realized pretty quickly that it was going to present a HUGE problem if I didnt add some sort of sex caveat. Otherwise why wouldnt she be off in alleys getting frisky with anyone who found her attractive? So I added this loophole to solve the problem. My thinking was she wouldve been absolutely obedient to Rotfelds desires thanks to the mastergolem link but not to anyone elses. Its a kludge I admit. ,Fantasy,cflgn1f,3,t5_2qknd

In his other series the books have typically come out one right after another.  Mistborn Trilogy    amp . Alcatraz     amp .  I think a big part of the gap in time between WoK and WoR was the fact that he finished WoT during those years.  A giant undertaking that wont be an issue in the future.Yes hes got a lot of other projects and yes these books are bigger than his other novels.  I dont expect them to come out yearly like clockwork.  But I would be very surprised if the time between publication of the future books doesnt shrink a bit compared to WoR.

Its heavy handed but you can read it because its part of the story.  By naked Empire and pillars of heaven Richard is just ranting and going off on very long monologues.  Explaining why pacifism is bad instead of showing us.  Its crap.If you want to talk about feminism simply write about a non sexist society and show female characters doing all sorts of things as though it were normal.

571190,0,t1_cg530uv,The book is such a fun read I really need to dig it out and give it another read through as its been years since I read it the first time but Ill do my best to give you a quick reviewThe book is set in the early s in Western Europe more specifically in England and France during the Wars against Napoleon. Mr. Norrell is a magician on the English side of the war and shortly into the book he meets a man named Jonathan Strange. The two become friends and Mr. Norrell teaches Jonathan the ways of magic to which he had some inclination already. Ill stop there as far as plot points go both because I dont want to ruin anything and my memory is a bit fuzzy on the matter.The writing style is what really stands out here though. The book is written almost like a paper for a historical journal. It has footnotes which will explain and give background on certain events and characters which is I think an extremely clever way to give back story and context to subjects without forcing exposition to explain the matter. Somehow the book manages to maintain both an excellent narrative while simultaneously making the reader feel as if they were reading the account of a historian writing a scholarly research paper on the subject. All in all the book can be a bit dry at times due to the writing style but that only serves to enhance the overall experience of it by the time youre done reading. Susanna Clarke really created a unique experience with this book and now that I think about it I would love to follow her example if I ever manage to actually write anything myself. I would love to write a book in a fully fictional realm that reads almost like a scholarly journal article. It would save so much time and energy on me having to attempt to force context into some conversations.,Fantasy,cg576jl,9,t5_2qknd

612686,0,t3_215828,What is there to be said that hasnt been said already? The Inheritance Cycle is a derivative mess that has been done better in other books. To the point where its infamously known for plagiarizing other works. Thats left up individual people to decide if he did or not.I enjoyed Eragon when I young though with each subsequent book I begin to like it less. I dont like this series anymore for a variety of reasons. From Eldest onwards a lot of the novels are filled with purple prose and meaningless details. The third book Brisingr is the worst in this regard. Eragon and Inheritance had their share of filler also but these books are where it drags the pacing as a result.As Ive read other books I realized how badly written this series is. Its rather on par with the Twilight Saga. To be fair he does improve with each book though not by leaps and bounds. Every aspect of his writing is awful. A lot of his similes and metaphors dont work often because they are clichd and nonsensical. Paolini fondly uses words that dont belong as if hes trying to show how smart he is. Paolini often tells the reader rather than shows.  Even his dialogue is silly. There are a lot of examples that demonstrate how poorly he uses it of such as one moment I recall with Roran at the beginning of Brisngr. He talks as a highly educated person when hes supposed to be a pooruneducated farmer. His characterization is inconsistent a lot of the time. A good example Eragon in Eldest decides to stop eating meat because he doesnt want to harm animals after telepathically being in them. Though in the next book hes killing humans needless for no good reason. Remember the chapter Mecry Dragon Rider anyone?I thought the entire ending sucked from Galbatorix onwards. I like the idea of how Eragon defeats Galbatorix but its poorly executed. There wasnt any reason for why Paolini wrote onehundred pages tying up everything but what was important. The Menola Trees Price The old mentor Tenga That one women with the children etc.I could go on ad nauseam but I think Ill stop there.  Im not saying people who enjoy thiese books are morons. People are free to enjoy them. I find it dificult to call them good.,Fantasy,cg9wxah,4,t5_2qknd

The book is packed full of tropes and pieces lifted from other works which everyone seems to indicate was intentional but generally comes across as cheesy. A lot of it reads like a college kids sexual fantasy with sex going on fairly consistently people stripping naked around each other at somewhat arbitrary times etc.  Theres a scene where people become foxes and have fox sex.It had a lot of high points  I blew through it fairly quickly and was generally interested in the storyline.

662834,0,t3_21pbh6,My name association is poor because I have Lyme Disease and its rattled that part of my brain a bit. I lose track of character names easily even while reading a book. This is especially difficult when reading fantasy as authors often like to create their world by filling in the general character sheet of like  characters and then having them pop in during the series with their own minidevelopment. I lose track of them all and then wait  or  years to pick up the next one and even half of the main cast is nameless in my head.I LOVE ASoIaF but I have major issues in this regard with this series. Then you have to wait FIVE years or more to get the next volume and it has  new characters including  PoV characters that I have to get to know. Its hard.Hand me a trilogy and Ill just read the entire thing in a row and absorb it all at once and stay in the story the whole time.

712276,0,t1_cgl89cv,I disagree that his heroes are inherently good. One of the things I most like about him is that his characters are so multifaceted. They have both positive and negative qualities and the good guys sometimes do bad things and the bad guys sometimes do good things. A lot of the times characters may start out binary but along the way you learn more about them and theyre not all good or all bad. Without giving spoilers theres Szeth Moash and Sadeas from Stormlight the Lord Ruler from Mistborn Vivenna Vasher and Denth from Warbreaker. All characters who originally appear inherently good or bad in the beginning but as the story continues and you learn more about them and their history you see other facets to their personality. ,Fantasy,cgl8llh,1,t5_2qknd

I love Jordan Sanderson Tolkien LeGuin Rowling Pierce McCaffrey and Rothfuss.

755230,0,t3_22sx3e,I think to a degree youre mixing up bad characters and or bad character writing with characters you dont like. If a character acts reacts and is treated as is fitting to the world build around that character then this character is a good character. In that regard...Yeah Monza and Ferro are cunts and drunken exgeneral whats his face is as well so is damn Im bad with names today that foppish duelist pov character from FirstLaw. Theyre still threedimensional follow motivations rooted in their pasts are rescourceful admittedly Ferro less so then Monza.Denna Ill just wait for the conclusion. Shes my least favourite part as well but as it stands we dont know if shes plain badly written or were missing too much of her background yet to explain her... flittiness. What tends to annoy people about here at least I think so is less Denna but Kothe telling someone about how Kvothe and Denna interacted. I withhold judgement till Doors of Stone.On Jordan. True annoying chits the lot of them but to a degree believable annoying chits when put before the background of the world. There is bad writing going on here as well Ill admit that but theyre not plain bad female characters characters in general. I could go a whole lot deeper here but you havent read it so I couldnt rightly explain it. Suffice it to say all of them make a certain sense within that world their upbringing respective culture. All of them... even Elayne. And Fuck Elayne.RAS cant comment too long ago. True for Tolkien. He didnt even try within LotR. Though Id say Galadriel and Eowyn are great examples of female sidecharacters done right.Now the ommitted GRRM... this will be long and ranty also spoilers for ASoIaF.I dont understand you at all here. Were not liking Arya because shes female well I dont I like her because shes this little kid alone in the world slowly turning into a badass on her own. As for the others they come from all facets of life and standing. There is no one female character type GRRM writes he writes all of them. Well no he doesnt but a whole lot. Yeah I get annoyed with Dany but I also get annoyed with RL entitled teenage girls.Spoilers ASoIaFs Now on to to the big one. I was bored with Sansa a long time as well but then I noticed how unique her perspective was. Shes a cliche at the beginning how youd expect a generic young lady in such a world to be and you roll your eyes but then you realize alongside with her how sheltered she truly was like Westeros after a long summer and when all of her childish fancies are stripped away from her its heartrending. Who wouldnt want to have a world in which her innocent dreams could come true? She is innocence. In a way Sansa is how Westeros should have been and as Westeros and its expected future is torn apart so is her life and her expected future. As Westeros loses its unifying King and all peacekeeping bonds Sansa looses her father and family. And as Westeros drifts around under an assortment of unsteady rulers so Sansa drifts from one master to another some more abusive than others but none having her best interests at heart never her own letting things happen to her. And one of these days the ancient rightful owner of Westeros will come to claim it again. Will Westeros let it happen or will it unite against that foe? Will Sansa be similarilly claimed? Or will she finally stop drifting and stand on her own? There was a certain snowcastle scene. I think thats her turning point. I think shes following a childish fancy one last time building her childhood out of snow for Winter has come for Sansa a long time ago yet she took a while to truly realize it. Damnit but Sansa is an annoying chit at times but shes also a great character.Point being you dont have to like a character to make that character a good character female or otherwise. If you didnt find an enjoyable believable female character in all that youve listed above youre not looking for a good female character but for a female character you happen to like. ,Fantasy,cgq4k4p,4,t5_2qknd

793304,0,t3_23753d,If you want to be moved and have a book haunt your thoughts for a long time I cannot imagine you would not enjoy Lions of Al Rassan.The emphasis is on the relationships between the characters and how that tapestry plays against their loyalties  to each other to their country and origins  if you liked the beautiful prose  how can you go wrong?I did look at your list on GoodReads and Kays work is a bit deeper than most of what you had marked  stars. It will have action but the plot does not turn on only that aspect  it is multifaceted  and holds up extremely well the perspectives will shift and have meaning no matter what time of life a reader picks it up.If you do try it and it doesnt work I dont know what age you are? Wait  years and try again.If it was the prologue of Tigana you read  that book takes a little longer to wind up  try Lions first would be my suggestion.,Fantasy,cgugaj5,2,t5_2qknd

818670,0,t3_23fjar,The oxygen of publicity is always good for a book and an author no matter the review. Liz Bourke rubs a lot of people up the wrong way and those people will automatically dismiss anything she reviews badly as probably a lot better than she makes out and maybe buy it anyway. The same goes for other reviewers they are those that will automatically gainsay anything she says just to try and prove her wrong.Either way Im sure its better for the Rjurik Davidson that hes in the news for something rather than desperately trying to get reviewed and noone listening or interested and incidentally his first book a collection of short stories called The Library of Forgotten Books was actually pretty good if a bit overweird in places.,Fantasy,cgxc312,1,t5_2qknd

Dark but not grim high fantasy about a young thief trying to avoid pursuing nightmares.Rat Queens which is a comedy about a female band of adventurers who are pretty much social misfits and fuckups. There are recipes for cocktails in each issues. Its a blast.Theres also Skullkickers in the same comedyfantasy club and it just started up again although I didnt like it qugte as much as Rat Queens.Also I definitely have to throw out Prophet. My favorite ongoing right now. Starts out with a kind of barbarian in the future and then just gets weirder. Space fantasy at its absolute best.The first couple issues of Sovereign have come out and its solid so far so I can recommend giving that a shot as well.I know theres more I cant think of so Ill try to come back to edit this if I remember any.,Fantasy,cgznoub,2,t5_2qknd

Someone breaks the law of time and well its a Thomas Covanent story so you can already guess it doesnt work out nearly as well as theyd hoped.Hal Duncans Book of All Hours series takes causality and continuity and does terrible things to them. There are narratives where characters live out their lives as people in both world wars the spanish civil war s Germany and ancient Mesopotamia as well as several parallel versions of the real world and a few fantastic worlds that shouldnt even exist. And then one character gives continuity the ultimate Fuck You just out of spite because hes that fucking badass.And just to go oldschool and corny theres the Dragonlance Legends by Weiss and Hickman. Fistandantalus was the most powerful evil wizard dude who ever lived and he capped his career off by travellng forward several centures in time in an attempt to enter the Abyss and challenge the godess of evil. Rastlin is the most powerful evil wizard dude alive today thanks to his rediscovery of Fistandantalus lore and he decides hell cap off his career by travelling several centuries back in time to kill Fistandantalus and succeed where the old fart failed.

1306597,0,t3_291p33,Id go ahead and recommend some Brandon Sanderson. Either the finished Mistborn Trilogy or the Stormlight Archives if you think you can handle some middle of the road prose and pretty intense awesome action scenes. Sanderson almost always have strict magic systems where you know what to expect. This pretty much keeps the deus ex machine out of the picture as well. There will be no beall endall spell that solves all of the characters problems. However he does tend to give details away in bits and pieces so dont expect to know how everything works right away.Also Sandersons plotting is great at the worst of times and fantastic at the best of times. There also arent an abundance of typical high fantasy races though he does have a tendency to make up a new one or two for different books.Another you may enjoy is Blood Song by Anthony Ryan. The main character is clearly powerful but at the same time the book covers his training from a kid into the man he becomes so youre not just jumping into the book with an overpowered prophesized main character. Its based almost solely around human interaction in a sword and sorcery medieval society. Its also written quite well and is being told as a narrative from the main characters perspective. Book two in this series comes out next week. ,Fantasy,ciglxdm,2,t5_2qknd
1310596,0,t1_cih1o63,So reading the main  is a safe bet. You get the full story and its all in Eriksons voice Esslemonts writing is weaker and many dont like it.  Forge of Darkness should be left until afterwards and the novellas can be read pretty much anytime after book  though they are extremely tangential and not really relevant.If you want you can mix in a couple of Esslemonts booksNight of Knives is short and interesting though not particularly amazing and can be read any time after the th book of the main series maybe earlier it isnt that important.  Return of the Crimson Guard is the only one of Esslemonts books that I think significantly strengthens the main story and I strongly encourage reading it between books  and  Reapers Gale and Toll the Hounds of the main series.  If you arent liking it you can skip it but there are a couple of events and characters that tie in somewhat strongly with other parts of the series. As a warning NoK and RotCG are considered some of his weaker works in terms of writing but he does improve significantly in Stonewielder and his later works.After that Esslemont kinda goes off on his own ground.  You can read Stonewielder after book  of the main series and the rest of his works should be read in publication order after youve finished the main .,Fantasy,cih2496,5,t5_2qknd

1344050,0,t1_cikrg05,Youve just described Sandersons First Law of Magic quite succinctly. It is also interesting that you mention his magic almost having a scifi feel because he has stated that his later Mistborn books will be a future SciFi  setting where their grasp of the magic will allow for FTL travel.As a side note I feel like Allomancy and its companion systems are tied to the gods of the story given that in the Hero of Ages s we learn that Allomancy and comes from Preservation Hemalurgy comes from Ruin and Feruchemy from both. With Preservation and Ruin being shards of Adonalsium theyre about as close to a god as we get in the Cosmere.

This is a story for fans of Bone Elfquest Nausicaa or Harry Potter to fall in love with highly recommended for teen and adult fantasy readers everywhere. The Library Journal.  The art is more simplistic in some ways which may enchant some and put off others and the story initially seems the same.  But that is actually rather deceptive as theres a lot more here than one might pick up on at first glance.  Another that is well over  on Sample here  Artesia  The story is thick with pitched battles and their aftermath as supernatural powers and creatures prowl the battlefield to gather up the dead mens souls. Gods and spirits are never far from human affairs here and Artesia must negotiate with them as with her human allies. This is grim stuff. The storys frequent use of gore and nakedness isnt gratuitous but works to suggest a world in which humans are fragile insignificant creatures despite their yearnings to be more powerful. Gods and goddesses are more powerful but equally determined to subdue their rivals.

They discover the huge impact this small difference has on their destinies when the aftermidnight twin is inducted into a world of supernatural beings and events that intersects with our own world. Together they will desperately try to stay one step ahead of their terrifying fates while they learn how far the curse afflicting them really stretches. by Mike Carey is UF in a Japanese setting and quite unusual.  Pat Rothfuss is a big fan and heres what he had to say gt If you dont know who Mike Carey is you should. Hes one of the best comic writers out there in my opinion. If you havent read Crossing Midnight you should. Its brilliant. It draws on mythology sorely neglected by most western authors. It manages to draw on the unfamiliar while still managing to be very readable and accessible. No easy feat there... Best of all these three books form a complete story arc. That counts for a lot. I hate starting a comic series reading  books then finding out it was canceled.  You should try it. Absolutely worth your time.  The Unwritten  Tom Taylors life was screwed from go. His father created the Tommy Taylor fantasy series boywizard novels with popularity on par with Harry Potter. The problem is Dad modeled the fictional epic so closely to Toms real life that fans are constantly comparing him to his counterpart turning him into the lamest variety of Zlevel celebrity. In the final novel its even implied that the fictional Tommy will crossover into the real world giving delusional fans more excuses to harass Tom. When an enormous scandal reveals that Tom might really be a boywizard made flesh Tom comes into contact with a very mysterious very deadly group thats secretly kept tabs on him all his life. Now to protect his own life and discover the truth behind his origins Tom will travel the world eventually finding himself at locations all featured on a very special map  one kept by the deadly group that charts places throughout world history where fictions have impacted and tangibly shaped reality those stories ranging from famous literary works to folktales to pop culture. And in the process of figuring out what it all means Tom will find himself having to figure out a huge conspiracy mystery that spans the entirety of the history of fiction.  Also by Mike Carey.  Fiction and magic and meta and so much brilliance.   Madame Xanadu  Centuries long and around the far reaches of the globe her tale winds before the ageless fortuneteller whose powers of sight can change the course of human events.  As the mysterious past of Madam Xanadu is slowly unraveled Wagner takes us on a journey throughout her history from a medieval kingdom beset by foul sorcery to the court of Kublai Khan. Eventually Madam Xanadu returns to Europe as mystic advisor to Marie Antoinette and as political tensions begin to boil the Phantom Stranger makes his return. This time he seeks to kickstart the revolution and ensures that Pariss streets run red  a blood sacrifice that will keep certain demonic forces at bay.  Lucifer  From the pages of THE SANDMAN Lucifer Morningstar the former Lord of Hell is unexpectedly called back into action when he receives a mission from Heaven. Given free reign to use any means necessary Lucifer is promised a prize of his own choosing if he fulfills this holy request. But once he completes his mission the Prince of Darkness demand shakes the foundation of Heaven and Hell. Now as his enemies unite to stop his reemergence Lucifer gathers his forces as he prepares to launch his new revolution. Mike Carey is the man.

Fables Books of Magic Stardust Mouse Guard Dawn by Linsner Star Wars particularly XWing Rogue Squadron Legacy and Dark Times were all great and Im not even that much of a SW fan.  Sandman is a game changer deceptively brilliant.  And for the people that enjoy Willinghams Fables then he also did Ironwood which is Fantasy porn with a bunch of good natured humor and an actual story in there somewhere.  ,Fantasy,cim8trl,5,t5_2qknd

1369865,0,t3_29rkd8,I really wanted to like this book but for me it fell kinda flat. Maias decisions throughout the book never feel as they have much impact and theres little dramatic tension despite the potential given the events surrounding him in the book. Most of the action is happening around him without so much as a window into what is really going on which ends up a real let down.The world itself was rather interesting but it felt like a lost opportunity the way the story is told. ,Fantasy,cio01gx,3,t5_2qknd

1370528,0,t3_29rzjp,Without giving away any specific culprits I absolutely hate it when an author foreshadows so heavily that I know the main character is going to die and my thoughts when it happens are finally. If your book or series goes from a single point of view to multiple points of view suddenly someones going to die. If one of your characters is hyper concerned about anothers safetyreckless nature someones gonna die. Frequent dreams in which the death is described are also terrible though once or twice can be okay.A main characters death should be shocking and heartbreaking. You should feel like the character has a chance to beat the odds or avoid the situation right up until the end.,Fantasy,cio31c0,2,t5_2qknd

Hell tell you mid action like oh ya that thing looks like this almost like he forgot to tell the reader. It took me like an hour to to read the prologue of the second book to understand what was going on. Hes  a great world builder maybe the best but hes not the best writer IMO especially compared to Rothfuss GRRM and Sanderson to be fair Sanderson is pretty simplistic but Stormlight has been fantastic.I still love the books so far although Im not done with them.

1398475,0,t1_cirkgc8,gtOn the contrary true horror is what happens just off screen where our imaginations fill in the blanks. Thats the difference between something that entertains you for an evening and something that sticks with you for a long time. Youre correct but missing the point. Compared to a book a movie still requires a great more stuff happening. It is a visual medium. The dread of what is lurking just off the screen can certainly supply horror but you still need a great deal more of movement and action from the characters on screen. Literature can digress and philosophize describe and allude in a way that film cannot. But all that is beside the point. The entire reason behind making the movie PG instead of R is to attract a wider audience. Del Toro wants a big budget and the studios are forcing him to bring in the teenagers to get that budget. Theyre not going to do that and then tell him he can still found the movie on implication halfseen glimpses and atmosphere. Theyre going to suggest demand you know a chase scene with a CGI monster would be great right here... and here... and here. A bunch of people on this thread have talked about how Del Toro will be able to basically skirt by the Rating Guidelines because Lovecraft isnt gory. So well get a movie with a rated R atmosphere... but its rated PG because of a kind of loophole. This isnt correct. The studio is going to demand a PG atmosphere as well. Action and Adventure. And that isnt lovecraft. ,Fantasy,cirkvgv,0,t5_2qknd
1401266,0,t3_2a5cuq,About the same as the first book.  A solid story especially for a new author but certainly not amazing.  The different cultures are flat caricatures character development and growth feel rushed the close relationship that developed between Vaelin and Reva despite the fact their only interactions were a couple sword fighting lessons that occurred offscreen being just one example too much unnecessary details and minor characters brought back for no real reason Caenis character motivations often feel contrived the Shield.On a more general note I feel as if Ryan changed his mind about where his story was going to go the first book foreshadowed things about Caenis and the th order and the blind seer and it either dropped these completely or gave a quick little mention and rushed right on by.I dont really have high expectations for the finale of the trilogy but I will look forward to whatever project he does next hopefully he learns from the mistakes in this series.All that said I did enjoy it  or  out of  seems fair.,Fantasy,cirxgf9,2,t5_2qknd
1402682,0,t1_cirgmze,As I tried to explain below the problem is the Studios arent going to be content with escaping through what is essentially a loophole.Del Toro basically agreed to go from R to PG in exchange for the larger budget that PG movies receive. The Studio wants the better chance of a big turnout that PG movies get so theyre going to protect their investment. This means it isnt enough for the movie to receive a PG on a technicality.... it has to actually be a bigbudget PG movie. Look around for decent psychological horror movies with a PG rating and a M budget. They dont exist. They dont exist because theyve all been lobotomized and sanitized and turned into safe movies for teenagers and the family. No Hollywood studio is going to risk a a budget that large on a two hours of existential dread and nihilism. Its going to demand Standard Adventure Plot  with some spookiness. ,Fantasy,cis3u7g,0,t5_2qknd

Howard Pyle known as the Father of American Illustration painted in the early part of the last century  said when you discover a happy accident in your work get on your n knees and praise the Lord. The trick is seeing that the flaw is working or recognizing it IS a flaw. This is why when I am painting  I use a mirror to see the reverse  as flaws tend to stand out. When I draw  I do the same thing and flip over any tracing paper studies to catch any discrepancies to my intent. Sometimes I turn the painting upside down when I work on some areas.

1465719,0,t3_2ay3tn,The funniest thing thats happened to me reviewwise was when BampN had Whitefire Crossing as their Free Friday Nook book a while back.  Something like K people download the Free Friday books and many of them are mainstream readers.  My book is secondaryworld fantasy but one of my two protagonists comes from a criminal background and uses modern curse words my world is not meant to be medieval.  Some people put down the book in disgust on the very first page when they got to the first fbomb and wrote scathing star reviews saying how offended they were.  No harm no foul  its perfectly valid to do that.  The funny part came when all these other people started starring the book without even having cracked it open saying how much they hated cursing and BampN should only provide clean books and then other people started starring it ALSO without having read it just to argue with the star people.    BampN has since taken down most of the reviews both star and star from people who said they didnt read the book but a few choice examples remain like i dont plan to read the book due to all of the reviews stating there is such offensive language they had to stop reading it! Lets face it many of us lead stress filled lives and want to settle into a good book to relax. We dont want to read nasty language.

1476066,0,t1_cj18abl,AMoL Gate spoilerss Gates were one of the things that kind of bother me about the series.  Having played tabletop RPGs I see Brandon Sanderson use of gates as potentially an exploit or violation of the rules for gates that RJ had put in place.  Im not sure if RJ was just less imaginative than BS or if he intentionally limited the uses that the forsaken had for gates.  In RJs days we saw gates as requiring extensive knowledge of the surrounding area and this restricted unplanned traveling to opening one of the gates with the platforms and traveling over a brief period to the desired location.  When Brandon came along he added a loophole that somehow you can open a gate to five feet away step through and then open a gate to the opposite side of the world because somehow you immediately gain an intimate knowledge of your surroundings by making that  foot hop.  How the hell did masters of channeling who lived in an age of countless channelers not ever figure this out?  If I were I DM Id have noped that.  It almost seems like BS was just looking for a way to cut back on travel time and book length instead of having to explain people camped out for a few days every time they needed to learn a location enough to travel.  Otherwise I was annoyed how clueless the forsaken were about other gate uses like positioning gates horizontally and using them for battle planning and such.  It seems like RJ placed a lot of restrictions on them to keep them from being completely overpowered but BS stripped a lot of the restrictions away like the heavy cost in power that would tire the channelers quickly when gating.    Oh and one thing that I always thought would have been awesome since shadowspawn would die after passing through a gateway just fill doorways with gateways that teleport the shadowspawn an inch forward.  The doorway would appear to just be an open door but walking through would immediately kill them but they wouldnt go anywhere.  Tie of the weave and watch the shadowspawn kill themselves trying to take a room.,Fantasy,cj1atbb,2,t5_2qknd

I think the vocabs simple enough for a  year old its also great for reading to your child because theyre entertaining for any age. Also has some really nice illustrations.One other one a little more advanced maybe is Mistress Mashams Repose. Only problem there is that helps to be at least somewhat familiar with Gullivers Travels and Id guess the vocabulary level is significantly higher if nothing else because its an older book and makes lots of historical references which might have been obscure at the time and certainly are now especially if youre not British.

It is how those things are approached through the literature that determines if it is fantasy or science fiction. You can tell a fantasy time travel story you travel back in time and go on an adventure. Or you can tell a science fiction story you travel back in time what does this mean what might you experience and what could you do with it. Its how you go about exploring the premise of the book that entirely decides what genre it is in. You could travel back in time to solve a mystery and the book is mystery. You could travel back in time and see unspeakable horrors. Horror. You can travel back in time and fall in love romance. That is the point.

I agree with you. And what really hurts female authors is how publishers push them in the genre. Its not the reviewers fault for the most part. Sure there are blatantly sexist critics. But thats not exactly news. Publishers market female authors differently as was talked about elsewhere in this thread. gt If I want to read a fantasy novel inspired by Chinese folklore I would prefer it to be written by someone of Chinese heritage. Not that only Chinese people can write about Chinese things but they bring a particular level of knowledge and lived experience that I appreciate. Furthermore they can be inspirational to other Asian and AsianAmerican readers of SFF who might want to write books one day.I see your point and for the most part I agree with that as well. I prefer reading about something from a writer who has more experience with it. But thats beside the point entirely. Ok maybe not entirely but it wasnt the point I was makingThe point is within the mainstream western idea of the fantasy genre. Which is still Eurocentric. That is something I personally think could do with a change as well. Id love to see more fantasy than I have based on other cultures. Babylonian Romani Egyptian AmazonianIncaMayan cultures are as yet largely untouched. Which again is a fault in publishing. New ideas arent largely marketable within a niche market which fantasy is along with my longer post about the fantasy genre tropes not being conducive to being centered on nonmanlymannonEuro stories. It is sadly still what sells. And what sells is based largely on the culture of the mass market. So yeah I get the logic that nonwhitenonmale authors should get more press and sales. But I also realize that its not going to largely change whats expected in the genre not with any sort of rapidity. Hell were still inundated with Tolkien clones every year. ,Fantasy,cjdbhcq,1,t5_2qknd

1652541,1,t1_cjnf6nr,Its not objective to say that the power levels add to the story what adds and detracts is subjective.  It is however objective to criticise a narrative by saying that some of the characters actions are essentially meaningless to the story since there are other characters whose power is so vast as to render most of the other characters actions inconsequential.In Gardens of the Moon for instance you can actually remove the activity of every character in the book with the exception of the dragonelflord and the outcome of the book would be essentially unchanged  everything done by Whiskeyjack and the guy with the lucky sword is completely pointless and if you realise that whilst reading it then it really damages any enjoyment you can have reading it.  Additionally it cheapens the end experience for the reader and the power levels are to blame for it.  Its the same if you watch Raiders of the Lost Ark and realise that nothing Indiana Jones does in the entire film matters and actually if he just hadnt interfered the Nazis would all have just opened the Ark and got their faces melted anyway.  That is categorically bad storytelling.I appreciate that you enjoy the story but having heroic characters with those unlimited power levels is again objectively something we see in stories for younger readers.  You compare it to mythology which we would today mainly think of as extremely simplistic stories.I understand that seeing it from this perspective will lead you to think that I am looking down on what you consider an adult story as being childish but Im afraid that Erikson is basically writing childish plots in an adult style.  If you think thats unfair try to summarise an Erikson plot for anyone who isnt a fantasy lover and see if they dont find even his basic premises childish.  Thats not a problem though people enjoy Dragon Ball Z as adults they can enjoy Malazan books as adults too.,Fantasy,cjngssw,3,t5_2qknd

1660184,0,t1_cjoclj7,.  Yes Husk is pretty damn cool..  Not the last time I... oh.  Well thats weird..  Ive got some pitches in and the real prospect of getting another book approved with Peter Gross.  No XMen plans at the moment but see other answers.  Never say never and all that....  Glad you enjoyed it!  Our second collaboration is The House Of War and Witness.  its already out in the UK and gets its US release towards the end of this year.  Its a ghost story set in eighteenth century Silesia and we had to do some actual historical research for it.  It almost killed us.  Its so much easier writing about a totally imaginary Arabia....  Oh man dont get me started.  Theres a species of mite where the male offspring die before theyre born.  They mate with their sisters inside the parents body cavity then they die.  The female mites are born pregnant.But its parasites that get me every time.  A Californian biologist did a biomass survey a few years back in two estuaries on the Baja coast.  Parasite biomass outweighed predator biomass by about twenty times.  The biosphere is full of things that want to live inside you!!!.  You know I never saw that pattern before but youre right.  Id argue that those three precogs serve different storytelling functions.  Rem is there in Seraglio as a bridge between her time and ours.  She addresses us as a contemporary and takes the edge off the quaintness and familiarity of some of the tropes.  Just A Feeling is part of a wider theme in Suicide Risk about selfawareness and blindness  I mean shes on a scale as all the embedded supers are in terms of how far theyre aware of what they used to be and what they are now.  In XMen... well come on if you had a chance to write Destiny and Blindfold youd do it right?  .  I grew up in Liverpool where theres a massive sectarian divide and my parents were of different faiths  my dad a lasped Catholic my mum an Anglican.  That stuff really mattered at that time and in that place.  SO I grew up immersed in the stories of religion  emotionally engaged but not intellectually committed.  I still use the ideas and the stories of the old and new testament to explore a lot of big issues like free will versus fatalism but Im not a person of faith.The other theme that I gravitate to again and again and again is family  especially parentchild relationships.

1687565,0,t1_cjrvdvo,Bleach was absolutely great up until Soul Society but almost everything after except the Vaizard flashback fails in pacing development and overall cohesiveness. When One Pieces Eiichiro Oda stated that he had another  years of story left Bleachs Tite Kubo said the guy is a diva he had another  years left too despite numbers already falling on the opinion polls.Then the series hit rockbottom with the Xcution arc and the anime was taken offair and it was obvious Kubo was forced to start on Bleachs last arc. Youd think that the last arc would be going places but between chapters with long dragging panels that show seconds worth of content and entire fights dedicated to explaining completely random powers that fail to fit into the world in any way its pretty much par for the course. Hell with this pacing he might even hit his  year mark.Urahara is one of Bleachs last redeeming factors but Kubo hardly ever uses him and at this point anything that blatantly reminds me of Bleach riles me up.,Fantasy,cjrvr6c,4,t5_2qknd

After you land your potentially lethal strike your opponent will remain upright and capable for a short amount of time.  During that time they might try to attack you but most likely after a sword to the face theyll just want to get away and stop the bleeding.  So yes the fight should end fast but the most likely way it ends is that the person who lands the first blow then repeatedly slashes the other guy until he utterly cripples their ability to fight.,Fantasy,cjvr607,1,t5_2qknd

1725472,0,t1_cjwmqrp,This is a reasonable response and probably how most people think of genre but it doesnt actually work that way. Rather than writing the work then picking a genre that generally captures the spirit of the content what happens is the following. A genre is created. This is due to a nebulous zeitgeist of all kinds of cultural currents and shit.. There is a breakout work in the genre. Say with Paranormal Romance Twilight. This might not be totally right but lets just go with it.. Readers begin to associate the genre with the breakout work. Is it not like Twilight? Then it is not Paranormal Romance. This is the codification of the genre.. Writers who do not write like Twilight fail to get categorized as Paranormal Romance. As there is likely no other genre for it to fall into  its got vampires but they ARENT teens and they DONT fuck and Horror isnt selling etc etc  then the book cannot be marketed well and quickly fails.. Writers agents and publishers seeing the books fail stop writing and buying Paranormal Romance that is not like Twilight. ALL Paranormal Romance books begin to resemble Twilight. . Within this sect of Paranormal Romance some books  still playing within the parameters of the basicallyTwilight genre that has been created  begin introducing some VERY subtle differences. . The differences between the new types of books increase. Then slowly they become their own subgenres its Twilight but now theres cyberpunk elements! Were breaking new ground here folks..

1804055,0,t3_2f2ywi,So Outlander probably doesnt fit the tastes of many readers who subscribe here but that doesnt mean it isnt a great bookshow. Yes it is aimed more toward women and has strong romantic elements but I dont think it should be dismissed so quickly. Its a great blend of Scottish history strong writing and has one of my favorite strong female characters. But Im biased I love this book. It doesnt have a strong fantasy element or any sort of magic system though I wouldnt say it belongs in this sub. ,Fantasy,ck6jqrz,1,t5_2qknd

1805980,0,t3_2f6x2l,Tigana  Really like this! Slow start but by the end it just gets so heavy and emotional. I think Guy Gavriel Kay really succeeds with blending genre and literature and he writes something that is both an entertaining adventure but also a really emotionally complex and poignant story.Promise of Blood  I read this after because I really wanted something lighter. It was a lot different than I expected with a lot of fast paced gunplay and magical action but it was very entertaining and I enjoyed the characters the chef was great. I look forward to seeing what happens next. The noir storyline did a good job of capturing that hardboiled feel and I love the overarching mystery involving ancient gods and all that.Locke amp Key Vol IampII  Not sure if this fits here but I read both these volumes. I liked them a lot really enjoy the horror angle and the blend of these really surreal horror elements and a lot of great family drama. I can see how they wanted to make this a television show because of that. The art is great as well.Read Seas Under Red Skies  Reread. I really loved this. I read it before when it was first released but was curious to read it again. It definitely holds up and in comparison to the first is really quite good. The dialogue is on point and while the plotting isnt that tight the genre switch up works itself in fairly well but still derails the initial plot for quite some time. Its still a blast throughout though and provides some great moments for Jean. The Thousand Names  REALLY loved this. A lot different than what I expected having read Promise of Blood earlier. A lot more realistic which I loved and the characters were familiar archetypes but didnt become annoying or anything they were quite likable. Winter especially was a highlight and the novels treatment of female characters was quite good.Republic of Thieves  Not finished! But I started it this month and Im nearly half way through. Its finally getting going with the preparations for the elections and all that and seems somewhat related to the first two books in a way like you could sort of take them as a starting trilogy because of the recurring themes and plot threads although Im not done yet so I have yet to see where the story goes. Really love the return of the Interlude chapters seeing Camorr and all that again is great.,Fantasy,ck6sejq,3,t5_2qknd

1823600,0,t3_2fgagu,Personally I prefer to go to Faery through some magical act rather than a magical door.James Blaylocks underrated Land Of Dreams has a town where every few years everyone can go but each must find their own way. One builds a boat out of a giant shoe one brews a magic potion of sea salt and tar another digs tunnels into molehills.Susanne Clarks Jonathan Strange is desperate to get to faery or at least talk to one. But like the adventurers in Dunsanys The King Of ElfLands Daughter he finds one has to be mad or simple or poetic to find the faery border.  So Jonathan Strange brews a potion to make himself mad. Drastic but effective.Then again there is much to be said for the standard ancient wall separating the two worlds.Such as  Neil Gaimans dull solid stone Wall open once every nine years for the fairy market. That wall is a peaceful thing with one old guard. But in Garth Nixes Abhorsen series the wall to the realm of magic is guarded by soldiers gun towers dogs and trained sorcerers.Similarly the way to Faery in Hope Mirrleess LudInTheMist has a detachment of soldiers to bar the way stationed on the Debatable Marches.But secret doors are always good. Standing stones are rather traditional.  Douglas Adams Dirk Durkley follows some homeless people into Asgard by doing   what they do. Granted the wall of Kings Cross Station Platform  is probably heavily dented with determined muggle forheads.,Fantasy,ck8xm8l,3,t5_2qknd

1839143,0,t3_2b4vvn,My just released novel RuleSet A Novel of a Quantum Future was designed to blend hard science with fantasy.I describe RuleSet as a mashup of advanced particle physics AI quantum computing and...uh...Japanese manga.Most of the action of the first book takes place at the site of the abandoned Superconducting Super Collider SSC shut down in  after  miles of the  mile synchrotron ring had been bored out as well as  access shafts sunk  feet into the earth into which the various detectors and equipment would have been lowered. The SSC is now the HHC Hyperconducting Hyper Collider and its beams can reach  TeV the SSC was specd at  TeV and the LHC operates at about . The remains of the SSC are still there I have a slideshow on my site.The future technology that enables the HHC to reach that incredible strength was developed in consultation with a physicist who works for a Texas company.If youve been following the advances made in particle physics you can have a lot of fun and still stay within the bounds of potential reality. The sections of the book that discuss AI are based on my own personal experiences as well as analyses of whats currently taking place. Quantum computing is real and developing rapidly though it will take a couple of decades before we see general purpose systems become widely used.When developing the plot and characters of RuleSet demons magic rings and potions are not required. You can get pretty fantastic with science as its developing today.Rick Chapman Author RuleSet A Novel of a Quantum Future. Just Released. More info at ,Fantasy,ckata8u,1,t5_2qknd

2065967,0,t3_2ibbjm,Just recently started to read this book on my mission to finish all of Sandersons works. Ive read the first two Mistborn books Steelheart and obviously Stormlight. And I just love everything Ive read by him before. Right now Im at about  through this book and its been pretty good so far... although I do agree that the book as lots of faults. Its easy to see that Sanderson was going to be a great author one day from reading this book.After this I plan on finishing Hero of Ages and then moving onto Warbreaker and then by that time hopefully Firefight will be out by then. Past that I want to crack into the second Mistborn trilogy and probably Legion as well. I think Ill likely end up putting off the Alcatraz series for a long time as the YA stuff is usually harder for me to get into and I really have never heard much about the books so I assume theyre just okay.,Fantasy,cl2fhu1,1,t5_2qknd
2073119,0,t1_cl35rkr,There is too much content in that book to adapt it like LotR was. I can see films or even series that center on specific events or people throughout that period. So much stuff was condensed in that book. Id love to see the fall of Numenor Gondolin Fingolfins duel War of Wrath. A lot of great material in there.

2078611,0,t1_cl3otxm,Im not a hardcore fan and I only recently read listened to the trilogy. I absolutely loved the films and even after reading the books I still find them magnificent works of art. However I now see that they lack a lot of the depth and the subtlety that Tolkien intended. Even the tone is changed in paces. The books have what I call a melancholic majesty. The films? They tend to trade it for action or a less subtle form of humour. And yet at times the movie really does get that sense of grandeur and sadness.In the end what it comes down to for me is that while the movies arent perfect translations of the books or even good ones depending on your viewpoint theyre still far better than most movie adaptations of books and better yet theyre good movies. If you never read the books then theyre just about perfect.The Hobbit film trilogy on the other hand has thus far proven to be both a poor adaption of the book and a less than stellar film series.,Fantasy,cl41c59,3,t5_2qknd

Im far more cynical than you as I think its ridiculous that to enjoy the books you have to skip upwards of  pages of nonstop bullshit that is utterly irrelevant. Im almost finished the series again after having read it originally when I was half my current age. I found it hilarious when Nicci was captured by Jagang in the final book and went on a rant for more than  pages. I couldnt believe what I saw. I skipped ahead to see what Jagang does after her ten thousand word speech and he just beats the shit out of her............ What the hell was the purpose of such a uselessly longwinded speech? It does nothing to progress the story.Oh my god and the fucking recaps. Jesus. Terry Goodkind has the biggest boner for recapping every god damn detail that adds NOTHING to the plot. Ugh....

2245378,0,t3_2kv8yn,i was interspersing large books with discworld novels to break up the pace so Ive read The Light Fantastic which I liked but not as much as the other discworld novels I read.Then Last Argument of Kings which was great especially the long ending after the climactic battle. Loved Glokta the most but will be reading other Abercrombie books even if hes not in them.Equal Rites was funny and enjoyable as was The Emperors Soul although I didnt agree with some people who say it is Sandersons best work I would love to read a sequel or follow up set with the same magic system or characters.Mort was one Id read before but I still loved it my favourite discworld so far.The Mirror Empire I am slightly undecided on the beginning rd or so is very slow and the massive world building feels a little clunky and can make it hard to read plus a lot of the characters are annoying but the plot picks up towards the end and it is a very unique world so Ill probably check out the sequel when it comes out.Sourcery was another great discworld book funny and clever as usual.And I just started The Painted Man AKA The Warded Man yesterday and love it  already a quarter through it and dont want to pause to read Slow Regard of Silent Things which I have been looking forward to for months. The writing is so clear and good that I dont even realise Im reading most of the time cos Im so immersed which seems very different to when reading the mirror empire.

2323307,0,t1_clypitd,I had originally envisioned a story with a very limited scope.  One POV character one mission...I tried to write it over and over but it became one guy trying to get to a certain point battling the ominous but also ambiguous evil and then being redeemed.Then I had admitted that I needed to tell the story quite different.  You know Harry Potter really only follows Harry Potter.  Its all about him and there are few scenes that dont involve him and those are usually villains talking with their pinkies to their mouths love Harry Potter BTW.  I really wanted something more grand something big so I started to evolve my story a bit but I was still reserved in POV and scope.A Game of Thrones taught me to write POV.  I had read a lot of POV books before but GRRM did it with incredible depth.  I doubt even my best characters will ever be so round as his weakest characters but it gave me something to strive toward.  Furthermore the scope of it told me that I was being far too linear. My world is deliberately not as big and complex as his not that it could be if I wanted it to but I saw how narrow and foresighted I had been and opened it up a great deal.His story feels like somewhere out there this really happened.  Tolkiens work was that way.  So was Star Wars.  You watch that and you think Maybe in a galaxy far far away this really did happen.

It had an explosive hehe final third and I thought that you melded technology magic and religion in a really intriguing way that really carried the book and kept me turning the pages. I feel like some of the coolest ideas to me werent explored to their fullest extent and were quickly explained through exposition near the end. For instance I feel like Skylas goggles werent really used to her advantage much even though they had the capability to do crazy stuff and that clockwork machines origins and machinations were barely alluded to. Was it a living being or created by that old civilization that wasnt talked about much?

2394452,0,t3_2mtfhy,I think Im in the minority but I prefer Ice and Fire. I like both but I think Martin has much deeper and colourful characters and I find it really hard to distinguish and care about Eriksons characters. They seem shallow in comparison and most of them are driven by their special abilities more than personality. Eriksons characters tend to be special in terms of what powers they possess and most of them are in very unique magical situations where Martins characters tend to be special just as everyday people are internally and externally in a less fantastical fashion. In general at least.However I do like the over the top power level epicness of Eriksons characters and I think to many Martins regular humans seem drab in comparison.In terms of lore I think Erikson spends more time to give you an epic scope when it comes to grand history of the world where Martin has a more human aspect to his lore where past personal actions are just as important to the story as greater events between cultures.Erikson has a lot of places and cultures but I honestly cant tell what sets them apart. I cant tell a persons race or culture based on their names and with a few exceptions I find it harder to get a feel of a place or a culture than I do with Martin. I think its again due to Martin focusin more on the humanity of things and to a historical feel.In magic Erikson takes the cake. Unless Martin later expands and exposes a lot about the nature of his history of the world and magic in it the gods and systems and races and all that in Eriksons books are far deeper and a very interesting albeit sometimes frustrating! thing to get into.I prefer Martins style a lot more I find it has a flow that I enjoy and Erikson is slighly harder to follow and gives a much more impersonal feel. This is highly subjective though cant really make a recommendation.However where Martin has a lot of foreshadowing tidbits prophecies and allusions to events that you can piece together missing these doesnt make the story less enjoyable.With Erikson a lot of things are told in a very convoluted and disjointed fashion with very little exposition which a lot of people greatly enjoy but it can make the books seem like a puzzle that the reader needs to solve to get the story. It can feel quite arduous especially when the events that do get described are from the POV of characters that arent as easy to care about as with Martin.I find both are equally brutal if you find yourself caring about the characters. Erikson is more brutal in terms of how much effort is expected from the reader to remember thigns referenced or alluded to.Its also worth noting that Martins series drops in quality as it goes on where Eriksons gets better. Eriksons is also finished.So if youre looking for a solid character drama of human epicness and more personal voice go for Ice and Fire.If you are looking for a more magical truly grand and unwieldy journey into a massive wealth of magical things to try and understand go for Erikson.Also a sidenote I havent finished Malazan. Also I seem to be in the minority in not being able to get into Eriksons characters. I dont really know whats up with that most people seem to find them very deep and colorful. I honestly couldnt describe any one of them outside their magical abilities. I wish I could. Any tips are welcome.,Fantasy,cm7nu9q,11,t5_2qknd
2398256,0,t1_cm7nnk5,The sex scene doesnt actually have any sex. But more importantly the series does not have an Rrated tone or atmosphere. Sure its got some gruesome scenes and the world is objectively a pretty cruel and nasty place. But Lynchs presentation of the worldthe tone with which he chooses to depict itis relatively lighthearted and flippant. These are not horrifying or emotionally chilling stories. Theyre fun and often silly adventure tales with lots of colorfully vulgar language and occasional nasty bits to keep things from getting too boring or superficial.

Take for instance GTA V being removed from a couple stores cant remember their names in Australia due to a feminist petition. Theres a very real threat to authors being able to write the story they want to write from these groups.If say well defined magic systems like WoT had the same political support and rabid group of followers that was willing to blacklist authors or petition stores to stop selling them... then wed probably see people like GRRM defending his more vague and mysterious magic system from criticism.,Fantasy,cmt79oe,8,t5_2qknd

2665514,0,t3_2qiwx2,Ive run into a number of cases where it was clear reviews all came from shills sometimes only after reading the actual book and I now inherently distrust all books with a limited number of reviews simply for that reason. That obviously ends up weeding out a lot of newerless popular authors. Itd be nice if we had some more data with reviews eg instead of  stars we got some sort of breakdown or a normalized score based on the reviewers other ratings. That said I do rate all of the books I read but only infrequently write a review and usually only in two cases to point out the shills or to break apart a book that had some really strong and really weak aspects. It seems most of the gold tends to drift upward without having an actual review just based on the strength of its ratings.On another note Im still waiting for Amazon to go all Yelp with Goodreads. ,Fantasy,cn6ib3s,2,t5_2qknd

I have no experience with LBGT characters and I am not just going to randomly experiment. If I am going to create a character that label is applied to then it has to be done right. I know that is how some men feel about writing female characters. We need to hold up writers who achieve quality character even if they are few in number.

Inigo and Westly were at that level.A more serious answer is harder. The wizards are rarely my favorite characters in a book or series for various reasons.  Gandalf is good because hes got that mysterious and wise business down. He also has some good memorable lines. Harry Dresden really has the cool wow factor down. I love to read about Rincewind because I know it means Pratchett is going to skewer some of the more ridiculous aspects of fantasy lit. Sabriel and Lirael. The general concept of the Abhorsen.

If you read nothing else by her Id recommend reading The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas  its a short story that highlights all of her strengths as a writer while nimbly dodging all her weaknesses. Id also conditionally recommend The Left Hand of Darkness not as a story but as a thoughtexperiment on nongendered society. Sci fi obviously but I feel thats probably still kosher here. Im still trying to make it through The Name of the Wind and I just want to cave Kvothes smugass face in every time he starts talking about himself how quickly he learns everything how is name literally means knowledge and all that shit. Still Rothfuss does have a way with words and any time the focus is not on Kvothe I genuinely find myself admiring the worldbuilding and nuanced description he does.Its a shame its a story about Kvothe though.

I thought it would be like the Black Cauldron but would last longer.  I can remember my mom having to explain some of the words idiosyncrasies?  but this book made me a fantasy fan for life. After the Eye of the World kids books were just ... too simple.  Too quick.   After that it was mostly books from the fantasy and Sci fi adult section.  Coming home with a backpack full of books my mom flipping through them to make sure that they were safe for a kid my age  this book ruined me for Goosebumps books forever.  I wouldnt have it any other way.Still we had a chart in class where every  pages you got a star and every hundred pages you got a personal pan pizza from Pizza Hut.  Teacher had to cut me off from the pizzas once I really got rolling on the book. All I wanted to do was read it.  And she said I shouldnt abuse the system which was to motivate kids who didnt like to read with pizza not stuff of a kid like me that didnt want to do anything except read with an unhealthy amount of junk food.

I have a really high tolerance for evil black humour but I do draw the line at children being raped to death and then eaten as well as psychopathic Dutch halflings. Those moments just completely derailed the mood of the book. The parts with the orcs are pretty bloody and violent too but the violence is so exagerated that you can find it funny.

There is only one person acting disrespectfully that I have seen in this thread so far and that is you.EDIT I would also argue that his basic premise is flawed. Often people hate legitimately flawed heroes and have a much harder time relating to them. Most characters that people love as flawed hero they love not because of a legitimate flaw but because of a virtue in excess of what our society can allow. While in real life it may be considered a flaw generally speaking in a fantasy setting we are free to indulge in that virtue without having to worry about the limits that society sets.They are reading the story because the people are strong witty masters of their fate free efficient unbound by conventions and a whole host of other things that while it would be horrible if applied to our world still connect with us not as flaws but as virtues. When you read the witty rogue the unbound barbarian the machiavellian mastermind you arent sharing in their flaws but sharing in the strengths that are unacceptable to show in our own world.Characters that show legitimate flaws are usually much more divisive.

In LotR its somewhat more subtle but in the end not subtle at all.You walk with the protagonists through lost history all the damn time and the characters wont shut up about it. Moody Elves and Dwarves and Numenorans It sort of begins with Weathertop then Moria emptied and cold and dark mourning elves in Lothlorien the Argonath border of a kingdom long withered standing alone in the wilderness the swamps battlefield almost forgotten Cirith Morgul corrupted wizards and stewards and kings fallen from grace broken swords and broken promises and broken characters. That book breathes melancholy and yearning for a golden time long lost.Youre rarely told straight out true but its all there without consulting the Silmarillion.

Im not saying I need ASoIaFlevel sex every few chapters or falsely shoehorned in romance mind you. But hes not good with passion at all. He can write slowburning emotion like Dalinar and whatshername and he can write awkward teen coupling like Megan and David. But he cant write passion which makes olderteenyounger adult relationships entirely awkward.He also avoids cursing as much as possible which isnt entirely a bad thing but when its the kind of character youd expect it from it doesnt lend for a very realistic personality.

I think of traditional literature just has fewer aspects to measure it and so each one is more important. I think that traditional literature is a lot like weight lifting you need the form and the strength but not too much else. Theres obviously a whole world of perfection and complexity there at the highest level but less so than other things. I think of fantasy and sci fi as more like a sport like tennis you need the form and physical characteristics but then theres strategy tactics mindgames...etc. When there are more ways to measure ones performance any single metric becomes less important.,Fantasy,co798m8,9,t5_2qknd

Since Im the nonfiction editor one of the big things Im going for is to have pieces that interact with specific aspects of science fiction from the fandom to specific works to common tropes used within the genre. Theyre personal pieces in some sense since the people Im working with are queer themselves and often dont have the sort of outlet to talk about these issues.

3035955,0,t1_coaps2m,Have you tried reading Lynn Flewellings Nightrunner series?  Ive only read the first   she came back and wrote another  books I believe. Theyre about a young man who becomes apprenticed to a charming older thiefrogue and they go off on espionagefilled adventures.  The setting is your fairly traditional fantasy  swords wizardry lots of political intrigue.  But their relationship is absolutely lovely  very nuanced amp intelligent with occasional flaws. Since the younger guy starts out pretty young the first book is more about their friendship that matures into love over the course of the books.  She wrote another trilogy called the Tamir Triad which started with the Bone Dolls Twin  Its a significantly darker read that occasionally borders on almost gothic horror sensibilities.  Basically its about a young boy maybe  to  who discovers that he was born a girl and magically disguised as a boy in order to hide him away from his insane homicidal uncle.  She spends most of the books forced to hide her true identity amp gender and does end up falling in love.  Its ultimately a straight romance so it may not do it for you but most of that time the guy she loves isnt aware shes a girl so theres a lot of interesting gender identity issues wrapped up in their romance. ,Fantasy,cococlz,2,t5_2qknd

Kemps Egil and Nix stories  those have the same characters and yet they are released from different publishers...or soon will be because the next of those books were picked up by someone other than the original publisher.Robin Hobbs new Fitz books are also with Del Rey even though the originals were released by Bantam and her other books have been coming from Harper Voyager.Like me Joe Abercrombie has titles in both Del Rey and Orbit.

Im just gonna restate the things I usually tell himPeople learn about themselves through experience. Those experiences can be found in a novel that speaks to you or a girl winking at you from across a dance floor. Its all about the things that touch your heart and make you want to grow.No experience is better or worse than another experience. Novels especially fictionfantasy are best intended as parables. They offer outcomes of moral choices about fighting against forces that you cannot defend yourself against. They are meant to inspire hope. Its like the existence of musicals. Songs are used in place of dialogue in order to properly articulate what the character is feeling. Not everything you will experience in life serves some greater purpose.

3189439,0,t3_2wj9ja,As someone who has spent a lot of time online and at places where people are always trying to sell something and as a person who has spent years of his life actively trying to promote himself music in my case for me it all comes down to thisIf you are only talking to me to sell your product or promote yourself its very obvious and I have no interest in spending any time with you unless I am already an uberfan and even then it will be disappointing.If you are a person with something to promote or sell and you are interested in talking about things you like and meeting people whether or not it might turn into money in your pocket then I am ultimately more likely to take interest in what you are selling.  If youre talking about your product because youre excited about it thats way better than talking about your product because you want to make money.  Put another way if our interaction is going to be over the moment you have gotten some money out of me Im not going to be happy and I can usually tell way ahead of time if thats the kind of conversation were having.Thats why I like the authors who come here and are active in the community and make book recommendations and talk about their process and all that stuff.  Because its not all about them its about the fantasy genre as a whole and they are excited to play a part.So yeah promote your stuff but dont let your only activity on twitter and reddit be pushing your stories because I look at the front page and can tell immediately from a title whether this is mindless self promotion or someone trying to be a part of a community.,Fantasy,cosl2up,2,t5_2qknd

3203544,0,t3_2wstu6,I dont think we should censor based on words. If we want to censor certain content it should be based on the message of the content and the intent of the content. I think the Please Be Kind rule is a great guideline for this. I mean I could reply to a Mark Lawrence comment and tell him that Broken Empire was fucking amazing. I dont think there is anything wrong with that. Whereas I could also say something like I think Malaysians are an inferior race and earth would be better off without them. No swearing in that but its absolutely not something that I would want to see on rfantasy. Basically ignore swear words focus on the message.,Fantasy,cou1p2j,5,t5_2qknd

Its about a young kid destined to be the chosen one but he is dyslexic and the magic of the world is comprised of the written word. The sequels are just as good but follow different characters and have different perspectives of the overarching conflict.The Black Magician series by Trudi Canavan is another good one about a gifted street urchin who works her way up in the world to challenge great magicians.The Obernewtyn Chronicles by Isobelle Carmody is a postapocalyptic story where the fallout from nuclear war caused mutations that allow for magical abilities like telepathy telekinesis healing talking to animals and other types of abilities. Follows a young girl who gets sent away to a type of prison for other mutant kids and through the series you get to see her grow into her powers and take on a leadership role.Magician by Raymond E.

3325723,0,t1_coydnwc,Second bonus review! Since the original link was to a very short introduction I went ahead and purchased the collected set of all three novellas Ash and Magic. That review isgt Ash and Magic follows the struggle of Wizard University an outofphase analog to the realworld University of Washington in Seattle student Ashley as she deals with trying to pass her dueling requirement to stay in school. Already highly accomplished in Summoning her struggles with War Magic lead to explosive growth both magically and sexually.gt gt This is a personal story told at the characters gut levels rather than a sprawling weighty oppressive tome of epic fantasy. In setting and tone its more like Jim Butchers Dresden Files albeit with a female main character but its even more personal and less loaded with existential global annihilation than that. Were treated to one womans troubles her inner dialog her struggle to come to grips with who and what she wants to be.gt gt Not to say that this is some kind of droning memoirstyle journal Park keeps the tone light and fun engaging with the reader in a way thats as charming as it is effective. You find yourself rooting for Ash even while you worry for her. Shes far from perfect and part of the fun of the book for me was seeing her make what I think will probably be mistakes though she seems oblivious as any youngster in the throes of making choices would be. Author Sophie Parks writing style is smooth conversational and easy to read.gt gt Theres also a delightful frisson between what we in the real world have been taught to think about angels and demons and seeing what this universe of Parks creation has them actually being all unfolding through Ashs ongoing and potentially naive experiences. I honestly dont know what the truth of the story is yet and thats a lot of fun. This could all go horribly wrong in accordance with my cultural expectations or wonderfully right as we find weve all been misled all along by what Authority has taught us.gt gt I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and eagerly await the ensuing chapters. Park has a gift for writing engaging prose that never gets in the way of itself and getting to experience a new world through the eyes of a thoroughly modern female character who happens to be able to summon demons was delightful. I highly recommend this book for anyone who enjoys light urban fantasy with the potential to turn darker.gt gt Warning The novel contains adult language and explicit sexual encounters all well done but still unquestionable adult in content. Parents of younger readers should be aware that these situations may not be appropriate for their child. For everyone else giddyup!,Fantasy,cp7cz9h,2,t5_2qknd

3338505,0,t3_2ydx9c,Id recommend Heroes Die by Matthew Woodring Stover. The central protagonist is an assassin with a fun twist and most of the other characters are very morally grey.And speaking of assassins theres always the classic Vlad Taltos series by Steven Brust.

3342336,0,t3_2yff56,I smiled Planning dinner then?She looked back over her shoulder and nodded.I riddled off mentally which type of dishes she could make with the ingredients listed but as I thought about it more and more something dawned on me.What day was it?  Why was everybody so kind and gentle? I felt myself suddenly silent and immediately blurted out my thoughts Is it your birthday?She beamed a smile back at me and winked It is.We continued on down the narrow aisle of vendors and I was keen to keep an eye out for any stalls that might have something  anything that I could give her as a present. Every stall had the variation of the same odd things. Trinkets voodoo idols carvings incense and lots of badly smelling cheese. But as we went deeper and deeper the market grew narrower and narrower. The thick stones on either side of the alleyway felt like they were threatening to close shut on top of us. It was then that I felt a sweet twinge flood both nostrils as the smell of the passing foods came heavy in the air. The ebonflow of this corridor felt almost secure as the crowds began to race in between us. They offered a momentary escape from conversation as she and I forcefully drifted. One moment I saw her and the next she was replaced by someone else. Here I was one of the many lost in the roar of commotion lost in my thoughts.Suddenly we stopped and there she was again turning to meet me.I dont like it here Jin. I want to leave  right now we have to go.There was an urgency in her tone an urgency that felt pressing. She snapped up my hand dragged me through the crowd of people.Where are we going Tali? I fervently asked. Isnt it your birthday dont you want something?She paused without answering and looked back. Its only then that I followed her gaze and looked back. I saw only a flash of bright white light and heard screams and cries shatter the air like milkglass. I felt the air thicken grow hot heavy and the breath squeeze all at once from my lungs.Then everything went black.When I woke it was to the flat of stone. My arm felt wet and my head heavy. There was a calm and eerie silence in the air and as I pulled myself up I understood why.Corpses.The alleyway was shattered. Broken stones and bodies littered the streets in mutual abundance. My ears were singing and I couldnt compose a thought. The strings in my head were playing on repeat with a pinging vibrato. Slowly the world fades in like a fog lifting from my mind.My sleeve was matted to my skin stuck with blood. It hurt less than I would have imagined. It felt dull and throbby. I blinked blinked again and pinched the bridge of my nose. I couldnt shake the feeling and even worse I couldnt get up. It felt impossible like my feet were too heavy for my body.But as the ringing in my ears slowly faded I heard something a dull something. Then I saw that something. It was a faint translucence to the air around me. It shimmered blue. Its source I discovered as I turned my head.Tali. She was straining to maintain concentration her eyes thin and her nose wrinkled. The mysterious blue fog massed in her hands hands that with arms outstretched manifested a thin and similarly blue barrier. Inside was our bastion our safety. The tiles unscathed spared from the outsides destruction.But as I tried to say something the edges of my vision closed in on me and I raced to meet the ground.,Fantasy,cp991qf,2,t5_2qknd

3350811,0,t1_cpa71fq,I cant argue that its popular.  But I cant understand why.  It doesnt appeal to me on any level with its dearth of genuinely likable characters nonexistent plot and its stubborn refusal to get to the point.  Mainly I find the POV switching tedious and unnecessary in Game of Thrones itself.  While intrigue and multiple stories may demand constantly switching viewpoints later in the series I wont read them since the first book completely failed to win me over its just not necessary in the exposition which appears to be the entirety of the first book another drawback in and of itself.  Theres no need to tell us anything in book one from Daenarys point of view since she wont contribute anything in this book.  We could come back to her in book two and actually focus on one person long enough to develop a rapport with her.  Instead her interludes jar the reader out of a groove that is apparently focused on Arya or John or the other kid whose name I forget.  And the interminable switching between the Stark kids further diminshes the readers ability to focus on any one of them.  Pick a handful of characters tell the story from their point of view and put some effort into making me care about them.  Instead I get a halfdozen characters none of whom stand out or tell their own story.Book  needs to function on its own as a story and it doesnt.  It fails to develop any character enough to win the reader over and doesnt seem to have any coherent plot.  Ive been told the TV show presents the material of the first book better than the book does being far less tedious.  I dont plan to test that.And Im just not going to sit through  pages of exposition before the author can finally make me care about one of his protagonists.  Not when Mercedes Lackey or Brandon Sanderson can do the same job in  pages.  Hell I like Richard Castle as an author more the G.R.R. Martin and hes a fictional character himself.,Fantasy,cpa7u53,1,t5_2qknd

3360006,0,t3_2yloyh,Some excellent timing for this post as I just finished book  of this series today.  I burned through all  books in a week on audiobook.Im seeing some negative reaction in these comments to the fantasy for grown ups tag and thought Id add my own impressions.  I might be wary too if I saw that in a review as Im not someone who generally enjoys slow serious books where nothing much happens outside of the characters heads.Thats not what you get here.  Plenty happens and some of it is violent.  You get a war with some battles and a city sacked.  Several assassinations and nefarious plots.  So far so normal for fantasy series.What is different is the feel of the thing.  Dont read this for heartwarming triumphafterhardship story arcs.  That story arc is actually in there but it doesnt come out heartwarming and triumphant.  Every gain has a price every triumph is someone elses tragedy.  Characters do things for what they consider are the best of reasons only to watch their lifes work explode into a mess of chaos and ruin.The characters are believable some of them likeable others not.  Even the unlikeable ones have understandable motivations.  Few of them get the lives they would want given the choice.  Most do the best they can with what theyve got though they all fall short in some way or other.Again not a series to read when you want uplifting or stirring stuff to make you feel good. I read Brandon Sanderson for uplifting Christopher Moore for funnies Charles Stross or Ben Aaronovitch for thoughtful entertainment Richard K Morgan for a bit of gory anger and interesting images Mark Lawrence for marvellously entertaining carnage and Ilona Andrews for a touch of romanceThis series left me with a slightly sad feeling but not to the extent where I regret reading it.

3371505,0,t3_2ysk9i,I kind of have the opposite opinion of a lot of Malazan fans when it comes to the Esslemont novels. I feel like this is one of the best ones and generally they get worse as Esslemont tries more and more to mimic Erikson. Later stuff like Return of the Crimson Guard and Stonewielder felt so needlessly bloated for the story theyre trying to tell. Seriously why did we need that Ghelel plot? It doesnt serve the plot in any way nor does it stand on its own. The only book that really got away with its extended length was Orb Scepter Throne and it did that by dealing with long established Erikson characters we actually care about. Note I havent read Assail yet in case thats that one happens to be really good or somethingNight of Knives though it doesnt waste your time like that. Just sticks with the two main characters and develops them instead of finding  other people who had nothing to do with the plot and trying to justify their inclusion. Its not an amazing book but its a solid addition to the Malazan world and knew how not to overstay its welcome. And it does have that one section about Tempers time at the siege of YGhatan which I think stands out as probably the best writing of Esslemonts Ive read so far.,Fantasy,cpckr6e,3,t5_2qknd

SpoilersThe main storylines that people put on the chopping block are Elayne claiming the throne Egwene holding a serene expression against Aes Sedai and the Malden pit of suck. The major issues with all of these plotlines is that there arent great adversaries. Do you even remember who Elaynes main challenger for the throne was?

3398530,0,t3_2z2z8x,You can try Conn Igguldens Conquerer Series.  Its about the rise of Ghengis Khan.  I dont know if it has an Eastern feel or not.  Maybe it was more of a Western retelling of Khans story.  The books are fun reads and you can get through them pretty easy.Ive had a hard time finding good books on the Vikings so I would also like to here some recommendations.  The first book in Cornwells Saxon series is pretty good and focuses on the Viking culture.  I didnt like the second book that much so I dont know how well the rest of the series is.I also read the first book in a series by Tim Severin called Oddins Child.  I think that was a pretty good book.  I think it as very war focused.  Its been a number of years since Ive read it so my memory is fuzzy.I also found the Long Price Quartet to have an Eastern feel.  I only read the first one and that was two years ago so I could be wrong.Edit  A few notes on the Igguldens Conquerer series.  I started to read Igguldens Emperor series about Julius Caesar and was utterly disgusted by the liberties that he took in his telling of the story.  Ive read a lot of historical fiction set in Rome and studied historical texts about the time period so that kind of skewed my perception.  With that being said my guess is that he took the same liberties for the Conquerer series and since I didnt have a background in reading Mongolian history.,Fantasy,cpfnpse,1,t5_2qknd

All the arguments about piracy supposedly creating paying markets for artists or justifications for piracy because works may not be readily available in some areas or publishers overcharge dont mean much to me. I think theyre excuses to salve the conscience of people who dont want to compensate an artist for the work theyre enjoying.And I dont believe being a writer means constantly sucking up to your fans. Thats just conforming your talent to the chase for bucks.Write interesting and compelling novels and Ill try them out. If a book doesnt measure up Ill stop reading.

Anyone who denies this proposition they consider less than a man since he has degraded the sublimity of his own soul to the base level of a beasts wretched body.

3543059,0,t1_cpw48zt,Yeah but when I say its hard to fight the temptation I mean that. Its certainly terrible for my current reading habits but I think some part of me enjoys the thought that someone might be messaging me. I have been disconnected on occaission now and then ususally due to nessacity either being somewhere inaccessible or being temp without powernet access or between phones. I agree that at first my reaction is omg nooooo my life what am going to dooooo? all dramaticlike. But then I quickly adapt until the situation changes again. Its not a big deal to unplug for a while but Ive grown used to being connected to people in this new age. Plus its not really practical for me to turn my phone on silent for too long we no longer have a house phone and my husband is terrible about keeping track of his cell so one of us needs to keep a line available in case theres an emergency and someone is trying to reach us.Anyway this is why Ive been going out on reading trips to parkslocal gardens when the weather is nice.

The DOJ was right in prosecuting them for pricing fixing and collusion as it was extremely clear that all the major publishers were in talks about how to raise their prices and all agreed to do so together and at the same time.   This is a classic example of pricing fixing.  You can argue that the price fixing was there to even the playing field but it was still classic price fixing behaviour which did financially impact consumers.   Amazon is certainly the behemoth in ebooks but the DOJ doesnt have a reason to go after them for ebooks because there is competition from multiple businesses for ebooksphysical books. ,Fantasy,cpxzb0d,9,t5_2qknd

Or if I look at a map of the world and see that there are all these huge cities but outside that is blasted hellscape with no farmlands. You can justify a lot of these things with magic or with imagined bits of biology but a lot of the stock fantasy will just take this vague concept of the Middle Ages start changing things around and then not actually think about the resulting society.You end up with inauthentic made up worlds which I dont particularly like to read about.,Fantasy,cq5gt6m,11,t5_2qknd

3647440,0,t3_324r1l,Awesome book. You can read it both as a standalone or as the stage setter of the Wars of Light and Shadow series my favorite epic fantasy series ever!!.I discovered Janny Wurts through her standalones To Ride Hells Chasm and Master of White Storm I was enchanted by her characterdriven yet full of action plots the originality the care for the characters and the gorgeous rich prose.She writes adult fantasy that is for sure. This is no book for skim read for it is deep and very layered complex. The reader is not supplied upfront all the answers and is prompted to decide what to think. No cookiecutter and evil dark VS good light or evil light VS good dark for that matter story and the plot follows several threads. The characters are superbly rounded and again while some are instantly likeable and easy to relate too others are not and their reasons or behaviors are not out of whim but not instantly revealed.Mistwraith is a book to court and its slow burn nature is highly rewarding! I realize that the first chapters are not easy for the reader the worldbuilding is huge and cleverly interspersed but I wasnt left blind some things are related quite early in the book so I could form my own opinion. After that action and basic knowledge of what was going on got me involved and I read in a hooking crescendo until the final sequence after which I decided I was going to read all the series because if Mistwraith represented a sample of the whole series structure of the elements of the story of the roundness of the characters and the unpredictability of the plot hell I was indeed in for the ride.And time proved me totally right even more than I initially thought given the broader perspective and the worldwide scope of the plots right now and the fact the characters kept all their promises and more Ive read up to Initiates Trial.The other element to consider is the writing style rich beautiful vibrant and never neutral but then again if for me it was instant challenge and then unconditional love it is clearly a matter of personal preferences.Edit elaborated a little on my experience with this book.,Fantasy,cq81a8l,7,t5_2qknd

3648755,0,t1_cq84yh7,But most people dont have time to read everything. If they only nominate the books theyve read and theyve missed a huge section of books they SHOULD have read then we arent going to get a ballot that reflects the tastes of everyone in the voting population.Whereas if they follow a slate drawn by someone who likes the same shit they do while still imperfect well get closer to that goal.Let me put it this way a guy replied to one of my posts saying that he grokked my point and liked my username. Then he asked what my favorite scifi is. I gave him a list and he shares the same taste. However he hadnt heard of the Kris Longknife series and was pleasantly surprised to hear about it. Im sure hell enjoy it just as much as I did.I read way way too much scififantasy and even I dont know every single new book that comes out. I do know what I like and I can alternatively reccommend to others or follow the reccomendations of those with the same taste and even more reading time. If Correia plugs something its probably stuff I like. If N.K. Jemisin or Elizabeth Bear plugs it its ... less likely to be. Maybe its still gonna be good but based on my track record reading their stuff it just doesnt grip me. Now if theres something reccomended by both Correia and Jemisin then by God I know Ive got some incredibly awesome shit on my hands.So Ill read the stuff on a CorreiaFlintWeber slate and maybe if I have time Ill check out the BearJemisin slate. If theres a weak link in the former I wouldnt nominate it. If theres a strong entry on the latter then I will.Thats just common sense right? Nobody is forcing anyone to vote straight down the ticket so why would any responsible person DO that? Why would you vote something youve never read and dont even like? ,Fantasy,cq86oeq,0,t5_2qknd

3689081,0,t1_cqcdiej,I suggest reading this gtIve posted this before but theres something one needs to keep in mind about Faile. We see her almost exclusively from inside Perrins head. Perrins nose makes him a fullblown empath and critically Faile does not know this. She knows he has an ultra sensitive nose but no where does she ever reflect that his nose lets him know every little flicker of emotion that passes through her mind.gtAllow me to give an example using an archtypical encounter with Berelain.gtPerrins POVgtBerelain walks by and jiggles at Perrin. Faile doesnt react but smells jealous. Perrin reassures her that she doesnt need to be jealous. Faile tells him perfectly calmly that she knows that but now she smells jealous hurt and angry. Perrin broods.gtSeems familiar enough right? Well now lets take a trip inside Failes headgtBerelain walks by and jiggles at Perrin. She ignores the hussy chasing after her husband  she knows Perrin is completely loyal to her  and makes sure that nothing shows on her face. Suddenly Perrin tells her she doesnt need to be jealous. She tells Perrin that she knows that but why would he mention that out of the blue like that? She knew that none of her feelings towards Berelain were on her face. Did Perrin think that Faile needed the reassurance because there was something to be worried about? sigh No Perrin didnt mean that of course. Hes trying his best so theres no reason to let him know how upset I am right now. Oh great whats he brooding about now?gtA lot of Failes PoV scenes in the books bear this out she knows that Perrin is devoted to her and isnt actually worried about him cheating.

She has handled being a pawn as well as can be expected and really matured.  Arya managed to escape and survive on her own which I dont think Sansa wouldve ever been able to do. Arya has never acted like a victim unlike Sansa even though terrible things have happened to her. But as you mentioned Arya is still immature in a lot of ways even if she is more selfreliant. Still Arya took control of her own life to some extent. Arya and the other Starks have made bold choices and dealt with the consequences. Sansa hasnt really done anything bold or interesting on her own...not yet. But I understand the reasons people like Sansa even if I dont share those feelings.  To each hisher own.

3763847,0,t1_cql99if,Pretty much this. The Fantasy genre as a whole not just epic has such a wide scope that nearly any kind of story can be told and still fall within the genre. The success and popularity of LOTR and the initial clones like Sword of Shannara did lead to a lot of very similar works and its like anything if you have to much of something you tend to get bored of it.While Tolkien was popular its difficult to argue that it is hard to write nonderivative fantasy works.  Massively popular guys like Robert E. Howard or Fritz Leiber were writing fantasy at the same time as Tolkien and were plenty different. So it wasnt as if Tolkien came along and just invented the genre out of thin air.Though DnD which came along later and drew heavily on LOTR was probably a massive contributing factor in relation to solidifying some of the genres tropes today.,Fantasy,cqlb1zf,3,t5_2qknd

3781203,0,t3_33pl4a,I think no matter how hard you try not to let reviews or what youve heard about a series sway you its hard to not let that thought slip in while reading and have you asking yourself are they right? Or having the reviews build up the story the way you think it will happen from things youve read. Its kind of like how they put all the best parts in the movie trailers and you build the story around that in your head or the coolness of an action scene is meh because youve seen it a hundred times already in the previews. I do tend to not read anything thats popular for awhile for that reason. If I do think I might enjoy reading something after hearing a few things about them Ill stay away from the comments and spoilers as much as I possibly can to try and keep my view fresh. The good thing about getting old is you forget about a lot of the stuff til your reminded while reading and then its an after the fact opinion you can compare to instead of a as it happens opinion. ,Fantasy,cqnaa3e,4,t5_2qknd

3819103,0,t3_345ka9,On the one hand Im a sworn enemy of book snobbery. There are no guilty pleasures and people should read what they like. Full disclosure Im a librarian and its my business to put books in peoples hands. I think well have made progress in this conversation when we learn how to differentiate between books I personally like and good books and the opposite books that dont do it for me and bad books. On the other hand when I read people complain about being looked down on or elitism or snobbery I always feel like Im being ordered to like what they like. As if I have a moral responsibility to enjoy Kevin J. Anderson or Stephanie Meyer as much as I enjoy more high brow works like Cat Valente or China Mieville. Were all allowed to like what we like. On the other hand what I like cant be the universal standard for what is a good book.So my . US dollars say that theres no such thing as a guilty pleasure. That books are for readers every reader has her book and every book has its readers. more library ethics here So we should read what makes us happy.What I really want is for people to read enough to have a clear selfunderstanding about what they like. I want people to read enough to know that there are good books that they personally dont like. Really I think that is the key. We can stop talking about elitism and snobbery when we stop judging people for the books they read but dont lose the ability to evaluate the books themselves. The holy grail here is for all of us to learn how to tell the difference between books we like and good books. ,Fantasy,cqrlx86,27,t5_2qknd

3839539,0,t3_34e1cb,I didnt read much this month. Primarily because Im poor so I read kindle books on sale and from the library. Only  full length and  collections of short stories. First I read The Grace of Kings by Ken Liu.  It was pretty good. I dont mind the telling but I can see how it gripes people. I found myself really liking Kuni Garu though I have a minor complaint towards the end about his character arc that is completely personal and I understand why Ken Liu went the path he did. Its about an  for me better written than Stormlight Archives with smoother and more interesting character arcs but with a lack of wonder in the world at large compared to Stormlight or really most fantastical fantasy. It doesnt diverge greatly from historical with very little fantasy framing. ASOIAF has white walkers and dragons greensight and flame magic. A Grace of Kings has... Gods and if the gods are to be believed some magic of their own which I wont mention due to possible spoilers. But alas I prefer more folksy hedge soft magic than ambitions of Gods no matter how subtle. The competitive nature of the Gods reminded me a bit of the mysterious powerful godsghosts? in Prince of Thorns.The second book is The City Stained Red by Sam Sykes. I was fairly happy with it. On world building I think hes more accomplished at giving a clear picture of races than say Daniel Abrahams Dagger and Coin series which is a bit numbing when it comes to actually giving a picture of the different races. The city itself the Souk and silk spiders and spire Shicttown etc etc. All pretty interesting. The religions are pretty evocative with the belly crawling worshippers questioning Clerics and all that. In regards to the story.... It did feel very much like a massive prologue. I very much enjoyed that characters were allowed to have existing lives and relationships to one another outside of the book. Their backstories with one another actively interfere with their relationships. This Ive been finding more and more to be rare and much needed in Fantasy. But when it comes to the story itself I find it kinda... in the mucks. Dialogue and Character interactions are obsessed with the city itself and a feeling of what next? Amidst the very stubborn characters.  The entire book only takes up a few days so I see why those interactions take awhile to progress its reasonable but it wore me out and stopped it from becoming a real page turner. All in all Id probably give it a  which is generally where I usually put the works of Daniel Abraham and Brandon Sanderson though all for different reasons. Id definitely recommend the book and hope the next ones will be as goodbetter. Two books of short stories. The first was Laird Barrons Occultation but thats horror so I wont discuss it. The second was The Last Wish by Andrzej Saprowski he writes The Witcher series and these short stories are about the Witcher. Honestly at least on the kindle edition I dont recommend it. Its RIDDLED with typos. I give any professionally published book about  typos. Anything more and I question the editor. This has  per story. Its very glaring. Incorrect apostrophes a random asterisk misspelling words misspelling character names. Some sentences are messed up by translation mainly just in word choices not unreadably messed up but apparent. Saying that the stories themselves were decent. Basically retelling of fairy tales. I personally enjoyed the framing story and probably half of the stories themselves definitely the Scandinavian? monsters. Especially the more common retold fairy tales like beauty and the beast. Id probably recommend this to fans of the Witcher already Ive never read them or played the videogame but I wouldnt recommend paying full price. Probably a  or  for me.,Fantasy,cqtxvys,3,t5_2qknd
3840724,0,t1_cqu1rm7,I hate this kind of genre nitpicking tbh even if it is considered as truth not sure  So lets say a book has a magic system which is pretty scientific law of energy conservation etc. Then we have a book which has a new technology which allows time travel and has some pseudo science behind it.

3895571,0,t3_351qiy,Roger Zelaznys Amber Series turned into an animated or live action miniseries. The series was optioned decades ago and nothing ever came of it likely because youd need good actors and special effects to do it justice. It has some of the same appeal game of thrones does the primary conflicts are the political machinations of the royal family against the backdrop of an external existential threat. The best part though is that the books and series itself are short. It could be stretched to cover multiple seasons up to  for the original series or just follow the main story and be a miniseries which worked for Gracepoint and True Detective. Mostly though I just want to see one of my favourite stories in a different format. Another alternative would be a video game with procedurally generated worlds.  One of the royal familys primary powers is traveling to alternate works or dimensions so procedural generation could represent that power well.  It could also be a really interesting game mechanic.  ie what do you need to change to reach a certain world which choices lead to the easiest path  try to get to Avalon by changing the colour of sky first and you get to fight through dragon dominated worlds the whole way there but change it last and the trip takes much much longer .

Well not first first but you get the driftEdit Guys I know WoT didnt literally pioneer the common tropes in fantasy. That was just a tongueincheek play on Simpsons did it first!. All I meant was that if youve read a lot of more recent fantasy works some of the tropes might feel a bit over done.

Will you apply it or will you choose to reject that knowledge and say something what other ignorant in that regard people are saying?In any case I understand that there are themes and complex stuff people wont hit right. Take martial arts and combat. That is usually not done correctly. That however is far more complex. Takes a great deal of experience and knowledge to even understand where the problems lie. Topics like that or lack of proper information is understandable. That wont pull me out unless the act is something absolutely absurd without aid of magic. But learning how to call something by name? That takes few seconds to google. If you are going to have a military protagonist he isnt going to call a magazine a clip. ,Fantasy,cratcbu,1,t5_2qknd

4045281,0,t3_36ul9x,So I just finished this book a couple days ago and have started on the second.  Heres my thoughts. Im a fast reader that skims.  This book punishes that type of reader.  I had to consciously change my approach to enjoy this book because entire concepts get mentioned in a single line and thats it. There isnt really a point in the book where everything clicks.  Its more like little epiphanies throughout and a whole host of unanswered questions after you finish. I had to become comfortable with ignorance of things while still trying to put things together.  Its...really weird. The magic system doesnt really get explained. Claws are the imperial assassins and spies. The Adjunct is an antimagic mage killer and the Empress righthand errand girl.Honestly after finishing it I have lots of questions very foggy understanding of many things but there was a complete conclusion to the plot there at the end.Im sticking with it because I want to see where the story goes but I cannot fault anyone for walking away.  The book seems designed to be inaccessible but I was pretty impressed with how everything came together at the end.,Fantasy,crhe4yb,6,t5_2qknd

4062189,0,t1_crijlwc,So the first thing that comes to mind is there probably is its probably related to reserves for returns.  Basically early on in a books life cycle a large number of sales arent paid for because the publisher doesnt know if they are sold through left the bookstore or bought  in arrived at the bookstore but might be returned if they arent sold.Each publisher has a slightly different royalty statement some will show the amount reserved for returns but others wont.  For me I needed to get something called a unit ledger which showed that  of my print sales werent paid for in the initial earning statement.  Now as time goes on and the return level is a known quantity a lot of those sales show up in later statements. So if your friend doesn t know their return on reserves ask him to ask his publisher to find out what that is.Another possibility is the publisher could have sold a right they signed to another company as a subsidiary right. In this case the income per book goes down substantially because the income that publisher A pays to publisher B is then split between Publisher B and the author.The next thing that comes to mind is how does he know he sold  copies?  If its on the royalty statement then they are accounted for.  If its not on the royalty statement then is he jsut guessing at that number?The next issue is how and where were those books sold?  If a large number of them were export sales then the royalty rate shifts from  of cover price to  of net receipts.  In this case a royalty that is usually . a book moves to . a book.  The same applies for books at high discount.  There are some other things that can cause this to happen but Id have to see the royalty statement and the contract to know for sure.The other thing to keep in mind is that the sales are greatly delayed.  If much of the sales happened toward the end of the year rather than the start of the year then the income would be coming on the next royalty period.  Its quite possible that the first royalty is a portion royalty because if the book came out in say April it is only going to report on the April  June sales which will arrive October.  The July  December sales will show up on the statement that comes the NEXT April.Not receiving a penny probably isnt  accurate...as he Im assuming received an advance.  So it was there that his pennies came in and until the sum of the all the royalties goes over that amount yes there would be no income.If you want give him my email address michaeldotsullivandotdcatgmaildotcom.  And Ill do some private poking around at his statement if hell share it with me and I can then have a better idea if anything smells really fishy.He should keep in mind that he can always audit the statement. And in some cases that may be warranted.,Fantasy,crjbhr6,2,t5_2qknd

4068164,0,t1_crjzs7f,Stormlight by Brandon Sanderson is gonna be closer to home of wheel of time Epic fantasy style but its not complete yet. The First Law in my opinion is a much more straight forward fantasy trilogy with other side books set in the same world. Its good but kinda weird going from a  book series to a trilogy imo. Malazan as said above is on a whole different plane of fantasy. It throws you into a world with information that isnt explained til later. The first book is really good but wont make much sense until later books. This series has a lot of characters like WoT or aSoIaF and a massive world.

Most of us could use some additional tools for quieting our minds. I dont know if meditation itself is spreading fast but yoga sure seems to be.

I do not mind the story expending more on some secondary characters but to have my favorites being removed form the story all together to fitin others I currently feel no emotional attachment to is harsh. I hope it wont happen. Brandon is a clever writer he must know his fans love the current crew and want to keep reading about them. There is also the fact most  comments from fans those I have read wanting to read more about Szeth andor Eshonai have to do with world building ie they are curious about the other cultures the Shins and a certain sword. However for my part since I am a character reader I care less about such things but I care immensely about character development. After two books I now have my favorites and I do want to keep on reading about them. Also if the core cast keep changing then we are not talking about epic fantasy anymore...

The characters in AoL Wax and Wayne are central to the next set of Mistborn books being released soon. Shadows of Self is due out this fall and Bands of Mourning is due out in January. Those next Mistborn books are part of a trilogy and I think Bands of Mourning is only the nd book in the series. AoL being a standalone book.Either way youre going to be waiting on a book.

Ive found waiting  years or a decade  and taking a second look and wow then stuff clicked.Or the opposite  some titles dont work for me now that would have been hits if Id encountered them earlier in life.If a book doesnt work at the moment  thats because what you value at the moment is not what that particular book is delivering. As your interest mood outlook changes focus then the book might push your buttons differently.Thats why I always return to a book that left me cold. Ive even left the book mark in them for years then come back in a different frame of mind.Often my opinion has turned   and Id have missed some incredible reads if Id stuck on my former impression.Not every book works this way  I do get impatient with thinly drawn YA Ive just simply grown out of it.

4297076,0,t1_cs9y2dk,Just to be clear Sandersons Laws which most people refer to when talking about modern fantasys tendency to have welldefined rules doesnt say that having welldefined systems is inherently better. It is about the relationship between solving problems with magic and how well the reader understands it.Part of this is that it does need to at least be consistent enough to avoid the Wait why dont they just do this? They did that earlier situation.  Mostly it just means that you cant have unexplained magic solve your problems in a way that doesnt inherently make sense.Consider LotR.  Magic is incredibly vague which is totally fine. All the reader needs to know is that the Bad Guys have a lot of magic that they can use to kill the Good Guys and take over the world. The only part that is clearly defined in the trilogy itself is that if you destroy the One Ring the Good Guys win. And that is all that is needed and all that comes into play at the climax. Each of the other magical artifacts either has a vague effect Galadriels light weakening Shelob or a simple one Sting glowing with orcish proximity.Had Samwise suddenly discovered latent magical abilities that gave him the ability to fly while strugging up Mount Doom and used this to carry Frodo past Gollum there would be a serious issue with the conclusion. But avoiding that flaw doesnt require rigid definitions of magics capabilities it just means avoiding cheap tricks to solve problems.,Fantasy,csa04sg,30,t5_2qknd
4301418,0,t3_3a8nkd,I read mainly UF as I like a world thats mostly familiar instead of one where Id need lots of boring exposition just to understand enough background info to follow the actual story. My ideal setting is modern with the supernatural still not public knowledge. I like the theme of a dark underworld monsters hiding in plain sight and conspiracies.Storywise I like things relatively small scale and fast paced and actionheavy. My favorite premise is crimemysteryespionage  supernatural elements.  The supernatural elements are the most important aspect of a setting. I like originality not twists on real world mythology. I prefer specific innate powers over vague doanything sorcery. I dont care about the underlying metaphysics of supernatural powers as long as they have limits.Characterwise I like villains and antiheroes characters just trying to survive or achieve their goals and who are not afraid to be as brutally violent as the situation requires. I do not like deontologists or paragons of virtue. I like badasses who are already competent adults when the story begins and do not need to come of age. I prefer loners and misfits who stay that way.,Fantasy,csahsys,1,t5_2qknd
4301696,0,t3_3a8nkd,Consequences.Too often if the protagonists in a fantasy story make mistakes they dont really suffer any consequences or the consequences are felt by some minor character to ensure that the protagonist isnt hurt. If the protagonists make mistakes I want them to experience real consequences. Sometimes that might mean death but its generally more interesting if its something thatll affect the character drastically going forward. Jaime and Theon in ASoIaF Caul Shivers in Best Served Cold etc. If I actually feel that the characters are in genuine danger and can suffer as a result of the mistakes they make Ill be more invested in the story. Of course this isnt unique to fantasy but its something that isnt done enough in fantasy. Too often it feels like the author is too afraid to punish or hurt their perfect protagonist. ,Fantasy,csaixh7,3,t5_2qknd

4413843,0,t3_3bknqf,I think the key with Abercrombies books is to take solace in the little victories. As Glokta says to Jezal as close as I can remember I think between the two of us we might do some little good.Its also worth remembering that Bayaz isnt actually allpowerful or allknowing. Sometimes he gets things wrong. Like when he gives Jezal shit about leading that charge against the breach. It was absolutely the right thing to do and it probably saved the city. Jezals demand that the citizens of Adua be let into the Agriont is the same way and led to the people of the Union loving their new and questionablylegitimate king. Bayazs contempt for heroism and decency is unwarranted. The Heroes spoilers and Jezals refusal to execute the children of Lord Brock eventually leads to him having an able and extremely loyal Lord Governor of Angland. For all that Bayaz is right about appearance being more important than reality sometimes the best way to give the appearance of something is to actually be that thing. And for all Jezals faults cowardice lust ambition classism and selfloathing narcissism he is on a pretty fundamental level the Peoples King. Also an early proponent of the income tax so props to him.,Fantasy,csn6b1u,7,t5_2qknd

4431537,0,t1_csp7dq6,Amazon.com reviews are the focus because that is the determining factor if a book is accepted at ad sites the big ones and the small ones. So for indie authors who rely on ads to help boost their readership it can make a difference for them where reviews are posted.,Fantasy,cspa8nt,10,t5_2qknd
4431846,0,t3_3bsuig,Heres the one problem I see with this change. If I come across a high rating I know that I look at the reviewers rating history to see if there are signs that heshe inflates ratings. I assume others do this as well they should if they dont. So if you give only high ratings you will appear to be an inflater and then that decreases the chances of your review being considered helpful by other readers. Hence to best help authors you like it seems to me that you probably also need to post lowrated reviews of books that you dont like. Thats likely to hurt some authors especially good ones who just dont appeal to your tastes. On a personal level what exacerbates this is that after having posted a few bad reviews myself I find it makes me feel bad afterwards. I dont like hurting people who are trying to make a living. Ive even managed to piss off a couple of authors and in one case I deleted a bad review because I felt bad for the author after getting to know himher. It can also lead to a flood of friends of the author answering the question Was this review helpful to you? with a No which under this new system diminishes the efficacy of future reviews that you post. All in all I think that henceforth I may not post a review of a book I dont like right now this seems the least bad of the bad options. The good news is that Ive fallen very far behind on reviews of books Ive finished so some of my good reviews will be more useful to authors I like than they might have been if I had posted them on a more timely basis.      ,Fantasy,cspbmy0,1,t5_2qknd

4593454,0,t1_ct9jv31,Hmmm I dont quite agree and here are my  thoughts on thatFirstly I am not really saying you are a true fan If you read those books. I am more critical of the impression of telling people to skip the books have. For example when I read book seven I was expecting the most dull book ever and it actually wasnt that bad. If I skipped it I would never would have experienced that novel and how it relates after the events of book six. Lastly Im dont believe Im mentioning the true fan idea. I want the reader to make their own decision. It is fine to say the books arent like the previous three you read up to that point. For example in your star wars reference I would tell the individual who has only seen the original trilogy. If you really enjoyed the original trilogy then you may not enjoy prequels as much. With knowing that Ill leave the decision for you to view them up to you. I find that response better than Dont watch the prequels everyone thinks they are terrible! It promotes giving the other a bit of information and asks them to make their own decision.So in summary Im not saying to be a true wheel of time fan you have to read beginning to end. I am just critical on the idea to tell others to just skip the books. ,Fantasy,ct9lj4h,3,t5_2qknd

4631490,0,t1_ctcuxpb,pulling stuff mostly out of my butt here aka no I dont have immediate sources to back me up p but from what I know the answer would either be NO or via exposure to WorkingClass white dialects.    Modern English would have already been well established when black dialects were developing so direct influence would be impossible but from growing up in Georgia I can tell you that the lower class white dialects have similar features and I would guess that is where Black English probably picked a good portion of its grammar up from. British English dialects like Scottish English Cornish English amp Cockney all have little vestigial bits amp pieces dating all the way back to the Gaelic roots so if there would be any influence that would probably be it.      Bear in mind though that Black English arose from PidginCreole speakers as well so the features could come from outside of English entirely.     I would strongly object to any of this being described as corruption or regression though its perfectly valid within the rules of the dialect. ,Fantasy,ctedb5d,2,t5_2qknd

4647788,0,t1_ctf73or,Its definitely not a character assassination burning Shireen is right in line with his character in my opinion. First off hes done this before. He killed Renly why not Shireen? Think about it from his perspective. Hes an absolute religious fanatic at this point and Mels magic is the one thing he can rely on. Killing Renly and stealing Gendrys blood worked out WONDERFULLY for him. However when he pushed her aside and tried to do things his own way like Blackwater and Marching on Winterfell he fails MISERABLY. Based on this knowledge the sacrifice of his daughter would not only be the best option it was a sure thing. Second he has to do something fast. It needed to be done to save his army save the kingdom and restore what he believes is proper order  ie. his ass on the throne. Hes got to get out of this mess so he can continue into the next mess. You say he doesnt compromise values and youre right and hes upholding them those by prioritizing duty over family not the greatest choice admittedly but then again hes already long since burned that bridge Hes desperate and hyper focused on winning and that leads to decisions like burning his daughter alive. Scary stuff. Lastly he displayed the proper mix of remorse stoicism and atonement you would expect out of him. Thanks to absolutely brilliant acting from Stephen Dillane you can certainly tell he didnt want to do this. He watched it happen with gritted teeth but his eyes plead despair. His reaction to the terrible aftermath was dispassionate and he kept right on trucking despite loosing half an army his priestess and his wife. Then he calmly accepts his fate at Briennes hand upholding his eye for an eye style of justice for the hell he wrought. Again Stephen Dillane was absolutely fantastic this season. Call it what you want  appalling shocking brutal unsettling bad parenting bad barbqueuing  but its not character assassination.Sorry for the rant...I just like playing devils advocate on this point. ,Fantasy,ctgf17c,1,t5_2qknd

4671780,0,t1_ctj9zz9,No worries I read it in December and even I forget much of it.  I hear what youre saying about it being difficult to put something so complex on paper.  Likewise Sanderson needed to make sazed an atheist in a world where god was obviously real which couldnt be easy.  I imagine my frustration with sazed is similar to the frustration many moderate theists have with me.  Interesting to get that perspective.    As for your answers to my questions thanks again.  I like how you approach the topic.  Ive heard similar things said about inspiration vs. dictation and I have never understood what it means.  I understand that the inspiration came from god and he didnt actually write it but why would such inspiration be subject to people specifically writing books of the bible during a certain time period?  I ask that question to set up the next one.  I think its super interesting what you said about later additions from copyists pushing their own ideas but why would that persons addition not be inspired whereas the original authors are inspired?  Certainly god would know the important people to inspire in order for his message to get out as best as possible.  My partial answer to that questions might be that it is more likely that a person willing to change things would have selfish intent.  but again I dont understand divine inspiration or the effect its meant to have on people.   Or maybe you have other ways of judging inspiration and are one who might attribute great works of philosophy to divine inspiration.  If you dont have a way to judge inspiration vs. human errorfree will whos to say that god didnt mean to inspire the terrible things and human error brought about the nice things.  relying on the belief in divine inspiration to reveal truth seems very inefficient at actually finding truth for a non literalist.  It seems like maybe you are judging things based on how much logical sense they make to you and I dont see why logical ideas are reliant on god to inspire them.  But again for a second time maybe I dont understand the concept of divine inspiration in the first place lol.          I wrote a lot more questions out but its probably counterproductive to put too many things on one plate.  I just have a billion questions to ask and love getting answers from anyone whos immediate response isnt you just like to sin.  Ive probably heard that answer a dozen times just in my own conversations.  feel free to pm me at your convenience if you feel like tackling any more of what I said.  or not if you dont promise i wont be offended.  I have no interest in converting you btw but I like understanding how other people can believe things so different from myself.     As for mormonism I think it produces a lot of amazing people  and has some great messages.  But totally agree it is on about as shaky ground as they come.  Scientology level shaky.  While I agree that I dont like questioning sincerity truth doesnt care about sincerity and the questions are necessary. oh god that sounded pretentious hope you know what I mean        Ok I think I understand why you chose Christianity now. I just wonder how much of your acceptance of tradition involves believing jesus is the messiah and how much is mostly on christian ethical teachings and a notion of god.  The bible makes a lot of claims and I love that you arent a literalist but that makes it difficult to pinpoint where a person stands.                          ,Fantasy,ctjfgqm,2,t5_2qknd

4737028,0,t1_ctrm5gz,The Racism accusation is a bit of a red herring. We live in a racist society. It is not the same to single out individual actions and ideas as Racist as it is to point at a person and say Racist.Heres my example. My wife is half AfroCaribbean and halfAfrican American. There was a term that she used casually around the house that I did not know was racist. I was in the car driving a famous author of color to a signing and used what I believed to be an innocuous thing. It wasnt. It was actually racist. He called me out on it and he was right to do it and I was wrong despite my good intentions. We live in a racist society and were all going to experience and enact ideas that are racist as a byproduct of our racist society. Its a fog that permeates the air we breathe a pollution in our cultural headspace. The way to clean it up is to call it out address it etc. It isnt about calling anyone a racist. It is about pointing to actions and ideas as racist and about creators learning from the mistakes they make. I was guilty of a racist action in that car unaware. I am not trying to be a racist and I am in love with an African woman who is amazing and the light of my life. That doesnt mean I am incapable of reinforcing racist ideas. It does mean that I need to try to do better to avoid them in life and in writing because my own community and family will not abide a whole lot of racist actions.This translates to art as well. Reinforcing racist ideation does not get a pass. It doesnt mean the creator is evil or a racist most of the time. It does mean that we as creators and consumers need to strive to do better listen more and imagine a future and a past that is a better example of what wed like our kids to believe is real.Peace and happy reading.,Fantasy,ctrn996,7,t5_2qknd

People who are sex ambiguous  well who knows how they would relate to saidinsaidar? We dont encounter any in the story so we dont know.As far as transexuals go our best example to study is Halima. It seems that the connection to saidinsaidar is found in the soul and that the soul of Halima is male  even when reborn in a female body she channels saidin.And you know what?

4846845,0,t3_3h9dcs,My debut novel Veiled Empire is out now in both ebook and paperback from Harper Voyager Impulse. And good newsIm  done with the sequel Shadow Of The Void which should be out sometime next year.The Empire is Shrouded not only by the barrier that covers the land but by the lies and oppression of the mierothi regime. Magic is the privilege of the elite and the people of this shadowed country have forgotten what it means to hope under their rule.But there are some who would resist with plans put into motion millennia before. For returned to the Empire is a valynkar servant of the god of light and with him come the strength and cunning that could tip the scales to end the Emperors reign. He has gathered a group of heroes ready to ignite the flame of rebellion and fight against the dark power that has ruled for nearly two thousand years. A power that has champions of its own.Nathan Garrisons VEILED EMPIRE throws a mythical land into chaos with races long thought forgotten and magics only just discovered. Steel and sorcery clash as brave souls vie for freedom and control in this astonishing debut novel.Book LinkHeres what Library Journal has to say about itplease forgive their typosLibrary Journal The Empire is locked inside a magical veil that prevents anyone from leaving or entering a barrier that has not been pierced in over  years. Yet somehow an immortal from the defeated caste has not only broken in but is leading an uprising set to topple the entire government and end the rule of the Mierothi. Multiple narrative points of view from Harridan a magically enhanced solider to Voren the emperors pet captive tell the complex story lending depth and nuance to traditional epic fantasy tropes. VERDICT The involvement of semiimmortal beings makes for an easy comparison to N.K. Jemisins The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms and its justified. Written on an grand scale and set in an ancient world of humans immortals and other magical beings this debut is an engaging and quickmoving story of love revenge and justice. Resembling the work of Joe Abercrombie and Michael Sullivan it will be popular with a wide range of fantasy fans.JMId love to connect with my fellow rfantasy dwellers.

Its not quite in the same vein as LotR or WoT up there so it might grab you more readily classics though they are I find the language in the Secret Texts more dynamic and therefore engaging.

Part of what makes authors like Tolkien and Martin great is that they have these huge complex worlds and these huge complex casts of thousands and yet manage to present them in such a way as to aid the reader in keeping track of them. They give the reader reasons to care about them. Erikson I always felt just tossed it all out in a pile and said Ehh theyll figure it out.Another way to look at it hes not telling a story hes relating a bunch of things that happened. There is a distinct difference. If he had presented Malazan as a whole bunch of short stories set in the same universe I think it would be brilliant. But thats not what hes doing. He presents it as one giant story but by not trying the pieces together until a couple of books in it just doesnt work.All my opinion. Your mileage may vary.,Fantasy,cv7x8lh,16,t5_2qknd

I work and study from home and I was curious if you had any tips to placate a needy kitty and get your work done. I adopted my cat as an adult this spring and he seemed pleased to finally have full time humans. Maybe a tiny bit too pleased. I adore him and I love that he loves us but it would be nice to be able to keep him suitably entertained and quiet sometimes.Second coming from a conservative background your work let me give myself permission to consider progressive points of view as a teenager. Gay rights women in the military premarital sex...it was so crucial to read about these topics from someone I admired. It planted seeds that helped me become a better person and as a queer woman a much happier one.

The following passage never sat well with me precisely because of its implicationgtSometimes a man enjoys a symphony. Elsetimes he finds a jig more to his taste. The same holds true for lovemaking.  Each woman is like an instrument waiting to be learned loved and finely played to have at last her own true music made. Some might take offense at this way of seeing things not understanding how a trouper views his music.  But those people do not understand love or music or me. p. The idea of women waiting to be enjoyed like a symphony or a jig is a sexist remark. Perhaps this can be excused as only reflecting the thoughts of Kvothe not Rothfuss but he makes an absolute statement at the end that makes me think otherwise those people do not understand love or music or me. From your previous postgtI also feel like you are demonizing him for writing Denna as male dependant even when he spends a chapter goign over how sad it is that that is the only opportunity for a women in that culture much like how it was back in the middle ages.I dont think this is accurate Fela Devi and several other girls at the university are doing just fine without being dependent on men.

I could instantly list ten other series that are better IMO obviously. Name of the Wind was a good start and then Wise Mans brings us a sophmore slump relatively speaking. Most of the story that I can recall on the top of my head is NOTW and not WMF...the reason is obvious.In terms of characters Id give Rothfuss an .. Bast and Kvothe are the cream. Denna? Annoying. Chronicler? Meh. Master Elodin? Pretty cool. Simon and the rest of the gang? Meh. Chandarian have been sufficiently built up so thats a good thing. Everyone else is forgettable.Plot .. Intriguing yes but nothing that blows me out of the water. Orphan looking for his parents killer? Done. Magical school? Done. The rest is fluff and fillers. This could be improved significantly if the pace was snappier.Magic System . Literally the best thing about this series. Its vague enough to be intruguing and have a shroud of mystery behind it ala ASOIAF but mechanical and technical enough for it to look like a science a la Brandon Sanderson hard magic systems So incredibly well done. Zero issues here.Pacing . Because its way too long to focus on one character. IMO Such long books only work for multiple POVs.Id give the series a . Hes a great writer but he has no idea what brevity is. Wise Mans Fear was too longwinded and had a significant portion that was just Kvothe in a magical forest. Wise Mans Fear Spoilers sexual adventures with Felurian I cringed through the whole portion which was obviously a cheap tool to hide all the infodumping to fill in worldbuilding data.

5439535,0,t1_cw6c6rb,Im aware of hard scifiwhich Star Trek generally isnt even considered. But again its not about the science itself either... Well its hard to pin down and Star Wars has been a point of contest among scifi fans and authors for a long time. I doubt well come to an agreement on the matter. Personally as a long time Star Wars fan who is disappointed Disney is jettisoning the EU material I consider it squarely in the fantasy side of speculative fiction.gtDoes that mean that TOS fantasy only and that the rest are sci fi?I hardly even consider TOS real Star Trek lol. Its...lore and inuniverse history saddled with a bunch of baggage from the time. Though I do like the characters and The Wrath of Khan is pretty good as far as Star Trek movies go. I consider the later series to be what comprises the core of what is Star Trek...and even Gene Roddenberry considered TNG to be what he wanted Star Trek to be but was limited by the technology and social atmosphere of the time.Edit And some people reading this thread really need to read the reddiquette thats so conveniently linked under the comment box.

5471607,0,t3_3pocqg,The Riven Kingdom and A Natural History of Dragons.Both have insufferable protagonists whom the author allows to run riot with the stupidity ball in the knowledge that they will be ok in the end because they will magick away any bad stuff rather than have the character deal properly with failure or making the wrong choice. If a character does something dumb or disloyal or reckless they should suffer the full consequences.To be honest I got the impression that if the characters werent female the writers would have given them both barrels the men in the books were pretty disposable. The two women get away with a lot more idiocy because the writers dont want to hurt them whether out of chivalry or a fear of being seen as misogynistic it adds up to the same thing and it still feels a bit patronising.Also Sebastian de Castells Traitors Blade.

5509135,0,t1_cwfs2x5,Faith of the Fallen is probably my favourite other than the first book. Its a nice selfcontained story and it didnt rely on Goodkind just tacking on more and more complexity to the plot instead of resolving anything. Every other book is here is a characterspecial magic that has never been hinted at before but is profoundly important and yet probably wont matter much in the next book.I dont mind the Randian philosophy stuff indeed I quite like it. I wish it was a bit more subtle in places but overall its in keeping with the heroic nature of the characters  its very clear that Richard and Khalan are the good guys and thats completely fine not every book needs to have an antihero as the protagonist. SoT is true heroic fantasy in much the same was as Atlas Shrugged is heroic fantasy  some characters and situations are deliberately simplified to really drive the point home and make it more memorable.

5559121,0,t3_3r8ur8,Im the worst at picking a definitive favorite. Since Ive read so many great books this year Ill narrow it down to a Top  and Ill still be cheating even more.. The Incorruptibles by John Hornor Jacobs  I cant properly express how much I loved this book. Ive never enjoyed a main character pairing so much the quiet and unsettling gunslinger and the centuries old dwarf. Shoestring and Fisk rival Hadrian and Royce for me. Theyre that good together. Western meets fantasy meets horror meets Victorian Era meets demon powered steamboats meets elf savages. Criminally underrated.  Red RisingGolden Son by Pierce Brown  Ill be putting a few other series down as just one book but this was the best of all. Barring a third and final installment that utterly disappoints this might go down as an all timer. Ugh that cliffhanger.  The Magicians Trilogy by Lev Grossman  These books are the definition of either love em or hate em. Obviously Im on the love side of this argument. Quentin Coldwater whiny as he may be  resonated with me deeply. Julias story in the second book might be the highlight of the series. Each book ended so strongly and in totally different ways. I defend this series like I do with The Thomas Covenant books. Grace of Kings by Ken Liu  Felt like there were three books in one. And I mean that in the best possible way. The ups and downs I experienced from the characters choices and where they took them. A different writing style very detached. It was like an interesting history book for someone who isnt that big a historian. No disrespect to history books all disrespect to Jimmy Kimmel. Kind of wish it was a standalone but Ill eagerly read more from the world. The City Stained Red by Sam Sykes  Congrats to Sam for beating out Joe Abercrombies Shattered Sea trilogy! As much as I love Abercrombie and that trilogy CSR was just So.Much.Fun. And its nice to realize the author definitely had as much fun writing this as I am reading it. I felt like I was reading my Baldurs Gate or Icewind Dale game come to life. Really enjoyed how adventurers were treated in the world. And talk about picking a favorite! How can anyone choose between all these characters. It was like a TV show that sported a great ensamble cast. Gun to my head I go with Kataria. But I felt for Lenk all throughout the book. Then of course theres Gariath. Some of his fight scenes were all time great. Also Sykes wrote maybe the best sex scene Ive ever read up there with the one in Naomi Noviks Uprooted another great book. My only regret is not saying hi to Sam during NYCC. I chickened out after the Fantasy Fantasy draft.Theres still plenty of time for books to be added but these were the big standouts. ,Fantasy,cwm5rl8,9,t5_2qknd

5649964,1,t3_3shjq9, Disagree. Personally I thought Wayne was more fleshed out than before in this book we got a better look into what made him tick during the scene where he was giving money to two different girls. Partially Agree. There were some parts with the kandra that I remember disliking for this reason but for most characters I thought it was fine. Disagree. Given that you are a Sanderson fan Im surprised you were surprised by the lack of sex given that he writes almost exclusively PG in terms of romance and explicit scenes. Its even one of the draws of his writing for some of his audience.  Partially Agree. Some twists were predictable but I didnt expect the character reveal at the end for sure. That sticks out but others did surprise me as well. Partially Agree. A reasonable point about the modern viewpoint in an older society but one that can be accepted given that this society is more egalitarian than its Victorian English parallel since one of its primary religious figures is a female war hero Vin Mistborn . Disagree. Similar to third point Sandersons writing tends to be more family friendly. Overall the themes however dont seem to be YA though few YA books feature enemies Spoilers that gain power by stabbing themselves and eating dead bodies or protagonists that kill without hesitation. A YA protagonist would knock out thugs put them to sleep with magic or conveniently distract them with a DeusEx. Waxillium just shoots them. Spoilers When a hostage is taken they arent useless they shoot their assailantOverall I think some of your points are valid but I enjoyed the book despite them.

5836534,0,t1_cxkm3zt,Malazan has races that arent just carbon copies of dwarves gnomes etc. And the ones that are similar have their specific tropes turned on their heads. For instance there is a race called the KChain Chemalle that are literally gigantic velociraptors that are tech based and have floating mountain sky keeps and have grafted swords in place of their hands. There is also a race that is very orclike but they are the most dry witty and intelligent beings you will ever meet.  And dont get me started on a certain character that subverts every barbarian trope known to man. Fave review of the Malazan Book of the Fallen series by Steven Eriksen covers why its so good. No spoilers. Malazan Series Spoiler Free ReviewAnd it is the best series I have ever read.  The first book Gardens of the Moon is the hardest. It does get easier the more used you get to Eriksens style. It can be confusing at first I wont lie It has a cast of hundreds a ton of plot thrown at you you feel like you got dropped into a foreign country with no guidebook and you dont speak the language. This is normal! Malazan does not spoonfeed you very much you have to piece togther characters and plotlines and how the world works. Eriksens books tend to start off slow characters plot history a lot of introspective philosophy theres a LOT in these books. Keep reading and all will become clear over time. But nearly every book ends with the last  pages with you sweaty breathless weepy exhilerated and its  in the morning and you have to work at  but you dont care because you just had an epic experience and will be thinking about it all day and you cant wait to read the next one.The dramatis personae and the glossary in the back of the book are your best friends. This tale isnt always about individual characters its about how the various characterplot threads interact and weave in and out of affecting each other. Every place you visit has an ancient feel to it every race you interact with has a millenia of history every character has a lifetime of stories to tell. The author is an archeologist and an anthropologist so the world building is second to none. His first book Gardens of the Moon was written nine years before the second and it shows a bit there are problems with pacing and such but by Book  and  all that goes away. Id read at least the first two. And if you dont like it THAT IS OKAY. No book is for everybody! Wont judge. Any confusion you feel is normal and does not mean you dont get it. Any questions or wtf is going on!? comments just ask here or rmalazan.

Ive tried to stay true to the essence of the original meaning of the name while also working in the style of maps for contemporary Fantasy works. Also note that even between experts there is still debate and speculation about the toponymic origins of some of the cities and provinces depicted here as these places were often inhabited long before the first preserved written source mentioning them and were named in dialects of old languages no longer understood today by anyone but scholars.

5905667,0,t3_3vq9d9,Hi guys guess its safe to talk about my fantasy series here...My first book He Walks with Dragons  began with the hypothesis that since nearly every civilization ever to populate the earth has had legends of dragons they must have existed.  The book was written from the perspective of one of the dragonriders Draig in his own words what it was like to be a part of the world of dragons seen through his own eyes.  It was supposed to be a stand alone until people started asking me When is the next one coming out? to which I answered What next one?.  So in  I came out with the second book The Staff and the Orb which was a continuation of the first book.  And this year I came out with book  The Crown and the Orb which follows Belinda the first female dragonrider and great granddaughter of Draig.  I am currently working on Book  The dragon on the Hill.  For those who might be interested I have a YouTube video of Samwise Gamgee reading from Book     If anyone has questions about my series feel free to ask....but I try very hard to avoid giving away too much of the story...  ,Fantasy,cxtrlrg,2,t5_2qknd

Publishers liked the label and thought it would sell. They jumped on it and informed us thats what were writing. This is I suspect why no two grimdark novels are all that similar. Polanskys books are nothing like Wexlers are nothing like Lawrences.Why would grimdark need to be any more aware of itself than any other fantasy genre and how is it any more absurd than any other fantasy genre? Fantasy is absurd. Thats kinda the point.Maybe Im missing the definition of grimdark. If its stuff like Warhammer k then none of these novels is grimdark.

Lev Grossman and JK Rowling for instance both suffuse their narratives with wry humor from an invisible narrator.

6047467,0,t1_cybu1b7,No youre completely right.  Im overly sensitive toward this.And there is most certainly a distinction between fiction that advances the genre in some wayeven just by being a fantastic and purposeful example of how to use its specific tropesand fiction that tries to plug and play a bunch of elements together without understanding how to use them.  There are certain editors in the field fewer these days than in the past who would insist that a story drop excellent but nonstandard elements in order to be more fantasy.  Read More like the tropes which they assume is what makes fantasy work.  These editors didnt from my personal perspective get fantasy at all.  They didnt even like it.  But they knew it sold and wanted to find the next Robert Jordan while at the same time being dismissive of the entire genre.  Theres been a constant problem in fantasy of people mistaking the tropesand not the purpose behind the tropesfor what makes fantasy work.  That doesnt mean the tropes cant be used but it does mean that just using them without reason can hurt the story rather than help it.An excellent example of this is the virgin birth which is an element of the Campbellian monomyth.  It gives a deific identity to the main character a noble destiny.  It works in many stories.  But adding it to Star Wars just because it is mentioned in Hero with a Thousand faces did not work in the prequel trilogy.  This is checking a box rather than looking at why the trope actually works.Your question is not without merit and I really dont mean to attack you.  Its just that the way we often talk about these things seems directly influenced by the pejorative language of those outside the genre.  It seems to me what you were asking was something more akin to What are some excellent examples of fantasy in which genre tropes enhance rather than distract from the storyexamples of beautiful writing within the fantasy genre.  And I think the majority of us got that.  For me I believe Terry Pratchett is the ideal example of someone who understands tropes and uses them to build something that is wholly unexpected.  If you havent read him OP know that starting with the first book is generally discouragedas Pratchett gets much better after his first couple of novels.  But another great example from recent years is N.K. Jemison who is solidly fantasybut approaching it with a mix of classical fantasy a modernist training in literary theory and nonEuropean mythologies and perspectives.  Her books are excellent.  I suggest The Hundred Thousand Kingdoms.  It manages to be progressive without forgetting to be fun and exciting at the same time. Uprooted by Naomi Novik from last summer takes classical fairy tale tropes from western Europe but approaching them from a fresh perspective.  The book is incredible.  And as always I suggest Guy Gavriel Kay as a true master of the genre.  Sorry to pick on you.  ,Fantasy,cycbtkx,20,t5_2qknd

They just need to pick one thing to focus on.I kind of hated Dresden Files. Yes I know skip ahead. I bought Book  but Im still not expecting much.Scifi but Kate Elliotts Passage of Stars was weird. I dont think I understood what was going on for the entire book and Im  sure thats by design. Which isnt great. Apparently its really different from her other series so Im planning on sticking with her for a bit more.Lies of Locke Lamora Two Serpents Rise and A Natural History of Dragons were fine functional books that I think I just expected way more from. I cant say I had a miserable time by any stretch but I cant say I had a wonderful time with any of them either.Words of Radiance was great but not as mindblowingly amazing as I felt like everyone considers it. The stakes are incredibly high and Im stoked for that but as a book its not my favorite.I was also expecting The Colour of Magic to just kind of be serivceable but I was laughing out loud. Not sure why people always recommend skipping this one.Wheel of Time has been pretty much everything Ive ever wanted from a super epic fantasy series. It comfortably sits right on that line between familiar and keeping me on the edge of my seat while also giving my a basically unprecedented scale.,Fantasy,cyg8dft,2,t5_2qknd

6099062,0,t1_cyivsnd,Luke had pilot experience and he clearly wasnt the best pilot there at the time.  The rebel alliance needed everyone they could field.  Luke was sent up with little to no training because of this.  His R unit handled a lot of the flight responsibilities and his only force use in the movies came from an ability to make a good shot.  The imperials were ordered to let them escape the Death Star so they could follow them back to the rebel base.The problem isnt that Luke was stronger then Rey the problem is that Rey is much stronger then Luke with a lot less training and less justification.  At this point Luke has used the force to deflect some training droid fire while Kenobi guided him and made and improbable shot.  Rey has FA spoilerss Learned the jedi mind trick with no training learned out to use a light saber with no training beat a trained force user with no training and beat that same force user in a lightsaber duel with no training.  In Empire Luke struggles to pull a light saber without fighting a trained Force user.  Rey with no training takes a Lightsaber without to much trouble while resisting a trained force user.  Not only that she has not faults.  Luke was head strong and impulsive leading to Vader setting the trap on cloud city and Luke walking right into it costing him his hand.  Rey is sad?

If the MC knows air magic but then suddenly picks up water magic they have to play around with what that means as far as spellcasting.  I wont like the character automatically if theyre complacent with that little bit of water magic I like thirsty for knowledge characters.  Even worse is when that magic is used as a deus ex machina a save for a situation then shuffled back into a box because the author doesnt have the chops to add it correctly to the book.

So if injury A takes a year to heal and he gets injury B C and D within that year they add up until injury A heals. If he doesnt heal faster than he takes on injuries eventually hell be up to injury W while on having healed D and thats a lot of injuries piled on top of each other. ,Fantasy,cyy2ir4,1,t5_2qknd

This isnt strictly a combat thing but I sometimes see fantasy characters wearing their weapons and armor at all times. While this might be appropriate in certain situations its a huge pain.

6268325,0,t1_cz1w9pk,In my experience its pretty normal to not really like Tolkien if you didnt get to him early. Its the case with a large number of great works that they are more famous for their place in history than the actual quality of the writing by contemporary standards.To expand on that point if some other writer had sparked a fantasy revolution with really careful world building and a cast of new races and THEN Tolkien had come along I do not believe for a moment he would have the following he does today. The mans writing is very very dry and if the languages poems and worldbuilding arent doing it for you I doubt the rest will either  because all these years later thats all that stands out. The craft has improved and for the other bits and bobs you can find authors who have done better with the other stuff by standing on his and other authors shoulders.So while Id recommend everyone who loves fantasy read Tolkien for the historical context I would also say its alright if they dont like it compared to what else theyre reading.,Fantasy,cz2507s,3,t5_2qknd

I didnt like the first book which came highly recommended and gave it away. Then after reading more glowing reviews I thought that surly from all the hints about the story this really should be a series I would enjoy. Well bought book number two and laboured... yes laboured my way through the first chapters... and this is where my association with Outlander might have finished had I followed your route... I didnt but carried on determined to at least finish the book. Then somewhere around twothirds in I got it. I then had to buy the first book again and all the others and read the whole series back to back twice over the series of a few months. Obviously there is no guarantee but it might be worth just starting GotM all over again...Getting on to the OPs comments... All the it is bad it is difficult stuff said about GotM... as SageOfTheWise already said most of it is just everyone perpetuating other peoples comments. Tons of people love the book and most people do not find it difficult to read.

6279069,0,t1_cz2oeuy,Thanks. One of the things I love about this sub is that each person has their opinion and more often than not voices their opinion in constructive and thoughtful ways. I really appreciate your line of thinking. I know never to say never but at this point Malazan is just too big a commitment to risk my time on. I actually didnt go into reading it with preconceived notions as to the writing quality story complexity etc. But pretty soon I felt that I was missing something.Im not the fastest reader but Id like to think that my reading comprehension is reasonable but pretty soon I was dependent on the Tor.com reread to understand what was going on and even then sometimes felt that I was in the dark. And often times I felt like some important things could have been less cryptic better explained and more obvious. Ill admit I was outright angry by the time I got the second book though I try not to mistake my thoughts on it as anything other than subjective.I do find you persuasive so  I just might give it another shot sooner than I would have thought.Thank again.,Fantasy,cz3cyic,3,t5_2qknd

6297112,0,t1_cz530kq,Maybe. It would explain what Ive seen happening in UK stores. Doesnt negate the need for more prominence for female authors of more stereotypical epic fantasy but it does show what women may gravitate towards writing naturally. Certainly theres a lot of discussion we may be missing because were not looking in the right places.I dont want to say this is socialised behaviour either. While its tempting I think sometimes  and maybe unintentionally  that tends to still sideline femininity. Women would write what men write if it wasnt for... seems to me to still exalt masculine values and themes. The archetypal strong female character always aspires to do what men do rather than achieve recognition of what women do. It may need an opposite situation  more men should write feminine themes?  to make it more palatable an explanation. It still privileges male subgenres like epic fantasy or hard scifi above romance or urban fantasy I really feel that the target should be for people to really explore femininity in sharper relief rather than just exalt the masculine. ,Fantasy,cz5es5a,1,t5_2qknd

6309862,0,t1_cz6uf8n,Yep definitely subjective. I said I personally think those books are good. I know plenty on here who hate KKC and think Sanderson is much better. However this post had nothing to do with who is better but just some interesting I thought metrics on how fast each one writes. I make no claims that one authors method is more correct than the other so Ime really not sure what the issue is. And its no problem at all you arent the only one who had some problems with this post. We arent comparing apples to oranges but rather similarly measured ouputs over time. But I can tell you exactly what I got from the data that was not just a generality . An extrapolation telling how often I should expect a given author to get books published in the future independent of their quality writing process or how many books they throw away..

When she comes to the tower he constantly insults and belittles her and threatens her to the point that in the early part of the book she considers suicide. Emotional abuse is still abuse and the idea that it can be excused because hes poorly socialized or trying to protect her is...distressing at the least. Doesnt matter what excuses he has. How he treats her is wrong and should not be considered romantic. Ive talked about Uprooted with friends who feel that he showed enough of a change by the end to make a decent romantic partner. I...wasnt convinced though I understand that others are. I preferred how Kate Elliott handled the same character type in her Cold Magic series. The mage in that one starts off just as much of a jerk as the Dragon but the girl doesnt merely laugh at or excuse his behavior she flat out makes it clear its not acceptable and hes being an asshole and she doesnt see him in a romantic light until he fully demonstrates that hes changed.,Fantasy,cz8kh3a,8,t5_2qknd

My feeling is that in the digital age consumers are feeling more entitled to new content due to the ease of illegal delivery. Historically in many areas there is a model where a product is priced high on arrivalcinema cq hardcover lowers down to a mainstream price for some timedvd cq softcover and then goes on to budget versionsTV cq rereleases. The packaging medium changes over time to reflect the prices but the difference of a hardcover vs paperback is less about the production costs than you imagine.

6376513,0,t3_430294,Most commonly people just get tired.  Sometimes they get tired at the same rate as if theyd done their magical feat manually.  In some settings they have to eat more to make up for the magical energy used.  In others they just need to rest.  In the Lightbringer series a magicusers eye color changes to the color of light that they can draft with the settings magic.  When their eyes fill up with that color they have to stop or risk Bad Things Happening.  this is based on limited memory I read the first one and am waiting for the last to be out before I do the whole series.  In the Dresden Files series using magic causes physical weariness.  Using black magic is addictive and often escalates. Even if the black magic was done with good intentions it is a slippery slope.  I think I read somewhere that in one of the tabletop RPG systems psions people with mental powers not necessarily magical powers tend to shave their heads because if they overexert their hair catches on fire.  In Star Wars people who use the Dark Side of the Force tend to show physical effects their eyes glow their skin gets paler grayer or violettinged while their eye sockets darken.  Their skin loses elasticity in extreme cases.  Both Light and Dark side users can sometimes enjoy greatly extended lifespans just by being in tune with the Force.  They can also live beyond deathDark side users sometimes use this to possess new hosts though Light side usually merge with the Force existing as Force Ghosts to guide those they leave behind.  ,Fantasy,czefuj3,2,t5_2qknd

6384128,0,t1_czew6k0,The issue with this idea is that it suggests that theres some huge pervasive force of just for fun YA fiction that is somehow devoid of substance simply because they arent the classics.  Thats just not true you dont typically write hundreds of pages without a point.Ive recently gotten my younger sister fourteen to start reading the Iron Druid Chronicles a YA fantasy series about gods and the such.  Theyre funny so shes having a blast!  Secretly though shes also learning about our modern worlds relationship with bygone religions and later on in the series shes going learn social lessons like the importance of boundaries.  Shes actually taking forever to finish the first book simply because she wont stop looking up every god she reads about ... its a great thing to see.Would I be thrilled to see her reading Locke or Huxley?  Of course.  But shes fourteen and lives in a world that seems pretty set on discouraging her reading habits ... and maybe that has something to do with our fixation on the classics books filled with language and concepts that are above her minuscule world experience.  Maybe it has something to do with well read people telling her that the books she enjoys are junk food when its been proven that reading a book any book stimulates and benefits the brain in a way that is completely unique.

6403318,0,t1_czh309r,Theres a way to do it to get the best of both worlds. Walk into a library or bookshop and youll see the diversity of whats on offer in the reading world all mostly filtered through traditional publishers thats why I dont buy this selling out stuff when it comes to publishing books.This isnt saying write to a trend with substance because thats hard and almost impossible but there are some broader trends within fantasy literature that are hard to ignore  such as the shift to almost exclusive reliance on third person limited or first person from third omniscient and the need for character drama up front and limited amounts of infodumping before your reader is ready for it and engaged with the characters andor plot. Yes there are limits on selfexpression because of reader accessibility youre unlikely to get a story written in the style of Tolkiens published because that style has passed over. Unless youre really good at it of course.However in terms of substance the grimdark scene is alive at the moment and gets fed quite well but there is a wide diversity of styles selling in epic fantasy and in general you go into any bookshop and see the huge array of different books Brandon Sanderson isnt grimdark by any means. Ellen Kushner and Guy Gavriel Kay piloted the idea of secondary world fantasy without magic. China Mieville deals well with psychological twistedness and wrote pure speculative fiction without magic or future tech involved. Robert Jordan sold an epic book series. Mercedes Lackey has a good solid fantasy series going as does Kate Elliott. Brian McClellan is selling nonmediaeval fantasy and earned out Jim Butcher did Romanera fantasy and has now embarked on a steampunk series as well as writing Dresden Ben Aaronovitch has sold a series set in modern Britain rather than America Terry Pratchett was...Terry Pratchett N.K. Jemison did postcolonial fantasy Kameron Hurley is doing the same thing with gender. theres a HUGE range of different styles and substances being published. The only thing these people have in common is that they all got past the gatekeepers  the gates are open wider than you think. Then theres selfpublishing which relies on going direct to readers without necessarily filtering it through an investment house like publishers are but has made a number of careers on here possible. Id still recommend getting critique editing and help with the layout because unfiltered prose tends to be less professionally engaging than work that has been thoroughly examined.If you want to write fantasy Finnegans Wake then go ahead but you may need to be extraspecially good at it to sell well you need to take the time to make it work for your audience otherwise youll fall at the first critique. Doesnt matter if you dont want to make a living at it but it does matter if you want people to read you and enjoy you. Thankfully Robert Jackson Bennett and Iain Banks suggests you dont have to compromise too much but its generally a matter of quality and the ability to hold an audiences attention which matters a lot more than the actual subject or style of your book. Literary fantasy and scifi is hard to do well but doing it well is lot more about getting good critique and editing that respects your voice but tailors it towards your audience rather than writing to a specific template. Have a look at some of the threads on rDestructiveReaders and rfantasywriters and look at some unpublished work through the eyes of a reader. Then you can judge your own work through a different perspective and see how they distinguish between maintaining a unique voice and making sure its interesting and engaging to read.Giving some thought to an audience isnt selling out to capitalism. It doesnt mean compromising the substance of your story but readers want books that are accessible and wellwritten and substance can be fed to them that way.,Fantasy,czhhq9f,1,t5_2qknd

6411913,0,t3_43i1ax,  The Fourth Bear.  Second of Jasper Ffordes Nursury Crime books.  This one mixes up Goldilocks a conspiracy involving cucumbers and explosions and the escaped mass murdering gingerbreadman.  Fun and quirky as expected from Fforde.  The House on Parchment Street by Patricia McKillip.  This is definitely YA and it shows.  A bit of a disappointment as I was hoping for more of what McKillip delivers in her adult works.  Swordspoint by Ellen Kushner.  Id actually already read The Privilege of the Sword out of order but I dont think there was much negative effect theres little in the way of spoilers in either direction in fact spoilers it maybe mislead me in that from what we heard of her in Privilege I was expecting the Duchess to be playing both sides throughout rather than that Ferris just misrepresented she was involved from the start.  Its set in a city where duelling is a common way for nobles to settle their differences often through the proxy of hired swordsmen and is full of manipulators and schemers.  I think Kushner definitely improved as I found it weaker than Privilege.  Some of the plot threads petered out a bit and we didnt really get to know the characters as much as I would have liked I was hoping for more on why Alec was the way he was.  Id also probably have preferred spoilers if it did finish with a big reveal from the Duchess as Ferriss whole plan being unravelled essentially with a coincidencedriven fallout from his incidental plot against Michael seemed a bit weak.  Still decent but I liked the second book better.  The Bible Repairman and Other Stories.  Short story collection by Tim Powers featuring ghosts strange magic secrets and everything else you expect from Powers.  Also as expected excellent.  Mythago Wood by Robert Holdstock.  Technically a reread since I read this when I was  or so.  However I didnt remember much about it bar the premise so figured Id read it again since I have it and the sequel sitting unread on my shelves for years.  Its set post WW where the protagonist ia a soldier returning to his childhood home after the death of his emotionally distant father.  He learns something of his fathers research which involves the nearby ancient wood which seems to enable the generation of mythagos  folk heroes reincarnated from the collective unconscious of a people.  He falls in love with one mythago but finds himself and his brother caught up in myths of their own.,Fantasy,czigxcz,5,t5_2qknd

This may have looked into the book too much I also know very little about Freudian psychology but it reminded me of the id ego and the superego.

6431754,0,t1_czk86zc,My take on this is a ton of fantasy authors write flawed characters but the stories in many ways glorify these flaws. Or the characters continue to succeed in spite of these flaws. Whereas a lot of the time with Hobbs books these flaws lead to a lot of heartache and trauma for the characters. The flaws tend to shape the narrative as opposed to it unfolding in spite of these flaws.Hobb doesnt sugarcoat these flaws and in my opinion it makes her characters all the more real. And just like real people youre not going to like or agree with the characters thinking all the time. Are you sympathetic to those in your life  percent of the time? Of course not. You should be feeling unsympathetic sometimes even if its someone you love. Thats part of being human. People get stuck in ruts so should characters. You should be yelling at Fitz to get his shit together.Theres a ton of authors who do incredible jobs of creating villains who you love hating but Hobb is one of the few making protagonists that at times you hate loving. Sure it makes for a more painful read at times but it makes the reward all the better in scenes like OP mentioned.,Fantasy,czkky9g,18,t5_2qknd

I hear its a bit more restricted now but ten years ago you would walk into this industrial parking lot surrounded by commercial trucks and small gocarts zipping in every direction and head to a nondescript warehouse.  Inside were rows and rows of giant frozen tuna and a man on a little stool with a clipboard making sounds I dont speak Japanese but it sounded kinda like Hobba hobba hobba hobba  Bingen Eye Bingen Eye  hobba hobba hobba hobba....  You could walk right up to the tuna if you wanted.  There were a small huddle of tourists in the corner but the rest of the room was filled with bidders going around with hooked picks testing the tuna.  I have no idea how people bid or when a sale was made except that every so often a tuna fish was dragged away and every ten minutes the man on the stool would pick up his stool and walk ten feet down and set it up in front of a new square of tuna rows.  It was the kind of thing youd never see in the US and if you did it would be behind some ropes and youd have to pay an entry fee for the privilege. ,Fantasy,czmvif5,3,t5_2qknd

6570681,0,t3_45kc6r,My lorebased rationale for wizard robes is that they mark the status of proper wizards as graduates of the Collegiate Arcanum.  They are sanctioned mages within the Magistry licensed to conduct magic for kings queens and captains of industry and their robe designates their status and perhaps even their specialty.  The robes are awarded at graduation and are not just a specific color but tailored for the individual warded and bespelled and what not as befits that particular specialty.  So... not just important for being light breathable cotton of a certain hue.For example mages trained in war and destructive magic wear Black Robes.  Not black robes of course but Black Robes because if you say it just right you can hear the capitalization and it sounds that much cooler.  They would have wards against physical and magical attack along with other tricky bits of enchantment to help them survive on the battlefield.There are other colored robes for other schools of magic within the Magistry but I have yet to delve into that officially.  This leaves the door open for me to go with something basic like Red Robes or maybe challenge the establishment a bit and go with Plaid Robes or Fuschia Robes.

Where women are allowed to be sexual creatures and enjoy their sexuality and not be judged for it.Yes youre right. but there are fantasy books with a female main character and a love relationship subplot that are structurally different because the themes of imagination adventure and sense of wonder come first. Whereas in pnr its the other way around and the fantasy elements are more of a subplot and romance is the main theme. this sets the genre apart from the other kinds of fantasy. Its true that there are fantasy elements and worldbuilding and all that but since there are great differences from the rest of the genre I consider it more of a sister genre like they have the same parents but they are very different.,Fantasy,d04k5sl,-1,t5_2qknd

6660912,0,t3_46ufs7,Ive been reading this thread and I think its important to look at the reaction many of us have to the phrase trigger warning.  It is something that doesnt effect most of us in any way and yet discussion comes to a screeching halt the moment the phrase is used.  Have we experienced some sort of trauma at the hands of those two words?  Or are we just uncomfortable with another community giving name to experience?Whatever the reason is we need to acknowledge that this happens.  If were so triggered by a trigger warning is it not possible that someone with trauma actual or perceived could experience something comparable to what we experience?  Even greater?  And if it is possible does it really hurt us so badly to see two letters and a sentence fragment before a video or an essay that covers an emotional subject if it might spare some individual a painful reliving of something theyve tried to move past?,Fantasy,d08ancr,21,t5_2qknd

Orcs cutting POWs heads off to play OrcBall the Sam and Frodo expys being ruthless and manipulative conmen and lots and lots of humor the expense of high fantasy tropes and cliches. But to be honest we dont really see many fantasy novels devoted entirely to comedy though not that there arent funny bits in otherwise serious Fantasy novels but very few are written with the express purpose of making you laugh. You dont get many Princess Brides bawdy wit or The Last Unicorns simple charm. Most of the humor in Fantasy is dark comedy while I do enjoy that from time to time I did just recommend a dark comedy I would like some fantasy series that isnt trying to make you laugh the way Shakespeare tried to make Titus Andronicus funny. ,Fantasy,d0ihxhd,0,t5_2qknd

Then whoever organises the whole thing goes through those suggestions removes duplicates maybe also the superpopular stuff that a lot of people will already have read books that arent easily available due to no longer being in printhigh prices etc. strips out stuff like character names etc. that might give the title away...In the end theres a list of maybe  to  book descriptions which gets posted and everyone who wants to participate posts the number of book that seems the most interesting to them. Then they get the title and author of the book per PM  there might be an easier way to do this but I think it would be nice to avoid people being able to cheat and look at all the titles before choosing and this is the only solution for that I could come up with. Then they have a month or two to buyborrow and read the book they picked after which theres another thread where everybody can talk about what they read and how they liked it.Its not ideal since people can still read up on the book before actually purchasing and reading it but everything that involves actually sending money and physical books takes a lot of admin and trust from everyone involved.

Getting rid of Susannah makes things a little easier from a filming standpoint.  The whole wheelchairno legsbeing carried around would be a nuisance to film plus getting rid of Susannah takes away the racial thing between her and Roland.

6806594,0,t1_d0l4e91,a  The Shang ordeal is far more humanbased than the Ordeal of Knighthood.  It does consist of a nightlong vigil but also of a week in the mountains equipped with nothing more than the uniform sandals and bare hands either in the time between winter and spring or between fall and winter always with the risk of being caught by winter.  The student is given a destination and must return with a specific token from that destination and will have to contend with masked assailants on the way or returning and without killing them.  b Warriors choose their titles sometimes with a sense of irony but they tend to follow the suggestions of their masters or they might otherwise never choose names like Dragon and Unicorn!  They tend to be pretty modest by the time they pass their ordeals.  For one thing few pass it the first time.  c  Eda was in the City of the Gods for a while teaching their warriors and the children of local residents after she went to meet Alanna.  Then she went to the Yamani imperial court where the prime minister had invited her to teach a group of nobles sons.  Thats where she met Hakuin who invited her to help share his teaching duties and very nice salary at the Tortallan court.   I hope that all readers take away that girls and women can be strong on their own and that they can choose their own way in life not the way that others think they should follow.  I also hope girls and women take an interest in selfdefense from my books so they never feel they have to depend on someone else and so they have the inner strength to turn to the agencies that are there to help.,Fantasy,d0ntmo1,2,t5_2qknd

6855616,0,t1_d0srrx0,But the thing is the fantasy genre has been making shit up about various cultures and their traditions andor using those as the basis for fantastical magicks and cultures for decades.  I cant recall as ufficeZombie put it irish folks hitting the twitterverse when they read Harry Potter and complaining using their buzzwords.  I cant recall eastern europeans complaining about Rowlings portrayal of Durmstrang students.Native Americans have been dealt a shit hand for sure and people in general need to stop minimizing what happened to them and their culture in the real world but this is fantasy and fantasy has been doing this to cultures and myths for a very very long time.It doesnt seem like Rowling is even being disrespectful of their culture  she just changed it to fit with her alternate world.  Which is what every author with alternate Earths does.Rowling is only getting heat for this because shes Rowling and an easy target and will get the Native American plight back into the minds of mainstream media.  Its not a bad thing since their plight needs to stay in our minds but this just feels disingenuous.

6879042,0,t1_d0vvhm7,Thats very interesting about China but I dont think its limited to China. Look at Wattpad look at some of the successful fulltime Indie writers  they dont write books we often come across in bestof lists or books that win the SPFBO or get discussed on FF much but they are making a living doing it by publishing a book every month or two. The ones Ive read have been perfectly competent stories but they are never going to win awards  yet theres clearly a market for them. As I said in replying to Courtney I like to think of it as the new pulp fiction and its a completely different model to the traditional publishing. So I suppose my point is that you dont have to target the same outcomes as traditional publishing i.e. a superpolished professionally edited book to make a success out of selfpublishing...depending on your definitions. ,Fantasy,d0w1xnk,1,t5_2qknd

6962593,0,t1_d14newn,I found her a bit twodimensional tbh. She didnt seem to have to work much for her prowess it was the same sort of thing I felt about Rey in Star Wars. I am a woman myself and when reading with a view to finding whats not being done find this a characteristic of women characters written by both genders  that even if it would make them deeper characters theres a reluctance to show them failing at something because  maybe  people are actually more worried about showing women at a disadvantage or being wrong and part of that quest for agency leads to the opposite extreme  that theyre right even when theyre wrong  see also A Natural History of Dragons Empress and The Riven Kingdom there is a bit of it in Mistborn Pride and Prejudice and Zombies had a lot of the kungfu princess trope in it etc. GRRMs mixture of characters was much wider in scope and gave a much more human depiction of women. In my wip Im worried about showing my protagonist taking any advice whatsoever from a man because then it becomes it takes a man to show her the right thing to do rather than two human beings helping each other out and learning from each other. I put in some women on the other side of the argument but its hard to write the story with the characters I imagine in my mind without having to add in a lot of disclaimers. One of the men admires my idealistic heroine for her ability to say what wouldnt be politic for him to say at the same time as wishing she would pick her moments a bit better. Internal perspectives like that as well as character development in the male character towards the goal of being more idealistic might help the process I guess.Going back to Sanderson I much preferred Marasi in the Alloy of Law series Sanderson did feel it clunkily necessary to have her defend her decision to wear a dress in AOL but beyond that I think there was more competence and less superwoman about her.,Fantasy,d15jnfv,4,t5_2qknd

7037020,0,t1_d1dzdul,I dont agree with the word radically since I find the prose to be pretty much the same within both works. I think that he improves upon a few aspects of his storytelling between Mistborn and Way of Kings but when it comes to the core of his artistic approach I consider his themes plotting and magic systems to be of a strikingly similar style and tone. Theyre different stories but keeping in mind that they each exist within the same universe with its own overarching plot they certainly share many elements.I dont understand the perspective but Ive definitely seen other people on this subreddit that really liked one series but disliked the other. They seem to go hand in hand for me though.Having said that to the OP I started with Stormlight Archive and its become my favorite series. However Ive recommended Mistborn to others as a primer because I believe it to be better at capturing the best attributes of what makes his writing awesome. Its somewhat more digestible and not as big of a readingtime commitment as WoK is.If you feel like youre gonna have a blast no matter what you read go ahead and dive into Way of Kings. Hes not everyones cup of tea though and I think Mistborn is a good indicator of if you should continue reading his stuff or not. As he says himself if you finish it and its not your style you have a story with closure. But...if you decide to continue from there youll begin paddling out from the kiddie pool of the Cosmere further towards the deep end.,Fantasy,d1e03ti,8,t5_2qknd

7041529,0,t3_4c1aor,I just wanted to address one thinggtI feel the problem is not with the books but with me.As a huge Malazan junkie Im always thrilled when someone starts the series. But you should absolutely not think the problem is with you. A series can have issues that cause a person to dislike it and thats fine. Its not a problem with the series or you. No one has to be wrong in this case. The series is dense confusing and eschews many of the conventions of the genre. Hell of storytelling. But it works for some people. People like me who find it fascinating. But if you look at those elements and feel annoyed or unhappy theres absolutely nothing wrong with that. My wife hates fish. Most of the world love fish. I loves fish. Its delicious healthy and one of the worlds most consumed food groups. So a huge majority of people love fish. Does that mean my wife should just shove more and more of it down her throat hating it all the while because the problem is with her? Of course not.Go ahead and give Malazan another shot. If you still feel the way you do dont force yourself to continue because of some perceived payoff or because you think the problem is with you. Hell the huge payoff that everyone experiences with this series is so tied into Eriksons particular style that you probably wouldnt enjoy it anyway.Taste is subjective and youre not wrong for what you like. Unless its cilantro. That stuff is nasty.,Fantasy,d1eij0b,10,t5_2qknd

Im not sure I can point to anything right now that has been super important to this series. The flashbacks have served as nice character building but thats about it. That doesnt mean it wont matter later. Chances are in a book or two we will look back and say ooooh now I see why he wrote about that! As we often do with his books. If you want to skip thats totally fine. Not saying you cant. Im personally ALWAYS against skipping parts in books. I think its best to read it all because most of the time its written for a reason. If it bothers me that much I just stop reading which VERY rarely happens. I also never recommend anyone skips parts in books. But if YOU want to skip go right ahead. Nothing wrong with that. I am just pretty sure that itll matter in the long run. Sanderson does this. Hes done it on a smaller scale with mistborn. Im sure itll be even bigger in an epic series like Stormlight Archives. ,Fantasy,d1ggdmk,7,t5_2qknd

7091188,0,t1_d1k57zy,Yeah the downside to the chosen one plot is that theres no middle ground. Theyre great when done right but very few writers pull it off. You should definitely check out Three Parts Dead by Max Gladstone. Its the first book in the Craft Sequence. Its on Scribd if you are a member if not just do the free trial. Also the blurb for the book cant begin to describe the sheer awesomeness of the story. If you like fairy tales have you read anything by Catherynne Valente? She is incredible! IMO she is right up there with Gaiman when it comes to fairy tales. V. E. Schwab had some good stuff out. Vicious was great and her new series is really popular right now.

I find Id rather read something new than the more books of the same thing.I liked a lot of things about it and appreciate a lot of what it was but Id have preferred the expurgated version.  Ive also read a lot of its influences already and the stuff that was new warrens for example didnt really float my particular boat. I might well have finished it if Id started at  or  but I just ran out of steam  the next book was on my list for a while and other things kept bumping it down until it just fell off...

7139319,0,t1_d1plz3d,Hey thanks! Maybe it sounds counterintuitive but The Lord of the Rings has the biggest influence on my book. Not so much its fairy tale storytelling mine is more of a tall tale or its plot or setting but its emphasis on world building and language. I decided against inventing my own languages early on because I was not a trained linguist.Also the Northwest Coast has as far as I understand the highest concentration of language families in the world. Emphasize families there. EnglishSpanishHindiRussian are all one family. Native families of the Northwest Coast include Salish Makah Chinook Nootka Haida and Tlingit... they are all as different from each other as English is from Japanese and those are just the ones that pop into my head there are others too. The last thing I wanted was to invent a fantasy word for a place name that might end up meaning something offensive in one of the native languages here. The First Nations of North America have suffered enough I didnt want to contribute to that pain.So instead I chose Chinook Jargon which is not the same as the native Chinookan language. Chinook Jargon a lingua franca pidgin that was commonly used by settlers and indigenous peoples in the PNW up until maybe . I poured through old dictionaries and just fell in love with the words like nawamooks and waum and polaklie. So often the genesis of an invented place in my invented universe came with me finding a Chinook Jargon word and deciding that I MUST apply it as a location name.,Fantasy,d1pnw1t,3,t5_2qknd

Although Id clarify the latter by saying that people have different thresholds for the amount of sex they want and how graphic they want it to be. When most people say gratuitous they just mean too much for them.Personally I have no problem with graphic sex as long as the story is able to stand up.

7159835,0,t1_d1rzk0f,Sorry. I couldnt resist. To answer your post in a more serious fashion it would be helpful if you provided a brief rundown on what postRevivalofF Goku can do so that fantasy readers who arent familiar with DBZ can offer suggestions.Im saying this because isnt necessarily a lot of crossover between animemanga fans and people who read fantasy novels. Even those who do both might not have gotten into DBZ. I never did I usually prefer stuff like Berserk or Claymore.Also its hard to offer comparisons because the power scales in most print fantasy franchises dont directly map to DBZ. With that said  Steven Eriksons Malazan Book of the Fallen is full of characters who could give Goku a good fight like Anomander Rake Icarium Karsa Orlong or Onos Toolan. Caine from Matthew Stovers Acts of Caine regularly takes on opponents far stronger than he is and wins by being willing to fight harder and dirtier than anybody else. I suspect that Vin from Brandon Sandersons Mistborn trilogy could give Goku a fight at least until she runs out of metal. Though Sandersons Stormlight Archive is nowhere near finished you might want to watch out for Kaladin and Szeth as potential matches for Goku. You might want to ask uSalaris about Talien and Lydia from Forging Divinity and Stealing Sorcery.,Fantasy,d1s05d9,6,t5_2qknd

I wanted to do characters who could fly because before the crash Id been having fun with characters who were in situations where they could travel long distances and explore more of their world in the IleRien trilogy and the SGA books Id written and I wanted to continue with that.  I also wanted to explore the idea of characters that had a very frightening appearance.  Originally the book I started was set in a different world with a demonlike creature who was pulled into that world and had to cooperate with its captors to get out but the more I developed the world it had come from and that characters backstory the more I got interested in it.  So I dropped the other novel I think Id gotten about  to  pages written on it and started The Cloud Roads and that character became Moon.I think Ive still got that early draft somewhere.

I just thought itd be a funny way to introduce these things.As for the Urban Sprawl Project it came out of my love of Iain Sinclairs psychogeography stuff Lights Out for the Territory was the first one I read if I remember right. Anyhow so a friend of mine and I walked around a suburb I wanted to write about with disposable cameras and took photos of it. After Id write pieces of prose to try and capture the identity of the area. Another friend of mine would lay it out. After that wed go and print it out and then because we were of that age hand it out anonymously in the area it was about.Probably maybe half a dozen or so people read each issue we did  which was about three if I remember right.

Make it internally consistent and its fine if youre basing a culture off of an existing culture or area of the world at least have all the names with a similar naming convention if its fully made up names dont go crazy on the Ghkhgrgils.. Mostly YA though this to can be done right. . Fair enough. . It depends on setting if youre talking about an isolated Nordic style culture its perfectly fine to have everyone be white. But thats mostly up to what sort of story you want to tell if you have a large world with people coming from many lands it would seem weird if everyone looked the same. . Both styles work it depends on how well you can write the travel bits and what kind of story it is. Most non epic or urban fantasy would do well to just skip over a lot of the traveling unless plot related points happened along the way. . This is a good guideline to follow unless theres magical healing or some crazy th hour burst of adrenaline that still leaves you in the hospital after everything is said and done its good to keep it somewhat realistic. Though the infection thing can be handwaved with a the wound was washed and bound or similar throwaway line. . If you can write well in that style do so.

Youre right that black hobbits and gay Gimli wouldnt improve LoTR but it goes the other way too the Fellowship would be nowhere near as memorable or engaging if it was made up of just  human men instead of the  hobbits  dwarf  elf  Istari and  men we actually get. Hell Gimli and Legolas character arc is explicitly about overcoming racial prejudice which is definitely a story born out of diversity.I think the key is to include enough diversity to have a believable world but dont make diversity the sole focus or the writing quickly falls apart.,Fantasy,d2fi5rq,29,t5_2qknd

Because I slogged through the first part and then the last part was like Woah! why couldnt you have done this sooner? because it turned awesome all the sudden. Then I was so torn because I wanted more of that last fifty pages but I dont want to sit through another slogfest to get it.   Oh yes I have been looking at Shadow of the Winter King! Is it worthwhile then?Path of the Hawk was a pretty good book especially if you like that storyteller style where every character that gives you information gives it as a big tale of what happened.I dont know what its called but sort of like watching a crime show where they are questioned and you get their detailed story of what happened. You might get overlaps in information occasionally but its not always the same story because someone withheld something or lied. I ended up enjoying the style once I realized what was going on.There was only one lady hawk who didnt get a huge role I am hoping she gets some book time in the second half. I think this is an older book redone for epub so I m not going to hold my breath on that.  It has some great fight scenes. Lots of up close and personal fighting. I loved that!  It was gritty but not overly so and not overly dark. Kind of along the lines of Seven Forges. I did feel like it tried too hard in places to give us the gritty but not unredeemable soldier. That got better later as we got to know them a bit.I kind of was assuming this book was in the same vein as First Law from the stuff Ive heard about that series around here but I am saying that having never read First Law.

7370888,0,t3_4gau0z,Your request immediately made me think of the mangaanime Attack on Titan As for books heres what I can recommend   Definitely check The War Against the Chtorr by David Gerrold!! Its a mix of postapocalyptic and an interesting take on alien invasion where its the whole ecosystem which is invaded. The eponymous main antagonists the Chtorr are huge worms deadly and very hard to kill but a multitude of other species as monstruous is also present. A great series with a good deal of action. It has been in a hiatus for decades but you should still definitely check it.     Vampire Earth by E.E. Knight Postapocalyptic setting with vampire aliens as antagonists cheesy premise but it works fine in the story. Its military scifi so expect a lot of action. Not a bad series although the recent entries starting with Appalachian Overthrow lost a lot of steam IMHO.     Posleen War by John Ringo If you dont mind military scifi this one is about the invasion of Earth by aliens with a heavy focus on ground action. It quickly turns postapocalyptic. Not a masterpiece of SF but if you like action its definitely worth a read.  ,Fantasy,d2g0p46,3,t5_2qknd

Will they understand what Im trying to do or will they be prejudiced against the surface elements? Are they going to say this is fantasy?So hes placing the potential prejudices in the minds of his readers presumably readers who prefer his previous literary fiction rather than genre fiction.

Besides one centralised exam means that the conditions and criteria are the same for everyone.

I only tolerate reading books with these settings because some of the storiescharactersthemes that Im looking for happen to be found in them. All in all Id rather read about a Kellhus or a Jorg in a modern setting because I dont want to have to learn about a bunch of made up exoticsounding nations religions cultures etc. just to understand a story. And thats what I want out of fantasy a story with magic not a whole world. If I wanted to be immersed in a world Id travel andor read nonfiction instead of spending my life within the same  mile radius and reading fiction.

I think that is a good thing because it allows creators to take larger steps from the original product while the audience will still accept it. When George Lucas did the prequels that was not the case yet. He had to tie this new product closely to the original trilogy since that was the wisdom of the time to continue a succesful IP. If Lucas had not produced prequels but merely Some Star Wars Stories people would not have had this RuinedChildhoodExperience. The new J.K RowlingProducts seem to have almost no internal connection to the Harry Potter stories.

7545557,0,t3_4ioqlj,The reason youre supposed to avoid adverbs is that most beginning authors use them as filler that doesnt really add anything. gthe mocked jokinglygtshe ran quicklygtit burned warmlyIn all of those examples the adverb literally states something that should already be obvious from the verb that was used.  You can see similar use in some of those GGK adverbs too. Sandres agreement would be grave considering what had just happened. However if you can use an adverb to surprise the reader or to show something that was not implied by the context or the verbs it can be extremely powerful and surprising.gthe shattered invisiblygtthe door slammed wetlygtshe frolicked halfheartedlyIn these examples the adverb tells you things you would have never known without it. The key is to remember that adverbs are modifiers and if they are not modifying the sentence think she ran quickly. Well of course.

7582175,0,t3_4j605w,I am currently reading Kings Rising of the Captive Prince series. I started this series after seeing a fuckton of fanart on Tumblr. I am not sure how I feel. The books go super fast and almost feel like one book that was split into three. I also feel a bit mislead by the fanart. I also DNFed The Court of Mist and Fury by SJ Maas which is surprising for me. But the whole first book was about building this relationship between two people and now the second book ends that and starts a new one. I might pick it up again but its hard care about a romance novel when youre not super interested in the characters. Aw man this is getting long. Ill blame it on the fact that I am sick and am still sick. I was going to go home but my boss asked me to help out on something and I felt bad about asking after that.

Now three very different people may hold the keys to the citys survival.Once it is said gods used magic to create reality with powers that defied explanation. But the magicor science if one believes those who try to master the dangers of thaumaturgynow seems more like a dream. Industrial workers for House Technis farmers for House Arbor and fisher folk of House Marin eke out a living and hope for a better future. But the philosopherassassin Kata plots a betrayal that will cost the lives of godlike Minotaurs the ambitious bureaucrat Boris Autec rises through the ranks as his private life turns to ashes and the idealistic seditionist Maximilian hatches a mad plot to unlock the vaunted secrets of the Great Library of CaeliEnas drowned in the fabled city at the bottom of the sea its strangeness visible from the skies above.In a novel of startling originality and riveting suspense these three people reflecting all the hopes and dreams of the ancient city risk everything for a future that they can create only by throwing off the shackles of tradition and superstition as their destinies collide at ground zero of a conflagration that will transform the world . . . or destroy it.

According to my memory.  Malazan just left me high and dry but I know theyve given a lot of joy to people on this sub.  Im stealing Gene Wolfes definition for stories which are multivolume works vs. series.  A multivolume work is essentially a single novel thats only split up because of publishing requirements.  As opposed to a series that builds and continues a storyline with the same or related characters over time.  All of which is a long winded way of saying I love having  or  books to read especially if the first one grabs me.  But more and more Im starting to believe that  serial doorstoppers are based in worldbuilding and overarching narrative not character or allusion and that structurally they present some problems for writers that so far seem insurmountable to me.But I will always try new stuff out.

8020790,0,t3_4p0ryi,For the record Im a  year old white Australian male.I reckon there are some therapists that would have a field day with what books we read and how it speaks about our insecurities and personality.I am finding picking up new series really frustrating right now. I love male written urban fantasy DresdenFelixAlex V etc but I really really struggle with female written Urban Fantasy. And Ive sat and thought about it a lot and it is not because the guys all have strong jawlines big muscles and tower over the women. It is because the characters are moving along being a strong female character and then some sexy guy walks in the room and three pages later after describing all his physical attributes the MC is left in some kind of domination power play where the more powerful Werewolf Alpha or Head Vampire is sexy scary as fuck and threatening.In what reality do women find that hot?Currently the only romance I read is Lesbian Romance. And it cannot just be about the romance I like a mystery or a story to go around it. Sadly this genre seems very lacking and filled with as many stereotypes as everything else. I have no idea what is realistic or not because while I have plenty of gay friends they are all men. I find it frustrating because all the male fantasy the romance is the weakest written part of a novel. The MC is either gets a major case of stupid or is so damn smooth its unrealistic. I hate female written romance because the romance love interests all seems to be intimidating and alpha jerks that need to put the strong female character in her place.The thing is I love the story and plots and even some of the prose of both male and female authors in the SFFantasy genres but the romances just keep ruining things for me.

8073358,0,t3_4pr4pd,Ive been a fan of WoT since my early childhood. For me they will always be my quintessential fantasy novels and the example of what fantasy should be.That doesnt mean hes perfect however. Just that hes very very good at some things and slightly less adept at others.So some common complaints.. Pacing. Starting around book  or  people feel as though it starts to slow down. By the time we hit book  people are saying that its a novel that is almost entirely superfluous. It picks up again after that I mean really picks up and the novels finish very strong. But there is that middle point where it feels like you are wading through a bit of mud.. Descriptions. People say that Jordan just loves to go into exacting detail and this bogs the books down. While I agree to a point I feel as though there are two sides to this coin. In all honesty I think Jordan was probably the best world builder since Tolkien  and there are very few still alive who can compete with him on that. Martin maybe? So yes Jordan can go overboard on descriptions but the world building is absolutely insane. It spans multiple ages and timelines even multiple realities and pocket universes at some points but the main world is just so well thought out that its nearly unbelievable. He creates very detailed and realistic cultures and customs the world is very much alive and people are distinguishable.. His portrayal of women. You will probably never see a Jordan   criticism that doesnt mention hair tugging tea drinking bathing and sniffing. Well. Its kind of true. But at the same time its once again just part of the epic world building. No one ever criticizes James Potter for constantly missing up his hair. Some characters just have actions that express their emotions. If James Potter ruffles his hair hes looking to impress. If nynaeve tugs her braid shes mad at somebody. Does he have to tell us that she tugs her braid  times a book? Probably not. But I chalk it up to epic world building. Just in closing I want to draw the comparison again between Rowling and Jordan although it might not be quite fair that the prior was writing desk facto childrens novels. However I was reading Jordan at the same time I was reading Harry potter and while I love them both its for vastly different reasons. Rowling writes a good story. An amazing story even. She has this way of leaving large chunks of the world mysterious of avoiding the more philosophical questions what is magic anyways and where does it spring from is a question you NEVER see Rowling address in the books. And just all around writing a well paced action filled coming of age story. Her world building is exceptional but its also very unfleshed. And she managed to work with that by just ignoring a lot of extraneous fluff and focusing on the core of her story. We never quite know what life is like for rest of the Wizarding world we never get huge into their politics or their entertainment. For the most part they are just like us. They have a ministry. They go to the pub. They have famous Wizarding singers and they have a sport.Compared to Jordan her world building doesnt even make the cut. He fleshes every instance of it and this more than anything is his downfall. If you enjoyed the simarillion youll enjoy Jordan.,Fantasy,d4nis9q,3,t5_2qknd

8098924,0,t1_d4qdtiy,Ah right then.Myself I loved the books up through AFFC and was very lukewarm on the series at first an adequatebutnotgreat adaptation. I actually hated Dinklage as Tyrion at first because his eloquent handsomebutshort Tyrion was so different from the misshapen bent cockeyed version of Tyrion from the books.Over the years Ive learned to appreciate the show for what it is. It has some quite fantastic acting and scenery that I enjoy now totally separate from the book experience. Having gotten to that point I found season  to be pretty great.

8098990,0,t3_4q3rj3,My highlight were the John Cleaver books by Dan Wells starting with I am not a Serial Killer. It took an unexpected turn that took some getting used to but as soon as Id adjusted my expectations it worked for me. The protagonist is a yeardold sociopath trying to fake normal but doubting hell ever make it and his point of view is fascinating and scary to read. The second book Mr. Monster was absolutely AMAZING but I liked all of them a lot. The Emperors Blades by Brian Stavely and sequels. Great books although this is one of the very few series that I think could have benefited from more books in it. It makes sense that Stavely just wrote enough to tell the story he wanted to tell I guess this feeling just shows I enjoyed the books and the characters enough to wish that more events had been described in detail and character arc expanded.I just caught up with the latest chapter of Mother of Learning a webnovel. The protagonist a student of magic gets caught in a monthlong timeloop. Check it out if youre a fan of thoughtout magic systems and worldbuilding. Magic is ubiquitous in this world with a th centuryish tech level and the author has developed it with that in mind. The magic is also fairly diverse covering alteration dimensional magic soul magicnecromancy mind magic elemental magic .................... The Novice and its sequel by Taran Matharu were entertaining and easy reads. A world of dominant humans secondclass citizen dwarves struggling for rights strained diplomatic relations with elves and a war against orcs. The protagonist and his allies are students of magicmagicians doing there thing via bound demons that are effectively monstrous pets. Helped me relax after I got annoyed finishing Dawn of Wonder which had a torturous start a decent middle part and such a terrible resolution of the protagonists most important character arc that I couldnt have imagined it  .The Whitefire Crossing by Courtney Schafer was good to burn away a couple of days of potentially productive time the pace kept me glued to the pages. Looking forward to reading the sequel.A Crown for Cold Silver by Alex Marshall isnt quite the next First Law but the vibes are strong. Rough around some edges or maybe its just that some small parts of the dialogue seemed to st century Earthlike to feel right. Similar to Abercrombies work in that its greatest strength is how the characters manage to make you shake with laughter from inside an unfair world of mad religious zealots and unmerciful ends.

8220977,0,t1_d54b5ez,gtGRRM is actually widely considered a pretty lazy worldbuilder.First Im hearing of it and I spend far more time than I should on websites like these. Calling Westeros essentially medieval Britain is doing it a huge injustice. Just because theres little to no magic for  of the story doesnt mean theres not world building. The way the houses and their history intertwine the way the history of the world implies things about current events and the current plot the way that he raises relevant questions about the worlds history its magnificently intricate.

8224306,0,t3_4rz15d,Couple of somewhat I think lessknown onesTwenty Palaces series by Harry Connolly  this is one of my favorite underappreciated book series period. I wont guarantee your own experience will be as superlative bc I dont want to overhype. But its dark  as in the stories tend not to end quite so happily as in most series. The protagonist is seriously underpowered compared to most of the peopleantagonists he meets in the setting  he basically just got hired on to be an expendable mook after fucking up and accidentally getting himself in way over his head in the supernatural world  so he has to win by being smart with what hes got and getting every inch of mileage he can out of what he can. And the magicmonsters are mostly pretty strange and different  even the werewolves in the first book have at least a little bit of a twist about them and are legit scary monsters not the sexy sex sexers you often run into in UF. So yeah one of my favorites. Start either with the first book Child of Fire which has kind of a in media res kinda vibe or with the prequel novel Twenty Palaces  ebook only which tells the story of how the protag initially got in over his head and is a more traditional entry point.Okay. Second series. The Eric Carter books by Stephen Blackmoore. These are a little bit more traditional noir as in absolutely pitchblack LA noir. The protagonist the titular Eric Carter is a slightly amoral necromancerforhire who gets called back to LA when somebody gruesomely murders his sister. Slightly expected  it looks like the culprit is somebody from Erics past. Less expected  specifically its a guy he murdered ten years ago for killing his parents and then fed his soul to hungry ghosts. So its kind of weird hes back.Oh and Ill second Felix Castor at least for the first three books. By the fourth one I was getting pretty tired of a few aspects of Careys schtick in those books so I didnt go past that. But the third one was actually my favorite so go figure.,Fantasy,d55letl,5,t5_2qknd

8233089,0,t3_4s4pzp,For me the degree to which the universe is saturated with magic isnt the important factor. I cant say less is better vs more is better. What I can say is that magic is often a scapegoat or a substitute for a good memorable engaging believable story.  Im pretty sure as a rule of thumb that as little as possible but as much as necessary makes for the best story.Magic has a tendency to overshadow the subtleties in a story. It also has a tendency to make it difficult to empathize with our heroes and villains. There are many exceptions to this rule. The magicians comes to mind as do Sandersons various works and Bakkers.Magic is a piece of a story. If an author comes up with a cool magic system thats great. But a cool magic system isnt normally why people read books. Magic systems why people play games. A book with a magic system that dwarfs the story is basically a game without a plot in book form. This is my subjective opinion please take it with a large grain of salt.I personally prefer highmagic fantasy but its often too much magic and too little plot. Alternatively  the plot is a tired rehashed trope or collection of tropes that has been readapted to exhibit the cool new magic system. In either of these cases I find the book lacking.This is why lately Ive been into grim dark.  Normatively The characters are well developed the universe is visceral and plot is normally more than young hero comes of age kills the big bad and gets the girl. Magic is awesome but its a sure fire way to destroy a story. Or it can be used like febreeze  to mask the problem.,Fantasy,d56ox7x,4,t5_2qknd

The first book was pretty meh for me although it did pick up toward the end.  Based on my feeling after finishing The Gunslinger I ended up reading a whole bunch of other stuff rather than moving on to The Drawing of the Three but I have good intentions of going back to pick it up.A lot of people Ive talked toread reviews from said the series really picks up in Book .  Ive also heard it really bogs down again around Books .  I do have one friend that swears Book  Wizard and Glass is her favorite of the series but she seems to have a minority opinion on that.  I think Ill at least read Book  but not sure Ill push on through the whole series with so much of it being considered a drag to get through.

When alliteration takes over and becomes an exercise in a thesaurus of descriptors it gets ridiculous.Period vernacular alone would leave the average reader dumbfounded. They make abridged and cliffnotes versions of Shakespeare not because the English used is unrecognizable but because the references and sentence structure are.

Since then hes shifted to still personally opposing gay marriage but with no basis for doing so apart from his own religious beliefs which shouldnt be forced upon anyone else.

A protagonist having violence done upon them especially if it is particularly graphic ... that is less so.  We like our fantasy battles to be spectacular we dont like dealing with the aftermath.  As a visual example compare and contrast the gratuitous gleeful splatter of the finale battle in Rambo IV with the intimate unpleasantness of a Saw.  One we can appreciate the other makes us feel complicit.

Its a slice of life of a high ranking warrior who has just had enough and is trying to find peace somewhere else.  Under Heaven Guy Gavriel Kay might fit  while there are earth shattering events the main male lead is a catalyst not a major player.  Crispin in the Sarantine Mosaic is even more apt.Arguably Small Gods Terry Pratchett definitely Only You Can Save Mankind both of which nicely play with the whole Chosen One idea.

It just doesnt change anythingIdeally this would be true if we lived in a meritocracy but unfortunately thats not the world we live in. The fact of the matter is and there have been a few great threads on rFantasy about this theres still a major representational gap. Being aware of it is the first step towards correcting the problem.For example a while ago I never thought about the author  I just read what the best books were and the books that sounded interesting to me. Racegender had no role in it. Thats the ideal scenario.BUT when I looked at my bookshelf the vast majority of books I was reading were by straight white men. I realized that I wasnt getting a broad scope of perspectives and I was inadvertently ignoring great books by women and POC. So I started seeking them out deliberately and my reading experience is much much richer as a result. But thats just me  everyone has their own process.,Fantasy,d6xf8cy,6,t5_2qknd

8801928,0,t1_d75ut90,But that is the point I have no problem with using race as a tool to make your work more expansive it just needs to be used as one. A hammer is a tool to help build a wall but it only works when there is a nail when there is not it only serves to put holes in a wall. The nail has a point and that is kind of what I am getting at. Race is a strong tool when it has a point to hold a world together and expand on its history its current conditions and its social structure. Absent that point though it often just feels like its punching holes in a story.EDIT Or put another way if one prefers race is generally created by groups of people being separate for a long time. Individual people dont often move around without very good reason such as trade shipping or things like that which means an individual being of a different race then an areas norm is most likely the result of them being special in some way not as a result of them being normal. The exception to that however is that while individual people dont often move large groups of them often do. Mass migrations and invasions being the two best examples and sometimes indistinguishable. But this also tells something important about the area and should effect it in some way. The point being that both of those types of movement involve something relatively important. In those days though the average person wasnt just moving to another country because they like the area more.,Fantasy,d75venq,1,t5_2qknd

They are really stretching here and if I had to represent one side I would probably rather defend this case than represent the publisher in getting the advance back.Original to the Author in all Respects is about being able to copyright it. There is no such thing as a book in the plain meaning of the sense original in all respects. Plot character structure its all been done before we are not creatures that can create art and invent it whole cloth its always based on your prior experiences. Books arent great because every aspect of it is completely novel but because you do something interesting with how your protagonist deals with his problems leading to the resolution.How do you write a book copying the same style quality and broad appeal of your previous book while being completely original? How is a book using real and fabled elements of Abe Lincolns life and character elements original in all respects? Its not. The same style etc. is just so the author cant write a technical manual on replacing the clutch on a  Ford Pinto and submit that. The terms are so generic as to be almost meaningless but they want a popular novel.An original work is a copyright term and thatt what the contract is about making sure he hasnt previously published it or put his name to anothers work or otherwise get them sued. The only use of the term original work is in the copyright warranty paragraph which you know if their boilerplate and has nothing to do with making sure he doesnt write a mashup just that he can copyright the bookProprietor represents that...Book  and  are original with Author in all respects...that the Work may be validly copyrighted...that each of Book  and Book  as a whole are not in the public domain. Well neither book as a whole is in the public domain.Im sure the plaintiff drafted this contract so any ambiguities will be construed against them in court. The fact is that the plaintiff and any objective person who reviews this contract will not see that use of original work to mean that he couldnt do a mashup. Plaintiffs could have easily written into the contract that no portion of Book or Book may be in the public domain but the fact is they didnt. They hired an author who is best known for a mashup and if they didnt want a mashup they should have made that clear in the contract.As I said before the submitting the idea before the deadline is pretty much worthless. Theyve had substantial performance and for three years they knew he was writing a book but didnt do anything about it. Now that its written it is too late to use that as the basis for breach. The material provisions of the contract are to get a book not to get an idea of a book. Theyve received substantial performance. You cant make a contract with a house painter require three days notice before he begins let him paint the house without giving notice and then not pay him once hes done because he didnt give you notice. Hes substantially performed and is entitled to payment.,Fantasy,d77y6lz,7,t5_2qknd

8956288,0,t3_52fx5q,Where do you think the war among the scrubs is going?I think someone is going to end up with at least a very bad injury. Beyond being bunked. And maybe that will make all the Scrubs pull together and get out from under the influence of their older brothers at least as far as academy matters go. Gotta say I kind of like Cherry Stripe now. Hes no leader but hes a good follower who knows a losing battle when he sees one. And hes brave at least try to call his brother on the Seirlaefs shit strategy.Has your opinion of Tanrid changed at all?Not really. I kind of expected this was going to be his relationship with Inda. What I didnt expect was his social awkwardness which makes him more likable to me.Did you see anything interesting about Tdors trip?The additional details about Joret seeing her aunts ghost and the treachery treachery treachery in a language she did not understand was pretty big. That treachery must stretch somehow to the Kings brother but just how those pieces fit... Its intriguing.Tdors curiosity about love and sex and knowing she has a place to learn about it in the future being good enough for her was pretty funny.So outside those questions Im pretty curious about the economy of the Kingdom. We are so much inside the aristocracy that we get nothing but hints about it in the foods they eat and the clothes they wear. Is it a feudal system or are the kingdom and its Jarls in charge of protecting free market commerce? We know Indas family is having trouble making ends meet with both sons in the academy but we dont know how they get their wealth in the first place. Thats the big background that I really want to know more about.,Fantasy,d7oetvg,2,t5_2qknd

8962701,0,t3_531jto,Finished A Memory of Light this week. Very fast paced book and I am happy that Sanderson was the one to finish this series otherwise it probably would have lasted  books and Im not sure it would have been worth it if it was the same ending. Which brings me to the ending. Without going into any spoilers I thought it was an OK ending. It wasnt that I disliked it just thought my initial thoughts were oh thats it?. Overall the series was decent enough. I definitely think the last  books were the best but I feel like there was much to be desired for certain characters and the Last Battle didnt seem all that deathly bad word but I cant think of anything else.Also finished Furies of Calderon yesterday. I liked it. Wasnt blown away but Ive heard that this was the weakest book in the series so Im going to continue. Ive got book  on hold now.Not sure what Im going to read next. Im about  pages into The Cursed Child. Ive been there for a  month. Not sure I can continue. I picked it up last night and read  pages before I put it down. Just a really bad book so far.

9039577,0,t3_542h26,gt DONT NEED NO MAN HELPSo I dont know what books youre talking about but Ill address this one. Theres two different ways this is used that Ive seen.A. Its a way to try to make the strong female character. The rebuff of the damsel in distress. The issue with this one is that it is creating the lone wolf character which I always feel is a weaker character by nature. Were also not quite used to female lone wolves yet in media the way were used to lone males. B. A rebuff of the men in her society. I have always been independent. I carried my own shit did my own stuff and no I didnt need a man to open my pickle jar. There was a reason for that. When I was younger men reacted a couple different ways when helping women. Some acted like women were helpless and would wax on about the delicate fragility of women to the point that Id want to scream. The other was the ever so helpful Nice Guy tm who was So Nice tm and Always Good tm who Id eventually learn was doing all of this as a credit system to eventually expect sex. A date a kiss a hug an inappropriate touch whatever. After all they had done so much for me surely I can see theyre a Nice Guy tm unlike all of those other guys.It was easier to be considered shrill and a c than it was to put up with either of these situations. After spending ones formative years dealing with these situations over and over a girl sometimes develops a very strict DONT NEED NO MAN HELP simply as a defense against potential unwanted attention. ,Fantasy,d7yewah,9,t5_2qknd

At this point its mainly because I want to support the author and have the money to do so. I have even gone back and bought the best of what I pirated through the years probably because they were worth a second read.Looking back I can understand why I did it but holy shit those pirated copies were terrible.

I think most of this stuff is discussed in chapters  and  of Heir of Novron.Novron fell in love with a human woman Persephone so thats how he developed his strong attachment to humans.  I dont remember the specifics but the elves might have been trying wipe out the humans at that point in time too.  At the very least they were persecuted.Novron was murdered by Mawyndul of the Miralyith the mage tribe of elves.  Mawyndul was also known as Patriarch Venlin during the time of the last emperor and during the series is known as Patriarch Nilnev.  Mawyndul murdered the king before Novron.  That king happened to be his father.  Being a murderer disqualified him from inheriting the position but not from blowing the horn and challenging others for the position.The horn decides the line of kings for the next  years an Uli Vermar.  Novron had a son so he became king when Novron died.  If Novron didnt have an heir the next elf to blow the horn would be king.EDIT  This is all in Riyria Revelations.

9381241,0,t3_5929p6,Ive read ... well lets call it  of Mercedes Lackeys Valdemar which is well past the  book mark. I have no idea where it is but its huge. I think I wouldnt recommend any of the newer books but the older stuff? Sure. Arrows of the Queen By the Sword the Oathbound series... yep. The newer books start to trail off in quality fairly sharply around the time her husband started helping. I also read... well lets call it most of Pern because I trailed off somewhere in there. And it was a heck of a fun ride. I think my favorites were the Harper Hall trilogy. Dont start there though you wouldnt have the foundation for it.  Im even sort of keeping up with David Webers Honor Harrington series which is in the something range and YES I know the main character is a total Mary Sue Im sorry and yes I know that he overexplains detail and I love it and Im sorry. So the real risk with these longhaul series isnt that youre reading so much of the same. Far from it actually  in my opinion they become comfort reads. You know what youre getting when you get into one and you just slide right into the world and enjoy it. The risk is that they decline in quality too sharply and they cant even live up to your nostalgia and that is a true bummer.,Fantasy,d9550j4,2,t5_2qknd

But for me they dont happen by accident Im well aware of what I can write well and whats a stretch. With every book I try to do something I havent done before from the second Night Angel book  Can I take a character who actually murdered a character readers really like and make them root for her? In Lightbringer  theres a scene thats textually really tricky in keeping the reader effortlessly oriented while never losing the emotion of the scene thaton a rereadIm really proud of! Cant wait to talk about it. And yes I did mean . I wanted to see if I could make it. I wanted to either fail and get it out of my system and get a real job or become a writer for real.

9411364,0,t1_d98mfdu,Lovecraft has been a huge part of the tabletop gaming community for a long time. One of the older surviving RPGs is Call of Cuthulhu from Sandy Peterson. Its had some serious problems over the years but its still running.The recent resurgence probably started some  years ago when Steve Jackson got at the IP. He managed to get Sandy to let him use it and he made a series of fairly simple but flavourful games around the IP. When The Stars Are Right is a good simple  player game and my favourite of them. This then started the gamers asking for more difficult works within the Cuthulhu Mythos which resulted in Arkham and Eldritch Horror and Sandy Petersons most recent work with the IP Cuthulhu Wars.

9470452,0,t3_5aecc4,I discovered Bingo at the start of the month so my completed reading was all in an effort to fill the bracket. Homeland Forgotten Realms The Dark Elf Trilogy  by R.A. Salvatore. Picked it up at my librarys last book sale in which they were selling a local High School librarys underread YA and Fantasy catalog. I picked this up because I knew Drzzt by reputation and as a playable character in a PS video game. It was a pretty disappointing book with clunky dialog and hamhanded story structure. Still it was good to read it for the background it gives the forgotten realms games Ive played.  Dragons of Autumn Twilight by Margret Weis and Tracy Hickman another DampD book which kicked off of the Dragonlance Chronicles was my reread to fill the book by multiple authors square. I first read this book when I was  or  years old and my tween self thought it was completely awesome. Now over two decades later I find it to be a horrible mess of a book. It really reads like a chronicle of players DampD campaign including bad player decisions annoying character traits DM interventions to get the party back on track and unfortunate dice rolls. Those are all things that can be fun in a game but arent the elements of a story narrative. Im a little sad to have ruined my good memories of the book by rereading. Soldier of Sidon by Gene Wolfe read to fill the Novel inspired by nonwestern folkloremyth square. Set in ancient Egypt this was outstanding! The main character has a head injury that left him without long term memory and to compensate for that he writes what happens to him down in a scroll. He has lots of interactions with Gods mythical beasts and magic which may or may not be real because the nature of his head injury makes his narration unreliable. A really engrossing book and my first exposure to Wolfe. I discovered after reading that there are previous books with the same character which I definitely intend to read. Castle Waiting Vol.  by Linda Medley is what I used to fill my Graphic Novel square. Starts with a twist on sleeping beauty and opens up into multiple character stories. A fairly charming read but Im not sure I was hooked enough to chase down more volumes. ,Fantasy,d9gfssg,3,t5_2qknd

9668480,0,t3_5dgdaf,Ive been writing since I was in short trousers as they say. Fast forward through odd years of noodling around with ideas to a big pile of words that resolutely refused to gel into a novel. Then in  my personal life blew up. In the aftermath I started writing as therapy and my loose agglomeration of ideas took a new form.One scene led to another which eventually led to a novelshaped thing called Songs of the Earth. My newlyacquired husband nagged me to send it out to agents and I agreed largely to shut him up.Eight queries. The second agent bit. All the others rejected me but by the time theyd all replied it was too late. Six weeks after I sent him the full script that second agent had sold my trilogythatbecameaquartet to Gollancz.In  so between the Great Rewrite and getting married I was diagnosed with MS. My health has not been great for the last couple of years as its turned progressive. That forced some lifestyle changes and played hob with my productivity which is why the final installment of said quartet is now so horribly abominably late. Also series wrapup is surprisingly tough.

9678754,0,t1_da5yzfs,I agree with Krista  Asunder and Masked Empire are the best of the bunch. Last Flight is a fairly compelling look at the ancient history of the Grey Wardens and their relationship with griffons. However its written by a freelancer so if youre looking for books authored by BioWare staff this ones not for you.An aside David Gaider the previous lead writer on DA wrote Throne Calling and Asunder. Gaider has since moved on to a new company. Patrick Weekes the new lead wrote Masked Empire.If you like the BioWarestyle quippyness you might like Patricks Rogues of the Republic series.

9681188,0,t3_5dlz7v,Its one of my favourite fantasy series and was my first exposure to Abrahams work. I like pretty much everything about these books but in particular I love how theyre structured time skips and all and how everything fits together by the end. How you can trace the consequences of characters actions through the years and you really feel their impact. If only Otah hadnt... maybe Maati would... So good. Its one of those series that has really given me an appreciation for a good title. I feel like the series title is so perfect for it and I love the title of the final book. One of the few books where I was so affected by it that I was in tears by the end. I really appreciated how slim each book was but also how much was crammed into the series. Addition by omission or something. Leave the reader to ponder and fill in the blanks. I know some people say the books are slow and boring but I was honestly captivated from that first section with the Poets training and I never looked back.I liked it so much that Ill buy and have bought anything hes written or been involved in that I can readily get my hands on. Ive enjoyed his other stuff like the Dagger and the Coin and the Expanse but they havent quite got to me like the Long Price did. Ive also still got to read his MLN Hanover urban fantasy series which Ive been setting aside for a rainy day. Still bought each book in that series asap to show my support and because I trust the author to deliver and he hasnt failed me yet.Im extremely pleased that his and Ty Francks Expanse series has taken off and been as successful as it has. He deserves all the success in the world. I only wish the Long Price had met with the same. Im eagerly awaiting any tidbit of information regarding his next solo project.,Fantasy,da6esh1,2,t5_2qknd

9685208,0,t3_5ds58s,I think I understand your aversion for urban fantasy especially when the world is too similar to our own. Which is why I have a soft spot for Neil Gaiman. His works can be purely urban fantasy but he offers such weird and smart premises that youd never think before but at the same time really explain mundane phenomenons.I prefer something with elaborate worldbuilding. I started off with Tolkien as a teen and it has been my benchmark for fantasy worldbuilding. A well established conlang would be a plus I guess.I also try to avoid fantasy with too derivative elements like dragons elves dwarves or basic medieval fantasy in general. Again since I started with Tolkien I guess Im a little bit selective with commontraditional fantasy tropes.And I guess I like fantasy books that can make me go whoa never think of that! or wow! what an epic prose!

It has the chief benefit of being about something the reader by definition doesnt know the answer too so it can tackle problems of how science works without the audience knowing the answers in advance. Itd be damned hard to pull off I think but I imagine someone has tried. The key thing is that science doesnt mean solid answers and clear rules it means a ceaseless search for understanding.

The characters in warbreaker actually felt a lot more beleivable than most of his books not saying I liked warbreaker better than mistborn or stormlight. The only book of his Ive disliked was Elantris.Your critique on the scandalized ingnue in a new environment doesnt make sense to me either. Neither of the princesses were stock characters. They were innocent because they are young and well... princesses. That makes perfect sense to me. They also responded very differently to situations and grew differently. The whole destroy evil thing makes sense because the command has to be extremely simple. Even  words would have been pushing it. It doesnt strike me as a stupid choice.As for your calling the twist a conspiracy on a small religious minority that the series didnt explore? What?! They were positioned in a theocratic capital of an extremely religious culture. The antagonists were a small nation of oppressed people who werent very religious but in fact oppressed by the main religion.

10062465,0,t1_dbhwbiu,The OP talks about fantasy in general and uses an example from DampD which fits his thesis hes not just talking about DampD.  But even in DampD it appears that they are still fertilegtMost halfelves are the children of humanelf pairings. Some however are the children of parents who themselves are partly human and partly elf. Some of these secondgeneration halfelves have humanlike eyes but most still have green eyes.From what I can find half orcs are also fertile in fact most half orcs are the children of half orc parentsgtThe majority of halforcs born since the Spellplague have halforc parents rather than being first generation halforcs although it is still not wholly uncommon for a halforc to be born from a halforc and human coupling either by consent or rape.and so are half dwarfsgtThe fertility and offspring of halfdwarves was similar to that of halfelves. If a halfdwarf mated with a pureblood dwarf the offspring would be a pureblood dwarf. If a halfdwarf mated with another halfdwarf or a nondwarf the offspring would be a halfdwarf.In other fantasy worlds it is clear that many races can produce fertile offspring.  In Lord of the Rings children of elves and men can have children.  In The Witcher they can as well one of the main characters has elven blood from hundreds of years ago.  In the Shadows of the Apt series which doesnt have elves but different kinds of insect humans the various races can all reproduce and make fertile offspring this mixing is traditionally looked down upon but becoming more common.,Fantasy,dbj5w1v,1,t5_2qknd

If I see a beatiful girl in a read dress Im probably not even reading the description certain colors on the cover are also off putting orange and red together for example.Im not sure if youre suggesting theres a system that weights male authors over female in any initial algorithms? Im more inclined to believe the algorithm is based more on their own actual data how many has bought this or related books impactful words in the description rating  length and availability and then later on go on to use your personal information to rate books you could potentially enjoy here is where the gender variable would be taken into account so in a sense you would yourself be responsible for the books you are recommended.I will admit to stopping at some authors names and reading their books simply because of that. Im currently reading a book series by a Al. K. Line isnt that name awesome? That name cant be real! Bottom line authors should pick fake names like weathermen.,Fantasy,dbk23zk,1,t5_2qknd

He gets more in depth and more immersive the further you get into his work. By the time you hit Mistborn Era  and The Way of Kings he gets the balance right. By this time you realize that while Elantris and early mistborn are decent they are not on par with Stormlight...But you also start to see the overall picture of the Cosmere start to form and you realize just how much detail he did put into those books but you missed... at that point I couldnt help but think of the  massive pair of balls this man must have to just throw like  things in the air and start juggling that I couldnt but help gain a ton of respect for him. ,Fantasy,dc4l0kz,3,t5_2qknd

10241833,0,t1_dc4frk7,gtI just mean take the same infinite sequence of symbols that makes up Pi in base ten but interpret it as a base eleven number. It would still be an irrational transcendental number but now its missing the digit for  so it cant possibly contain every possible combination. But if it was interpreted as a base  number it would have a different numerical value than Pi. Any    or X string will have its numerical value changed if it were in a different base system. And since not all trancendental irrational numbers are normalised that new number youve made does not necessarily follow the same rules or have the same properties. What Im saying is that statistical analysis shows a tendency towards an even distribution of digits as the number counted approaches infinity and people have performed that analysis up to millions and the trend holds.But none of this has any bearing on the Dark Ones ability to win. He cant because any time he gets close the creator puts his finger on the scale. We know this because hes failed an infinite number of times before.Whats confusing is that the Dark One doesnt seem to have worked this out yet.

Theres an amazing quote in one of the stories that is pretty much the motto of the author  KaneWhat if instead of some longdead artists neverfinished vision of unearthy beauty you found yourself trapped in an unhallowed nightmare from which some feverpoisoned madman awoke shrieking? The dark muse cares not whether her dreams portray ethereal beauty or mindless horror.  The poet formed an easy smile If I wanted to write poems on sunshine and flowers and love this might worry me. But you know my thoughts well enough. Ill weave my verses for the night sing of the dark things that soar through nameless abysses  unfold the poetry of the macabre while others prattle about little things. ... True beauty lies in the dark side of life  in death in the uncanny  in the grandeur of the unknown. The pure awareness of beauty is as overwhelming an emotion as blind fear to feel inexpressible love is as soulwrenching a sensation as to know relentless terror. When fired to the ultimate blaze the finest emotions become one intolerable flame and ecstasy and agony are inseparable.,Fantasy,dc91vph,2,t5_2qknd

The original vampires of folklore originating in Central Europe arent as dramatic as Carmilla or Dracula so we dont often see them in epic fantasy.KJ Parker has a real Central European vampire floating around somewhere in one of his short stories.Sethra Lavode in Brusts Dragaera novels is often mentioned as a vampire but that part of her nature doesnt really feature in the Taltos books. Brust often draws from Magyar influences so it could be that kind of vampire I dont know.Also wanted to note that Sapkowski is extremely well regarded in Europe.

A wizard in long robes with long beard would probably fit the wizardinpointyhat trope perfectly regardless of the wizard owning a pointy hat or not. A magical sword or a magical bow? Same trope. So depending on how you choose to look at it the tropes will become increasingly or decreasingly common. But I also think that many of these tropes comes from the earlier fantasy literature and that there have been a shift in modern writing style probably as a response to readers getting tired of elves elves and elves. ,Fantasy,dcady89,1,t5_2qknd

I know I saw an AMA author once that said they had a series that didnt do very well they wrote another book that did much better and they decided to focus on that and that they probably wouldnt finish the original series. I would be afraid to pick up a book from them. Whether the new series was like standalones in the same universe Discworld early Dresden or a very sequential thing KKC Stormlight would also be a big factor.,Fantasy,dccw71p,2,t5_2qknd

10382220,0,t1_dckuqnv,Hi Ashe I think you may have but it gives me an excuse to tell you again Bloodrush is a comingofage tale set in an alternate  spread between London and Wyoming. Its written to be dark weird west but contains a smattering of steampunk elements which is hard not to include in the s. Its a very magiccentric book with the title coming from the magic system itself which is quite extensive.The main character lordling Tonmerion Hark is orphaned at the opening of the book and sent to live with his undertaker aunt on the frontier of the discovered world  Wyoming. All he wants to do is get home and solve the murder of his father the Prime Lord of the Empire. However his aunt the wild and Merions peculiar friend Rhin Rehnar a Fae outcast have other ideas for him. Im going to leave it spoiler free there...The Gunslinger  to Yuma and True Grit were the major influences for the Western elements. Theres something so alluring about the barrenness of the landscapes and the unpredictability of it and its wanderers. Lawlessness is a tantalising concept I think. Its why I believe dystopia apocalypse and zombie genres fascinate us and the wild west is just another shade of that. The main location in Bloodrush Fell Falls I wanted to be the complete opposite of bustling London.For the fantasy elements I took a lot of ideas from mythology and history particularly the Scythians and Moche.As for music Bloodrush has a playlist that has some of my metal songs on there. Current favourite metal album would have to be the  Memphis May Fire album This Light I Hold. Cant. Stop. Listening.Cheers for the questions Ashe and hopefully catch you soon.,Fantasy,dckw09n,2,t5_2qknd

That said a couple of things to consider in regards to AtiaranLord Fouls Banes Atiaran and the Lands people in general are fairly hardcore pacifists. The moral code they take from the Oath of Peace is as widespread and fervently held as a religion. And part of that is you absolutely do not harm someone if they are not a present threat. If Covenant had attacked Lena in front of Atiaran or Trell you would have seen a very different reaction. As it is attacking Covenant after the fact would be violence for vengeance and remember the Lands people are taught that those emotions can be a real threat to their worlds existence. Second she believes two crucial things Lord Foul is back and Covenant is Beric reborn. An existential threat to her entire people is here and she believes Covenant is the only one with a good chance of stopping it. She sacrifices her personal desire for justice for the best chance at her peoples survival.Is all this realistic? Maybe not but Donaldson was creating the Land and its people both as something close to a utopia and a personal hellparadise for Covenant. Covenant deliberately is the voice of cynicism. The Land is his opposite.,Fantasy,dcnmhke,4,t5_2qknd

The description of the heavy weight of aching darkness is rather accurate.  In this case the depression is magically alleviated though not removed similar to taking drugs.  And the character learns to live with the darkness but there is a profound impact on everything he does.

For touring Id probably just call a cabuber to just go straight into town than try to deal with the long public transportation trips that are there. If you can swing it you might want to stay in Old Town Alexandria also a charming historic district near the King Street Metro instead. Thats about as balanced between the locations as you can be. Other stuffThe smithsonian closes at  or  depending on the season with the exception of the Portrait Gallery which is open until  daily. The monuments never quite close per se and seeing them at night all lit up is really cool actually. The mall is indeed where all the monuments are. If you look at the picture of the recent inauguration all those crowds or lack thereof are standing on the Mall. Walk or just take regular public transportation assuming youre already in DC and not at National Harbor. Between Metro and the DC Circulator you ought to be good.

10529322,0,t3_5qrc40,My first favorite books were Matilda and the Witches by Roald Dahl. After that it was probably the Young Jedi Knights series by Kevin J. Anderson and Rebecca Moesta. For a long time it was Enders Game by Orson Scott Card along with various Discworld books there were a couple of years there where I pretty much only read OSC and Pratchett. Traitor by Matthew Stover had its day in the sun as did Peter the Great His Life and Times by Robert K Massie. These days if Im honest with my self my favorites are probably Alexandra Quick by Inverarity and Worm by Wildbow. All of the books Ive mentioned as well as many more still have a special place in my heart.,Fantasy,dd1m3a4,3,t5_2qknd

10537659,0,t3_5qtbni,Yes many times.  You definitely should read them in order if you can but it isnt essential due to the chaotic nature of the storyline.  They are batshit crazy and bounce genres all over the show but I really like some of them.  Havent reread them in a decade though so my memories are a little hazy.  They get weirder and weirder though in a generally good way.  The Wizards and the Warriors is a relatively traditional quest narrative with weird stuff. The Wordsmiths and the Warguild is a light hearted farce the quest of a fool of whom nothing can ever go right.  Its a lot of fun.  The Women and the Warlords is a very serious look at the fate of a woman in a patriarchal medieval society it isnt pretty.  This is what tanked his series sales female leads never sell well.  I liked it a lot didnt.  The Walrus and the Warwolf is my favourite overall a charismatic romp by a complete bastard of a protagonist.  Pirates ninjas demons and more.  The Wicked and the Witless finishes the first arc and fills in many of the gaps from the other four  Watashi was a walk on character in each.  The Wishstone and the Wonderworkers and The Wazir and the Witch are set on a different continent and barely interact with the previous five they are also allegedly written by a madman.   Stuff gets very weird now and also a bit SF.  I mostly recall a giant talking crab.  The Werewolf and the Wormlord finishes that plot strand up and explores the history of another continent and a squabble over an empire. The Worshippers and the Way is set on yet another continent is very post apocalyptic SF in tone and lays the groundwork for what is really going on.  It feels a bit Amtrak Wars like.  The Witchlord and the Weaponmaster is another favourite  it stars Guest Gulkan who cameos everywhere else and it basically ties a lot of the whole series together.  Unfortunately then the series stops and there are a lot of dangling threads.  Full marks for ambition though and my god what a talent.  He was honestly a decade or so too early the Internet and fan theories would have saved him.,Fantasy,dd2k6hy,1,t5_2qknd

Books  of Wheel of Time slow down a LOT and in particular Book  is a massive waste of time and a disappointment compared to the rest of the series up to that point. If you are fully on board with and loving Books  of Wheel of Time and then in a few of the later books you get bogged down and find yourself struggling to keep interested  just skim through them quickly to hit the high points of the plot and pick up reading more carefully in Knife Of Dreams book . The series DOES recover from its disastrous downturn in the middle so if you can skim through the worst parts of it like Book  fast there is a good stretch of novels on the other side that are at least as good as the earlier WoT books and some are arguably better  Brandon Sandersons finishing novels combine the best of his strengths as a writer with the best of Jordans while almost entirely removing the worst of Jordans flaws.,Fantasy,ddd1bea,75,t5_2qknd

Lots of over the top action and some great dialogue.

10732312,0,t3_5t9ysg,The first book of Sandersons I read was The Final Empire some three or four years ago. Nobody recommended him to me Ive never even heard of him before.

Everyone who asked me and some who didnt for a recommendation got a Im a bit ashamed to admit fangirly squeaking about how good he is. And a proper explanation why so I dont drive them away from his books by just repeating awesome awesome awesome .Imfangirlingagainhalp.I am in love with his worldbuilding his incredibly well thoughtout magic systems and characters that follow their own reasoning and beliefs instead of doing things for the plot. Although his writings kinda slowpaced the first half of the book I really like  of what he wrote. Sometimes the slowpaced thing even more than the action. Heck if he wrote a dissertation on snails journey cross the road Id probably read it and give it five stars. Hes the first author Ive ever bothered to find out more about and spend time reading what he wrote on his website. And not to mention how much he communicates with the audience its really amazing.

10742037,0,t3_5tnrl9,Good discussion here. Thanks for posting. Noting the vagueness of the term the grimdark subgenre gets too much credit for popularizing moral relativism in fantasy novels. In fact I would argue that the term refers less to parallels with postmodernism than to an overreliance on any combination of violence sex and vulgarity in fantasy novels that happen to explicitly reject binary morality.Fantasy novels were exploring nonbinary morality an effort that inherently moves away from old genre tropes long before the term grimdark became wellknown. They did so without the shock value of contemporary grimdark novels. Friedmans Coldfire trilogy comes to mind. Friedman delves into dark themes and moral relativism without the need for excessive bloodshed. Her character Gerald Tarrant is an exemplar of a fantasy antihero that would fit perfectly in a grimdark novel except Coldfire for all of its shortcomings delivers a narrative without the trappings of shock value.Friedman may not be the best example but grimdark refers primarily to content and secondarily to ideas. Fantasy novels have long rejected or developed upon old tropes and presented nonbinary morality as well sincere irony without the need for someone to bleed every  pages or curse every  paragraphs. Sincerity acknowledging irony but without nihilism nor the grand narrative is here already. ,Fantasy,ddnykda,10,t5_2qknd

If we could find some turned pottery it might be possible to extract audio from the patterns in the surface like an old fashioned record but I dont think turned pottery goes that far back.  I suppose fossils could show soft details and from that the possibility of creating sounds could be determined but the language issue remains which is harder to get at.Given we are looking for fantasy we should not be too hard on authors tweaking reality.

Judging from your own books I would guess a dangerous proposal to guess at anothers intentions that your issue with Postmodernism is that it tends to distract from its moral quandaries rather than leave them bare. And in the face of a noncritical reader I would agree with you. However Im tempted to argue that grimdark would be as wasted on that reader as postmodernism is.,Fantasy,ddp9p9l,2,t5_2qknd

Have a friendly well laid out table a few package deals etc and be polite with people share a few jokes. In my experience youll not get a lot out of using tricks to draw people in.For stock its hard to say how much you want. Itll really depend on the crowds. Twenty of each is probably decent for a bit of a table spread but I wouldnt expect to sell that much. You might  that would be great but I would say unlikely  but its best to keep your expectations modest. If you sell one book youve sold one book and its a success.The book marks and cards Krista mentioned are a good idea btw. A lot of people will pick it up and take it and its a nice way to leave a reminder around.The trick to remember is each one of these is a learning curve. You do your first your make your mistakes you get a handle on what ppl like what they dont. And location will change a lot as well.

10804420,0,t1_ddu9sgt,Here are some reasons I think its different.  . Rape survivors often suffer from PostTraumatic Stress Disorder. Reading about rape can literally trigger a PTSD episode which may involve reliving their own rape or other types of extreme psychological duress. Because so many people are directly affected by rape that it is impossible to avoid in any sort of media is a real concern for them as it is literally extraordinarily painful to read about.  . Rape is very often handled poorly cavalierly or inaccurately. This is offensive to people who have been raped or sexually assaulted because it was a life changing traumatic event for them. This is also offensive to people close to them because it is also often a life changing traumatic event for them. Because it has such a profound effect on peoples lives it should be taken seriously.     . The inaccurate representations are often done in a way that are EXTREMELY EXTREMELY problematic even dangerous. For instance thousands and thousands of works depict women who are raped only to end up enjoying it or falling in love with their attackers.   Yes you say but no one has killed anyone because of violent video games. Yes that is totally true. But how many people do you know out in the world who think that shooting people is a totally fine thing to do? Now consider that places like the redpoll exist where literally hundreds to thousands of men discuss things like how rape is deserved or justified or always false accusations or just plain acceptable. That attitude is real widespread and dangerous.    This also goes for things that minimize the seriousness or damage of rape or just straight treat rape as a joke. If you were caught shooting someone totally innocent of any wrong doing in the street youd likely go to prison for a long time. The total normalization of rape has evidence of real consequences in our society  the swimmer rapist dude got caught in the act of raping an unconscious woman and got only a six month jail sentence. After all boys will be boys is not a thing people say about gang killings but it is a thing people actually really fucking do say about gang rapings.     That is not to say that rape cannot be used in fiction but if it is used I think all of these reasons are good enough to show why someone doing that should use caution and address it seriously.  ,Fantasy,ddueemn,14,t5_2qknd

You wear the tshirt chew the gum got the shelf of collectables can list the Kings of Numenor from ArPharazon the Golden to Aragorn the Scruffy. But have you ever dared Fantasy?There is an old rock that serves as a rough chair.  Once it sat in Camelot. Arthurs knights called it The Siege Perilous meaning Dont Sit Here. In Andre Nortons Witch World a modern man has nothing to lose but dare the Siege Perilous. A brave man an exsoldier who never fit in OUR world. Same as you? Do you fit in? Do you read fantasy because our world makes you itch as though it were the wrong fit  the wrong cloth for the wrong form?Well the Siege Perilous sends you to the world where you belong.Consider that.

The place you have sought from Oz to Westeros in spaceships and riverrafts behind wardrobe doors and carnival masks.No going back! Sit in that chair and you are forever exiled from this world. And welcome to the world you belong in. A whole world for your mirror showing your real face. Colonel Simon Tregarth dares the Siege and finds himself on a shadowy moreland hearing the hunting horns in the distance feeling the threat of storm in the air. Hes come to an ancient world of magic facing strange threats. A world that needs a hero as much as the hero needs it.And all of Andre Nortons stories are just such a chair.

I regularly remember the gender of characters so I was wondering in this case how I could have gotten it wrong.  I looked back and at times for at least one stretch by chance no pronouns are used to refer to her. From page  to  no pronoun is used to refer to Sauce but her name is mentioned seven times.  As I have written code that would have failed at that point I mentioned it but of course I have higher standard for humans including myself.I mentioned that the original description may have confused me as I dont have a good visual image of a kirtle   Sauce was standing on the table in a red kirtle what laced up under her left arm  A kirtle to me is some kind of clothing thing from the middle ages just as a quillion or falchion is something to do with a sword.   It seems like weak evidence in hindsight.Looking at the book in hindsight it is weird that I did not recall her gender.  I dont doubt that.

10871231,0,t3_5v78w7,Oh we like loads of the same books Here is a link to all my most highly recommended books Recommended Reading I keep the list updated so its got everything that I think of as excellent. There are a few notable names missing as I try to wait until trilogiesseries are complete or at least close to it before I start on them.It is a pretty long list so here are a few top suggestions...  Adrian Tchaikovskys Shadows of the Apt series is awesome I would say it is the only long series I have ever read beginning to end and enjoyed throughout there isnt a sentence of filler in the whole ten books   Daniel Polanskys Low Town trilogy was awesome fast paced clever witty and very well written goes for all his books actually but that is a good place to start .  Brian McClellans Powder Mage trilogy and shorts was an outstanding read   Joe Abercrombies First Law books all  are action packed with a healthy serving of blood lust I also found them quite amusing   James Barclays Chronicles of the Raven trilogy and Legends of the Raven quartet    Mark Lawrences Broken Empire and Red Queens War  trilogies are outstandingly gritty and lusciously grim   Karen Millers Godspeaker trilogy.  Fiona McIntosh I would start with either Trinity or The Quickening trilogies.  Trudi Canavans Age of Five trilogy.  N. K. Jemisins Dreamblood duo.  C. S. Friedmans Coldfire trilogy.  John Gwynnes Faithful and the Fallen quartet. Enjoy ,Fantasy,de1ag73,1,t5_2qknd

10889036,0,t1_de33wb1,Oh god. Any of them really. The thing is theyre all quite different stories written from different perspectives by different people. It depends what youre in the mood for. Id probably wait a bit on Andrea Hairston and Kiini Ibura Salaams work unless youre super into genre bending stuff. Nisi Shawls stories have a bit of the genre bending feel but not as much.Black Tom is a nice little read that you can finish in a day. Likewise in length not genre Redemption in Indigo is a lovely little story thats pretty short and quite funny in places. It reads like an oral story which I liked.I recommend Jemisin for anything any place any time although be prepared to feel feelings. Imaro is good if youre into traditional heroic fantasy.Fifteen Dogs and A Stranger in Olondria are excellent if you want a more literary read. Sofia Samatars work is more on the fantasy side of literary while Andr Alexis is more literary with a side of fantasy.You could start anywhere with Octavia E.

Large world with different states that have different economies and histories. The magic is well developed and unique. Also the main character is fat and not sexy so that is cool. The series rides the line of the amount of acceptable plot twists which is awesome and does a good job of constantly blowing your mind without being too aggressive. Wheel of Time it is a common recomendation but in this case a good one because it is one of the best and biggest series in terms of large developed world that has a lot happening with a crazy magic system.Inda Magic is much less common and more mysterious but is replaced by politics and pirates. The first two books of this series have so much awesome stuff happening all over the map.

10976084,0,t3_5wpp7x,Theres no too small reason to stop reading a book. Most fiction is  just for entertainment so if you are not entertained why keep going? Everybody has different tastes.  WOR was one of my favorite fantasy novels but I understand why some people wouldnt like it.Part of the trouble with books is that they take a long time to read. Im one of the most prolific readers I know and I only read about a book a week. Its not like movies where people with some time on their hands can see every movie worth seeing ever. So people tend to read what is often recommended which means that those people start recommending too.Then add the fact that these threads have voting... so all the most popular stuff not only gets mentioned but also upvoted and discussed way more than more obscure things. Heres what I would do. Join Goodreads if you havent already look through the top rated reviews on a handful of your favorite books find reviews you agree with then you can look through those peoples ratings and reviews as well as compare books with your own profile to try to find some compatible readers. Then add those people as friends and youll see their activity as well as see their reviews first when you look at book pages.  Ive ended up with a fairly big list of friends most of whom Ive never met and rarely spoken to who I know have similar taste so when a handful of them all rate a book highly I trust that a lot more than the general average rating.It might also help if you just post something describing your favorite books and what you love about them as well as some books you didnt like and why and maybe you will get some specific recs.,Fantasy,dec4rkv,5,t5_2qknd

A rough outline  Most egregious offenders of a poor diet are sodas fast food candies alcohol and ice cream.   Cutting them out does a lot for you. Trans fats oils such as olive oil are better than saturated fats butterCrisco.  There are some your body requires but cannot produce on its own. Fish oil supplements can take care of that. Complex carbs wheat are preferable to simple carbs white and make sure not to consume too many carbs. Lean meats chickenturkey are preferable to red meats but if youre working out protein is protein. Fibers from veggies too.  And lastly drink plenty of water. I know this sounds like unhelpful common sense but it really helped me to realize that I didnt need to eat miserably everyday to get in shape.

11120278,0,t1_derxesb,Im just going to hide all of this behind a spoiler tag  just in cases The books are all about the build up. Its palpable  as the separate stories come together and you see each of the characters through the other characters eyes you get this feel of stuff happening. This is the thing I liked best about the books. The writing is great but there is a weighty feeling to events. This shit is all heavy but at the same time theres some hope that the characters arent as terrible as they tell themselves they are.At the same time theyre not as heavy  or as slow paced  as say Robin Hobbs Fitz books.  Then we get to the third book. This is what I didnt like the denouement that ends with the writer ostensibly saying haha I fooled you all this time things dont get better the world is terrible and it was all pointless all of it.  I dont mind that the characters are all terrible. I liked that. I liked that I had more sympathy for Dogman than for any of the mains. What I didnt like was the lack of any real story in the  odd pages Id just read because it was all for nothing.,Fantasy,desh3jp,2,t5_2qknd

The way they built their world all fantasy races were always among us but it was magic that made their differences skinny pointy ears cockney Games Workshop accents kick in. So less magic in the world eeveryone looks human. More magic all the variations come out. Its the environment causing the changes to express themselves. Sorta like melanin and sunlight actually.

11189810,0,t3_5zr21h,Im sure data could be collected to see if your theory holds true but I dont think so.Going only by those books you mentioned they all were big hits from book one. And while they will stay big hits with theyre next releases I believe they will have lost some readers during the long hiatus between. I think for the midlist author the more the better as often as you can while maintaining quality.  years between series books is acceptable any longer and you risk losing a lot of readers due to sheer forgetfulness.I like to anticipate but after a while unless the internet is shoving it down my throat I lose the anticipation. Like Ive waited so long that I dont mind waiting a little longer. And Ive stopped checking for updates so by the time I discover the new book is finally out it wont be a new release any more. And then I might need to go back and reread all the previous books first but I put that off because of what Im in the middle of right now. This is how many series get abandoned in the middle.I thought the latest thing in publishing was to release an entire trilogy in one year if possible. Like they did with the Southern Reach trilogy by Vandermeer. That way people who are really into it can snatch up book  while the story is still fresh and then they grab book  a few months later ditto. Keep the momentum going.Plenty of people nowadays wont even start a series until its done. Ive done my share of not finishing a series because I just forgot about it between books and Im not even talking about more than a year. I certainly wont be rushing out to buy the latest book of any of those three you mentioned and yes I have read both Rothfuss books and all the released Ice and Fire Locke Lamora didnt grab me with book  So my gut says your theory doesnt pan out.,Fantasy,df0co9i,7,t5_2qknd

These were the ones that I struggled to find a book for and ended up very happy with. Both Additionally First Wrong Impressions was an excellent Pride and Prejudice remake thanks to  uKristaDBall for posting about how controvesial this book was. I wouldnt have found it otherwise  . The Traitor Baru Cormarant and The Fifth Season tie for my tear out my heart awards for compelling characters in shitty situations that I just couldnt put down. Angels Blood was a fun read complete with all the tropes I associate with the genre but enjoyable characters though I admit to enjoying Alphaholes when they are complemented by bullheaded female leads.Least favorite booksI finished a few books I otherwise wouldnt have and only tolerated a few books on this list for completionist reasons. Spin is the worst offender. For a book that seems to be trying to position itself as hard scifi it gets the science egregiously wrong in a few places. On top of that it read as a traditional nongenre romance complete with unworthy man and MPDG woman. If I hadnt gotten it for free and if it wasnt filling out a slot I would probably have thrown it across the room about halfway through The Copper Promise is a book that I couldnt tell you why I didnt like it but it found it incredibly boring. I had the sense that I was reading a DampD campaign where all the PCs went in separate directions and refused to work together and the DM was trying to salvage something out of her uncooperative players. Lastly The Mirror Empire is a book that I wanted to like but just didnt resonate with me. I didnt like the characters and I wasnt that impressed with the world. Having read and had the same feeling about Gods War I think I just have to accept that Im just not a fan of Kameron Hurley.,Fantasy,df5ljfy,3,t5_2qknd

11249566,0,t1_df6fvws,Sanderson may be prolific  well he definitely is  but he writes very easy to read books. He has also gotten better from book to book in my opinion. The Stormlight Archive has amazing world building good characters and a good story so far  and I expect it to only get better. Discovering the mysteries of Roshars magic system and regional culture along with the caracters has been very satisfying to me. Dont expect the depth and multitude of characters like in LotR or the Malazan series or ASoIaF  but beyond that it is solid toplevel fantasy. Much more thoughtthrough than many books which are considered good or classic fantasy.There are obviously people who had trouble getting through the book so this is just my opinion.

11258581,0,t3_60neku,The First Chronicle of Thomas Covenant. It may make you want to throw it in a river but at least you will have something great to read while you are drying off.Its a good series from multiple angles. For one it tells a novel story arc compared to most other fantasy books. Most books follow an arc of growth this one follows an arc of destruction. Most book the main character is building up towards something becoming better stronger more skilled more noble or more productively ignoble. This book is the opposite it is a man whose life is falling apart and rather then rise to the challenge like you will find in some fantasy books it rather takes a look at a fantasy hero who isnt all together and rather is completely crumbling under the unreasonable weight a fantasy book puts on its protagonist. In that light it is both unique and novel pun not intended but also very easy to relate to.It was written in many ways as a response to LotR and Narnia and it shows in many aspects of it. It at its heart is a deconstruction of those tropes and explores small flaws rather then grand virtues. While flawed heroes are nothing new the use of small flaws I would argue is relatively unique. Most books featuring flaws use a more grandiose approach. They choose flaws and portray them in such a way to make a character more then he would of been otherwise. This while it can be entertaining does not make for very relatable flaws in those characters however. Covenant as a character is flawed in the small petty ways that lessen a person and in that way they are flaws that are extremely relatable. He is a character lessened by the flaws he is struggling with and being crushed by both those flaws and the unrealistic nature of fantasy writing that is being deconstructed by those books. This makes for a very personal character driven story even though the events of that character driven story is taking place in what otherwise would be an epic setting. That contrast the unique character arc the relatable flaws and the ultimately small personal goals of the character amid the greater goal of the world makes it one of he best character explorations in fantasy that has ever been written in my opinion. ,Fantasy,df8562y,9,t5_2qknd

I stopped going to the doctors because I felt it was only making things worse so I never got properly diagonosed. Because of this I cant really speak in specifics but I know that I was mentally ill in some fashion.During this time the Realm of the Elderlings books by Robin Hobb got me through. I related to Fitz so damn much because it seemed that he was going through the same mental shit that I was. Other characters like Paragon or Kennit were similarly damaged but I didnt relate to them the same. I dont know if Hobb intended to have Fitzs mental state to resemble a form of mental illness but it was pretty damn close to my own at some points. I dont know if I was projecting and honestly maybe I was. All I know is that Fitz helped drag me out of some seriously shitty stuff and that it was because my fuckedup possiblydepressed self related so strongly with him.,Fantasy,dfddd8o,25,t5_2qknd

11308397,0,t3_61ctfc,Looking back I really do appreciate how unique and eccentric the Engineers Trilogy was right down to the  page description of falconry and the entire chapter about the life story of a random enemy mook.  But like OP says the best thing is the rather unique and highly cynical approach to Love in the theme of the trilogy.  Below are my two favorite quotes about itgt Love is a confidence trick thats all. Its Natures way of suckering a mammal with a brain and a long vulnerable gestation period into reproducing. Humans can think so ordinary animalgrade maternal instinct wouldnt be enough to make human women go through all that not if they stopped and thought about whats involved. So you have love. Its a substitute for rational thought look at it that way its the complete antithesis of what being humans all about. Humans can make choices its what makes them unique. Love takes all your choices away and there you suddenly are. Worse still love inevitably leads to the worst pain of all when you lose the people you love.gt She didnt say anything and when she kissed him it was like the scary stories his grandmother used to tell about the foxes who could turn into women and who stole mens souls through their mouths. And he remembered thinking at that moment this is what love is its the constant demands give me money give me food give me happiness keep me alive and the incessant taking taking and taking away until theres nothing left but you keep on because theres no alternative because you have no choice.,Fantasy,dfdsfsn,5,t5_2qknd
11312020,0,t3_61fpwg,It sounds like urban fantasy may be a hit for her. A goodeasy entry point would be for her to read the Southern Vampire Mysteries by Charlaine Harris that were the basis for True Blood. The books are vastly different than the show season one was closeish but its a very different journey. Kresley Cole might be a perfect fit if you want to go with something fresh. Her Immortals After Dark series has a seriously snappy plot great character development and brings the high heat level. The series has gotten better and better over time as most series with complex worldbuilding do but definitely a good one. Bonus points If she wants to do the audio books while at work the audio of this series is one of my favorites. Narrated by Robert Petkoff. Karina Coopers who writes SFF as K.C. Alexander Dark Mission series might be a good fit. Its essentially category romance tropes with a great magicworldbuilding layer. Big problemsmystery to solve but also the sexytimes. She may enjoy Nalini Singhs Guild Hunter novels. Theyre urban fantasy with a strong romance subplot. First book is Angels Kiss.Jeaniene Frosts Night Huntress books start off as UF and transition to paranormal romance as the series continues. Vampires ghouls ghosts etc. and a halfvampire who slays and sometimes loves them. Theres a chapter from the second book that gets referenced FREQUENTLY in romance communities.

11347544,0,t1_dfhv4qp,The thing is details like skin colour gender and sexuality among other things arent superfluous details to a lot of people. Those things are fairly large in the way that someone defines themselves and in the way their personalities are shaped particularly when the majority of media you consume dont have characters with those same commonalities in them. You can find commonalities with anyone if you try hard enough but I think the point he is trying to make that fiction should mirror the diversity of real life. Im not sure what kind of fiction you tend to read but there is a huge lack of diversity in terms of gender sexuality and race in genre fiction and growing up a gay teen I found that frustrating.  Most of the gay characters I saw growing up were huge stereotypes which led to people tarring me with the same brush. That was painful I never felt like a stereotype but I felt pressure to be like one. In the books I read there were barely any characters who happened to be gay. The only gay fiction I ever really saw was around the subject of being gay. I was talking to a friend of mine the other day whos Asian and we were having a similar conversation. He was saying that he finds it harder to connect with certain genres because the lack of diversity reminds him of how under represented he is. I had never thought of it before because as a white dude its easier for me to identify with a white character of which there are a majority.  I tried to think about how annoying it would be if  percent of the books movies and tv I watched were mostly full of another single race that wasnt my own and I honestly would find it harder to connect to he characters. Thats just the way a lot of people think. You identify more closely with something because you have more in common with it.You may not feel like there is a lack of diversity but its true that a lot of people do feel that way usually the people who are feeling under represented. I think Myke Cole is really cool for speaking about this kind of stuff and I really hope some people can get more enjoyment out of his books because of it. ,Fantasy,dfi826p,12,t5_2qknd

11402163,0,t1_dfodacp,And a few thoughts on some of the readsWhile I didnt love Kafka on the Shore it still piqued my interest in maybe trying another book by Murakami or in the magic realism genre. Reflecting on my actions of  minutes ago I probably should have put A Court of Mist and Fury instead of Thorns and Roses because I liked the sequel far better and want to comment on how Im basically embarrassed by how much I enjoyed it. The first book was okay. I thought the magic was cool in Alchemists of Loom as the dragons different magic abilities are tied to specific body parts and some of the muggles of the world have experimented with surgical procedures to create chimeras and obtain magic themselves.Ghost Talkers is one I normally wouldnt pick up but when it came up as the goodreads book of the month and I still needed a dedicated wild ginger I decided to give it a go. It was a fun concept and I really enjoyed the story.Overall Ive really enjoyed picking up some short stories and think I want to create a new goal for myself to read them more regularly. A Thousand Nights was a book lying around on my kindle from when it must have been on sale and I went ooo pretty cover sure Ill why not. I enjoyed it way more than I was expecting! I love the storytelling way it was written.I just finished The Traitor Baru Cormorant probably an hour ago so definitely still have some strong lingering feelings from that one.Senlin Ascends was definitely talked about a lot here this year and I agree with all the raves.

Still I intend to do so  Feel free to omit any of them but I would be delighted to hear your thoughts on most of them and hopefully at least some other redditoros might be interested in your answers. I always read every single AMA backwards and forwards and find them inspiring.     Anyway  Im way behind with your work. Ive read Prince of Thorns year ago and just yesterday I finished King of Thorns and started Emperor of Thorns. I guess this AMA should be focused more on your newest works but I dont know them yet.      On the other hand I regularly follow your blog and as many other people owe you introduction to other great books and series  Josiah Bancrofts Books of Babel or Phil Tuckers Path of Flames to name just two.Lets get to the questions.     As a stationery products geek I always ask if the author is fully digitalized are you? Do you sometimes use analogue tools to outline  write stories?   Has the sheer brutality in some parts of your books earned you any angry readers? Do you have any anecdotes about crazy readers? I know I was disturbed by Justice scene. Spoiler s Kill all the people that you want decapitate them if you fancy but leave animals be!   As a reader what kind of books or stories do you enjoy? Did the way you see other authors books change since you started writing novels? What are you currently reading?   I read somewhere that you dont plan ahead that much at all and are led mainly by the story and characters.  It seems it works well as your stories are engaging. Have you ever wished you had planned a story more in advance?    Do you have any writing quirks?   Does writing energizes or exhaust you?   Youve been involved in the industry for some time. Can you tell what is in your opinionexperience most unethical thing in publishing industry?  Thank you for doing this AMA and interacting us,Fantasy,dfv4bkc,1,t5_2qknd

TAke Iron Man  from all the trailers it looked like Tony was actually going to be having serious problems and I would have loved them to explore that angle more. Tell a more personal human story kinda like FOX did with Logan. Really shove the suit to the side and get into his character. Another movie they hinted at real problems with was Dr. Strange they really needed to get into his drive his fear of failure and death.Some of the most interesting scenes from Avengers were those deleted scenes of Cap struggling with being a man out of time struggling with wanting to reach out to Peggy seeing all the files of his friends that had passed on.

I hated it.There were plenty of reasons unique to me as a reader but the one that I think is endemic in the modern fantasy genre is that the deities felt like they were included just for fan servicemyth nerds. They didnt feel necessary to the plot and worse they were boring. Not sure how you do that with the Tuatha De Danann but the author managed.For me the gold standard for pagan gods in modern fantasy stories is always going to be American Gods. With that as the high bar I dont even bother with books that dont come close to that level of characterization and unique twist on established legend.,Fantasy,dg8kgsp,7,t5_2qknd

I went in thinking nothing was wrong with my vision and that I just needed a routine exam. Turns out I have astigmatism. No wonder things are slightly fuzzy at a distance now that I think about it. Book wise I have a large large pile of library books Im trying to read before the move. Ill have to read very fast but it should be doable. This past week I finished up the following Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie. I know Im late to the party but where has this been all my life? I loved it and it really reminded me of Ninefox Gambit in how it dropped you in the middle of the action without an explanation. One Hundred Nights of Hero by Isabel Greenberg. An enjoyable graphic novel but I have mixed feelings like I always do about retellings. Maleficium by Martine Desjardines. Pretty sure this counts for new weird even though I still dont understand the definition because it was pretty weird. Its told as the writings of a Catholic priest writing down confessions he heard and is this magical sinful mash up of orientalism magic demons lust pride desire vanity and hubris.For the weekend Im reading The Winged Histories by Sofia Samatar Invisible Planets edited by Ken Liu and will probably start up The Stars Are Legion by Kameron Hurley because I cant handle it staring at me from the shelf any longer.,Fantasy,dg97xdi,1,t5_2qknd

Im also playing Mass Effect Andromeda and its...kind of boring? Maybe Im getting too caught up in the minutiae of it all the same thing happened in the last Dragon Age game. I spent too long doing side quests and was burnt out by the time I started any plot related missions but Im not feeling compelled to play it much. The combat is fun though. I went to the midnight pm showing of The Fate of The Furious last night and it was magical. Not as good as some of the others but pretty darn fun all the same.

11652871,0,t1_dggsqdu,I mean not to spoil the later books too much but actually yes in this case it can in action if not in internal morality. The reason for the stretching is that ultimately most of the Aes Sedai see the Oaths as a necessary burden because theyre already so mistrusted that if they didnt adhere to them no one would want to see them. Now at least people know that an Aes Sedai isnt going to show up at Court and murder an entire royal bloodline if she doesnt get her way.The Oaths are simple and have tons of loopholes for a reason the Aes Sedai want the other powerful people of the world to be assuaged and not have to worry about their own personal safety and wellbeing while still leaving the Aes Sedai enough room to play politics. The Oaths are broad enough to cover the important things most people worry about but are specifically designed to give the Aes Sedai enough wriggle room so that if theyre smart they can get what they want done anyway.,Fantasy,dggv8hr,2,t5_2qknd

All illiterate nomadic barbarians from the same place who fought in the same way. All totally beyond what the civilized people could handle.Before guns came about warrior cultures simply dominated.

If you want to go beyond horse archers we could talk about Japans domination of the far more populous and advanced China.

11725416,0,t1_dgp2s5i,Interesting. I personally would argue that a large number of younger fantasy readers were introduced to these types of books by first seeing movies like Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings. I definitely do not doubt that these series were immensely popular before their adaptions. So that assumption would be incorrect. But I know several including myself that only started reading fantasy because of movies like The Lord of the Rings. My belief is not that these series success relies upon their film adaptations but rather that their original book forms became even more popular after being adapted largely due to introducing new readers to the world of fantasy. So naturally that would lead to these series popularity being inflated above that of most other series without film adaptions. Despite that these wonderful books still have pulled above the rest and I find that impressive. Edit The to to in the second sentence. ,Fantasy,dgp3u8l,1,t5_2qknd

I absolutely loved it and felt like Ken Liu did a great job of taking the plot in what seemed like the natural direction after The Grace of Kings while still throwing in all sorts of unexpected events. Some of the things the author comes up with are honestly the most inventive ideas Ive read. As much as I loved Kuni Garu and Mata Zyndu in the first book I also felt like the characters in the sequel were way stronger and more interesting. Cant wait for news about Book . Im also listening to the audiobook of Red Sister right now and have about an hour left so I should finish that on my commute home. This is probably my favorite Mark Lawrence book so far. Ill have to synthesize my thoughts a bit after I finish but I found the characters and their interactions to be the strongest part of the book. I grew attached to all of the novices and am looking forward to reading more about them in the next two books.

In which case it indeed would not count.,Fantasy,dguhpe2,2,t5_2qknd

11782099,0,t1_dgvivts,I prefer just having one wellstocked library. Easier to plan your reading renewals are easier plus my library has no real browsability. If you know you want a book you can place the order but all youre really going to find except the YA section which is pretty good are bestselling thrillers and romances.  ,Fantasy,dgvjex4,1,t5_2qknd

11784494,0,t1_dgvgpnx,Thanks for the explanation.Is there a particular book you are curious about?Ive done plenty of drooling on the digital window in the past but Golden Age is one of the first Ive been able to really consider.The difference between the leather and clothbound editions of the Fifth Season will be the traycase.On that note are limited editions generally cloth bound whether or not they are labeled as such?,Fantasy,dgvt7ek,2,t5_2qknd

11787469,0,t3_68628a,I get a bunch of recommendations go to a library andor download previews of everything I can and read about  pages of each. If it doesnt hook me I ditch it.  I start on the book that interested me the most.I realize that this means I may miss out on some books with slow starts but I already have only limited time to read anyway. I just cant justify investing in something that isnt interesting enough to me to keep me reading for at least the very beginning. Its always worked out well for me Ive never completed a book this way without enjoying it as I have plenty of times based on internet recommendations.,Fantasy,dgw5dfa,1,t5_2qknd

11800976,0,t1_dgwiggo,The first fourth and fifth books are more weird west. The rest run along a more varied path of mixed genres mostly scifi fantasy with elements of horror and a good dash of postapocalypse. The comics at least the first  or  volumes take place before the books except for the first volume which is mostly a retelling of most of book  since its a flashback story.,Fantasy,dgxojml,2,t5_2qknd

11806949,0,t1_dgyc05e,Yeah theres definitely a bit of a step down in Meyers Magic . series. I enjoyed Spell or High Water but I can certainly see how somebody else wouldnt  and if you didnt like it skipping An Unwelcome Quest is definitely a good idea.,Fantasy,dgycwtd,2,t5_2qknd
11807776,0,t1_dgy372h,Its OK. You understand so little that youre not really invested in anything. OK so these people suspect they are being betrayed due to... well I cant even remember why but they suspect it. Why should we care? This guy has a big sword and is making a deal with people in a city who appear to be betraying other people in the city. Is that good? I dont know because I dont know who any of the people in the city are their relations to each other or what they do. Now these two guys are going to do wake up a spooky thing. Sounds spooky but why should I care since not only do I not know what it will do even if I did I dont know anything about what it might destroy or help in order to assess whether what it might do which I still dont know is good bad cool interesting dangerous or anything.Readers often like it when characters are not blackandwhite goodorevil  and I am such a reader. This feels a bit like a weird attempt to have such characters but where instead of giving them tangible reasons to be conflicted about supporting or disliking them youre just given no information at all.,Fantasy,dgygald,1,t5_2qknd

Barathol and Chaur also have a special place in my heart. But with the way this series is Im afraid for Chaur  hes so sweet and innocent that I hate being so attached to him.

11810558,0,t1_dgyqorr,My understanding is that while significant parts of the story had been preplotted as part of Erikson and Esselmonts role playing campaign the actual prose story had not been drafted until after the sale of Gardens of the Moon. And Erikson has talked about how little editing he does which honestly only makes the quality of his work all the more impressive. ,Fantasy,dgyrngw,14,t5_2qknd
