173253,0,t1_ceuys0s,I really have. And the character doesnt bother me so much when hes not cursing every other word. But  of the time his cursing comes across as a twelve year old who just heard some curse words through the door of his dads poker game and then the kid starts swearing out of context and nonsensically. In other words his cursing lacks style and makes him seem ridiculous. I understand what Kirkman was going for when he made the style of the character. But I just think it didnt work. Yes hes more violent has more men weapons and is more dangerous. But he consistently takes me out of the story with his dialogue and makes me think about what Kirkman was thinking when he wrote a character who says things like What the fuckety fuck fuckin fuck you fucking fuck! Its not cool or badass. Actually I find it embarassing to read how bad Kirkmans writing gets in those moments. ,thewalkingdead,cey5ztj,1,t5_2rygv

360724,0,t1_cfi3p6f,gt And I agree that in this world  isnt wrong especially when you have someone as emotionally immature as Daryl I think it would be doing Carol a disservice to pair her with him. Hes just not emotionally mature enough for her. But part of their development in S is that while he gives her hope regarding Sophia she gives him strength to keep going and keep doing good.  The cherokee rose flower is undeniably romantic.  When Sophia dies Carol makes sure he doesnt retreat away from the group and go back to his old self  and it works.  She and Rick get through to him.  By S she was blatantly flirting with him and they were constantly separating themselves from the group to have discussions together.  Im sure you remember his emotion as he psyched himself up to open that prison tomb door thinking she was dead behind it.  Also when Daryl leaves with Merle the others ask What do we tell Carol? and Carol is extremely upset when she finds out but fully understands his reasoning.  Its fully established that these two know each other well enough to understand and process each others reactionsdecisions.  This is a key component of bringing two characters together.  Another perfect example is Rick and Michonne.  Michonne just gets him has ways of relating to him and therefore he is softer towards her.  Their stories are intertwined and they develop via each other.Your interpretation is very jarring considering the last scene before the prison was invaded was Daryl reeling at the news of Carol being exiled and defending her innocence That aint her!.  You know he has to care a LOT about someone to snarl in Ricks face.   Reedus has said theres more tension to come between him and Rick due to Carol.  So the issue is in no way over.If they were going there with Bethyl they would not have him insult her fathers outlook mere hours after his death they would find common ground and he wouldve comforted her as she cried.  If they dont even script a perfect moment for establishing romance how are they compatible?  ,thewalkingdead,cfi5lat,-1,t5_2rygv

412767,0,t3_1yrig7,To me it looked like an older sister who killed the rest of the family. IIRC there were two children and two adults on the beds but the girl in the chair looked fairly young herself. So my initial assumption was that the family decided to kill themselves the oldest daughter stepped up to do the deed out of a sense of responsibility but after her family was dead the gravity of what she did hits her and she loses it defaces the painting which was maybe a portrait of her mother and eventually offs herself. The painting being wrapped and propped against the door is really weird its not so easy to figure that out. Could just be a product of a shattered mental state maybe the daughter propped it up as a sign of whats inside the room and covered it out of guilt. The fact that its so strange makes me think it happened between shooting the family and shooting herself.

487582,0,t1_cfvk8fx,Theyve only just begun to do what they can with Beth. I think it would be pretty shitty writing to kill her off next episode. It would be too obvious. I dont think we can use past deaths as justification for postGimple deaths. Him and the producers have all said that theyve changed how they kill people and so far theres proof of that. So far theyve only killed Hershel. It was a death that affected every single character advanced the plot and killed the audience. The audience has only JUST begun to care about Beth with this last episode. It would be needless unless they were trying to push Daryl into becoming a villain and Scott Gimple has proven he doesnt do needless deaths otherwise he would have killed Sasha during the flu arc etc.. I think Carol is past the point where she could be a guiding light for Daryl. Shes killed innocent people and is full of too much darkness now. If Beth dies anytime soon so does Daryls goodness. But hey maybe they ARE planning on making Daryl a baddie. ETA Daryl is already emotionally traumatized. I mean he cried in the last episode after reverting back to his old self. Emotionally traumatizing him further  literally taking away the last bit of hope he has  could only serve two purposes suicide or he becomes bad. I doubt theyll go either route with his character. ,thewalkingdead,cfvowux,6,t5_2rygv

514267,0,t3_200fr5,Zombie bites are not necessarily fatal because of the zombie pathogen but rather the unsanitary nature of their mouths due to diet and decomposition. Scratches cause similar infections for similar reasons. Their mouths and saliva often contain several septic factors specifically the bacteria E. coli Staphylococcus sp. Providencia sp. Proteus morgani P. mirabilis and multocida. The rapid growth of these bacteria tends to cause extremely virulent strains that are highly resistant to antibiotics and most often lethal. It can be assumed however that an undetermined number of original outbreak cases involved recentlyreanimated zombies that were relatively intact and clean. This could indicate that the active form of the virus does in fact play a part in the attack on the victims system perhaps by rapidly wiping out immunity cells which would allow for even weak infections to be deadly.,thewalkingdead,cfyq4gq,3,t5_2rygv

557241,0,t3_20ipcj,There is a LOT of divergence particularly when it comes to who lives and dies. Season  has actually followed the comics more closely than any other season because of a new showrunner who appreciates the source material a bit more than the last one. However he Scott Gimple has stated that there will still be plenty of differences. Robert Kirkman is actually the biggest supporter of change. If youre asking about future divergence Id say its anyones guess at this point. Ive kind of got the feeling Glenn is going to kick the bucket before Negan is introduced but thats probably just me.

From the way Mika tries to employ coping strategies count and look at the flowers I can guess that Lizzie was probably ill before the zombies showed up. Without medication or trained professionals there wasnt much they could do for her. If they could it would take time to get her into a safe place mentally and she could kill again before then. Between ditching her to get eaten alive and shooting her quickly The latter would have been less painful.I find this episode so heartbreaking because Lizzie didnt understand that what she was doing was wrong. She strongly believed that the walkers were still good people and couldnt fathom why others couldnt see what was obvious. She was mentally ill she didnt deserve her fate.,thewalkingdead,cg4gei1,3,t5_2rygv

And the fact that Shane cared so little about Otis and killed him in coldblood is all the darker to me because Shane was once a respected and normal human being.

570855,0,t3_20o5jd,Ok I think I hear what you are saying but I think there are  reasons for this .   those problems exist in many basic television dramas. They arent picking up cinema writers or premium cable writers. Theres already a ceiling in how well they can do. I love watching college football for instance but even with all the quality is still not the same as the NFL .  despite deviation and remixing writers are still working from source material. Kirkam  is a talented comic writer but somethings translate differently when adapted for screen. I think that is often the case with TWD often the adapted graphic novel direct dialogue is...well graphic novel worthy.  burgeoning actors. Same critique of the writers also applies to the actors. I think some of the actors are great some have gotten better overtime and some remind me Im watching basic cable. Particularly the child actors I think have been difficult to handle some of the scenes they are in. Chandler has gotten a ton better over the years however the girl that played Lizzie was great at moments and unbelievable in others crying for example I think this only amplifies the problem you write about. All things consider with these limitations I still enjoy the show the actors and the writing.

That facility looks large enough to have a pig pen in one of the buildings. Canned food is a premium option so no reason to offer that to newcomers but they could be breeding animals easily.

If there was a female antagonist she wouldnt be breaking down ricks door with a damn tank.  She wouldve worked her way into trust  then betrayed the group.  Or I dunno tank works too I guess  but seriously  the Governor must have been retarded to surprise Rick let alone surprise Rick like that.

895196,0,t1_ch5vt3r,D.C. is not the one logical place to go at all. First you have the distance and danger inherent in getting to D.C. from Georgia in a world where any given road might be blockaded by a massive traffic accident collapsed bridge or wandering horde of zombies. Second they have no indication that there is any government left to save them. s They went to the CDC headquarters in the first season and the lone survivor there confirmed he hadnt heard anything from anyone in weeks or maybe longer. And in the third season I think the Governor found a small detachment of soldiers that had been operating independently for some time.Third and most importantly D.C. itself is likely a death trap. Its a city with millions and millions of inhabitants. If even a fraction of those millions are now walkers theyd be dealing with a literal necropolis a city teeming with undead mobbing the streets filling the buildings making even shortdistance travel a death sentence. The fact of the matter is that if civilization collapses just trying to stay alive day to day is plot enough. edit fixed for spoilers.,thewalkingdead,ch61dmp,3,t5_2rygv

1516784,0,t3_2bjx2y,Someone posted a theory that depending on your choice with Rebecca different people will get shot and Im supporting that and I think Luke gets shot if you shoot Rebecca and Kenny gets shot if he shoots her. And then later on after escaping you have to either decide between them somehow.Take this as an example ClemKenny shoots Rebecca and as everything happens Luke gets shot because he was distracted by Rebecca dyingKenny gets shot because shoots Rebecca. After the dust settles and the Russians are dead everyone is panicking and LukeKenny needs medical attention. KennyLuke says that they wont be able to save him and says they should just put him out of his misery and move on. Then you get to decide to save him or not. If you choose not to save him you just shoot him and move on. If you choose to save him you guys looks for medicine but when you find them a herd of walkers appears and KennyLuke ends up dying.And Im hoping Bonnie and Mike get out of it relatively unharmed.tldr Kenny or Luke get shot depending on your choice with Rebecca and then you get the choice to save whoever was shot which results in the other ones death.,thewalkingdead,cj6elw5,5,t5_2rygv

1529793,0,t1_cj7sm5c,you see thats a great theory but the only problem i have is f If the scene with them being lined up and them begging to take the dude to DC is somewhat right after they get catured they showed the swinging at glenns head to be in that scene. I think the showrunners are just trying to fuck with the comic readers minds because glenn clearly appears in a bunch of scenes that are way after that first scenes when they first get caught and are on their way to DC. He probably begins to swing to intimidate them or just tries to and rick yells stop or something. so thats my theory as to why hes safe for now GOT S SPOILERSGame of thrones S book ?c Besides you know that the comic readers want to see the show be more accurate to the comics and glenns death will hurt deep for refrence check out the viper vs the mountain from GOT pain is timeless new and old,thewalkingdead,cj81buf,2,t5_2rygv

He also encountered the claimers he ended up fighting against them when he found out theyre trying to kill Rick and his old group. I dont think hell leave them again since he actually likes them.It would be kinda cool to see his spinoff group but the one thing I wouldnt like is him leaving lol.

He didnt even give her an opportunity to explain herself just assumed the worst in a fit of rage.

1965346,0,t1_ckprobs,Well... That is still kind of dicey really. I mean Im sure youve heard the comics are different enough to keep you from guessing how something is going to happen but it does spoil roughly whats to come.But a big part of Carl is his age. In the comics hes younger and unlike the show where there is this big drag of his character for the first two seasons comic Carl starts out pretty much from the beginning growing and developing. Making him likable much faster since hes never quite annoying just a confused kid. And the scene this image shows DOES happen in the comic but Carl is about eight instead of  so it lends itself to be more sympathetic. In the show its easy to write it off as angst because hes a teenager but in the comic its nothing but heartbreaking that an  year old could display such cruel and hopeless cynicism.Carl is a character I truly think gets better and better but his much more rapid aging in the show does really fuck up what are supposed to be a lot of defining moments for his character.,thewalkingdead,ckq0xlc,5,t5_2rygv

You even see the childrens toys in the one scene which also fits alongside the hunters story of them eating their own children before they moved onto adults.  I would almost bet that it will be later explained that there was a food shortage at Terminus and they started slaughtering their prisoners because all the people that could actually hunt were killed off in the rape raid.

Shane is still one of my favorite characters and his shadow will be there throughout the whole show much more than his comic version. If he never died rick and daryl wouldnt have gotten as close. If there was no daryl tyreese might be more like his comic version.

Sorry I just dont see any evidence of that this episode even if they were hungry and short on supplies. When Rick asks Carl and Michonne how hungry they are on a scale of  in . A and they each give answers way over  yeah then I know how hungry the characters are possibly on the brink of starvation.When Daryl has  squirrels  thats hyperbole folks  and I dont know how many squirrels they already ate the night before in camp AND none of the characters discusses this risk starve vs that risk sanitation I just dont see it.

There is no hope for this generation but they come to realize those born after the zombie apocalypse do not have the virus in them placental protection or something like that.  It is that hope for the future that keeps them going from surviving to thriving.Part of what separates the comic from the show.  There is still this glimmer of humanity at its best.  Life doesnt have to be as nihilistic as it seems.  Show will end on some note like that.  Maybe not a happy ending per se but not a grim one.  There is always hope.  ,thewalkingdead,cliv5kp,18,t5_2rygv

The group finds a place with enough decent people to establish a safe haven. Rick dies from an injury though knowing that he has led his friends and especially his son to safety. It is revealed in the end that there are other civilization hubs around the world.Fast forward ten years into the future we see Carl who is now a leader riding through a now empty Mad Maxstyle country probably doing a regular scouting routine. Most zombies are either gone or to weak to be a threat and the civilization hubs around the glove are slowly growing in size and keeping contact. However since most people have died during the zombieapocalypse survival of mankind is still uncertain especially since various factions are now fighting for dominance in an empty world but thats a story for a different show that might look more like The Road.Darker version Same as above but it is revealed that there are too few people left to allow mankind to prosper again. The group are among the last people who see the rest of mankind slowly wither away.

Even in real life getting bit by a person or animal can give you pretty nasty infections its not like getting sneezed on. I knew someone who got bit by a cat down to the bone and had to rush to the ER because they could see the infection spreading quickly. And this was someones pet cat not a rancid reanimated corpse. Usually the issue is that you have a wound and if you dont clean it it can get an infection. If your wound is a bite theres lots of nasty bacteria in there to begin with.

Hes one of the strongest characters on the show. gtBut Gimple recognized what David Simon saw years ago when he was casting the crucial part of Cutty on The Wire Colemans eyes arent just windows into his soul  theyre distress calls. Theres a gentleness and ambivalence to Coleman that belies his size. Gimple has smartly written Tyreese in the direction of that contradiction. While his sister Sasha the excellent fiery Sonequa MartinGreen throws herself into battle with bloodthirsty gusto Tyreese prefers to hang back maintaining the fragile peace between the survivors caring for baby Judith.

I liked the last episode more on a second viewing but I thought was the worst episode in quite some time mostly due to the writing not to mention how dark everything was. The only good thing to come of it was that the Eugene plot is finally exposed it worked much better in the comics to think that maybe he actually did know of a cure but on the show I kept repeatedly rolling my eyes any time he said it was classified or Abe started beating his chest about saving the world.

2351120,0,t1_cm2a2ua,Right but saying Andreas a bitch when fictional characters dont decide how they act is so illogical.  How we like characters depends on how theyre presented to us.  Andrea was presented illogically as were most of the women in S and S.  Either Darabont or Mazzara or Kirkman or all damn three of them at once were sexist as hell and relied on weak stereotypes or just made the women fuck something up if there needed to be conflict.  The only ones to blame are them and their writers for expecting modern audiences to accept wimminz are stupid! writing.  But if we say stuff like Andrea is a stupid bitch we are buying into the crap they served us.  Why do you think Kirkman and a number of female staff have done significant press detailing how theyve improved on their writing of the women?  Because they saw what even a little bit of effort did for Carol Maggie Michonne Beth.  We need to be constructively criticizing the writers so they dont serve up second rate bullshit not throw rocks at a fictional being who cant respond or change anything. ,thewalkingdead,cm2b4ur,0,t5_2rygv

2371689,0,t3_2mjfeb,Carols always messing around with Daryl. I didnt think anything more of it than that. I know theres a lot of speculation going on about his sexuality but Kirkmans said that if there comes a time when things slow down and he isnt busy crossbowing then theyd deal with it. That time obviously hasnt come yet.  Sure they could be dropping subtle hints along the way.. Kirkman seems to know what hes gonna do for Daryls character but people seem to be all over Daryls sexuality and love interests. First it was about him and Carol then him and Beth now were on him being gay. Id personally just have Daryl be Daryl.. no relationships no loveinterests.. I think Daryls just fine on his own.  Daryl hasnt embraced Carol and knocked boots with her but theres a reason for that. Norman Reedus said he plays Daryl as someone whos not used to it.. someone whos not used to the affection to having closefriends and people he can trust and rely on. This is still new to him so hes not really sure what to make of it or how to deal with it. Not because hes gay but because of his past. The way he was raised.. he had a mom who didnt care a dad who abused him and a brother who was anything but a brother so he never got that affection. He also said that if Daryl were to enter some sort of relationship he wouldnt want it to happen sporadically hed want time to make it work and hed want time to develop it. Itd be that boy meets girl its awkward and they dont really know what to make of it thing where over time they get to know each other and get closer develop feelings etc. and I dont think were there yet for Daryl.. but like I said above.. personally I just like Daryl on his own.,thewalkingdead,cm4ukl8,1,t5_2rygv

So many times you are stuck in horribly tense and dangerous situations without someone making a dumbass decision to get there.

First half of S is probably the shows high point so far but the second half is useless.  S is uneven overall but it becomes much better as it develops.  S so far is...eh Im undecided as Ive only liked  episodes out of  so far.  The comic and show have never shied away from the fact that they are character studies first and a show set in the apocalypse second so what the characters are experiencing and feeling are always going to be the primary focus of pretty much every episode.

If he doesnt make it back he knows she can take care of them and that Carls respect and love for her will help him move on from the loss if Rick were to die.He may not want to be a dictator but you can see that hes basically offended by being criticized or trumped.  You saw it in his face when they went with the hostage plan and when Daryl told him to not kill the bearsized cop.  Its as if he can taste the disrespect.If everybody wants to do it another way but its the wrong way then theres an issue.  Its not like choosing Italian or Chinese where either way everyone eats.  Its dead or not dead or saved Carol n Beth or saved no one.  High stakes.   ,thewalkingdead,cmc5453,3,t5_2rygv

2482768,0,t3_2nz4kr,The thing about a person getting shot in the head immediately after doing something is that they arent alive anymore to explain their actions. Maybe Beth had some reason for stabbing Dawn. Maybe she acted out of adrenaline and rage. We dont know and well never find out but in the end her actions led to the death of Dawn and Noahs freedom. Regardless of intent her death was not in vain. Personally I think she wanted Dawn to act out like you said but not so she could reveal herself. If Beth had stabbed Dawn in the neck it would seem like an immediate retaliation against the group and a firefight would have broken out. People would have died. By stabbing Dawn in the shoulder rather than outright killing her it allowed Dawn to react and attack Beth and I think she was betting on the hospital groupleaving Dawn to die. ,thewalkingdead,cmimwz7,3,t5_2rygv

2499550,0,t3_2o8kl8,The real answer is that it looks fancy. Which is perfectly reasonable for a TV Show. Remember youre watching entertainment not a survival simulationdocumentary An AR with a neat scope is arguably a lot more aesthetic than a plain shotgun If not to you then at least to most people. Similarly Rick has his signature Colt Python. Daryl has his crossbow. In reality neither of them are really practical and it would quite frankly be stupid to use them over other choices. BUT they look really awesome and badass.EDIT I will just respond to the comments this way as to avoid repeating myselfFirst take note that I say over other choices. If I didnt have anything else then I sure as hell would take both the crossbow and Colt Python. But if I could choose which they can I wouldnt even hesitate switching them out. And heres whyColt Python. The easy one here is capacity.  bullets. But thats not really the main reason why its bad. The main reason is the trouble in reloading it. You cant just plop out a magazine and plop another back in and continue shooting like a semiautomatic. You cant just plop a round in while shooting like a pump shotgun. You have to slide out the cylinder pull out empty cases not all might be manually put in the new ones one by one you wont have  speed loaders in your pocket and even if you do loading a revolver with a speedloader is quite troublesome as well I know I was surprised too slide the cylinder back in but youre not done yet. Then you have to align the cylinder with your bullets. If you replaced all the bullets then theres not much of a problem but if you replaced all the bullets then you used a heck of a long time.As for advantages people seem to be repeating the fact that it can shoot  different calibers. A whole lot of guns can shoot multiple calibers. Use some tiny bit of extra equipment and you can shoot a whole ton of different calibers. You can even use different barrels and everything which is very easy to carry with you in a backpack or a pocket. The only big advantage I see is reliability. You get to shoot those  rounds without much trouble. If ones round doesnt fire then you can just keep on shooting. Unlike with a semiautomatic where the whole thing would just jam and although that usually only takes seconds to fix its still longer than pulling the trigger one more time.Now to the crossbow. I will just start off by saying the better alternative is a bow and heres why A crossbow believe it or not is actually really hard to cock pull the string back. Pretty much all powerful crossbows will have a cocking device to help you do so and not harm the crossbow itself. Cocking and loading the crossbow easily takes more than  seconds usually even more. Whereas with a bow you can easily get off  shots within that time I can personally do even more. On top of that a crossbow is very easy to use a bow requires more skill. The reason this is relevant is because the bow has more room for potential and Daryl is obviously skilled. If youre faster and stronger then youll shoot it faster and stronger. As opposed to the crossbow which doesnt shoot any stronger and the time it takes to load is also required as to not harm the crossbow and to have the bolt securely in place. Another really important thing is that the crossbow requires specific bolts. Try to shoot any bolt that isnt the correct length or isnt perfectly straight and youll have a lot of trouble on your hands. Whereas a bow can pretty much shoot anything within reason of course. And there is of course the thing about power. Many think that because a crossbow has more draw weight than a bow that it becomes more powerful. While its true crossbows do have more draw weight the thing with that is that they have such a small powerstroke. The increased draw weight is a result of having such a small powerstroke because crossbows are much smaller than bows at least the bow part of it. So the crossbow needs a stronger draw weight to MAKE UP for that not to actually make it stronger. Meaning that the only crossbows that are stronger than bows at all are those that require really special cocking equipment which wouldnt even be close to being practical in a zombie apocalypse.As a conclusion I just want to repeat that this is entertainment not a survival simulationdocumentary. I have absolutely no problem with Ricks revolver and Daryls crossbow. In fact it would be rather lame if Rick were to walk around with some sort of semiautomatic and if Daryl used a bow. Wouldnt be the same kind of badassery. BUT that still doesnt mean they are more practical than other options.sorry for the long postedit,thewalkingdead,cmktuwo,6,t5_2rygv

I love how Rick and Carls story runs alongside Michonnes til they come together at the end....and its all about Carl and Michonne each having epiphanies that they need people. Big character development for Michonne.Michonnes nightmare is really important. It shows her backstory a bit and why shes so broken inside WHILE showing how her brain is giving her a lil jolt in the ass to go back and follow their footprints. Shes sort of having a repetition of tragic events if she doesnt go back before its too late. And her brain wants her to realize what the answer to Mikes question Why?. The answer is people. You go on for people. Because you want to be with your loved ones.And its a lovely happy ending after the fucking horror of the prison fallingeveryone being scattered. It feels good.My only problem with it is Id like to punch Carl in the throat for bringing up Shane to Rick. If I was there Id have yelled SURE we remember Shanedo YOU remember DALE??

Zombies do not automatically go for a door handle their initial instinct is to push up against and try to scratch their way through. Of course many will argue that Morgans wife tried to open a door by turning a knob in the first episode but we have a seen a drastic change in zombie intelligence as the seasons have gone on and I do not believe they are smart enough to do that anymore. One doesnt need to physically turn around to close a door all they literally have to do is grab it and swing it shut as they run past.

His fear of being discovered his almost coming clean to Tara all of it culminated in me realizing I wanted Eugene to stick around. I wanted him to find redemption. To learn that he was always capable of more but his fear and intelligence kept him from having to. Ultimately...

Season  lasts about a month from what we can tell and then claims tell us that they had been at the prison for about  months after that by the beginning of season  personally I couldnt find any sources for this the closest I got was Robert Kirkman saying that it had been a few months.

2917787,0,t3_2tfhg8,It you look at how the characters have evolved and changed during the course of the show Dale didnt have what it takes to make it. Hershel became strong. After he most his farm he realized he didnt have anything left to loose and he quickly adapted and became able even allowing Rick to cut his leg off without question. Plus Hershel had his family with him and Im certain that helped keep him ahead of the game even thought it wasnt openly stated. Dale simply didnt have the will and strength to make it and he wouldnt have. I respect Dale and he was a favorite of mine but he hung to the past too much. Hershel definitely wins it for me. And no I dont think there will be another old man. At least not anytime soon. The characters have become too lost and far gone.

Baseball bat foreshadow is great  nd time now a bat and Glenn have met.  Re Ricks arm I think its just too hard logistically to take away your main characters arm in TV.  And I think that Noah is just for TV but if hes going to alleviate anyones role from the comics it would be HEATH who would be coming up and is a hardened runsmen. wed assume Noah wont be afraid to go out on the road now plus the obvious skin color connection which the show has committed to. ,thewalkingdead,cofzuar,1,t5_2rygv

3090099,0,t3_2vjqau,gtSo if a Walker was full do you think it would still chase people down? Walkers are never full because theres no chemical signaling function between stomach and brain remaining.  Theyre always hungry.gtBut more confusing than this is when theyre already eating but then get up and come after someone else. Theyre running on lower brain function.  Movement detection is pretty fundamental to human vision processing I think its actually the first thing your brain looks for before shape or colour or depth.Same with sound  the startle reflex is pretty basic.You should be able to walk calmly past an eating walker without being molested but any fast movement or loud noise might bring it on you.  Obviously this isnt how theyre doing it in the show... the same supernatural infection that animates dead tissue for years makes the zombies preferentially attack live humans over all else.,thewalkingdead,coiacih,14,t5_2rygv

3095410,0,t3_2vjm0e,Tossing my hat in the ring and throwing out the unlikely possibility of Michonne meeting Lucille first.  Glenns the new jaded one in the group now and Michonne is the hope that they can find somewhere permanent and safe.  Her dying at Negans hands would then jettison Rick into wanting to fulfill her hope which was Glenns in the comics and make the world a better place.  Glenn could become the new Michonne and become a badass which they seem to be leaning towards for some odd reason. Michonne had much more depth in the comics and if theyre not going to overly sexualize her in the show they could use her as the catalyst for the Negan war since shes kind of reached her potential.  I mean lets face it right now shes the chick who just kills things not much else going on.   ,thewalkingdead,coiu6kk,4,t5_2rygv

3100187,0,t1_cojb3ew,Im not sure if I can narrow it down to a few favorite episodes but season  was definitely my favorite. Season  was great too it established the whole world in a believable manner but season  to me is the best. I liked the notion that the characters felt safe at the farm and the show runners conveyed that safe feeling to the audience by not showing many walkers. The show is about the people surviving and thats what season  shows us. It also in my opinion was the strongest season for character development. A lot of the characters who are left in the show that spent time at the farm are the way they are because of their experiences on the farm at leasts that how I see it.          I agree with you that it is now just gore and drama that goes no where. I also hate that they have to kill off a character in almost every season finale or premier. They should basically be running ads like The Walking Dead Sundays at . Tune in to see which poorly established character dies this week.            My biggest issue with the show is its consistency and continuity. Season  starts with them in the prison struggling with a sickness then out of nowhere that sickness is no longer an issue. Why would that be the case? The later half of season four the worst segment of the show is a slow build to this mysterious place called Terminus. They get there in the finale and then they leave there in the next seasons premier. Why would they set something up that could have been so interesting just to barely use it? I thought the first  episodes of season  were some of the best since season . But once again the consistency of the show fails us and that greatness was taken away. The rest of the first half of season  was bland. It felt like they were trying to be like the show Lost and the people in the hospital were going to be the others. They gave us characters that could have been interesting and then they are gone. Also killing Beth was just for shock value. This didnt move the story along what so ever. The least they could have done was when Rick offered the people in the hospital to join his group one or two of them could have joined.         I know it sounds like Im bitching I am but I still hold out hope that this show will turn around and go back to the direction they had in the first two seasons. I feel at this point I am too committed to not watch it. ,thewalkingdead,cojbzzg,0,t5_2rygv

I dont feel the show does a great of job of doing episodes with heavy emotional undertones. The only one that did a great job was Clear but everything else has dragged. I guess the problem is I dont really find myself sympathizing with the characters and it doesnt take  minutes to get the point that they are sad. They do seem to do there best to make you aware of how sad everyone is over and over.It feels like the last two episodes could have been combined into one. I hope the characters split up again since the first half of season  was my favorite due to a change of setting helping to explore various plots and character emotions without giving the sense that the material was being stretched. ,thewalkingdead,comvlyb,8,t5_2rygv

As time goes by those remnants fade and they are just husks. Furthermore they would be deteriorating and would become slower and grosser. We see that their skulls become rather soft so it seems they are decomposing if only slowly. This could translate to behaviors being stripped away. ,thewalkingdead,conzz4r,3,t5_2rygv

3155407,0,t3_2w9mpk,As much as I would love to see both I have to agree with everyone else and say we are at least a couple seasons away from that. We still have to get to New Alexandria not to mention go through everything there. If they start getting to The Negan arc already in the show not only are they going to skip a massive amount of plot but they are also going to catch up to the comic book too rapidly. We probably wont see Saviors or Whisperers until at least season  or maybe even . This gives Kirkman time to release more comic story as a roadmap for the show to follow because after all the comics are the source for all of this and Kirkmans original pride ampamp joy. Once you see Jesus you can start getting excited about The Saviors ampampampamp Whisperers until then just enjoy how it all builds to that moment. If you break down the seasons so far you can sort of compare comic volumes to seasonsSeason   Volume Season   Volume  Season A  Volumes    Season B Volumes  amp  Season A Volume Season B  Aaron first appears in Volume   so this is where we are currently. We dont actually meet Negan face to face until Volume  Something To Fear and we meet Jesus in the Volume before that. Although as we have seen anything can happen so this doesnt necessarily mean that it isnt possible but they seem to be following some kind of general path of the original tale. ,thewalkingdead,cop20qc,4,t5_2rygv

3195171,0,t3_2wp32p,I think it will be Noah and maybe some characters not yet introduced.Rick Carl Michonne and Daryl are safe for a very long time.Carol could die soon but I dont think she will this season since she still has a lot of potential.Sasha and Maggie will probably make it since I think after the last episode Maggie dying would drag Sasha down a lot and Sasha isnt dying anytime soon since she will have a lot of storylines if they keep her as Andreas counterpart.Glenn is safe at least this season just for the sake of Maggie.Judith will likely not die unless they do c No Way Out this season.Eugene Rosita and Abraham are all safe since they have a lot of upcoming storylines which shouldnt be skipped imo.Tara has a lot of potential since she could possibly take over c Michonnes role as Ricks deputy since she was in training to be a police officer. Although she could possibly die if they just wanted to kill someone from the main cast this season.Father Gabriel is up in the air since they could kill him off or let him live and it wont matter much since his character in the comic c just kind of fades in to the background.Aaron and Morgan are safe for the season since killing either of them so soon would be a waste.,thewalkingdead,cot6gwe,3,t5_2rygv

3247335,0,t3_2xb8pg,Im getting pretty tired of these generic oneword titles. It makes it look like the writers dont have any concept of what the theme theyre going for is. Looking back through the seasons this started when Gimple became the showrunner. Pretty Much Dead Already. Good title.  Days Without an Accident. Good title. And then most of season  is like Infected Isolation Indifference Internment After Inmates Claimed Still Alone Us A. All the alliteration is so unbelievably tacky and looking through the episode listing gives me absolutely no idea what the progression is like  which is strange considering TWD has probably been at its strongest thematically with all the talk of being unable to go back. I think the characterization has gotten a lot better since Gimple took the reins but somehow S and S feel like so much fluff. ,thewalkingdead,coylf89,-12,t5_2rygv

3251060,0,t3_2x8pdb,Dont think the gun stealing will be a thing Rick left a gun outside I think he will get that one and well have a cool episode where he is out on his own without a weapon would be cool to see atleast? Also I recon that will be going on during abes story in E.The next episode will be called remember it probably is due to the interveiws and Rick being a police officer again and the nostagia using what you can call a street patrol as a way for the audiance to be introduced to other characters as well as having them in the same house for the night too.I think well have the powershift has the main clifhanger with no romance but thats just me I think it would be too forced. All in all the past few cliffhangers have ment comic book readers havent been able to know for sure what was going to happen. e.g. People of woodbury moves into the prision who will be the ones to attack it and jesus how are Rick and co going to not get eaten by people if you guessed they ate people,thewalkingdead,coyzbxs,1,t5_2rygv

At the end of episode  he was ambiguously months behind Ricks group only about a month has passed since episode  Terminus night Gabriel next day Hunters at night Abe and co. leave next day Daryl returns at night Atlanta next day  days pass to Tyreese  days pass between  and  whether you go by Sashas day and a half or Ricks three weeks since Atlanta next day meet Aaron next day go Alexandria next day exploring in Alexandria next day Rick becomes constable next day is party next day Rick goes full Shane  its been  days at most since Rick and co. escaped Terminus. If Morgan was plural months behind the group then then weve still got AT LEAST one more month before he gets to the church. So if the rest of the season only spans a few days to a week then there is little chance that Morgan is arriving at Alexandria this season.

Also in Lost there is a black guy a Korean guy and a Police Officer just like in The Walking Dead. The others in Lost are like the walkers and it all takes place at  Rock but the real story line is how they are trying to make it to BelAir to live with Ricks Aunt and Uncle while Eugene is trying to make it back to the President played by Kevin Spacey in DC Thats why its classified.Sorry for all the spoilers. ,thewalkingdead,cphrym9,116,t5_2rygv

3418807,0,t1_cphtahx,What I couldnt stand was all the bitching about the TV Governor. Sure he was not much like the comic governor with a different appearance different ethnicity and he just wasnt as psychotic but the TV Governor was just so much better. Dont get me wrong I liked the comic Governor but David Morrisseys performance was astounding and his character was well written too.He had characterisation for a start which is more than can be said for his comic book counterpart who only had rage and increasing psychotic need for revenge. Yeah they had to tone down the content a bit for the TV show but where the gore and rage was missing an actual character took its place. There was this one scene I remember where the Governor gives this whole speech about a time when he stole his fathers cigarettes. His father was abusive and noticed they were gone but his brother said he stole them to protect him. But the dad just beat them both anyway. We learn so much more about his character from that speech alone than we ever learned about the crazy Hispanic dude.Whats more Morrisseys Governor had charisma. You could see why the people in his town would actually like him  he had natural charm to mask his sociopathic tendancies. In the comics there are a couple of scenes where he says something nice to some Woodbury residents and theyre nice back as if they dont see him as a crazy psychotic bastard. There was a scene where Michonne kills all the fight walkers and some woman yells at the Governor  hes just a dick back to her. Yet the community respects him.The only big problem I had with TV Governor was that scene where he guns down his people. I get it he was mentally unstable and enraged but the show didnt even make an attempt to give any better reasoning than that.,thewalkingdead,cphyvr1,20,t5_2rygv

Until Clear we assume that he was able to kill his wifes reanimated corpse and life went on as the universe would intend... When we do get back to Morgan and see everything thats happened to him its devastating. Hes been alone for what  years? We see this broken man whos only CHOOSING to survive because he wants to make the small town that killed his wife and son a safe place... Or at least whats safe in his eyes.

And why the hell did Gabriel sell them out?  What did they ever do to him except save his ignorant ass multiple times even after his own stupidity nearly got them all killed.  He thinks theyre bad people because they killed the cannibals in his church?  He has done absolutely nothing to help the group since they met him.

When everybody was locked in a train car it was Rick that appeared like some super hero to let them out.

Fairly simplistic stabs to the brain stem have taken out zombies on the show. The resulting explosion and shockwave from a grenade would be more than enough to destroy zombies look at how fragile they are on the show. The government has drones that would provide an excellent way to observe and destroy large groups of zombies. All the while they would probably introduce extremely strict measures to ensure that fallen soldiers stay dead. This completely ignores things like mortar rounds landmines or chemical weapons such as VX which would be very effective at destroying zombies ability to move.

I dont know how much they rely on sight. There is the part in the comic that mentions if a walker sees another touching a door handle it might assume that it was trying to open it.

In recent events Rick finds out that Pete an Alexandrian has been physically abusing his wife and they get into a fight and it makes Rick look like a monster.Outside of Alexandria weve been hinted that theres a group called The Wolves that carves a W into zombies foreheads and also tortures people theyve burned villages and Daryl has found evidence of a live person tied to a tree and then fed to the zombies.I think Ive covered the necessities.

Now I find him quite annoying his long monologues are a stark and unwelcome contrast to Daryls silence and I dont buy him making those kills that he made at the walkersintrucksdeathcamp.  I also found Ross Marquands acting to be pretty subpar.  I didnt buy his emotional speech to Daryl about doing it together or his intro to Morgan.I dont know... that whole piece took me right out of the zone for a while.   Whereas Andrew Lincoln was on fire tonight as was Steven  Norman Reedus was his usual Daryl with his nervous tics etc.  As much as I dont like Gabriel and feel he hasnt contributed much to the show except as a counter point I find his acting better than Ross Marquand and is thus preferable,thewalkingdead,cpvhkcb,1,t5_2rygv

3628292,0,t3_31wa22,Then AMC is kind of dumb. The problem of screener videos being posted has been a solved problem for a long time now through digital watermarking. While you cant reliably prevent someone who really wants to from leaking a screener video you CAN reliably determine who is leaking them through digital watermarks. This is impractical for large scale video services like Netflix or iTunes but trivial for smallscale screener distribution. Movie companies have been doing this for a long time now thats why screeners so seldom leak. Other sources leak but never screeners.,thewalkingdead,cq5upvh,11,t5_2rygv

Theyre harvesting his meat after having been shot at the beginning of the altercation with Rick Michone and Carl in A.

3685289,0,t3_32ksrw,I liked and did not like this scene. I liked that they were willing to go there right off the bat with a scene so graphic and really try to show viewers how far removed from our reality the show now is.I did not like that Ricks group was conveniently at the far end lined up as if they were also going to be killed. Had they gone through with someone in the group actually dying there Id do a complete  and say it was a fantastic scene and one of the best in the series.As it was I was watching at a friends house and as soon as they were lined up I said there was no way anyone but the redshirts die.Now since they didnt want to kill any main characters  minutes into the season I understand but that would have been brass balls to do so dont line them up in a situation theyre pretty obviously going to get out of. Make the trough shorter. Make it so theres only enough room for the redshirts and Ricks group has to sit back huddled in a corner and watching or something.Putting the characters in mortal danger but having no threat of following through with the danger shouldnt be what The Walking Dead is about. If one character is in danger sure theres a good chance theyre going to make it out.

3896726,0,t3_35036z,I think its really important to notice how much emphasis the producers put on Gabriel saying that the Devil disguises himself as the light ... or something along those lines. Gabriels religion is built mostly on faith. When I used to go to church I was always told that no matter how rough life gets all you have to do is believe that God has a better plan for you and if he does take you away then youd better hope youd lived your life the right way.Between when the group first meets Gabriel and the time they get to Alexandria he has experience most of his postapocalypse major hardships including confronting the people he lost or betrayed. At one point we even seem him toss aside his priest collar. This brings us back to his quote about the devil or the darkness or whatever disguising itself as the light. Although Ricks group swooped in to save him he almost lost his faith in the process. He now sees that the group is trying to discourage him from his faith which represents a lifetime of damnation in his mind. He thinks that even though things seem bad now hell is worse. His job as a priest or at least how he sees it is to protect the people... TLDR He honestly feels like hes protecting the people of Alexandria.Edit Changed up the wording. Im not religious any longer so I hope my wording doesnt offend anyone. Thats not my intent. Feel free to correct my views if I have misinterpreted anything. ,thewalkingdead,cr0glr2,3,t5_2rygv

Weve already seen them herd walkers through their territory and to the ocean but it would be awesome to see them establish other towns and expand their territory. This group has the infrastructure in place to slowly expand indefinitely join with other groups of survivors and begin to turn the tide against the undead. ,thewalkingdead,cs3b55m,2,t5_2rygv
4252392,0,t1_cs4ucms,For example SPOILERSc Things like killing walkers. In the show even minor characters like Rosita are seen on screen killing walkers while I dont think shes been shown killing a walkermight be wrong in the comic. Also In the Comic the group survives with  LITTLE KIDS  of them. All the way up until right before the Hunters ArcTerminusish I dont think a walker has ever even been close to attacking Sophia or Ben or Billy in the comic yet they survive for so long. But I think the comic is also more realistic in some ways. For example the Governor attacks on the prison result in the death of very few characters but c in the Comic when Rick decides to hold his ground and try to fight the Governor Hershel Billy Alice Lori Judith Tyreese Axel and Patricia die. Basically the only people that survive the attack that were in the attack are Rick Carl and Michonne.,thewalkingdead,cs4yks3,1,t5_2rygv

4323935,0,t3_3aim39,gt If theres a grocery store for example in a town where youd have to fight a crowd of  zombies to get it the food in there isnt scavengeable. Its suicide to even try to go get it. Just distract them all to the other side of town first.Maybe a boom box cranked up full blast.If  survives thats still a lot of people. Grocery stores wouldnt sustain that many people that long. Maybe a year or two? Long term you need a sustainable food source. I would look to the oceans. Life should thrive there when man is no longer overfishing them and polluting them.But finding a suitable coastal area or island might be a challenge. The best would already have been settled in the past and have large zombie populations.Maybe a large cruise ship or military ship? They might be easier to clear of zombies. And even if you dont have fuel to move it around it might be easily defensible from land. And you could dock the fishing boats to the seaward side.But then fresh water is an issue unless you can position the ship at the mouth of a river that empties into the sea.,thewalkingdead,csd1bgw,7,t5_2rygv

Remember s when Shayne dies from a gunshot and reanimates soon afterwards?

Also that whole episode when the group arrive in Alexandria for the first time and try to fit back into their old lives  Rick donning his uniform Carl making friends with other kids Carol changing her clothes and meeting the other Alexandrians Abraham doing construction work etc. Despite how short lived all of that was  it was cool to see an episode that wasnt all just people and zombies getting killed and there wasnt much of a threat existing yet. ,thewalkingdead,ctbcyin,3,t5_2rygv

This is a huge story that were given a very small personal taste of and its fun to see the characters continue to explore and rebuild the world around them. For them to shoehorn in a cure or a cause plotline would be pushing it.

The books are written with a POV chapter structure so each chapter is a particular characters perspective. I find their thoughts feelings remembrances and actions to be incredibly three dimensional and realistic. Eddard Stark who is the main character in AGOT is definitely a stoic man but Sansa for instance is just about the complete opposite. Jon is driven in large part in the first book by emotions and feelings of inadequacy superiority.

Theyd been walking on that roof for over a year. Whyd it start becoming structurally unsound then? Ricks snare traps. You dont snare deer. Even if he did why didnt the roamers eat half of the deer? They left all the meat and most of the insides. Also farmer Hershel was way off about the tomato plants. They dont grow well when pinched off and replanted.

4873442,0,t1_cu8qh2x,gt so unfortunately while talking about bias he leaves out quite an important part. She turned and Kenny shooting her is a defensive move.He didnt see her turn he just heard gunfire and saw his dead sister. Also she only died because JaneClem robbed him of all of his medication.gt Also while he definitely is robbed in that world he got shown mercy before. Which him and the comment above ignore. You know he stands by listening to people talking about the danger of him coming back with people and guns and deciding to believe in the good and let him go. He then comes back with people and guns. Every right? Nuh. He was lying in the first place.No ones ignoring that he wasnt shown mercy. Its just the kind of mercy where someone decides not to murder you after they rob you of all of your medical supplies leaving your sister to die. Which is what happened. Arvo didnt lie about anything either. He didnt bring an army of guys looking for you you stumbled on them after leaving your camp. And then despite any argument that Jane has nothing to do with your group Jane suddenly shows back up and rejoins your group. I mean Arvo kind of has a pretty good point.Which is almost beside the point. If Arvo DID show up on your doorstep with an army of guys with guns to take back his medical supplies he STILL would have been completely justified and Jane STILL would have been wrong for wanting to murder him in cold blood.

I know not to expect much from a spinoff but just saying if I was given a  minute pilot it would have had significantly less filler and more city in flames everyone running. And before all you keyboard warriors get on me for being a pleb that doesnt even get TWD isnt about zombies wrsoedgy I understand that there doesnt need to be hoards of zombies destroying the city but come on as drawn out as that pilot was there should have been. Simply knowing more than the characters isnt enough of a draw to watch it.

Shes smart and crazycharming in real life.Steven Yeun will do some guest starring roles here and there but hes an Asian underwritten on the show hes on. Melissa McBride will go back to obscurity. Norman Reedus... well hell do some directtovideo stuff off and on maybe make a cameo in a geeky theatrical movie.Lauren Cohan might get a role in a new television drama. I could see her doing a comedy but I could also see discrimination against her accent for big  television shows. Maybe a secondtier recurring star?Sonequa MartinGreen might actually pull off a big career after this Ive seen her in interviews and shes really likeable and spontaneous. If someone can get a TV role with her and Lauren Cohan at the same time itd go two seasons easy.The guy who plays Gabriel is already on another show at the same time as a recurring guest star. Hed probably just get another television role or two or three. Actually everyone who was ever on the Wire will at some point just get another recurringstarring role on a television show and continue their forward trajectory.

This is a brand new diseasesickness that as far as they know is very contagious and unprecedented. They would not go about things as business as usual. They would quarantine they would be on phones they would be overly cautious because they do not know.

5145080,0,t3_3lcs7g,Maggie.She had six siblings one of whom was undead and kept locked in the barn before she met Ricks group. Then once the barn was opened the walkers came out and killed two more of her siblings which also shattered her view that the walkers were just sick people.Rick later came back and brought her family to the Prison where her two youngest sisters were quickly beheaded by an unknown prisoner. Once the prisoner was caught she killed him herself when he attempted to murder her family friend Patricia who betrayed the group and let him go.Her husband is later abducted by a madman and luckily received the least torture out of the three that were taken. Her home is then attacked by the same madman which makes her and Glenn decide to leave the Prison behind. She says goodbye to her father and brother for what she believes will be the last time.She adopts a child who is mentally unstable appearing to believe that she is her real mother. She is then reunited with the surviving members of her group who inform her that her father and brother did die which leaves her in a state of grief as she has lost the last of her biological family. She then attempts suicide but fails resulting in her feeling guilty over abandoning Glenn and Sophia.She then discovers that she is pregnant so decides to move to a safer community but very soon after has her husband brutally executed in front of her. She arrives at her new home where she learns that the leader of the community is incapable of anything and believes the man who killed her husband is reasonable. She then overthrows him and becomes in charge of a community of  people with little experience in leading.Several years later the leader she overthrown is still bitter over it so turns a group of her community members against her after their sons almost killed her daughter. He then attempts to assassinate her but is even incapable of that so she manages to imprison him. She is stuck with the decision of whether or not to execute him and decides to do so and also decides not to spend much time searching for Carl who has gone missing and could possibly ignite a war with an enemy they knew little about. She knows both of these decisions can turn Rick against her and ends up having a fight with him.TLDR Maggie has lost all six of her siblings her father and husband were both murdered she has attempted suicide and was almost assassinated.,thewalkingdead,cv66b4q,8,t5_2rygv

It didnt mean they were going to kill all civilians in the city.The military was evacuating the hospital and was going to humanely euthanize any civilians that were left in the hospital.  The thought process is Civilians in the hospital are sick and injured.  If theyre sick or injured there is not enough resources to take care of them back at base. They were not going to kill civilians in the safe zones they were just going to abandon them.Los Angeles and likely every other major city is already lost and dead by the end of Fear the Walking Dead.  Bombing the city would just be destroying empty buildings.I dont think the firebombing in Atlanta was a product of Operation Cobalt.  It was an action the military tried to do to contain the outbreak likely during the  day skip of Fear The Walking Dead and it failed.,thewalkingdead,cvrmqv4,9,t5_2rygv

5355405,0,t1_cvw5mrn,I thought those walkers in Season  were the ones that walked through Terminus. That wasnt fire bombing just propane explosions. Wikipedia which never lies says that firebombing munitions have ingredients that burn large areas at much hotter temperatures than what propane would generally do napalm  magnesium white phosphorous molten copper thermite  sodium chlorine trifluorideAnyway...in a world with no running water with no firefighters and once something gets burned itll never get replaced...you better try this method far far away from your base.When looking this stuff up I saw something Id never considered...a propane or acetylene torch.  Cooks between C...more than enough to ignite something on fire. I only would see this as being effective when the walkers are obstructed behind a chain link fence or something. Shoot the flame for a couple of seconds into a walkers eye nose or mouth and I bet it would ignite the walkers facial subcutaneous fat. The fat would continue to burn at a high temperature and cook the brain. ,thewalkingdead,cvw7p68,1,t5_2rygv

5419398,0,t1_cw423hu,A good character does not equal a good person.  Shane is liked because hes an intriguing character like many other bad or evil characters in other stories.  Lori is despised because she was written to be irrational and of no real use or interest other than creating tension.  If she hadnt been written to contradict herself every five minutes to advance the plot regardless of who she ended up choosing she probably would have been liked a lot more in the viewing community.They did something similar to Andrea in Season . I get that the show is trying to create complex and conflicted characters but I dont think the writers ever do a good job of it.  As a result these characters just come off illogical and stupid and Ill prefer an evil character over a stupid one every time.,thewalkingdead,cw4dw28,2,t5_2rygv

5427760,0,t3_3pau4y,I honestly was just expecting such a negative reaction to Morgan being such a deliberate pacifist.  Obviously leaving someone who wants to kill you alive can bite you in the ass i.e. the Termites coming back but there are perks as well.  Tara was on the wrong side of the war a tty the prison to start and now shes an ally.  Sasha was basically a prisoner when she joined the group Eugene lied and couldve gotten everyone killed for nothing but hes starting to bring some much needed tactical thinking to their backline.  Not saying any or all of the Wolves will become an ally but that is one possibility.  The other is that a live hostage is more useful than a dead one.  Obviously the dude Morgan rocked at the end of the episode was a main character so he may not cooperate even after being tortured but maybe Rick or Sasha will break him.  When Morgan said Im sorry it was totally because he knew this guy was going to get the shit tortured out of him when the rest of the group returns and not because he just killed him.  Also sidenote the scythe that that same wolf swung on Morgan with is totally going to be added to his staff or given to Gabriel.  Still thinking an angel of deathwho puts down every walker they see out of mercy rocking a scythe is on the way. Either Gabriel or Morgan.,thewalkingdead,cw5gai6,1,t5_2rygv

I know that Morgan had a head start on them when he left but since they heard the horn they cant be that far away and as evidenced by Carols timer  an hour passed. It seems unlikely Rick and the others wouldnt have arrived back at the town within that hour. Only thing that makes sense imo is that the rest are continuing with the plan.

5461642,0,t1_cw950wj,It seems like you ignored the main premise of the comment you replied to so allow me to reiterate Rick and Carol put down those people immediately due to the circumstances. In past instances where characters were allowed to live out their last few hours such as Bob the group did so because it wouldnt hurt their chances of survival. I noticed you cite Dale as an example of someone who got a more dignified death but how was his death any more dignified than the woman Carol put down? The only difference in their deaths was the far more emotional reaction of the other group members...which is understandable in a group that is much more close knit than Ricks group is with the Alexandrians at the moment. Besides if you didnt notice Carol did feel remorse for what happened to that woman. It was all over her face.

Although passively that makes them more dangerous as literally every single person will at some point become a walker.As long as you dont get cornered and you dont sleep in a big room with lots of people in case someone dies in their sleep youre probably in good shape.Plus I live in Canada so mu chances of survival just increased a lot.,thewalkingdead,cwcznlb,1,t5_2rygv

Morgan had the chance to keep his gun from Carol and he could have easily killed all those wolves. He chose not to and now people whose lives that actually matter the good people are going to die.

5497056,0,t3_3qcn1k,I wracked my brain over this too.The only thing I could come up with was a combination of two things. Mainly that Michonne was still getting over the shock of having just told him hed survive till Alexandria IMHO. I dont think she thought that he of the three injured would be likely to die that quickly after all he still had his faculties. She was unwilling to admit to herself that he would die.Second I think she had learned from Heaths facial expressions on her mercykilling earlier she wanted to see what he would do instead. When she realized he wouldnt make that decision she wanted him to live with it.Both of them combined is the only explanation that I can come up with. The result only makes sense given both. The Michonne that had done the mercykilling before would have no qualms with doing it again but her exchange with Heath showed she was at least willing to hear what he had to say even if she didnt doubt Rick and give him the option of showing how humane he was. When he said we gotta go we dont have a choice she was willing to let Heath make that call.I think the short stint of Heath seeing himself in the water was him realizing that Michonne and crew might actually have a point that it wasnt them Michonne Rick and etc. who had lost their humanity it was possibly him. And he clearly was disturbed by what he saw in that reflection.,thewalkingdead,cweaui3,8,t5_2rygv

All life is precious is not compatible with a utilitarian perspective of any kind.gt If all life is precious and you know that the Wolves are interested in killing people wont you save the greatest number of precious lives by refusing to let them leave? By killing them?No that is some life is more precious than other life. All life is precious at least when put in context with his actions implies equally precious life itself is precious independent and irrespective of the owner.gt That may seem like a weak argument and can be knocked over by saying Morgan believes they can change but...kill them now gt more human lives saved overall. Subtract now add overall. Its not really a weak argument. Its just your argument. Id tend to agree. Believe me Im not defending Morgans view or actions. Im just explaining that we cant really assume that he is doing this to be merciful or even nice. Its purely principle. For some reason he is diametrically opposed to killing at least when not necessary.I dont think he thinks they can change. I think it is more that he hopes they learned their lesson. Thats the thing. Both positions can be problematic. The problems with his are more obvious to us but weve arguably seen problems with Ricks as well or at least glimpses.

5557062,0,t1_cwlv56y,I wouldnt underestimate that because fans begged for Morgan to come back sooner but the actor was too busy at the time.

The truth is were missing information needed to conclusively determine either outcome but our brains fill in the gaps with what we want to see. Sure it may be easier to believe Nicholas death than Glenns and it can be hard to distinguish bias from reasonable conclusions but if the roles were reversed I think some of Glenns fans would still be claiming he made it under the dumpster and nobody would be trying to explain how Nicholas was protected by his dead body.,thewalkingdead,cwm63c9,2,t5_2rygv

5567331,0,t1_cwmupvj,gt Morgan can defend Alexandria and he did he just wont kill.If he had actually killed those two guys in the woods originally they would have never found the gay guys pictures of Alexandria and thus would have likely never had an attack from them to begin with. Everyone that died is Morgans fault because he cant kill. It is a bullshit philosophy that makes no sense when the show has made it clear over and over that you have to kill people to survive now. I am not talking all people just the ones trying to murder you.Oh and the pictures being lost in the first place was absolute nonsense. You think truckloads of walkers are not going to be banging around and making noise? They would have got  feet from them and heard tons of noise coming from the inside. So the trap itself was fucking stupid to begin with. Yet another instance where characters are swarmed instantly by slow moving stupid zombies. ,thewalkingdead,cwn6fh1,2,t5_2rygv

Serve as rd in command in the Student Body Government.

They let me play these games but made sure I understood the difference between fantasy and reality. They talked to me about the violence and sex in these games. You can let your kids do what they want but be involved in their lives. Talk to them. Make sure they understand the world around them.

5571967,0,t3_3rfu74,I think youre assuming they need the flesh of living humans to sustain themselves but as weve seen they dont even need the bottom half of their bodies to live so the biting and eating has nothing to do with that. I doubt the even have functioning digestive systems.Think of a real world example rabies. Rabies makes the infected creature aggressive because that increases the chances of the virus spreading. It also makes the creature scared of water because water washes the infected saliva out of the mouth and therefore decreases chances of a bite leading to successful infection. You can watch videos on youtube of people infected with rabies trying to drink water and shaking so violently they spill it before they can get a drop in their mouth.From the zombie virus perspective its just trying to propagate and turning people into aggressive biting machines is an efficient way of doing that.,thewalkingdead,cwnr5fw,2,t5_2rygv

5633858,0,t1_cwumizm,I forget who but someone did the math. Out of the  that live in America there should be around  survivors. It is  survivor to every  walkers. That leaves  walkers. Even if half of them killed thenselves it would still leave  walkers in just America.That is a huge number to take out. Sure you could start clearing your area out and one way of doing that is managing a herd away from your safe zone.  is a lot to take on. Walkers do not get tired or sleep humans do. Better to lead them away. Fire is a bad idea and a waste of resources. We have previous episodes and seasons showing us that fire does not kill them. The most recent examples are from SE and SE.In episode  the guy had a motolov thrown at him and he burned to a crisp and still turned. He wasnt walking however from a  foot fall off the wall he could have broken his legs or even spine. We do not have enough evidence to state the fire left him unable to walk after turning. In episode  a walker goes right through Morgans corpse bondfire and has to be taken out. There are more examples such as Terminus etc. Fire also attracts more walkers and humans. On top of that it could weaken the structure of the wall allowing walkers to break through much faster. Using spears or pointed objects can certainly work to an extent. However we as humans tire out. The biggest issue would be building a ramp of corpses that eventually let the walkers in or essentially making it so no one can get out or in. Even if the dead could not climb up the pile of corpses created from the spears you would eventually be unable to reach the ones in the back leaving yourself trapped. The clean up would be a pain as well. Shooting them just isnt a great option. The sound would bring more and it would be a waste of ammo. There are still at the very least  walkers at Alexandria or  since Rick did state half broke off from the pack. So save the resources you have.Herding them away really was one of the better options. Make the numbers more managable to deal with. Rick was hoping Daryl Sasha and Abraham would have come back already. They could of led the ones surrounding Alexandria away. With more managable numbers you can start clearing an area. You can reinforce and build up defenses once the situation is under control. At the moment the best option is to stay quiet and wait for your outside crew to come back and pull the herd away or let the herd pass.Of course we all know that wont happen as the plot demands something to happen outside of everyone being safe behind the walls.,thewalkingdead,cwvfm7z,2,t5_2rygv

5685705,0,t1_cx1o2qw,The pancreases is releasing glucagon when it is not releasing insulin. This means the liver is releasing glucose from glycogen stores. Many type  diabetics can develop hyperglycemia from not eating and is common as a result of not eating. Insulin tells the bodies cells to take in glucose. Without it they cannot. Cells are hungry for energy and yet without insulin they have no ability to take up. One of the livers jobs is to produce glucose for use in the body as well as regulating the conversion of fat into energy. The longer the type  diabetic goes without eating the higher the blood sugar will get and at some point fats starts breaking down into ketones which acidify the blood and can cause a coma if the PH level gets to low. Before messing with someone if possible test their blood check their bags for a glucose meter to see whats happening.From Wikipedia Kussmaul breathing is a deep and labored breathing pattern often associated with severe metabolic acidosis particularly diabetic ketoacidosis DKA but also kidney failure. It is a form of hyperventilation which is any breathing pattern that reduces carbon dioxide in the blood due to increased rate or depth of respiration.In metabolic acidosis breathing is first rapid and shallow but as acidosis worsens breathing gradually becomes deep labored and gasping. It is this latter type of breathing pattern that is referred to as Kussmaul breathing.Kussmaul breathing is respiratory compensation for a metabolic acidosis most commonly occurring in diabetics in diabetic ketoacidosis. Blood gases on a patient with Kussmaul breathing will show a low partial pressure of CO in conjunction with low bicarbonate because of a forced increased respiration blowing off the carbon dioxide. Base excess is severely negative. The patient feels an urge to breathe deeply an air hunger and it appears almost involuntary.A metabolic acidosis soon produces hyperventilation but at first it will tend to be rapid and relatively shallow. Kussmaul breathing develops as the acidosis grows more severe. Indeed Kussmaul originally identified this type of breathing as a sign of coma and imminent death in diabetic patients.Duration of fasting presence or absence of liver enlargement and Kussmaul breathing provide clues to the differential diagnosis of high blood sugar in the inborn errors of metabolism.,thewalkingdead,cx1v7ns,1,t5_2rygv

The bullets will get used and they will get used on the person Ron intends to use them against. Foreshadowing. Well find out for sure Sunday night. EDIT Its like the whole Ollie fiasco in GoT if you watch it.

5795986,0,t1_cxf2cwg,crazy is a term that is used loosely.If someone like a type of pizza topping that makes you sick to your stomach you are likely to call them crazy but in a different conversation you may use the word to describe a complete psychopathThe Governor would certainly fit here.If you want to get technical the boy is certainly emotionally traumatizedbetween an abusive father who recently died after he killed an innocent old man and the zombie apocalypse thing and the Wolves that broke into Alexandria it is understandable but being understandable does not make the following untrue.His desire to stay upstairs is irrational as the threat of what happened downstairsand outside has been removedat the time of his speaking these lines that others describe.  If the condition persists or worsens it would classify as a chronicpersisting over time disorder. just having the problem in the first place could fit the definition  It would not classify as acutesudden and or sharp beginning yet as far as we have seen but the condition is present.  I will use crazy under these outlining criteria just to save space.That he has a condition currently and is very apparently confusedwhich is why hes asking questions leads people to think that it is possible he has a screw loose that wont just up and heal all on its own.  In this show it is proven that people suffering from mental break do a lot of reckless dangerous or even crazy thingswarped understanding delusions hallucinations disconnection from reality etc.  Adults and children alike.He is not simply a kid that likes cookies as people keep trying to put forthwho are likely vicariously offended because they like or want to like him because the actor is a cute kid on top of knowing nothing of very basic psychology but some arbitrary personal definition of crazy.

5813331,0,t1_cxhodfr,I see what youre getting at but kind of feel like it is the opposite actually s when the music is full speed he isnt dissociating. Hes in his room his carefully constructed environment that he knows he can handle and feel in the present moment. Nothing bad is happening in that room and hes made it into a comfortable place for himself. Once something happens to threaten that safety bubble that is when the dissociation starts and the music slows down. He cant handle the reality of the monsters and difficult shit happening so his mind responds by dissociating.I still feel like it does a great job to depict a particular symptom of PTSD though. I have severe PTSD and struggle with dissociation so it is unfortunately subject matter that is all too familiar to me. I too like to isolate myself in my space that Ive made as comforting and familiar to me as possible. When that comfort is shattered I will tend to dissociate more often and for longer periods of time.

But like you said.. there are so many new ideas that could be added.Now my complete dorkiness is going to show but some ideas Ive wanted to see would be a badass group of only kids and teens escaped together from school during the outbreak and have stayed together since a community of people on yahts takes in our group doing well until a major hurricane an unexpected attack from sometging other than Walkers like wolves..  but a group of Walkers roam through and accidentally save the group imagine Walkers attacking a pack of wolves and the fight that would ensue... badass an unexplained helicopter flies over a near by city and bombs it to shit like in the earlier episodes indicating someone or some group is still working on eradicating the problem the list goes on and on.Any of those story lines would add a little shock value and something thought provoking for the viewer.

I loved her for teaching the kids to defend themselves but lately shes gone to far. I cant believe that so many people forgives her so easily for killing Karen and David. They were already isolated the group had taken preventive action. What if the first people to get sick had been one of the original group? Karen and David probably would have died anyway but they didnt get a chance and Tyreese was robbed of being able to say goodbye to Karen. She takes everything to far too soon. The thing with Sam and the doc keep forgetting his name. I feel like Carol needs to calm the fuck down. The wolf had to die but she couldve handled it way better.  And I get that the world has changed after the outbreak but one of the reasons that youre rooting for our group is that theyre good people. And good people dont kill the living unless the absolutely have to and since the prison it seems as Carol doesnt even bother with looking for any other possibilities. ,thewalkingdead,cxkandi,2,t5_2rygv

At what point did this old white lady become an inspirational or important figure in Michonnes life who deserves to impart her wisdom?  Particularly  given that the main thrust of this seasons theme this far has been that the Alexandrians are sheltered and dont understand this world like Ricks group does.Deanna lacked the authority both in terms of her own character development and her relationship with Michonne to make that speech.

Stories about starting out on different sides but then reconciling and forming strongs bonds... those always get to me. Even though I didnt know the story behind it the pure emotion that Maggie put behind her words blew me away.gt Glenn saves people. Even people like that. I couldnt accept it either. But then I thought about you. How we were on different sides of the fence on the worst day of my life. And now youre one of the most important people in the world to me. Things can get better. We can make them better. You tell me what you want to do. I recently started watching the series from Episode  and Im really looking forward to learning about Maggie and Taras past troubles.The runnerup scene was Maggie and Sashas reaction to Aaron approaching them for the first time.

I think a Jedi or Sith could live well off the land in TWD. Build a kickass camoflauged treehouse that only they can reach through jumping and climbing.

American Horror Story has gotten nominations but three of the performers who regularly get nominated have been established critically respected actors for many years prior to AHS.

Maybe im in the minority but I dont miss moore. He put more background detail no arguing there but his style just wasnt right the book. Too cartoony imo and if we are going to talk similar looks literally every character he drew had the same weird cartoony expression.

Ironically enough too its the season where she appeared the least. Kinda reinforces the idea of quality over quantity. Rick Season . I loved seeing his gradual breakdown from Farmer Rick into Animalistic Rick. Michonne Season . Exploring more of her background and personality through the deepening bond she was establishing with the Grimes was amazing. Maggie Season . The only season where she had any semblance of an actual storyline and wasnt being surrounded by Glenn . I loved all of her scenes with Hershel and with SashaBob.

But I think the progression we see throughout the story is the most important part and that was made clear with Ricks speech he gave this issue which by the way was a great speech. Rick doesnt want to go back to being old Rick Grimes if he did it would be the end of everything theyve built. And as the protagonist I think Rick is gonna have some armor but I also think that this issue and many others showed that Rick isnt some superhero. Although hes survived and endured so much up until now it shows that hes not invincible. Making him into this great character will just make it that more meaningful and that much harder to deal with when he really does die. And Kirkman knows it. No one is safe not even Rick Grimes.,thewalkingdead,cyxi0eq,6,t5_2rygv

Negan unites the Saviors and fights with Rick against Alpha. Rick kills Alpha thus becoming Alpha of the Whisperers. He uses the Whisperers to be scouts and herd walkers on the perimeter of the safezone as it expands eventually creating extermination traps.Negan then kills Rick to become Alpha and attempts to take control of the  groups. The coup eventually fails when Carl kills Negan with Lucille becoming Alpha and leading the  communities to saving humanity. Carl uses the community that Rick built to expand the safezone and herd walkers out of cities. They retake DC Philly Baltimore and eventually NYC. Then they expand outwards into the country when they have numbers.Imagine what theyll find in those cities and army bases!,thewalkingdead,cz75m52,10,t5_2rygv

6594604,0,t1_d012t6e,I think Sam had one of the most tragic arcs weve seen. He is younger than Carl and Carl was what...? When all the shit went down? So Sam was..? Maybe ? Sam is a great juxtaposition of Carl. Carl learned shit the hard way  trial by fire. Remember all that earlier character development we got from him? He learned to shoot guns he watched Rick make terrible decisions he knows what its like to survive. Sam never did all that. Sam lived his entire life isolated from anyone his age with an abusive father and reallife horror movie monsters lurking constantly on the far side of an aluminum wall. Of course the kid was fucking weird.And while Carl is still alive because Rick is strong a protector and utterly devoted to keeping his son among the living Jessie was a mediocre parent who never equipped her child with any kind of coping mechanisms whatsoever even when faced with the apocalypse. Poor kid never had a shot at succeeding. Instead he was completely consumed by terror of the monsters and then  is brutally killed in an actualization of his greatest fear. He literally died experiencing his worst nightmare. It doesnt get much worse than that. ,thewalkingdead,d01fpo4,28,t5_2rygv

6596674,0,t1_d010ejk,Strangulation is relatively quiet its implied that Daryl strangled the guy with his own rifle sling and while the thrashing of a struggle might have made noise I for one ascribe to the theory that most of the survivors at this point have hearing damage from being around so much gunfire with unprotected ears especially in enclosed spaces. The hearing damage theory also explains why some characters end up dying so absolutely pointlessly by getting jumped by single walkers with constant tinnitus and reduced hearing you wont always notice footsteps behind you so if a walker doesnt announce its presence by snarling you may not notice it until its too late. I think the theory may even have some weight in that Michonne and Daryl both of whom favor quiet weapons and rarely use guns have been shown at a few different points to hear things before other members of the group.Assuming that Negans men on the bikes have been around comparable amounts of gunfire to the AlexandriansRicks crew they too probably have some level of hearing loss. I work at a gun range and its pretty noticeable when I encounter war vets and avid hunters that have done a lot of shooting without ear protection at ranges we all wear earplugs at a minimum often noisecanceling earmuffs are used in addition those guys that have spent a lot of time with unprotected ears around shots definitely have a harder time hearing me speak and would probably not hear the sound of a relatively quiet scuffle from several yards away.,thewalkingdead,d01nf6k,1,t5_2rygv

6615273,0,t3_468rzd,For some it is an acquired taste some dont like zombie flicks some just dont care for the story and some are just idiots that like to criticize things in this show that they praise in others. The slow burn is one of the most criticized aspects in The Walking Dead but then those same people will acclaim Game of Thrones for it. You may also just be finding the vocal minority or only finding people who dislike it. When you go on a youtube video that pans the Walking Dead your more likely to find hate than love.And Ive always had a general rule in my mind when it comes to any media. For every fan there are two nonfans one who just simply hasnt watched or doesnt care to watch and one who hates it.And if I can extend the conversation Id like to point out that even thought many people give it hate it is still consistently one the the most successful shows out there. It gets an average viewership of M almost twice what Game of Thrones gets M. I compare these two a lot because I see them compared by social media a lot. I dont know where the idea that no one watches it comes from. The ratings in the first season were about M on average and they have since doubled. It is a huge success and still wildly popular.,thewalkingdead,d03kqe3,0,t5_2rygv

6656996,0,t3_46okt3,My completely unsubstantiated theory is that they had some big editing changes between when the midseason change aired and when they finalized this episode.

While its easy for one person to hide among the trees much more difficult for a group to hide.Plus you cant make a plan when you hear what you think are gun shots all you can do is be cautious which they were. If a group of guys were waiting with guns they would have saw them when they poked their head round the corner and then just ran away. As for the last bit he could have knocked Daryl out hes proven himself to be a good fighter. Or just slipped away when he went for a pee or if he fell a sleep. You dont need to be that cautious with somebody whos proven they have no interest in killing you even when theyve had a chance. If he was a threat he would have had hr multiple armed guard obviously. Plus youre comparing one exceptional survivor and using it as evidence it isnt. Jesus is obviously an exceptional survivalist most people dont possess his skills.

6684279,0,t1_d09ugv9,I agree with you  theyre trying to show more caution after all thats just happened. No one trusts anyone anymore. The comic has a lot more timepages to devote to these sorts of things. The show has to skip a lot to get the same point across so holding out some of the reveals makes sense from a dramatic standpoint. Also I think they are playing up the Jesus mystery a bit to get the audience unfamiliar with the character to be more intrigued and like the guy straight off  which they seemed to have succeeded in doing based on reviewer feedback Ive read fans already love him.,thewalkingdead,d0apogn,2,t5_2rygv

6689774,0,t1_d09vjtc,My initial thought for keeping her character alive was to prevent the backlash of killing a child on screen.  Someone mentioned in this sub they didnt trust Daryl until he fed her while in the prison. Also remember the scene where Morgan holds her on the porch it gave Rick a comforting vibe.  Carol watches the baby monitor while cooking food that one time.  Reminded us she was once a mother and can exhibit some motherly traits.. except for bowl cut Sam haha.  Of course Richonne seeing Judith is fine in bed and they are safe to watch breath mints and chill. In the crazy world they live in Judith provides some normalcy.

I dont think even Rick could. Or anyone in the group. I dont think Rick would be able to do what he does at the conclusion of All Out War with the death of Maggie and her unborn child after what he has lost.

If its Glenn Ill be a bit disappointed because I wont react nearly as strongly as I would have if we hadnt gotten that curveball that was Thank You.Also when Glenn was murdered in the comics he was possibly the fan favorite which is why people were so traumatized. To get a reaction that equals issue  I think itd have to be Daryl meeting Lucille. While showviewers love Glenn his character and fanbase pales in comparison to Daryls.I absolutely love Daryl and will be very affected if he is killed in the finale but I love the emotional rollercoaster that TWD puts us through even more than I love any character on the show.

6794113,0,t3_48le4b,I really think it has to be Glenn. They gave him two groaningly big free passes this season so I think he has go arbitrarily just like in the comics. Those free passes were all about setting up his pointless death. They toyed with a lot of death foreshadowing around the Daryl  Beth subplot then subverted it by killing Beth but thats a lot different than what theyve been doing with Glenn...

But he needs to realize that nonviolence is his choice for himself and he needs to let the rest of the group make their own. Its seriously frustrating to see him try to convince them otherwise and its beyond naive to want to talk things out with Negan.

6899089,0,t1_d0ybplj,Just because the manga was ahead of the timeline doesnt mean its production cycle was ahead. gtAkiraToriyama is heavily involved in writing the story of Dragon Ball Super. He does not write the script or draw the manga but he writes the overall scenario and develops the basic story he wants to advance in his own way. The anime is more directly connected to his work while the manga is more of a method of advertising the series. The manga is written by Toyotar who previously worked on a fan manga Dragon Ball AF under the name Toyble. Toyotar was chosen by JUMP for his incredible ability to more or less emulate Toriyamas drawing style perfectly. This has created confusion among fans who might think Toriyama himself draws the manga. This is not true. The mangaalready has evident differences from the anime which Toriyama is directly involved in. Toyotar has the power to manipulate and adapt Toriyamas basic story just as the anime staff can do so this creates discrepancies between the two mediums. In the end the DBS manga cannot be considered in the same light as the original DB manga was. It is used solely to advertise the anime however thatdoes notmean in cannotbe considered a part of the official canon ofDragon Ball Superand the series at large.SourceAll you have been stating is opinion with no basis to back it on.Please if you can prove where your opinion is coming from since you seem to have the insider scoop above everyone at rdbz and every DB fan site.,thewalkingdead,d0ybwbm,1,t5_2rygv

Cudlitz is my personal favorite because I think both the show and comic versions of Abraham are onedimensional stock characters and hes done an incredible job actually putting life into him.  Hes turned Abraham into one of the more interesting characters despite him being written mainly as clich tough guy.  Cudlitz is incredible.You seem very interested on disproving my opinion.

Ill admit I might be stretching it a little on that one thats really me just putting two and two together. People act like its ridiculous to consider that people will want to smoke cigarettesweed or drink coffeealcohol in the apocalypse. You dont have to agree with their usage but why not gain for yourself in the form of food clothing or weapons through trade? Im honestly surprised there is opposition to the idea lol.And like you said the painkillers are self explanatory. Im not saying grow poppies to trade as recreational drugs. Thats actually a bad idea because of a risk of rapid addiction in a walker infested world. Maggies gonna need painkillers when she gives birth right?

Do note that season  of this box set is cut.From the commentsEpisode  s of cuts to Rick dismembering a corpse with an axe and then delving around in its innards.Episode  Missing two explicit and gory zombie bites in the scene where the camp is attacked near the end. One of these  where a young woman is bitten in the throat with screams and gushing blood.Episode  s of cuts to Carol twice driving a pickaxe into the head of her dead husband.Also the box set has some nice artwork however the discs are not in hardcover cases.

6985052,0,t1_d182671,I come from a medical background and I dont think what you say is true. There are many reasons the doctor should move to the patient and not vice versa for emergency treatment and a lot of these situations can result in the patient being absolutely fine. Even in a postapocalyptical setting.Also I think you put too much value on a single person with medical background. Ofc a highly trained emergency surgeon would be very valuable in such a situation. Denise was far from that though.I just recently finished med school and I consider myself in a similiar position. What I am about to learn in the next couple of years is what will give me skills  not what I learned in med school. What I try to say is that there is not such a huge difference between denise and what everyone else in that group could have done in terms of medical expertise so I dont think this she is worth  normal group members formula is accurate. Everyone will have to risk things in this world. You saw it with pregnant maggie in previous episodes.

6989467,0,t1_d18eyom,I hear this a lot and it always bothers me. Not the bit about Daryl I keep switching who I think its going to be the bit about any character not having anything left to contribute to a story. Thats just not true... Ever. Every character has more complexity or different choices that lead to various outcomes. Look at Carol in season .  One might think her storyline had nowhere left to progress... But that wasnt true then. Its only the limitation of the writers imagination that gives a character an end to his story. With Daryl we have never seen him love or be truly vulnerable. We havent seen him relax and be jovial. We have only for the briefest moment seen him become professorial and truly looked up to by others at the prison.

OK no one was safe if they were black and had been on the show for a while.

The only reason that scene works for them is because its some scrawny king they can hold up against a wall or a pot in the last episode or something they can manage to push off of them after a while also in the last episode. Imagine trying those scenes with the Undertaker... Id say thats a bit more threatening.

7042493,0,t3_4c2mg1,I said it once and i will say it again Gabriel and Jesus. As of Right now they had no dialogue with one another whatsoever. Even when they sat in the Car together both just talked to Tara who talked to both. They never exchange even one set of words. Mostly because of Jesus Nickname being just that. I want him to become a sort of Guide for Gabriel to justify that Nickname. I would so love that and since Jesus is gay as far as i know this would work well with possibly challenging Gabriels beliefs a little more since usually the cliche priest is against gays but Gabriel literally showed no reaction towards Tara being gay.

There isnt a storyline between now and no way out that weve missed so far. Weve even gotten a couple extra storylines in addition to renditions of the source material. If I could pick right now each season consists of roughly  volumes  issues. Ideally I would like to see the remainder of something to fear what comes after and March to war in season  with the entire season  dedicated to all out war.,thewalkingdead,d1hieru,2,t5_2rygv

7072236,0,t1_d1hybbw,gt I think that the fakeout death earlier in the season was a tester to see how audiences reacted.Im not picking on you in particular here Im just curious. Is this actually a thing? I have seen people say this a lot but do TV shows really pull shit like this? What reaction are they expecting or looking for anyway? If people didnt freak out they would be more likely to kill him off? But then this moment wont have the impact its supposed to since its supposed to be a beloved character. Or if people DO freak out then they keep him and kill a lesser character? Again the moment loses its impact. And surely they already know that Glenn has a fanbase?It just seems so... odd Im wondering what the actual basis for this is. ,thewalkingdead,d1i01wi,3,t5_2rygv
7072563,0,t3_4cgw8z,Seeing as we have a few years of the comic to go if they ended the show say next year it would have to be one of those endings that indicated that their struggles will never end.

7091659,0,t3_4colpu,Whether the comic angle will come into it is one thing but this rivalry with Dixon is separate and TV only so Dwights reasons specificaly here are still a guess. What I will say though is before the apocalypse f he was a soldier so he may have a code of honour but he treated Daryl the way he did in the burnt forest due to pure desperation. Concerning his current treatment of Daryl I would say that maybe the woman he was with is now being used as levarage against him by the Saviors and hes obviously been punished hence the facial burnscar. Now he is having to play a longgame so that this time he and the woman can get away again but with definate success. Ill keep this ambiguous but the TV show could make this a better all round story so very different to anything set in comicbook stone. I see Daryl becoming a sort of conduit for Dwight. I could be totally wrong but with Daryl regularly trying to help people he may become aware of how Negan has ruled over Dwight and at some point instead of fueding with him they become close in a way that benefits everyone in the bigger world communities.,thewalkingdead,d1k7igk,4,t5_2rygv

7095470,0,t1_d1km146,I guess I sympathize with the writers on this. They want to do justice to Glenn and if they know hes about to die it would really suck to shove him in the background until that moment. I mean how else do you handle it? You give the audience a few meaningful scenes and everyone is like lol Glenns gonna die. You ignore Glenn for  episodes and then kill him and people are going to complain that the death didnt have the impact it should because Glenn didnt get any plot or character development. Its kind of the same corner theyve painted themselves into with minor characters in the past. As soon as they start getting development everyone is like yep that bitch is gonna die. If they kill them without any development its just another redshirt death and no one cares.Im not really arguing with you or disagreeing necessarily. I guess this is just one place where I think the writers have an impossible task. And I think theyve really tried their best  throwing up red herrings making it look like Glenn has too much plot armor to die. There are some people who dont think it will be Glenn because of that silly dumpster arc. Other people think it marked him for death. Maybe the writers could have done a better job Im sure they could have actually but I genuinely believe they tried. The TWD audience is kind of tough to please when you think about it. However if it ends in a cliffhanger  thats unforgivable. ,thewalkingdead,d1kn3ef,2,t5_2rygv

7134039,0,t1_d1p1rol,You know I hadnt considered Abraham as a tactical choice on Negans part. So far everything weve seen from Negan shows us that he is skilled at forcing others into submission. You proposal that he would target Abraham in order to reduce Ricks fighting potential is winning me over. I think it would definitely be a smart move for Negan to make this decision. However I dont think Abrahams death would cause Andrew Lincoln as much distress as the finale evidently did. Also this leaves out the suggestion of the POV individual being the third storyline added to Rick crews RV escapade and Morgans horse time extravaganza. I suppose the use of first person might have only been intended for effect in the beginning of the episode but it seems much more satisfying to believe that it was done on purpose to give a continuity to the one who meets Lucille. ,thewalkingdead,d1p27xe,2,t5_2rygv

She was somewhat of a main character just not that core character that Im guessing you mean. Since there were actually quite a few lesserrole female deaths this season.IMO. I think Maggie will be safe but possibly loses the baby and Glen gets the bat. It would make sense for her character development since they seem to be heavily implying that shes going to be recieving more responsibility.

7137069,0,t1_d1pdwf6,It doesnt.  Ratings are determined by a panel of people who should statistically represent the viewer demographic in each market of the US.  This panel is typically only a few hundred to maybe a few thousand people per market.  If you are not a member of that panel in your market nothing you do will affect ratings at all.  Even if a member of the panel records the show to playback later  it still counts towards ratings just a different type.  Nielsen keeps track of whether or not  you meaning panel member watch the show live or play it back  days later.  It only wouldnt count as a view and thus rating if the panel member recorded it and then played it back over a week later.  ,thewalkingdead,d1penqi,2,t5_2rygv

7141274,0,t1_d1pu3k2,Yeah I agree. Kirkman is not the greatest writer. I think he is creative enough to create interesting ideas but he is not great at the actual craft of writing which is painstaking and meticulous. I still read the comic but it lost most of its narrative power after the war with Negan. It just seems like he is throwing plot points at the page. Compare him to a fucking genius like Alan Moore and and Kirkman looks like a total amateur.,thewalkingdead,d1pvx7b,2,t5_2rygv
7141389,0,t1_d1pc77u,Its not about what he thinks or not. Remember. This is the first time Negan meets Rick face to face. He doesnt know all of what Rick has been through.

7141519,0,t1_d1ovyrq,Speak for  yourself. I really feel for Abraham hes my favorite character right now hes got such an intensely comforting presense the way he speaks is great and it shows hes witty and intelligent. Hes been in the role of soldier for so long thats what he knows and he does it well and he respects Rick as the group leader so he falls into rank no problem but if Rick wasnt in the picture I think Abraham could quickly rise to be just as great of a leader as Rick if not moreso. Abraham has a rare and great potential. Cutting him down now before he grows more would be a true tragedy and I think his absense on the show would leave a dark cloud and the sense that the world isnt as bright a place anymore. I love Abraham.,thewalkingdead,d1pwxhu,1,t5_2rygv

There will always be people who take things too far and the people who go out of their way to threaten even Chris Hardwick who has nothing to do with the show itself are the dumbest of all. As for firing the show runners people are just upset and since in the past firing the show runners has resulted in an even better series so I think that the people who say those things are just hoping that either a Gimple makes up for what he did in the next season or b a writer will show up with every fans intentions at heart.

7151277,0,t1_d1r0p6o,Agree although not really Roddenberry at that point I think. Im just comparing it to the idea of ending the season with something created for drama but not having a solid idea of how it will be resolved. Something that maybe should be renamed a LOSTism.Thinking of all those shows and their cliffhangers it just really emphasizes how immature this one is. As I say you can have great cliffhangers where interest is carried to the next season without this Who shot JR? stuff. For example LOSTs we have to go back cliffhanger.

7162291,0,t3_4dbm3f,I know Im sort of self sabotaging myself here in a way but Id like to be one of the few that is defending how Season  ended. It ended on a cliffhanger I know. But for those of us who have read the comic and watched the show we already have seen several things that have strayed away from the comic. We as comic readers were waiting to see Spoilers Glenns brains get bashed in however the thought of it leaving on a cliffhanger also gives us a possibility that maybe they went a different direction. Also in their defense they did give us enough information to know one thing is for sure....someone DEFINITELY is dying. They arent going to steal that away from us. Had they ended it before he swung the bat then it leaves them open for a possible escape. At least we know were going to lose SOMEONE from the group. In my opinion the show is doing its best to tease us with false hope. Now maybe for once the comic readers AND tv watchers are asking themselves the same question..Who got hit? Finally for once were all on the same page. I actually overall appreciate the effort. ,thewalkingdead,d1sa821,1,t5_2rygv

We were totally indifferent to her many of us knew she was dying us spoiler happy people at least had a pretty strong suspicion due to filming schedules and based on her story arc you had a pretty good idea she wasnt going to make it. But as we got closer this character I never really cared about suddenly... I didnt want her to go. Suddenly I started to hope I was wrong and that she was going to make it. But thats not how it works.And I will admit I cried when she died. Daryls reaction Ricks Maggies Noahs... all of it. It was a hard episode. And one I was not expecting to be hard. A story line I think we were all kind of annoyed by in general but a CHARACTER we kind of grew to like out of no where a little... to care for.So thats the beauty of it. We dont get to chose when were ready. Thats what makes it compelling television. But we were robbed of that because now we have  months to prepare to speculate to theorize... so no matter who it is none of it will feel shocking when all is said and done.

7168251,0,t3_4dfb34,That spoiler was posted all over the place. But let me put into perspective why people still didnt think it was going to happen.It wasnt too far out of the realm of possibility that whoever posted the spoiler was only given limited information. This would have been a great move on the studios part had it been the plan and had they pulled it off. It was not and they did not.We wanted to believe that their choice was shocking enough that they chose to omit it from screening making it so that spoiler sites would have a much harder chance at giving the ending away. Mostly none of us believed that a network could make such a mindbogglingly bad decision like that. To comic readers a powerful moment was reduced to mush. To blind and excited viewers excitement and horror was reduced to confusion and anger.They made a bad move not by cliffhanging but by cliffhanging the absolute wrong thing. And the thing Im still most angry about is that no one will own up to it. Their best bet to save face is to air the actual ending with an apology soon. Not going to happen but that would be their ultimate retribution. unintentionalrant,thewalkingdead,d1synrw,1,t5_2rygv

I was very hyped going into this finale and because of this unnecessary cliffhanger  its all gone now.  They could kill Glenn which at this point I kind of doubt  and it wouldnt nearly have the same amount of impact to me. They should have ended the finale with negan saying im gonna beat the holy hell out of one of you or even before.

You also show Negan turn his back toss off Ta ta and walk away like it was nothing. That would have completed the story and had the audience feeling like they were in that lineup. Now the audience just feels disgusted with the show runner. Theyve been thrown out of the story.

7225148,0,t3_4dzak7,Lucilled predictions Im discounting any camera angle clues which the producers have said dont exist. But who knows.TIER   Rick and CarlThere are infinity to one odds that either of them is dead but you already knew that.TIER   Sasha Abraham Rosita AaronThese are the people that could die but would be really unsatisfying choices. Abraham and Sashas thing whatever it is feels like its just getting going. It would be shitty for Rosita to be this wonderful badass female character...who gets dumped and promptly axed. Aaron is great but wouldnt make the deep impact on any individual character that lots of other options would. And it feels to me like theres much more to be explored with him.TIER   Michonne and EugeneThese two are still unlikely but better options than the above characters. Michonne is in a pretty good place and her death would deeply fuck up Rick and Carl moreso than any other combination besides Glenn losing Maggie. But I think its too hard to pass up the power couple opportunities of grizzled Rick and a really capable partner.Eugene would be on the top most likely list except that this is obviously a really iconic moment and Im not sure hes a big enough character to be worthy of it. Otherwise he totally fits the bill of the usual character death formula. The vast majority of characters get a buildupredemptive moment right before they bite it and Eugene had his BIG TIME this episode and has been growing over this season. Also he handed off the bullet recipe to Rick which is an obvious loaded gun. That detail means hes either going to die or the writers are deliberately leading you that way. Of course the way the episode ended his buildup loses most of its impact.TIER   Maggie Glenn DarylIm inclined to make Maggie my top choice but it could be any of these three. Glenn has been so steady through the whole thing but hes almosttothepointofbeingannoyingbutIcanthelpbutlovethemdammit pretty much defined himself by his relationship with Maggie. They brought special attention to him killing a person for the first time a few episodes back which hints that Glenn is moving to a darker place soon. Losing Maggie would kick that way into overdrive. I almost want it to happen to Maggie just because Glenn has been so static. It would really put everything hes believed to the test. Of course I understand that not EVERY character has to have a dark side or go through some big crazy change. But Im curious to see it happen to Glenn. I think the baby is becoming a symbol of hope so her loss would be really devastating for the group too.On the other hand Glenn would also be a huge loss and a fitting choice for the themes of this episode. Glenn more than any other character has gotten out of so much ridiculous shit that him being the one that goes would really drive home how fucked they really are. The whole conflict with the Saviors in this episode is about the group feeling powerless. If Glenn cant make it out what hope does everyone else have? Lastly Daryl. The loss would hit really hard since hes Atlanta Five and hes had lots of big moments with just about everybody. The theory that its him has been floating around for a long ass time and for good reason. Also Daryl has had so much good development in pretty much every season of the show that at this point I dont think his death will ever feel premature. Also hes not quite the escape artist that Glenn is but he is the badass of badasses so his loss would drive home the powerlessness theme too. It fits.Side note I hate the ending too but its worth mentioning as others have that the meh cliffhanger at midseason finale set up one of the best episodes of the entire series with the midseason premiere. I havent lost all hope.,thewalkingdead,d1zg1ru,2,t5_2rygv

7236796,0,t3_4ejk55,IMO no. I never understood the acclaim it got from fans around here.It started strong with No Sanctuary but after that I started having issues with it. . They should have had the balls to use an original Atlanta survivor for tainted meat. Using Bob who hadnt been around more than a season took away all the emotional resonance of the arc. . Maggie continued to forget about her own sister. That was awful out of character writing.. Beth received one of the most poorly written deaths Ive ever seen on television. It doesnt matter whether you loved or hated her. There were a lot of other ways to kill her but they chose that one. Awful. It also didnt help that it felt like theyd been building up to Carols death. Killing Beth after that felt like a cowardly cop out. It also made the hospital arc feel anticlimactic and pointless.. Them was a lot of filler. I get what they were going for with the ending scene in the barn but it didnt resonate with me. It didnt feel earned. The core cast had been surviving for so long that I didnt buy their struggles in this episode. . The Alexandria portion was fairly solid and a bit refreshing Ive got to admit. However Noah dying for Glenn just once again illustrated how ridiculously safe the core cast has become. Also creeper Rick was just odd.Overall it just felt like the season that finally admitted Yeah the core cast is safe and we have no balls. We only kill supporting characters now. It had some good moments though. No Sanctuary was awesome. I loved the emotion and hopelessness in Tys death episode. I liked the pacing of the season.

7271992,0,t1_d248s41,It was just an odd scene maybe the way it was filmededited.  Some trees were knocked over and that could explain killing some walkers but really nothing I saw looked like trees falling over that close to the barn.  So what happened to the dozensscores of walkers pressing up directly at the barn and the door?  Did they all simply blow away? I find it unlikely there was a storm powerful enough to knock over tall trees and supposedly throw dozens bodies far away but not damage that old barn in any way.  If not then where did the walkers go is this the very first time they grew disinterested or gave up trying to get inside and wandered away?  The fact that there wasnt a single damn walker left anywhere around the barn just made it very unrealistic to me and my gf.  To be fair on first viewing I really liked that scene because I thought it was some type of dream or metaphor the group of survivors literally holding back a horde of undead against a raging storm.

People are quick to crucify Season  but its honestly my second or third favorite season with the first and second being  and .Season  may have had pacing issues but it has probably the largest number of my favorite scenes out of any season so far. I know they can do it  I just hope AMC doesnt continue to interfere as I believe they did with the finale cliffhanger because too much buildup and no payoff can really get old.,thewalkingdead,d292jm4,5,t5_2rygv

7314230,0,t3_4fke88,No. It wouldnt have been okay if it was at the end of an episode in the middle of a season either. The cliffhanger sucks because it suckes out the tension out of whats happening. Even those people in the future who can just immediately click next episode on Netflix it will still be somewhat ruined for them. Putting an episode break in the middle disrupts the flow immersion and tension of the sequence. While Ive gotten over the cliffhanger its still just left me with a bit of disappointment. ,thewalkingdead,d29ktu7,53,t5_2rygv

The Governors attack Terminus Alexandria The Wolves... All of that happened within a very short period of time. She didnt have time to reflect on everything shes had to do to survive and save everyone else. Episode  however starts off months after the events of No Way Out. Being in a safe and secure place Carol finally gets a chance to look back at her past actions and shes terrified by what shes capable of doing to other people. The reason she lost her shit in The Same Boat is because its the first time shes being put in that situation again where she has to become The Badass and kill people.

At the very best he thinks his way is better and so he tries to seize power through violence.

His hair growing longer was synonymous with the TV Trope term Growing the Beard which means a character getting better for themselves. In a large sense he was. By Season  he was a secured fan favorite. He always was but Season  made that more evident to me. He was praised as a man who put away that old place of pain courtesy of Beth and he moved into a new place of family. Also some peoples hair color can change from blonde to black. I can assume that it was due to the sun bleaching and dirt but its actually not impossible.

Not only that but we are talking about a situation where you are attacked by a threat you see. A threat that is slow and mindless. A threat that can be stopped by a door. And most of that threat will be localized in hospitals which would be the most prepared to handle that situation. A new disease means immediate quarantine. Anyone who comes in with a bite quarantine. It wont take long to realize the sick become violent after death. Especially with the constant communication between hospitals the CDC and other medical professionals studying this new threat.               You do bring up a good point.

It was a fresh story unlike TWD which has comics as a source material. Everyone knew Lucille was coming already we were waiting to see who died. Thats it. Maybe if Negan was an original show character it would have worked better.Comic readers waited  months this season for Negans debut and we were all so excited. If your audience is already anticipating something there is nothing worse than to tease them.There was some resolve in TNG as well. We knew what happened to Picard at the end of the episode so it was a matter of what happened next. Emotionally that is far more satisfying.TWD pulled a Mass Effect .

7566956,0,t3_4iy2fv,That is a good question. I wondered the same thing at one point.Its likely that the reason those bodies didnt reanimate was because of some kind of trauma to their craniums. Those cars were in pretty rough shape so its likely they were in a car accident during the outbreak. The force cause them to hit their head really hard and thus it caused them to die with out any worry of reanimation.The combination of heat and the natural decaying process of the dead body more likely is the reason they were malnourished and almost skeletal looking.

But it doesnt matter who it is because once the episode is over whoever isnt happy is going to bitch and complain and quit the show regardless.

They had promotional material just of the baseball bat they had the actors give interviews where they said shit like they could barely get through the scene it was built up with a ton of anticipation.So when they Lucyied the football out from underneath the fanbase yes there was a negative reaction. If theyd kept things quiet had not built it up had not leaked about Negan showing up maybe even covered up who had been cast for it amp made no mention of the character even showing up this season and then  had the show played out the same fans particularly those who are familiar with the comics wouldnt have felt cheated.

7705885,0,t3_4kviyo,Yeah I mean the accident where him and Glenn helped out was another sign. I think it happened a few days after  was filmed which was supposed to be the death scene. I dont think either of them would be just hanging around if their characters were killed off. Also looking at the narrative about the cliffhanger and the new narrative being It doesnt really matter who died but know that someone died leads me to believe that AMC is scared to death over losing any ad dollars over any possible ratings dips due to a main character being killed. Im totally ready for Aaron to be the one who gets it and Scott Gimple and Robert Kirkman coming back on Talking dead with their smug ass expressions saying how its about the story. ,thewalkingdead,d3i3w4s,26,t5_2rygv
7705964,0,t1_d3i0xr6,gtUndead would imply theres actual life within the original human.Well I guess it depends on the terms a bit. In a traditional fantasy setting zombiesskeletonsetc are all referred to as undead regularly even when theyre just mindless fleshpuppets being controlled by magic.Outside of fantasy though lets say we see a TWD character out scavenging and they find a body. Before looting the body they stab the head. Why is that?My guess is that your answer is to make sure theyre really dead in which case isnt that kind of what Nick said? People make sure walkers are really dead. You can kill a walker but you cant kill a dead body.This may just be quibbling over semantics but tldr I think its reasonable to say that walkers arent really dead. Im not sure if Nick believes walkers are the same people they were in life or if he just thinks theyre something completely new. Remember that I think? he was the first one to recognize and say walkers are dead so his beliefs may be complex.gtIf were to take the CDC episode as canon its just a human host being controlled liked a puppet.I feel like TWD Season  being considered canon at this point would actually be a huge point in favor of CeliasNicks beliefs. Remember back then  Walkers were capable of basic problemsolving eg they knew how to climb they knew to run when they saw prey they knew they had to smash glass to get at the people inside a building.Walkers could use tools to accomplish their goals eg using the rock to smash the window.Walkers seemed to have and act on memories of their previous lives eg Morgans wife constantly returning to the house Morgan was staying in and trying to open the door.Walkers may have had some level of emotion eg the little girl who was still carrying her teddy bear.Youre right that the CDC episode contradicts this stuff some but I think that Celias beliefs could very well be an accurate summary of what Darabontwalkers wouldve been had he stayed in charge.,thewalkingdead,d3i47r5,3,t5_2rygv

7708112,0,t1_d3ic1e5,gt Do you really think the first twoedit games are a better introduction to TWD than the show or the comics?I think it depends on the person but in my experience yes. I found the series through the game as did a few other people that I know.Speaking personally I dont like horror movies at all and Ive never been interested in zombies either. On the other hand I do like games and books so a game thats a glorified chooseyourownadventure movie was right up my alley.I played it in spite of the theme rather than because of it. Of course I was pleasantly surprised when I realized that its nothing like I expected. TWD is actually the exact opposite of what I was expecting it to be but I doubt Id have ever given it a chance without the game.Maybe Im overgeneralizing here but I feel like anyone who hasnt seen the show by now probably just isnt interested in it for one reason or another. The game is unique selfcontained fairly short and a lot less famous. Thats a pretty good combination for motivating someone into trying it out I think.,thewalkingdead,d3iczzv,1,t5_2rygv

GoT has deaths but a majority of them make sense for the story for them to die and it furthers the story in big ways. TWD is a different world though where it does make sense that people would die randomly and  unexpectedly. I think they need to start making deaths matter more on TWD thats all. We havent seen many die that creates ripples through the show. Sometimes characters die and then the next episode everyones already moved on and doesnt care anymore.,thewalkingdead,d3lx093,8,t5_2rygv

Shane was the designated villain of the season and was obviously going to die and Sophia was a nobody. She doesnt count as major just because she was a kid. Even Sam was a bigger character than she was and had a more gruesome and shocking demise to go with it.I agree with Season  though because the showrunner was a loser who didnt know how to write drama without a bunch of deaths no matter how much potential he squandered. And even then that was the era where Daryl became untouchable. I heard Mazzara even wanted to kill Carl for dramatic effect.

Some of the decisions they have made royally pissed me off but you can deduce that to me being so damn passionate. But I say this now because I have the good sense to know a bad decision when I see one. Cutting the budget for Season ? Really? I mean Season  is decent in its own right but it really could have been better. But fuck that noise cuzthat was  years ago.  Some of the decisions that make get in the way of this show reaching its full potential to the max. The only season to even get consistent results in quality from.me was Season . The other seasons were either or above or below average like Season  or  or  incredible great or good Season    respectively. Season  was just near perfect  in my opinion. gt Theyve had some pretty gnarly episodes and plot lines that make me go What the fuck?What the fuck would be my reaction depending on how good or bad the storyline plays out. The Lizzie arc? That was shockingly amazing. The Beth arc? In hindsight that was shockingly clunky and a bit shitty.,thewalkingdead,d4ezmvj,1,t5_2rygv

8016157,0,t1_d4h2tmx,Yeah to be fair it doesnt even seem like AMC knows who their main characters are. I mean your opinion on who you think main characters are is fine and I respect it. But there are characters that the show itself consider series regulars and some they consider recurring. The assumption being that series regulars play more of a main role and recurring characters are minor ones. Jessie Aaron Spencer and Rosita are all considered series regulars while Denise was considered just a recurring character. Yet she arguable have more screen time and more of a story arc than all of those other characters. They invested a lot in her and made us care a bit about her. It would be difficult to see all that happened with Denise in season  and not consider her a main character. However she officially only had recurring status.,thewalkingdead,d4h39tz,1,t5_2rygv

I wouldnt have minded if they showed the death but Im not going to make a fuss because they didnt.The build up before that scene induced shivers all down my spine. I know a lot of people complain that its now ruined due to the cliffhanger but not for me. The hopelessness of the whole situation was portrayed very well and I know that Negan is a terrible person to cross paths with. Not showing the cliffhanger doesnt diminish his introduction in my opinion.The blood effect at the end was definitely unforgivable though.,thewalkingdead,d4pd28d,0,t5_2rygv
8089910,0,t3_4pyrzk,I almost liked it. The difference between it being the best or worst episode the showd ever had was literally two minutes. Two minutes more to show Negans domination of the group in its complete brutal entirety. Or two minutes less to allude to just how outright fucked they were without having to even make Negan swing his bat. Theres a this is the worst time to end things mark and S couldnt have hit it more perfectly. Other than that. JDMs performance was chilling. The way he approached how he was going to punish the group was amazing. His right hand man was genuinely troubling to listen to. The amount of manpower and equipment they had access to was staggering. It became hopelessly apparent to the group as they rolled on that you arent getting out of this like they were hoping. Everybody everybody was putting on some of the most phenomenal performances weve seen from the cast yet. There was genuine despair creeping into Ricks group as things progressed. It was honestly some of the best leadup the shows done to date. They did do an amazing job building tension. Its just a shame they shit the bed as hard as humanly possible on the climax.,thewalkingdead,d4pdolh,3,t5_2rygv

Unfortunately the fanbase isnt talking and speculating about the right things.

Living with Negan was just much more convenient and less dangerous than being a regular member of the community. In other words Their choice.As I already said yes Negan is not a good person. He doesnt mind killing somebody just to set an example but thats because he believes its needed to keep things together.

Especially since I dont think they have much knowledge of the whisperers. Jesus and michonne have the same issue. They were unaware the attack had taken place already and werent around for any planning. Dwight however makes direct reference to multiple check points being set up presumably they werent in time and for gabriel to get in place. Dwight also references staying awhile. The whisperers clearly mobilize much faster than they expected. They are already in place before gabe even arrives let alone the rest of the forces. Once its upon them standing and fighting is how they dealt with herds in No Way Out and Dante and others use circular combat strategy in the same way as the militia in earlier issues. That is their herd combat strategy as there isnt another way really. Which is why they guide them which is impossible now.The plan is directly outlined in  as waiting for Gabriel to sound the horn and keeping tabs on whisperers with checkpoints and lookouts. None of those are able to be put in place so options are zero. If gabriel doesnt sound it then they cant do anything but fight the herd. Retreat cant be routed for the same reason the herd cant be routed. Its being guided. If they manage to run away then the whisperers will just move right on and end the communities. The size of the herd suggests its not even close to the full force of the whisperers as seen in  so they cant run away from them and leave everyone else to die. ,thewalkingdead,d7fv2uq,1,t5_2rygv

8927909,0,t1_d7kyrl3,Yeah but the episode and every feature of Tyreese since early season  was about how he didnt have the stomach for what the world had become. Karen being killed and burnt destroyed him Governor killing Herschel was big. And then The Grove and then his encounter with Martin and then Bob being partially eaten by cannibals. The final straw was watching Sasha and co. slaughter the Terminus folks with not just abandon but glee and passion. Watching his sister turn into a monster who enjoys brutally killing out of anger fucked him up. Thats why during the hospital arc Tyreese is adamant about trying to do things peacefully while the rest of the group mostly wants to go in slitting throats and killing random innocents. Hence after all of this Tyreese freezes up when he sees a dead little kid zombie because all of this horrific stuff has happened to him in the last month and he cant handle the brutality of the world so he just like stops and gets bit and wrestles with his feelings for a bit before being like yeah fuck this Im out.

8954174,0,t1_d7nvpya,That isnt quite how it went down in the comic and TV Negan seems a little different so that remains to be seen.But if I had to say why Negan has such a large following despite his goofiness is because hes actually very intelligent. Negan knows how to rule by fear. He goes out and supplies his group with PLENTY of extra supplies by grabbing other communities by the balls while he meanwhile dishes out these grotesque punishments for disobedience. So to the average community member Negans group means a very easy life and disobeying the rules means a very fearful torture. But the safety of having that well supplied group despite the price it comes with is more comforting than surviving on your own outside.I also imagine Negan really plays up the everything you have you have because of me card. Hes got a bit of a God complex. Hes sharpened the most loyal Saviors into cultlevel loyalty.And to be honest hes not really a bad leader. At one point in the comics he gives some leadership advice to someone that while kinda dark isnt really wrong. Just unpleasant. Hes capable of detaching himself from the situation to do what needs to be done just like Rick is. Negan is the worse person but just like Rick Negan is capable of committing atrocities his followers cant because both leaders think thats what needs to happen.,thewalkingdead,d7o5p51,2,t5_2rygv

They are either too scared or not allowed to kill off main characters so they avoid it by bringing less important people in.

9157843,0,t3_55pup8,The only thing that could happen is that Glenn and Abraham were shooting in a different location with a purpose to misdirect the fans. Because the only argument that TSDF has is that they werent seen on set they dont have any inside information. All of the other actors from the line up were seen shooting but there is a new theory that just came up. The theory says that Rick is having hallucinations of the Lucille victim through the whole season thats why a certain actorss is seen on a lot of scenes. The top contender for that theory is Michonne because she is seen on a lot of scenes with Rick so she might haunt him because he loves her and in the bed scene he promised her that no one can stop them. Its interesting that Maggie wasnt seen on set either but she has an alibi that she is on hilltop. So for all we know Maggie might got the bat but people think she is safe because she is on hilltop and therefore is seen on set. A lot of actors said that even tho you think you know what will happen you dont. To me this is a sign that AMC read the spoilers and they are telling you that they arent true. I think this is the first time that TSDF doesnt have any legit information besides people who report who is on set.   ,thewalkingdead,d8ctnyn,1,t5_2rygv
9160811,0,t1_d8ba9ie,TV viewer only here so I dont have awesome comic andrea influencing me. I can definitely see the issues people have with her and there are times I find her irritating. I think Laurie Holden made a huge mistake playing up Andreas smug attitude particularly since Andrea never really got to do anything of note. But maybe she was directed to idk. Still I think it makes sense that a character who went from the plush life of a rich lawyer to literally nothing and answerable to a bunch of morally questionable alpha males would make anyone in her position feel confusedrebellious and desperate to find equal ground somehow. I get the notion from both Lori and Andrea that they knew a lot about parenting Lori and working Andrea but neither of those qualities served anyone or anything in an apocalypse setting. So what do you do when youre intelligent and capable but not? Sort of related but in S Joe says to Daryl A man with a rifle could have been some kind of photographer or soccer coach back in the day. But a bowmans a bowman through and through. I think this relates to how Andrea was just your average person with no skills for the sudden new environment. But not everyone just gives up when theyre useless.,thewalkingdead,d8d77n4,2,t5_2rygv

I get it why watch something if you get no enjoyment out of it. The problem I have is people then degrading people over enjoying the show. As if because people who like it are now less refined than you because how could they like that hot garbage AMC is spitting out?!? What I find interesting is how different some of these peoples opinions are. The cliffhanger sucked and now youre only gonna stick to the comics and kill Glenn?! to The cliffhanger sucked and youre gonna kill Abe?! Just stick to his comic death! to The cliffhanger sucked and now they are just copping out and killing two people as shock value?!Proof you really cant please everyone.

9329401,0,t3_589b5q,Writing is a big part of it. Some characters have silly motivations and development. Not much an actor can do other than say the lines sometimes. Now I dont mean this in a bad way but the show has developed into a soap opera with gore. Its still fun and I enjoy it but its no longer groundbreaking material. I enjoy it to see where it goes not for the chance to watch a show that changes tv like it used to be. But for the first few seasons when it was different I would say TDog certainly couldnt hold his own acting wise with the rest of the cast. He really didnt have much to do but his death was his time to shine and the actor couldnt pull it off and make it all that emotional. ,thewalkingdead,d8ykilb,2,t5_2rygv
9336915,0,t3_58baru,Hes still my favourite but youre right. I was really enjoying his character development until about a season ago when they stopped him from being dryly funny pretty much stopped him from speaking. I get that hes clearly miserable because of everything that has gone down and that probably wont change but Id like him to have a friend outside of TF I mean dude is a fucking mess mentally and nobody really talks to him much outside of strategising that he can connect to. I liked his developing friendship with Aaron until they cut that dead for seemingly no reason Aaron being sidelined is a whole other rant and Denise we all know what happened there  maybe Jesus could be his friend? I just want the guy to have someone else to talk to for a change. The show has done him dirty by reducing him to a henchman. ,thewalkingdead,d8zit86,11,t5_2rygv

Slower zombies would still be awful in a large horde but otherwise they seem pretty easy to deal withavoid in most media.I like to zone out thinking about scenarios a lot too now especially in car rides. If im bored Ill look out a window pick out a building and think what shit would go down there? What would I do to survive?Shaun of the Dead is great and hilarious as are the other movies in the trilogy and Zombieland is one of my favorite movies to watch for fun now I personally love when they dont take the zombies too seriously it helps me laugh about my own fear more.

9386223,0,t3_59477p,I love the GOTTWD comparisons. TWD is about shock value gore and progressing the story every now and then with some character development. GOT is built primarily on character development and progression of the storyline. Gore violence and sex are a byproduct of that environment while in TWD it almost feels as if it is the primary purpose of the show. I sometimes wonder if Darabont stayed on board full time how this show would have been marketed. You can tell that Darabont didnt really care for AMC. Hed have been more well suited for premium cable IMO.,thewalkingdead,d95rpyp,1,t5_2rygv
9386423,0,t1_d95s79e,I think the shock factor is actually pretty important to both the narrative and the style of the show. The grit and gratuity drives home the plot point in a way that killing Glenn offscreen could not. Again its reasonable to not have the stomach for this style and I reiterate my point that this is a good time to stop watching if that doesnt work for you as a viewer. Showing Negans brutality and behavior enhances the worldbuilding that they are trying to do here and puts the viewer in the characters shoes more effectively than having an off screen death at least in my mind.,thewalkingdead,d95smuv,1,t5_2rygv

He tricked his new group into thinking they were going to take the prison for themselves but really Guv just wanted revenge. Negan however is very deliberate with what he does toward a certain end is in total control and enforces it with vicious and uncompromising brutality. I liked the way he laughs off Daryls punch and made an example of his disobedience immediately by making someone else pay for it. All the more powerful when you have Rick on his knees begging Neegan to take his arm instead of mutilating his son.,thewalkingdead,d95ya9m,5,t5_2rygv

Im back to keep torturing these people! would feel cheap too. The thing is that the events were too long Ricks group being captured Simon talking to them then Negan appears Negan talking to them Negan choosing the person to die Negan killing Abraham then Daryl punching him Nega killing Glenn Ricks I will kill you Negan and Ricks trip Negan making Rick think he had to cut Carls arm... It was a long series of events it had to be split between two episodes and ending one episode as if everything was over in a conclusive way without cliffhanger and then starting the other episode to show theyre actually continuing the scene would have been confusing. I think a cliffhanger is better that way. I dont like cliffhangers too but all other options would feel worse at least to me.,thewalkingdead,d96tur9,1,t5_2rygv

9398914,0,t1_d96pawu,Im not.  I think that beyond the subject matter the fact that many put stock in Negan not being that bad because of what is known of his character as he explicitly says about rape but thats the dark dichotomy of this character because thats exactly what he constantly does in order to maintain control.Rape these groups.  He uses their bodies for his amusement as a demonstration of his power over them in order to turn them into his slaves.  Enslavement involves psychological breakdown in the form of the torment we saw with Ricks group.He showed them that they have zero body autonomy.  He can do anything to them anytime.  Rick cannot stop him from not only hurting his family but making RICK HIMSELF hurt his family to serve Negans interest.That is complete destruction of a sense of autonomy.The only thing holding Negan in check is their usefulness to him.Putting out that symbolism in the scene makes it harder for his fans empathize with Negan to be a fan of him even with complete awareness of his villainy because you have to include that symbolism in what hes about.,thewalkingdead,d97dmly,1,t5_2rygv
9399180,0,t1_d96uzvp,I think a lot of people are growing to like him because were kind of stuck with him.  Its hard to find a child actor that grows and improves along the way.  Even if someones good as a child doesnt even guarantee that theyll be good when they grow up.   Its almost a no win situation really especially when theyre adapting a source material that requires a lot of complex emotions for a child.   I do wonder if they were to theoretically start the show today with teenage Carl would Chandler Riggs even get a call back from his audition?  There are a lot of talented teenage actors out there including Austin Abrams who was cast as Carls foil in Ron last season.   I just hope for Chandler personally that his parents have been taking care of his money responsibly because I doubt hell ever stumble into a cash cow like TWD again. ,thewalkingdead,d97euab,8,t5_2rygv

9401631,0,t1_d97otuj,I agree for the most part and kind of liked the Gov during the Woodbury arc. Him keeping Penny after she turned really showed us his mental instability and made him more of a sympathetic villain rather than a straight up collected psychopath like Negan. The Gov was unstable though which is why he made some really stupid decisions. My favorite arc was when they had just had gotten out of the prison and the characters were surviving in isolated groups. To me that was a more realistic telling of what a postapocalypse life would probably be like rather than of over the top showdowns between the hero and the big bad. I completely disagree with you about Carol though. The transformation of her character during the prison and terminus arc was amazing. She went from a scared and battered house wife to a hardened badass. That was awesome.   ,thewalkingdead,d97q15x,1,t5_2rygv

9408141,0,t1_d98j2br,The Walking Dead is a huge production. Television as a medium is overtaking film in terms of quality and originality. Costuming and makeup are both crucial elements of film making and if one of them falters then it can bring the whole production down. The assumption that one is more valuable or more artistic than the other is pretty ignorant. As Ive stated before I know that this picture was not the finished product. The finished product was awesome. I just pointed out that in the image that was posted the fact that his fake eye was a different colour to his actual eye caught my attention.Hell it could have even been that colour because that colour looked better on camera then his actual eye colour after being screen tested.

This was back in the earlier seasons. Like I said its been years and no one buys it hell I probably wouldnt either but Id like to think I somewhat started this meme. EditYep. Just as I predicted. Look Im not saying this to be an asshole. I genuinely believe I was one of the very first to say it. I had never once seen it mentioned before I wrote it.

He keeps saying to Rick how every leader needs a good right hand probably trying to figure out who is Ricks right hand. But Negan keeps stalling because Rick or anyone else isnt showing any clear signs of who is Ricks right hand Because there isnt a clear answer to that question.When he decides to kill Abe he probably suspects that he got the wrong guy Correct Abe is certainly not Ricks closest man. Then he keeps provoking them untill its necesary to shut that shit down then he kills Glenn.   This time Negan gets the reactions hed hope for since Rick and most of the others are a lot closer to him.

9423125,0,t3_59pw74,Definitely watch all of it and forge your own opinions. Theres a consensus on S that it was boring but for the most part opinions are divided on everything else. Personally I would say that the show is more drama and less action than one would anticipate but that actually leads the show to be better in my eyes because you have a connection one way or the other with each of these characters so when the action bits come they have more impact.For example since you have already watched S  s Dales death is more impactful when you watch from the beginning because you can see how he came to think the way he does and just what kind of a man he is.,thewalkingdead,d9ag2ih,3,t5_2rygv

9436287,0,t1_d9bzolj,maybe consider that Ricks group were the only group hitting Negan back. When the first lot of bikers were blown up by Daryl the other group knew about it when they take Carol and Maggie hostage the lead female talks to them about the group that Daryl shoots an RPG at.Then everyone at the compound dies suddenly but one guy gets away on a bike  so hes reported back to Negan whilst Carol and co. are dispatching the group that took them hostage. The redhead in this group was in radio contact with another guy possibly the biker and there was time for him to radio back to Negans base and report that he was going to X place because they had X people from a group who had attacked the compound.This is all Negan needs he then starts his plan to take the group back. Daryl has encountered them before and has prior relationships specifically the guy who nabs his crossbow with burns on his face. Hell be the one issuing tactical advice regarding the make up of the group to some extent at least. So pissed off Negan gets sick of losing his men and goes on the rampage setting up the mother of all traps....and the rest is up to Lucille. Theres no evidence to say the Hilltop group betrayed them as this wasnt in their interests  as far as they know Ricks group would feed them straight to Negan anyway making their situation worse.doing that all from memory though so feel free to correct misremembered bits,thewalkingdead,d9c45s8,1,t5_2rygv

They cant win. Not now where they dont even have weapons anymore. Oh and as a side note I dont like Ricks submissiveness. It somehow doesnt feel right. I suppose thats exactly what the show wants me to feel. But I cant say I like it. Maybe Ive got to think more meta about it. Like... if the show manages to make me feel like this its got to be a great show it is no question and I should continue which Im very likely gonna do despite my rant. But still...The only other way I can see them getting out at a kind of fair price is with the help of King Ezekiel. I think thats pretty close to deus ex machina. Maybe its just me. It might be my appreciation of justice. I cant stand it for much longer not to see any silver lining on the horizon. And up until the latest episode I havent seen any that really deserves the name.

9778384,0,t3_5exypr,I live far enough north that ice roads are a major source of transportation in the winter... pretty sure at  to  Celsius zombies arent a problem but new threats being able to attack each winter would be.Permafrost can also cause problems for roads and foundations. Being in a tundra and above the tree zone its very hard to grow typical gardens. It would be really cool to see people having to learn traditional hunting and foraging like the Inuit and Dene people.Id love for a northern Walking Dead! The constant daytime in the summer could cause lots of problems as well as the lack of daylight in the winter. I think it would be a lot more about surviving the climate than anything else though.For clothes definitely a layer of wolverine fur. Ive heard that it helps keep your facial hair from freezing. And lots of layers! Keep you warm and protect against zombie bites!,thewalkingdead,daiegc5,2,t5_2rygv

I saw the interaction more as an incite into Negans character rather than a relationship between him and Carl. Having read your and others interpretation i can now see that side of the story.

And since the actor simply cant make TWD his full time job they gave him a good final moment to show who he truly was before departing and leaving the option open for a return.The characters and their struggles are the story of the Walking Dead. Always have been. TWD doesnt have a story in the usual sense of a singular plot that is constantly moving forward towards an end goal.

Get enough actually loyal soldiers and the ones who follow out of fear dont really stand a chance. Even if someone like Dwight managed to kill Negan what would happen? Someone else would step up and try to establish control. That or the whole operation falls to pieces. Anyone who wants Negan dead still wants to maintain Negans home base.

You could talk about how she becomes more emotional as it goes on how she briefly reflects on her mistakes and tries to instill some last minute wisdom into Carl and is very open about making sure he knows he is loved. I also think Daryl and Merle in  is a great one this time about familial dysfunction and abuse. It starts with Daryl calling out Merle for being a prick then moves into Merles jealousy at Daryl having a new family then moves back into how Merle ended up chained to the roof in S then moves into the childhood abuse both brothers suffered. ,thewalkingdead,daz6uax,3,t5_2rygv

I also feel like Michonne has been underutilized since Season  and the development of Richonne in B was a way to make her feel more relevant without actually giving her a significant plot of her own.

Immediately more voters supported Hillary than supported Trump.Second Paul Blart Mall Cop has a higher approval rating than Trump does right now. Its the lowest rating of an entering president in history. Im not saying this stuff in an antiTrump or proTrump gesture just pointing out that he won remember? is not supporting the idea that most people are supporting Trump.Crowd size is a stupid metric  of course the inauguration of the first African American president is going to gain a lot of attention people want to be there for history.

They make a stand because it slowly diminishes walker population while protecting a community because majoritt of people like being together than apart. Plus they were fighting for a place that had walls self sufficient energy and water and a food amount of ground for crops. Theyre going to lose people with or without fighting and in this world chances need to be taken. There is no such thing as playing it safe forever in their scenario. And assuming Wyoming is peaceful even in an apocalypse when their population may have been a little under k preapocalypse is still naive.,thewalkingdead,ddro2ox,2,t5_2rygv

10859998,0,t1_ddzorf9,Their leader somewhat explained it.   Basically theyre a group who started off well finding supplies but as food became scarce they became much more thorough and efficient when out searching. They began to value efficiency and results above all else. That became part of their speech and mannerisms as simple concepts and simple words take less energy and assuming everyone adopts the vernacular is more effective.  Also If theyre constantly struggling to survive then theyre just not going to want to talk as much.  Remember that last stretch before Alexandria? Where the group was just walking and walking without saying a word and killing Walkers as needed before continuing on?  Its a lot like that except the Scavengers have been living like that for a while.   Scavenging repurposing what they can and doing what ever they can to stay alive.  Their changes were something they probably didnt even realize were happening until it was too late for them to care. ,thewalkingdead,de04rql,27,t5_2rygv

10864398,0,t3_5v6h06,Honestly these garbage people are breaking my immersion. The same thing happened in the comics when they introduced the whisperers recently. I totally understand that after some time passes people would form into larger societies and each of those societies would have their own gimmick to maintain social order. But the garbage people are so weird that its not believable. For instance the names they use and the words they use sound like something youd expect an isolated society in a Mad Max film to use. But these people are all old enough to remember normal society before the zombies so why would they change so much? I realize the Kingdom is a little weird too but theyre all pretending for the sake of Ezekiels sake. Otherwise they all admit its a joke. ,thewalkingdead,de0l3jd,11,t5_2rygv

He couldve just told Negan he found the note Given to Daryl. She helped him escape then when he found her she was being eaten by a bunch of walkers. On a personal level I hope her and Daryl cross paths in the woods. This will give more of an opportunity for her to explain Dwights story to him and start to repair the rivalry between Daryl and Dwight. To go more personal....Daryl cranks her down in an abandoned house as a big F U to Dwight,thewalkingdead,deaatqp,7,t5_2rygv
10958735,0,t1_de9zd7t,hes explained this clearly and even explained it repeatedly though obliquely before he was imprisonedHis view was that there were two options. Dont do anything  people like the wolves keep killing everyone until theres no one left. Embrace a persona where youre so fucking scary that even the hardasses and desperate people are too scared of you to rebel.Being a kind sensitive leader just weakened you guaranteeing your downfall and a reversion to chaos and more death.Think about Iraq. Saddam Hussein was terrible right? But what happened once he was deposed is arguably even worse and has definitely led to a lot more people dying.

11075672,0,t3_5y2w2l,The thing is every major character has gone through a period like this one at a time. A PTSDlike arc in which theyve simply absorbed too much killing or too much loss or whatever. Think back through the series. In no particular orderRick getting phone calls and seeing Lori everywhere Ricks actually had a couple of these crazy moments Carol going off the deep end and first killing everyone in sight followed by total removal from everything Sasha killing every walker she can find and nearly getting everyone killed in the process Glenn putting the little Abegroup at risk in his search for Maggie Michone going back into the woods with her jawless walkers Morgans killing spree followed by madness followed by pacifism Darylls two seasons worth of grunting into his hair Carls had a couple periods of being an annoying little asshole and so on. At some point or another each character has cracked and been carried by the rest of the group. Ive enjoyed watching the different ways it has happened with different characters and often wondered if the reason theyre special probably best defined as still alive is because they havent had a moment yet where several of them have panicked or broken at the same time.Ever been in a tricky spot and had someone in your group panic? That shit is terrifying and surprisingly contagious  if there arent one or two in the group who are totally holding it together its easy to imagine how one person losing it can get many others killed.,thewalkingdead,denf1cv,20,t5_2rygv

Theyre the way they are because the Japanese had inferior steel and less of it so in order to make the most out of it they made it really sharp and thin. Theyre thin and break down easily. Give me a Damascus steel longsword any day.The lack of ability to make lots of steel also helped the katanas be more deadly when fighting in japan because the fighters couldnt make lots of reliable plate armour so it could slice through leather and cloth. Thats why they went more cutty and less stabby with their swords. If the mongols hadnt crossed over then died in a hurricane then crossed over... And died in another hurricane they wouldve conquered the island easily had they been able to establish any kind of foothold.Medieval Europeans vs samurai wouldve been an absolute slaughter. Hell Romans vs samurai Id still give the advantage to the Romans because of their shields armour and method of battle.Katanas only look cool.

Looking back Deanna was barely touched in fact.And when Lori died the walker that found her body ate the entire corpse  bones  hair and all. And was so stuffed it just slumped in a corner and didnt care or react when Rick came through the door as if its feeding impulse had worn off? And yet others are shown feeding on a corpse then leaving it behind to go attack another human despite there being no need to. Its a weird constant switch between the walkers being almost intelligent and then being mindless drones.Tbh Id love an episode which pays more attention to the walkers themselves to debunk a few myths something similar to the CDC which featured in season  would be great.,thewalkingdead,deze1zq,17,t5_2rygv

Now that he is no longer safe there he is joining the side that wants to kill his enemy.  How is that different?      Dont forget Dwight ran from Negan only to go crawling back out of FEAR AKA being a coward.  He then killed people for Negan to prevent himself from dying.  So he took multiple lives over losing his single life.  That is cowardly.    But yet you call Eugene cowardly for doing similar things as Dwight in a less violent way.  Dwight is only going to do his plan because he now knows he can win.  How is that different?  Eugene will stay where he is the most safe and Dwight did the exact same thing.

I think the bacteria or virus when bitten causes you to go into a fever and stops the heart. Whats interesting is what you mentioned though if it can be combated to a more docile state like the virus that they all have already then the bites could no longer kill. You would just die of natural causes then turn essentially making the only threat of walkers being eaten alive. ,thewalkingdead,dfgk86g,2,t5_2rygv

Of course even then his best role is as an internal spy but it would be too dangerous because Negan would try to use him as a hostage and any leaked info would be a trail of breadcrumbs leading right to Eugene.Season  Episode  could be all about breaking Eugene out of the Sanctuary. ,thewalkingdead,dfgybur,9,t5_2rygv

Dwight was made in the comics because of Daryls popularity. Now theyre both in the show one may have to go. After the the war Alexandria and everything else lives for a period  years?? of relative peace. Not much going on all civil growing gardens and mills etc. We saw how Daryl was maladjusted to Alexandrias boring life at first. Everything will be different think about how it will be for him when not much is happening. Unless he takes Michonnes place in the comics and goes on that hiatus wherever she went but Im sure that will be Carol. Meanwhile Dwight proves himself in the war maybe Daryl dies saving him and becomes Ricks second in command From the Sanctuary. I know it wont happen since Daryl is like fan favorite  but if there ever was a time for him to die is during the war.,thewalkingdead,dfj43uw,7,t5_2rygv
11355616,0,t1_dfj1k2z,My entire problem with this argument is that Negan controls every outcome. People say well the wives could just work for points but they choose to be concubines instead. But Negan is the one who put that point system in place to begin with. The only reason anyone has to work in continuous debt for points is because Negan is forcing them to. So its not really a choice youre a slave to Negan either way. Either hes extracting sex from you without your consent or hes extracting labor from you without your consent. In that sense hes raping his wives and hes also a slaver.People also arent allowed to leave the sanctuary. The last guy who tried had Dwight sent after him  and knew the punishment for trying to leave would be so severe that he chose death instead. So not only is the choice between physical slavery or sexual slavery that is the only choice Negan offers. There is no freedom. ,thewalkingdead,dfj4zg5,9,t5_2rygv

11360876,0,t1_dfjpyri,First of all the Alexandrians dont need to know the Saviors are there. Literally one guy with some binoculars and some supplies on the main road in and out of the town would have shut down Ricks plan. Too many times the Alexandrians left and arrived showing off a nice new arsenal of guns. If the Saviors had even one scout what they would have witnessed from last episode would have revealed Ricks plans. At that point the Saviors could either ambush Ricks group when the attack comes or just preemptively attacked Alexandria. Either way the storyline as it is would be impossible. With one hidden scout.Also I disagree that the scouts would have to be hidden at all. I mean the way they come back every week to take whatever they want murder whoever they want you really think having one or two guards is that much worse? And even though those guards might be at risk if the town turns hostile you tell me what is worse a couple guards dying but having the chance to radio in and warn all the Saviors that they should expect attack or not placing guards therefore saving two men and having the main compound attacked with no warning? Those two or three guards is a small price to pay for being able to predict a full scale assault on the main base.On top of that it makes a lot more sense overall because in Negans deluded mind he is providing a service in return for all the tribute he takes by protecting his vassals. If Negan doesnt even have a way to keep tabs on his vassal communities what is stopping them from getting wiped out by some other group when he isnt around? How stupid would it be if Negan took all of Alexandrias guns with the goal of taking their resources over time only for some other group to wipe them out because he left them completely defenseless?Either way whatever discussion you had last week was not the end all the case is not closed. There are a million common sense ways that Rick could have handled the way he dealt with the Saviors better and the same goes for the way Negan deals with Alexandria.,thewalkingdead,dfjqg0q,2,t5_2rygv

Like he was mad that Jared shotkilled Benjamin because of the complications it would yield not because he cared about Benjamin.

11426672,0,t3_633zn1,The following post will be critical. I am a huge fan boy but this needs to get off my chest so if you want to stay hyped dont read.Look Im all for where they want to go with this but we needed a win. Not a half assed jump the shark tiger coming out of thin air while Negan was about to swing and two other groups operating separately meeting up inside the walls and through all the defenders to save the day.What we needed was that dynamite to go off and kill Eugene and about  saviors. We needed the trash scrubs to chase the rest out into wherever after some gun play. We didnt need them to make another half assed enemy with the trash scrubs. Now you added just another enemy our group absolutely cannot should not be able to handle. This episode was a disapointment because I wanted to see a complete big ass chip being knocked off Negans shoulders. Hes more amped then ever now and his army is now ready with multiple outposts in which our crew dont even know where. Thats not even counting the trash people who are now armed and have a reason to fight. They have three places to defend instead of just Alexandria now too. So have fun with that. You fucked up TWD. Too many coincidences and no one feels like this is a win for Rick and co that has any sense. They actually made things significantly worse and in the real world would be demonstrably fucked. Negan could quite literally ride  hours home call the outposts and his own base and rofl stomp right over Alexandria.Pros the tiger looked awesome. Thats it.,thewalkingdead,dfr79lh,25,t5_2rygv

11430796,0,t1_dfrehb5,I think for me she introduced a different kind of survivor. Rick and the main gang were with each other from the get go with one narrative. When her and her group were introduced it reminded me a lot of Lost when they found survivors from the tail section of the plane. It reminded me that other normal survivors exist in this world and are worthy of stories. Upon her introduction Sasha weaved and bobbed among several survival communities and situations and was able to see the livability in all of them. She began in her own survival group failed induction to the prison joined Woodbury and then joined the prison relatively smoothly. I really enjoyed the concept of survivor migration before static factions and distrust rose among groups. Her characterization was almost a battle between her and her own survival instincts. The parallels between her introduction and now were really nicely tied together. People forget that she began on guard duty. That was her at Woodbury. Her stance was safety not putting herself in unnecessary risk not being stupid. Lets set up in a building knock out the stairs and live our lives here. She had no allegiance except to herself and her brother. Contrast to now everything in her instincts is telling her to go on guard duty but something else has grown and compelled her inside that she has to step up. She no longer wants to just survive in some random building she wants to protect Maggie and Bob and go to Terminus. She wants to go with Abraham and fight for the future.

They hung out on the farm a bit longer Sophia died small change farm got overrun they left and found the prison. Season  of the prison was a lot closer than season  of the prison governor part . Seasons  and  were completely different. Ignoring the governor there was all the terminus stuff and all the Beth stuff. You also have Morgan and Carols very long arcs being very different. Ill ignore the wolves since it was closeish. You cant tell me Alexandria time and Negan time have been the same as the comics if you read them. I never praised or shit on any showrunner.

Like giving up hope.I got the feeling that Rick at one point wondered who the Father was. Just like we all did. He internally debated it hoping she was his but knowing the chances were greater that she was Shanes. So at some point he made the decision to just accept that she was Shanes child so he no longer had to think about it agonize over it. He could just accept she was Shanes so he could move on with his life. Fighting it and spending all that time wondering trying to convince himself that she was his was just going to eat him up inside so it was easier to just accept it.

Ultimately bonding and caring for the others but keeping that dirty job handler mentality. Merle and Daryl would set out as a two man group to scavenge and look for supplies Michonne would have dropped the beef with him eventually especially since he had that epiphony when he was delivering her to the Governor.I think he would have been a mean killing machine for the sake of the group but Daryl would have kept him grounded.

While Andrea argues with her Lori is washing up in the kitchen. She says Andrea could and should be helping with daily chores more rather than worrying about testing someones suicide seriousness or keeping watch because Dale was already doing it. Andrea makes it about skipping laundry. As usual people take Loris line about the men handling it to be sexist but its literally true the men have all the outdoor jobs another issue in itself sure. So Andrea is not pulling her weight and now ranting about letting a  year old try to kill herself. Lori had every right to be ticked off at the very least.

11747111,0,t1_dgrk204, Look I just dont think the show would do the character justice and Id rather not see them butcher Clementine my favorite Walking Dead character in the same way the show to other characters.  Im also the very small minority on this sub that thinks the show has always been a bit shitty even with the high points every now and then. ,thewalkingdead,dgrkc3y,7,t5_2rygv

11771909,0,t1_dgu9mi2,Theres a middle ground between those two options though and I think its  episodesseason. Or maybe . But  is too much. Especially for s and equally as much for the all out war arc in S. Season  was too short with  eps but I think season  was the perfect length despite the slower pace.,thewalkingdead,dgudlru,6,t5_2rygv

11807945,0,t3_68cs2i,I hope theyre being serious! I mean they did keep their word on not ending the S finale as a cliffhanger similar to the one for S. The show works a lot better when all of the characters are together now that they have hopefully well get to see new odd character pairings. These are only examples but they could do something like CarlTara RickRosita DarylEzekiel MaggieMorgan and a long awaited scene where MichonneCarol have a conversation.,thewalkingdead,dgygzfg,1,t5_2rygv
11809436,0,t3_67uk1e,I just did the whole series again too. It was interesting watching it a second time round to be honest. I hadnt noticed how much Daryl had changed as a character until I went right back to the beginning again. And yeah fuck the trash people.,thewalkingdead,dgyn2kx,1,t5_2rygv
