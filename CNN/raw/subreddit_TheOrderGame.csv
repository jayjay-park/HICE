3090598,0,t1_cohk0rl,Yeah I mean its a theme. Why do we have to wait to download a theme? Its nice of them to give it away but slightly annoying to have to keep the code around for a couple of weeks before it can be used. Ill bet half the people who get it will lose it by that point...,TheOrderGame,coic7o2,1,t5_2xjt3
3149139,0,t1_con98q1,Do you have a source saying that they ever mentioned the game being fps?  Ive never seen them claim that was a target at any point during development. ,TheOrderGame,cooelaw,1,t5_2xjt3
3166616,0,t3_2wew3j,Dynamic Theme doesnt come with the Store Edition you need to play the game on the website to unlock it if youre in the US. If youre on EU PS Store theres a direct link for the free theme download in this subreddit.,TheOrderGame,coq7vfz,-1,t5_2xjt3
3167101,0,t3_2wepft,unlucky man my parents Samsung had a similar issue but worse the lines were more in number and clearly visible.,TheOrderGame,coq9ohn,1,t5_2xjt3
3172573,0,t1_coqnrwu,Honestly I like that type of thing. I loved The Last of Us and I really like the look of the game even through the bad news. I know Ill enjoy it while I have it so thats good enough for me,TheOrderGame,coqu3lz,2,t5_2xjt3
3183215,0,t1_corwoic,Was wondering about this myself. Is it confirmed somewhere that this is working as intended and not a bug?,TheOrderGame,corxugg,1,t5_2xjt3
3186964,0,t3_2wmuo0,I actually read the reviews AFTER having bought the game. That being said I was left with a buyers remorse and tried to hate on the game simply because I was told to. Yeah where the hell are the lycans Im only fighting humans. This story is so underdeveloped. On my God Im in chapter V I bet that shitty ending is right now.Then I finally got to the United India Company secret. And I was blown away I never couldve predicted that revelation. I was pretty sure it would be hidden lycans and was ready to hate on it for its obviousness. After that I shed my prejudice and started enjoying the game.Sure The Order  is not a masterpiece. Sure the QTE can be annoying and I would like to have had more control over Galahad. Yes the combat was pretty generic and could and should be improved in I hope future instalments. But the reviews have been simply ridiculous.  really? Shut your gob mate.In short The Order  is not an excellent game. It is an average game which in NO WAY deserves the hate it is getting. More importantly it is an IP that has MASSIVE potential and a world I would like to visit again under better circumstances.,TheOrderGame,cosbv19,7,t5_2xjt3
3192767,0,t3_2wp5qj, will get a sequel. I just platinumed it about an hour ago and I enjoyed it immensely aside from the somewhat disappointing ending. Gunplay was brutal and satisfying great graphicsscoresound design awesome voice acting and good story. I can see how some people didnt like it as you need to play the game patiently. However I enjoyed it very much.,TheOrderGame,cosxhui,1,t5_2xjt3

3279410,0,t3_2xnotb,Great review but why didnt he give it a ?,TheOrderGame,cp22uxs,1,t5_2xjt3
3374245,0,t1_cpcv9nr,hmm thats disappointing. I dont really know its difficult to find anything on a lot of the items so Im guessing that means theyre relatively rare? Worth mentioning Im from the UK.edit Is the game anything like The Last of Us? I loved that game but from hearing the poor reviews of The Order I didnt bother paying much interest,TheOrderGame,cpcw0a1,1,t5_2xjt3
6234320,0,t1_cyy2jhx,Apparently so.,TheOrderGame,cyy9vwp,1,t5_2xjt3
8916326,0,t3_4jg8mh,The final boss fight in the Order was basically a copyamppaste of the other werewolf bosses its lazy and was lacking. U on the other hand was tense emotional and mirrored the side story with Avery and came up out of nowhere.,TheOrderGame,d7jm19n,1,t5_2xjt3
9392037,0,t1_d965c7h,Yes and no...from a marketing standpoint you have to come up with some creative advertising to release DLC for a game thats almost or more than two years old.  Technically though theres no limitation in the age of persistent online games where some games get two or more years of expansion DLC every couple of months anything is possible.  To me this is a franchise that seems like it could really role out over  games exploring all kinds of areas in this interesting universe but it doesnt seem like RAD is interested in making that kind of long term commitment to any property.,TheOrderGame,d96i9yg,1,t5_2xjt3
10620593,0,t3_5rq792,I got it in the flash sale and enjoyed it. At  it was hardly a gamble. It was also an easy platinum. Its on sale quite often so I would advise to keep an eye out for a price drop.,TheOrderGame,ddbfmm9,1,t5_2xjt3
