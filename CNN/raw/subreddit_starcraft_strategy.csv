4147037,0,t3_386td8,For Protoss Id argue you cant quite pull off the same build for each matchupVs Terran Rains gate FE is solid  very easy to hit the timings and take a third behind a few colossus pushing out  up to platinum you may accidentally just win with this push but thats a good problem to have. Vs Zerg just focus on nailing either a gateway expand or Forge Fast Expand and playing around with different tech choices from there  almsot all builds start from one of those two places. I like gateway expand into four gate zealot pressure into DTs because no one responds to zealot pressure with spore crawlers... I dont macro PvP but robo openings are the easiest if not always the safest. PvP is almost a rockpaperscissors Robo beats Twilight beats Stargate beats Robo. ,starcraft_strategy,crsz7q7,5,t5_2smn2
