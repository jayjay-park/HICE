810324,0,t3_23eb4c,This doesnt look like the easiestworth itat all platform to start on for a fixed gear. With the single piece crank and  wheelset the frame isnt really set up for a good conversion that is worth the effort and money. Id say keep it as a cheap getting around town bike or maybe make it a single speed. But fixed will not be so good. You would also have the issue of the cog spinning off.,fixedgear,cgwdziv,2,t5_2qln0

For me it definitely isnt as my entire bike weighs  pounds its light weight is one of the most important aspects of my bike. Although a chromoly frame will most likely outlast my aluminum one it weighs a hell of a lot more but hey if you dont mind weight I suppose it would be a good thing.,fixedgear,cqamqh4,1,t5_2qln0
