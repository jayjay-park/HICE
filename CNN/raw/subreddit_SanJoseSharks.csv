312255,0,t1_cfd4l6u,Theres far more than just stats and points that go into making a great player. Ricci was probably the best defensive forward the Sharks have ever had and was an absolute beast in the faceoff circle  at the dot almost every season. Theres no way the Sharks go to the Conference Finals in  without Ricci anchoring the rd line with Cheechoo and Scott Thornton. Ricci also had  points over  seasons compared to Pavelskis  while being the far more defensive forward than Pavelski. Im pretty sure over the next couple of seasons Pavelski will be on that list I just think its a bit too early for either him or Vlasic.If were just making a list of the top  point scorers in Sharks history there isnt really a whole lot of discussion to be had here.,SanJoseSharks,cfd4u06,2,t5_2rdh2
312516,0,t1_cfd5g9a,Damphousse would be a tough one to take off the list. Hes another one of those guys where if he wasnt wearing teal the Sharks probably would not have had the success that they did. He didnt put up huge points but was a huge part of the team especially in the  playoffs where he was an animal  points in  games. Of anybody else on the list id have the hardest argument for keeping Cheechoo on it. I love the guy but outside of his Rocket Richard year he wasnt ever the best player on the ice at anything he did and he was only around for  seasons. His PPG is pretty wild to look at. PPG no playoffs. PPG . PPG in playoffs. PPG . in playoffs Rocket Richard. PPG . in playoffs. PPG . in playoffs.

360633,0,t3_1y6owr,Well the two most prominent players on the Sharks are Patrick Marleau drafted by the Sharks in  and Joe Thornton acquired by the biggest trade in franchise history in  both of whom recently signed  year extensions.

425318,0,t1_cfoqkih,I get really angry whenever I think about that he isnt playing and didnt get to play in the olympics.

438367,0,t1_cfq6gb0,My bad for not checking who I was responding to. My initial comment was agreeing with you that its not true that people that dont like Torres dont understand hockey. Not you specifically but it seems like a lot of people are over the moon that hes back and think hes redeemed himself for his past sins. Hes still got a long way to go in my eyes.The hit was on Michalek in the  playoffs when the Sharks were dominating the Oilers. The series turned on that hit. That year all of the top teams were knocked out of the playoffs and the path was clear for the Sharks to make a long run. ,SanJoseSharks,cfq79xy,2,t5_2rdh2

1294965,0,t1_cifafyh,The same thing Ive said multiple times here fire Jay Woodcroft or alternately get him to fix the powerplay shore up our defensive depth somehow not exactly an easy thing to do btw cut as much of the dead weight from the bottom as possible Kennedy Burish Havlat namely settle on one goaltender probably Stalock and pass the captaincy to Couture with Vlasic and Jumbo as Alternates.Its not a matter of one or two guys being the problem. We have a lot of smaller things we can do better and those need to be worked on. For example the Sharks were less prone to that stupid droppass entry into the offensive zone and it made our team a hell of a lot better on the attack. DW has made some decisions in the past that werent great but hes also made some fucking amazing deals. His biggest problem is that hes too keen on veterans and resigning them its not the worst problem in the world and hes still a better GM than just about anyone on the market. Finally theres been a bigger focus on actually using our development and creating a farm so thats a step in the right direction. If anything Roy Sommer being replaced will help with development and thus help the SJ Sharks. The Woo hasnt had success since they were in Kentucky...Have to be smart and patient about major changes or you wind up worse off because you dumped someone just for the sake of change. Jumbo and Patty are still stars who we will be hardpressed to trade we have much worse players on the lower end of the spectrum and our stars are not hogging up cap space. Were not exaclty a shitty team overnight even with the collapse and if our development picks up we can stop relying on journeymen to fill our bottom lines which will improve our team immensely.,SanJoseSharks,cifatka,13,t5_2rdh2

By my count thats not a full  months... but  months isnt a whole lot better. Secondly I am certain that it is more than just placing meds directly at the site unfortunately. He does have an infection so you were right about that but what happened is that when he had his surgery last year they had to put a graft in to repairstabilize his ACL. The infection in his leg was so severe that they had to remove the graft they put in last Fall because it was likely responsible for the infection. Once they removed it our dear friend Raphael was probably put on a steady diet of antibiotics and steroids for the last month or so to knock the infection out. The surgery he is getting this month is to put a new graft in there to repairstabilize his ACL injury from last year which means he is essentially having the exact same surgery as he had last season. The only difference is that theyre probably going to limit his rehab a bit more to see if that helps avoid infection this time around. Doug Wilson released a statement  weeks ago that noted that the surgery Torres is having on September  is in fact to put a new graft in. The good news is that since the surgery is going to happen as scheduled its safe to assume they were able to get rid of the infection.,SanJoseSharks,ckczhi0,3,t5_2rdh2

Im not taking about their leadership skill or even their talent but they just dont have it. That drive to win that drive that takes them to the next level and as a result the culture in the locker room is being affected. Something needs to change and it isnt management.

Every NMC is different. Some NMCs are ironclad in that they do not provide any option for the team to move the player without their consent.So no you cannot simply trade a player with an NMC thats exactly what a NMC protects against.

3725752,0,t1_cqg8yu5,Generally speaking I agree with you. I personally had a hard time getting into that whole Operation regicide. However I believe this is somewhat newsworthy to us because of WHO is involved Stoll. That piece of shit changed not one but two series. First the hit Torres landed on him led to his suspension and I believe Sharks would have won the series had Torres been playing and then Stolls hits on Vlasic led to him being out and IMO helped the Kings win that series. So all in all yeah keep the black and white with the crown out of our subreddit but this is one of the few exception I thought it was ok. ,SanJoseSharks,cqgym2v,4,t5_2rdh2
3729181,0,t3_3341ou,I agree with this whole thing. We lost the play off opportunity for two reasons. Raffi Torres just did not heal in the time that was predicted. That is the main reason. He has a reputation of being a goon but his minutes in San Jose have been EXTREMELY productive albeit short.The amount of points hes made for us in the games he has actually been there for are pretty phenomenal for a rdth liner. He did actually clean up his act when coming to the team and he is a great addition as long as he can stay healthy.The other part is the entire organization shit the pot in February. Just. Shit. The. Pot. They were awful. Had we won half those home games wed be in the playoffs soundly. The last  months of the season would not have been so rough on every single fan. Everyone blames DW mostly and Tmac about  for this.. But the organization just shit the bed in February. Thats it. The team went into a rut and could not escape it until March started. DW has built a lot of talent and TMac is an amazing coach who has a career in the NHL for the next  years if he wants it. I hope both of them keep their jobs. I admit I hated DW all year until I came to the realization that he cant be solely to blame for the team failing so hard in February while at the same time be solely to blame for not rebuilding the team when the ThorntonMarleau contracts end in  years. We should have made the playoffs but more importantly we needed to have a season like this where we bring in a lot of new talent and build them up.Theres PLENTY and I do mean plenty of more work that needs to be done if were going to win a cup but lets face it. While we should have made the playoffs this rebuild needed to start this season.And as much as I dislike Hannan Id like to explain why DW brought him to the team. He knew we were taking a step back. Mind you he surely thought Hannan would play better.... But Hannan has a reputation of being a man of steel and he is an experienced veteran in the NHL and most of his tenure has been with the Sharks. He was here to coach our new and young blue line. He was here to use his experience to advance the organization which is trending much younger. That is a smart move. He was supposed to play better than he did. No one can argue that but if they do what he says and not what he does that is extremely beneficial to the organization.,SanJoseSharks,cqhcndp,1,t5_2rdh2

6351190,1,t3_42m2k4,There are way more shitty players that need replacing than Brown.  Hes been the hero way more times this year for the sharks than he has been the goat.  Hes one of the few guys on the sharks line up that actually plays with a bit of grit something the sharks have long been lacking.  Sure lets cut him and make this team even more pussified.  Brown does alot for the rest of the sharks who cant seem to land a hit without getting themselves knocked down to the ice.The fact that the sharks have ZERO defense outside of Pickles is the reason they keep getting fucked.  Burns in all reality is a forward playing on the defense line and as long as hes kept there hes not fulfilling his full potential and is also a defensive liability.  These other guys they have on the blue line are an absolute joke.

6675356,0,t1_d09rwgs,I do actually. The Sharks are set to fall apart once JumboMarleau leave so if theyre going for broke they might as well. Meier wasnt exactly a top  pick and if today is any indication Wilson doesnt give much of AF about the farm. I see Meier coming in being surrounded by little but an aging Pavelski and only really having Couture there to create any offense with. I project his early career to really be hurt by the organization he plays for. Plus hed be like NHL insanity if on a line with Marner or Nylander.Basically hes SJs best future prospect as a bargaining chip and could fetch a hell of a lot if the teams serious about making some noise in the postseason.,SanJoseSharks,d09sfwx,2,t5_2rdh2

7020208,0,t1_d1byr0z,The last time SJ made a trade like that will be completely defined by how they do in the playoffs the next year was the Travis Moen Nick Bonino trade. Looking back that trade wasnt horrible but it was very unnecessary. Thats how I feel about the Polak Spaling trade so far.Both trades will truly be defined by how SJ performs int he playoffs. I know a LOT of people believe Reimer has no chance of staying in SJ. But his options as being a starter are VERY limited. CGY will bring back at least Ortio and probably Ramo as well.Carolina and Arizona are the only two teams that may truly need starters but even then they have internal caps plus other cheaper goalies that could do the job. Everywhere you look Reimer just doesnt fit well as a starter monetarily speakingSo if he stays in SJ as a backup which I think he just might due to players falling in love with SJ often then this trade will have been worth it.,SanJoseSharks,d1c39vh,1,t5_2rdh2
7021348,0,t1_d1bov8z,Theres plenty of space below the nd line just because he isnt a top  doesnt mean he is incapable of being on the team hes smart enough to know that no team will pay more than SJ would. His contract is almost up and hes going to either sign a lower paying contract here or retire. People keep acting like we have to pay Patty until he dies or that hes only interested in playing for a team thatll pay him  mil. His contract was made up a while ago and he knows he isnt producing as much anymore. Hed have a tough time finding top  space on any team thats worth anything and he knows SJ will give him a fair deal for his current production rate and veteran presence. Just because he isnt scoring  goals doesnt mean he isnt playing well.,SanJoseSharks,d1c7yih,7,t5_2rdh2

7218735,0,t3_4eb31b,Ill chime in on the differences vs two years ago. The team is deeper and more well rounded. We added warriors in the offseason guys built for the grind. Specifically of the  players who played in the last series  are no longer on the team Sheppard Boyle Torres Brown Desjardins Hannan Irwin Demers Havlat Niemi Stalock and Stuart. Theyve been replaced with Ward Donskoi Tierney Martin Karlsson Dillon Zubrus Spaling DeMelo Polak Haley Jones and Reimer. The top end talent has never been in question Thornton Marleau Burns Pavelski Couture Vlasic. Thats as great of a core as any team in the league. The issue in years past has been that the Sharks were built like a team that thought throwing enough eggs in the pan makes an omelette. This team is much more complete they can play in different situations and adapt much better than the  roster.I dont know if theyre at the point that they can knock the Kings out thats as tall an order as any we were going to get this year and Im not accounting for the Kings own improvements so Im not going to come out and say Oh yeah we got this in the bag. I just have significantly more faith in this Sharks roster to get the hard scrappy goals and win the close games than I have before.In fact Ill go on record as saying this is as good of a playoff built Sharks team in the lets say last  years at least.,SanJoseSharks,d1ypqh3,3,t5_2rdh2

7269677,0,t3_4exl3p,Its a different feel this year for both groups of fans it seems. Theres a whole lot of respect and everyone knows it can really go either way. There may be a strong dislike for the other team but the true hockey fans will appreciate how important having strong California teams really is. I grew up playing hockey here in the North bay area and in high school i had to drive an hour to a rink to play against adults. When I got to college all the other guys on my team had played on high school teams or traveling teams and I was so jealous but its awesome we are producing more and more players now. The scene in southern California is really strong and thats a testament to the Kings and ducks skill and outreach.As California hockey fans we took a lot of crap until the ducks and you guys got a cup now we get more respect though as sharks fans we still take a beating. The California road trip has to be one of the most feared trips for any team. And I havent heard any claims that we dont understand the game like I used to hear years ago.Sorry this got kind of rambly but I love great hockey and only wish this series wasnt forced to be the first round.

Pavs was going full speed when he was shoved in the numbers. If hes looking down probably not a problem. But his vision was upward to try and catch the puck thus because of his attention and balance he was not prepared for such contact.

9785876,0,t3_5fcuxd,Hes definitely been showing he deserves his new contract ever since the announcement hes been one of if not the best Sharks player on the ice in the last couple of games.Random story a couple of weeks ago I went to a Sharks game with a friend who had never been before so we went down the glass to watch the warmup. A couple of Sharks players threw pucks over the glass cant really remember who but I think it was Pavelski and someone else  they each threw one puck. Burns threw  pucks during warmup so  times more than the rest of the team combined and that was only on our side of the ice he may have thrown more on the other side. Also we were standing in the corner and Burns was knocking at us on the boards with his stick every time he skated by with a big smile. He was maybe the only player during warmup who genuinely looked like he wanted to interact with the fans in some way not that I hold this against the other players I understand they want to concentrate.Ive always loved Burns on the ice and his personality off the ice his suits his looks his van etc. but that made me like him even more that kind of behavior is great for the fans especially the kids who will grow up Sharks and Burns fans.,SanJoseSharks,dajbm4y,13,t5_2rdh2

11712598,0,t1_dgngb6q,Correct.  But thats because the Sharks wanted to bring the Worcester Sharks to SJ instead of buying out Stockton Thunder.  That was a terrible mistake and Im not sure why they did that.  A Sharks affiliate in Stockton would have projected the Sharks brand especially strongly and Stockton has always had good attendance for the Thunder.  It would have been cheaper to house the players and they can be recalled just as easily.It was a big big mistake by the Sharks brass.  Instead of furthering the brand out of the Bay Area they dug in and gets  attendees per game who are already Sharks fans.  SMH,SanJoseSharks,dgnnhxi,1,t5_2rdh2

Thats just my opinion but the fact remains that moving to center from wing is much more difficult than viceversa. ,SanJoseSharks,dgre2x5,2,t5_2rdh2
