6380706,0,t1_czew8do,. I do believe the Condorcet winner is more correct. The reason I am not advocating for a Condorcet system is because it is vastly more complex than and a compete departure from STV vastly more significant than what Ive proposed.. Mr van der Craats referred to the quota problem in NSW ACT and Tasmania because they are relevant for optional preferential voting like in rmp so the total votes for nonexcluded candidates decreases as more candidates are excluded. In the  NSW Senate election full preferential   . of ballots were exhausted. In the  NSW Legislative Council election optional preferential    of ballots were exhausted. Mark Pearson of the Animal Justice Party was elected on less than half of a quota. Similar figures for exhaustion can be seen in Tasmania and the ACT. I dont understand how you claim STV has No risk because no reward. Senate STV has no risk but gives the fringe H voters the unique reward of allowing their votes to flow to either B or E at full value depending on how others vote whereas the preference flows for the other voters are moreorless fixed once they cast their ballot. I dont think I am referring to what you describe with the ABD minority. This is not an orchestrated coordination of votes to achieve a particular outcome this is just the counting system automatically giving the fringe H voters a leg up on others by interpreting their votes with insider information.. I say lost since if they voted for B B would win and  of their vote would go to their second preference while if they individually changed their vote B would still win but  of their vote would go to their other preference. Given how all others vote this voters loses  by voting honestly  this is exactly the same as what occurs with Wright STV and strategichonest voting fringe F voters.. I say ordinary because it is STV affords supporters of every candidate the ability to transfer surpluses if they have enough support. STV does not afford supporters of every candidate to have their preferences flow differently based on how the count turns out.I can see you are frustrated with this discussion. If you want to leave it here I am happy to do so. My only objective as Im sure yours is too has been to provide the community with the facts so they can decide for themselves and that I have done.,ModelAustralia,czex243,1,t5_38zyp
6438962,0,t1_czkz4s7,Bio  fun joined rmodelparliament back in in July  originally joining the Liberal party.  However was elected in uncontested to the seat of WA as an independent.  With the greens winning a minority government fun offered to become the speaker of the House if they would provide social progression and cohesion.  fun strived to remain impartial and independent whilst in the House however would cause controversy in public to encourage debate.  After getting elected a second time fun choose not to sit as speaker however as a Cross Bench Independent. Worked on bills attempted to give the government a hard time.  During this time fun also served as an Independent Acting Chief of Defence. He also ran the Mudrock Media Conglomerate interviewing a vast spread of members of the game.  On the pause between the third and fourth Parliaments fun was nominated as the Head Mod due to his past as being Independent as well as fairly active.   ,ModelAustralia,czlbsjf,1,t5_38zyp

6690923,0,t3_46v9lu,Interesting as a independent her are my views on these matters.In respect to veterans additional medical aid for physical and mental injuries from combat should be given. While the militarys role overseas should be decreased.To solve crime major prison reform needs to happen. The reforms need to reduce the amount of people who after going to prison return to crime by focusing on rehabilitating the prisoners helping them return to society as productive members.The drug and alcohol problem can be dealt with by along with prison reform a larger focus on curing the addicts of their addiction and helping them get over this struggle. Soft drugs like cannabis can be dealt with by decriminalizing them and requiring by law those caught to go to counselors to help them deal with their drug and alcohol problems.Editgrammar and changing a word from returning to rehabilitating,ModelAustralia,d0beey0,2,t5_38zyp

7180364,0,t3_4dtyt4,Having mutilated the Defence Legislation Amendment Bill the decent thing for the Labor Government to do is allow the bill to die with dignity.We will be putting forward a motion of withdrawal upon the third reading should the bill pass the CID. Its a shame that the government has chosen to render the legislation impotent with amendments rather than simply opposing it outright. The bill The Greens put forward is gone and we do not support what now stands in its place. lurkerLeader of the OppositionThe Greens,ModelAustralia,d1ucdmo,6,t5_38zyp
7205259,0,t3_4e3sqb,I remind everyone that it is simply an idea that I did not really think it through and that I am more than happy to substantially change the parameters and operation of such a system if implemented. I repeat that  was simply one that I pulled out of a tophat. Something like  is reasonable.Also people seem to be thinking that voting either Takes a long time or Not everyone can make it or Solution in search of a problem.I will attempt to address both in my limited time.As I have put forward in comments below voting shouldnt take more than  seconds. There is no reason to spend hours to make a vote MPs should already know what they are going to vote when amendments or bills or whatnot are introduced to the house to begin with.Not everyone can make it because no internetbusyetc. In which I reply well why not work around the problem instead of saying because it will disadvantage x the entire idea is silly? Hence in response I proposed turning leave into a meta issue to prevent government from playing favourites and also to ensure political noninterference.It isnt a solution in search of a problem. The problem already has a solution three weeks before the boot I am simply proposing another solution that in my opinion is better. I envisage a future where people need to meet minimum voting requirements in order to keep a seat. That seems reasonable considering that so many people would like to sit in parliament and these seats are being wasted to people that do nothing. Also it will force them to AT LEAST vote which is better than haranguing MPs for doing zilch.,ModelAustralia,d1x6i6d,2,t5_38zyp
