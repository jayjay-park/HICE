1416639,0,t1_citu9s9,gtOne is on an individual level the other is on a communal level. The Torah rewards and punishes on the individual level as well.  Just what do you think the stories of the patriarchs are all about?  Abraham isnt rewarded with spiritual blessings hes rewarded with lots of cattle anachronistic camels and lots of kids.  How about the punishment of Miriam?gtBasically its impossible to have such a system.Of course it doesnt work!  So you agree that the premise is dumb?gtIndividuals however are judged and this as you know determines our ultimate fate.But are they?  I mean you claim this but do you have any proof whatsoever?  Is there anything to show that some kind of divine judgment or karma or whatever mystical concept you want actually exists?  Because if not I call bullshit.  And Ill call it repeatedly until you or anyone else manages to conjure up some sort of verifiable and reproducible evidence.gtSuffering also is good for people.Read what you just wrote this is the kind of insane and disgusting thinking that religion promotes.  You are sanctioning atrocities. Its Calvinism all over again.  Wind is not suffering for a tree thats evolved to live in windy climes just as exercise isnt suffering for a human.  What kind of awful analogy is this? I mean you could make far better analogies but the conclusions should revolt you. How about the need for occasional forest fires to thin the underbrush and allow new plants to grow.  If it happens often enough most of the thicker trees will survive the fire.  If the forest becomes too dense the fire will burn much hotter and all the trees will die.  You can adapt that to a need for wars disease and infant mortality to thin the population.  If you dont have this the population grows too much and eventually crashes.  Frankly Id much rather live in a society that has eliminated the needs for those things thank you very much.,exjew,citurgs,1,t5_2seh7

You get to choose.gtWell couldnt plants exist for a day without the sun?No. Plants did not exist before the sun.

Oils major use is not for fuel for which it is relatively easily replaced.  Its major use is for lubrication and again there are synthetic alternatives to that as well theyre just costlier.gtBut what I was wondering was about how do you have hope and know about such things? I mean this is unlike anything that has ever happened before. Never has the entire world been in such danger.I dont know.  But if my choice is between humanity which has done stuff or a divine being which has never done anything outside of what is recorded in mythological books from thousands of years ago Ill go with the group that actually does stuff.gtWhich is why I expect the geulah.

1512632,0,t3_2bi49s,As others in this thread have already said Jews are both an ethnic group and a religion. However you raised an interesting point when you mentioned offending religious Jews by embracing the culture. Religious especially ultraOrthodox Jews tend to be somewhat incensed by culturalonly Jews because the statement that the latter group makes is in the eyes of the former I know Im Jewish and I have a strong sense of Jewish identity but Im not going to do anything about it. I want to participate in the fun parts of Judaism but not the parts that demand something from me i.e. observance. Having grown up in an ultraOrthodox home I can understand this sentiment even though it may not sound like it makes much sense but even though I understand it I dont agree with it. So I would advise you to just go for it and interact with Judaism in whatever way is comfortable for you. In my experience Jewish culture has a lot to offer even if you dont believe in the religious component.,exjew,cj5vv1x,1,t5_2seh7

Though other sources describe the apparently positive blessings he delivers upon the Israelites he is reviled as a wicked man  in the major story concerning him. Balaam refused to speak what God didnt speak and would not curse the Israelites even though King Balak of Moab offered him money to do so. Numbers . But Balaams error and the source of his wickedness came from sabotaging the Israelites as they entered the Promised Land. According to Numbers  and Revelation  Balaam returned to King Balak and informed the king on how to get the Israelites to curse themselves by enticing them with prostitutes and unclean food sacrificed to idols.

11746092,0,t3_67feod,Reform Judaism does being based these days not originally on the ideals of liberal American culture.  Other liberal American religions like UU are also fair to everyone.  Im not sure about Wicca but with how popular it is with girls it may not be a bad one in terms of fairness.gt Or does religion inherently involve the oppression of women?Men and women are actually different physically.  Women for example were invented specifically to care for children.  They carry the child while its developing and nurture it with milk after birth.  Men have a completely different role in this process and couple that with the different physical characteristics  men are bigger and stronger than women generally  it makes perfect sense for men and women to have different roles in society.Unfortunately this is often interpreted as having women be subservient to men the Torah itself supports this unfortunate interpretation for example instead of just different.  But pretty much any ancient society and even some notsoancient ones will treat men and women differently and expect different things of them which women may interpret as limiting their potential men dont get to give birth or breastfeed children but theyre historically OK with that.Traditionalist religion  specifically traditionalist  is necessarily going to support defined gender roles because it was natural for societies to treat people that way at the time that the tradition was codified.  We see that in orthodox Judaism we cut our sanctuaries in half  thats what mchitzah literally means  because some medieval rabbis objected to women doing important things in the synagogue.  But not all religion is traditionalist.  Liberal Judaism for example has done away with this mshugat.  So has liberal Christianity and any modern liberal religion is egalitarian.  If you view Orthodox Judaism as normative which is a reasonable view of things then Judaism oppresses women.  But its very difficult to view any particular branch of Christianity as normative and liberal branches dont have less of a claim on the religion than fundamentalist ones.gt Is there anywhere in the world where women are treated fairly and equally? And if so where is it and what religion if any is most prevalent there?Liberal America as well as liberal Europe.  The prevalent religion among European liberals is probably either none or some variant of Christianity and in the US I think its Christianity but the nones are catching up.,exjew,dgrg6hs,3,t5_2seh7
