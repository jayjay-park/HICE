927512,0,t1_ch9odnq,You have any experience using a quadtreeoctree as the underlying representation? A quadtree is supposedly one of the quickest implementations but I havent seen anyone actually use one thus far.,cellular_automata,ch9poei,2,t5_2tr1l

4273613,0,t3_39sn0j,Has there ever been a gamification attempt of CA? Im imagining two players setting up initial conditions and then altering their rules to consume the other player in a turn based CA or some sort? The idea is for players to either choose the best initial condition andor alter their rules in a way that beat the other player is this possible?,cellular_automata,cs7cr6q,2,t5_2tr1l

6471996,0,t3_44664m,Thanks for posting this. It is very interesting to look at. Perhaps you could post a bigger resolution one to rwoahdude,cellular_automata,czor0bl,1,t5_2tr1l

7261979,0,t1_d23jntc,Thank you for good suggestion. It could work pretty well for lines and other formations where head position could  can be inferred from tail and propagated length or xy offset in the grid. The propagation would probably have to go both ways to get it to log n. Of all things this is probably the most realistic and definitely worth a try.,cellular_automata,d23mwj1,1,t5_2tr1l
