238335,0,t3_1wtkpd,The BrickFan said it bestI usually dont write about controversial topics like this but this is something I would like to touch on. From what Ive seen many people have been praising Charlotte for writing such a powerful letter to LEGO. As a LEGO fan I have to disagree with Charlottes letter as well as to everyone Ive seen supporting her and heres why. LEGO has been trying very hard the past few years to get more younger girls building from the highly popular LEGO Friends sets as well as the newly released Disney Princess sets. Charlottes point in the letter is that she wants more female minifigure to have more adventures. There have been plenty of female minifigures in boys sets such as a robber in the High Speed Police Chase  as well as in the Police and Fire Accessory sets. There are also very strong female characters in the DC Universe sets like Batgirl Catwoman Poison Ivy and Harley Quinn. Heck even Eris from the Legends of Chima setscartoon series go on tons of adventures with Laval and usually saves Laval from harm. Lets also not forget about the female characters in the Star Wars sets like Princess Leia or Padme Amidala. Leia is in the Millennium Falcon sets and you can even let her pilot the ship if you wanted to. Finally take a look at Wyldstyle from The LEGO Movie. She is on an adventure with Emmet and the other Master Builders to save the world from Lord Business. It cant get any more adventurous than that! My point is that you should start making your own adventures with the LEGO bricks and minifigures. You dont have to follow what the set has given you. LEGOs mission statement has always been to inspire and develop the builders of tomorrow and to have children think creatively. I suggest that everyone kids and parents take a look at all the boys sets and you can see that there is unlimited potential of what female characters can do. If you want the female minifigures to swim with sharks then let them. If you want them to pilot a star cruiser why not let them fly it? If you broaden your vision of what LEGO has to offer you can see that LEGO has something for everyone.,lego,cf5gcgq,5,t5_2qhm7

280028,0,t1_cf9m0dz,Wait what  there are female characters in Chima? I havent noticed a single one in any of my sets  and countingOf course I never watched the animated series so for all I know  of them are supposed to be female but thats presicely the point you have to tell me some of them are supposed to be female. Going by the looks alone they are all blokes.And anyway they are not LEGO people in the first place. They are weirdo monster thingies.All that being said this is probably the first time ever I jumped onto the queeffree bandwagon and most likely the last. TLG is actually one of very few if not the only company that makes it laughably easy to teach your kid gender equality or really whatever set of values you want for that matter. Dont like the killer ninja robot? Part it out to build a fluffy bunny. Dont like fluffy bunnies? Use the bricks to build a fully functional crossbow. Dont care for the car in pink? Build it in  other colors or buy any of the  other car sets readily available at any given moment. Dont like the beauty salon? Buy the oil rig. And swap the male heads with female ones if you want to! If that aint easy then easy has no meaning. Seriously.

283911,0,t3_1xc5m4,In our house everything is together. My two boys are  and . My oldest is falling out of Lego and going into the dark ages. Sports and girls have his interest now. My youngest is getting into his full on building mode and out of the destruction mode. This is just part of our collection a older pictureWhen I first started building our display I was like the father and was terrible to the kids about touching stuff. They were much younger and in destructive phase so I was a little miltant about it. We had a few hurricanes in the house were EVERYTHING was destroyed. It involved their cousins who really have no respect for other kids toys. Both my boys have become protective of our display as they have gotten older. When they are really young you will have to have a separation of Lego no way around it. As they get older youll know when they are ready to join in on things.We have certain areas on the display that are private and off limits. No one is suppose to adjust or change things and then there is a free for all area were anything goes. This has worked well. I have certain sets and builds that are off to the side and the kids know they can play on them but not to change things. To leave them as they found them. They leave my minifigs alone that I have on shelves and I leave their builds alone. We are in the process of converting our garage into a Lego area and will have two x tables in there and the negotiations for what will happen have gone well.Think of it as a tiny little United Nations there is a lot of back and forth of what to do and not to do. It has helped my boys in real life they understand give and take respecting others property and choices and to work together with a common goal.,lego,cfa6wde,3,t5_2qhm7

Just because one doesnt have any on clearance does not mean another one  miles away wont!Alternatively check shopgoodwill.com for good deals.  Dont bid for awhile.  Just look to see what the prices are for the sets and how much they end up selling for.  Read the descriptions VERY CAREFULLY!

Great for learning interesting building techniques using just a small assortment of common elements. Although the book recommendation is that it is for yearolds and up I think it is more for older kids and adults. I would say  and up. Here is my review on it Also both volumes of The LEGO Adventure Book are great for ideas inspirations or just drooling over the pictures. It also has a bit of a story which is nice.

The barrels and the extra antennaeexhaust pipes on the back shouldnt overshadow what is a pretty great collaborative build IMHO. Another plus  for me  is that its a sturdier more substantial build.

Basically its comparable with LDD.There was also a mechanic called behaviors which are a way of bringing lego models to life so that could have allowed it to go forward turn left turn right etc. And it could be comparable with programming a mindstorms creation If you have ever done that.So in short yes.

It is just big enough to fit the LiPo battery pack. I will use the speed control function and control it with the simple switch. The bogey at the front is actually the Power Functions train motor. Wires will run just under the cabin through a slot and hangconnect through the undercarriage to the front bogey.Rear bogey uses larger wheels. This was the hardest part. I had to find the right parts to get it to the same height as the front assembly without restricting the rotation of the front or rear bogey. I think I got it.

1825754,0,t1_ck95jxm,gtI dont mean to come off as insensitive but how is this very much sexist?Asking questions is never wrong. The point of the female scientist set is to have serious female figures in science. There are female scientist figures from Lego but its more akin to this. with such beautiful descriptions asgtHead down to Olivias Invention Workshop to help her create a remotecontrolled pet robot! Together with all the pink and colorful parts not very serious.The image shows a female scientist messing up in her lab and men coming to help her.gtThat face was included in the set because it is a laboratory and shit happens. It seems more likely that the face was included because theyre not printing any new faces and needed a female face with glasses which didnt leave many options.gtBoth male and female scientists spill things. This is a common mistake The reverse argument and probably why you dont understand why its sexist. Just because something happens to both doesnt mean its not sexist to present one doing it.It might be hard to follow if youre unfamiliar with patriarchy and privilege but you have to understand that the male sex is right now the dominant sex and we very much do live in a patriarchal society. The female sex is in all ways a minority.There is a very big difference between the majority making fun of the minority the minority making fun of the majority and the majority making fun of the majority.A good primer on the subject can be found here.,lego,ck96zrp,-12,t5_2qhm7

Edit... there is a reason I wanted this set so bad. and a half years ago after being at my current employer for around a month my trainer and I went to some wind farm in west Texas. He didnt tell me what we were doing just said I would like it.Well we get there and a Manitowoc  series is sitting there he hands me the notebook which he had never done before that day. Tells me go find something. The crew had put it on the ground for us to inspect. I spent  hours going over every inch of the boom rigging and anything else I could get to. Loving every moment of it. When we were done they hoisted the beast into the sky it went on forever. They used it to place entirely assembled wind turbines into place. It was that day I knew what I wanted to do for a living. Now it wasnt it this configuration when I saw it. I have however inspected another that was. I have to say it is one of the most amazing things you will ever see. A true work of art and science.

You are going to give up on Lego because they made a few setsthemes you dont like? I mean I am definitely antilicensed sets but Im not going to stop buying Lego just because of that. There are still some awesome nonlicensed themes. Pirates and Elves are going to be new next year! gt It seems modern Lego is more of a marketing machine than ever Legoizing anything that is popular making new molds to fit their needs. It has lost that wonder aspect to it.I  disagree with this. I think all the new molds and greatly increased the wonder of Lego. Look at the incredible and detailed MOCs that people build these days which has definitely been due to the more detailed pieces. Newer bricks such as the masonry brick or cheese slopes add so much more detail. For me Lego is all about using your imagination to build things which can still be done even if there are licensed sets. Build MOCs for your favorite showsmoviesbooks that arent already existing or better yet make up your own story. You dont have to just buy sets build them and display them forever.,lego,clvv82e,24,t5_2qhm7

2329862,0,t1_clzo55i,I used BrickLink to inventory the sets. You can add entire sets broken down by the parts to your wanted list. I created a separate Wanted List for each modular.First I looked at my own collection of LEGO bricks and then would check off the items as I found them.After that I placed a few orders to get as many pieces in as few orders as I could at the cheapest places I could find. After that it I went after the rarer items and would add other missing pieces to those orders as well to try and cut down on overall shipping costs.Sometimes it makes more sense to spend a bit more per rare items if you can get them at one shop since shipping can add up.At times I would have multiple stores open in separate tabs and adjust my order inventory to make sure I was getting the best possible deal.Some people go after the rare items first and add in as many common items to those orders before doing the big purchases. I dont know what way ends up being cheaper but I probably would have gone that route had I thought of it.When each order came in I would check first with the invoice to make sure I got what I ordered accidents do happen with sellers and so far I have had nothing but positive things to say about BrickLink sellers that gave me wrong parts or shorted me. Then I would go to my wanted lists and subtract or delete items from it based on what I ordered. It made making each successive purchase easier.,lego,clzomm2,1,t5_2qhm7

Same size same shape same plastic same texture.  And the logo is written on the studs in the same orientation as what LEGO bricks would have.  When viewed upside down quickly the letters COBI in the font they use look very similar to the letters LEGO.I understand that Mega Bloks have a right to exist court cases the world over have stated this.

I rarely kept sets intact back then.  I was constantly doing MOCs.   Friends and I even recreated scenes and sets from Star Wars long before there were ever Star Wars sets.   We built the interiorexterior of the battle between Luke and Vader in Cloud City as one of the more memorable creations.

This lets you see the average price per piece and the average price per lot.It becomes a judgement call I consider how important the piece is if I expect more to be released later is a shortage temporary or permanent  ex any old gray shortage is permanent the new amount coming to BL is insignificant how much the variance in price is am I saving  cents per piece or  per piece by shopping at a given store? and decide what I want to set my maximum price to be for each piece individually.I do skip this for the common pieces  x x platesbricks etc... that are generally available for less than  cents.,lego,coeyxs3,6,t5_2qhm7

3454977,0,t3_2zt8xe,I have a knockoff Captain America that someone gave me. The very same one they have pictured on that site actually. The entire thing feels like a cheaper stiffer plastic and of the  printed parts the face printing is too far down on his head and the shield has a smudge on it. The colors are a bit off from the original. When you take the legs off of the torso the legs are only held on by  small clips which look prone to breaking unlike the large tubes that usually hold the legs to torso on a LEGO minifigure. I saw the other ones that my friend got from his set and the one he gave me had better printing than  of the others. One arrived with a missing hand and another had part of one of its legs broken. I do not recommend buying these.,lego,cpm3dn7,2,t5_2qhm7

3769782,0,t1_cqlw8e1,I dont have LDD installed so I cant see your design.  How largewide are you making it?  I made a roughly xx but I build a xx frame inside of it to make it a bit sturdier.  I didnt have the x bricks with studs on all sides so I had to modify the design and use the x brick with a single stud on the side  I just offset them a bit and they worked just fine.  I also used the x plate with a ring to reverse the studs in the frame.  I was then able to put my six face plates onto the frame.  I dont have pictures on me but I can post a couple after work if someone else hasnt answered your question better.,lego,cqlzdvv,1,t5_2qhm7

4221474,0,t1_cs1ecq9,Actually its for the machine that puts the arms on the torso. The printing machines put all the layers of colors on including the neck mark in one assembly line so the parts do not need to be reoriented. From the printing machine they are dropped into a bin before the arms are attached so the armattaching machine needs to reorient them.It doesnt always work either. Though LEGO is remarkably consistent I have found one torso in my years of buying with the arms attached backwards yes from a sealed set.Collectible series minifigs and some magnet figs which are made in China are done on newer machines and they do not have these neck marks. Also unprinted torsos never have neck marks.,lego,cs1fg2o,86,t5_2qhm7

I understand Disney  Lucasfilm wanting to keep these things close to the vest to avoid spoilers but really its just a movie.  There wasnt really a need to have a Force Friday  months before the film comes out.  If theyre not going to share full designs with the toy makers and the toys that come out dont really look like what will be in the film whats the point of having them?In this case they make the shuttle out to be pretty boring.  Im supposed to be excited by wings that raise and lower like its a super cool play feature? It isnt.  And if the ship doesnt even do what it is supposed to do on screen open up to the big V it is basically a waste of a toy.This ship looks really cool in the concepts we have seen  I just wish that Disney would have been a bit more open and shared more designs and especially the functions with the Lego designers.  The current Lego design for the ship is honestly quite bad.  Really I dont even think you can properly design the ship without seeing how it is used in the film  if it is actually quite important it will make the current mess even worse.,lego,cut6vi6,5,t5_2qhm7

5182173,0,t1_cvalwkw,Im never happy with the cost of them and what Ive spent but Im always fond of the memory I had building them. A memory I hope I hope to share with my kids when I have some. Being an adult and building Legos takes one down a nostalgic path. Seeing the things you grew up with be turned into miniature models and even life like scale if youve ever been to Orlando Studios Harry Potter is awesome! Building them is ever better! Its almost like attending a music concert. You didnt write the music you didnt sing the songs to hundreds of fans but you were there and you got to experience it! Building Legos is the same. You didnt design the kit you didnt create the original object but you got to build it and display it and enjoy the memories that the not only the kit brought you but also the original source as well and at the end of it all you can say Yeah I built that! Whether youre old or young first time builder or master builder youll never forget that first time you opened the box and poured out the contents and heard the crinkle of the bags and the hollow rainfall of Legos.,lego,cvan3yv,3,t5_2qhm7

Dont get me wrong there are a lot of great classic sets out there but youre also looking through rosecolored glasses and remembering how much fun you had as a kid. I love older sets too but revisiting some of them shows just how rough they can be compared to modern Lego. Did you buy any new sets for your son? If not you should take him to the store and let him choose what he wants then build it with him. You may be surprised to find that there are some pretty cool things going on with modern sets. And Im not saying all modern sets are great Ive come across some stinkers from all lines but if he likes it and enjoys it is it really that bad?Just some food for thought. ,lego,cvgbrr0,18,t5_2qhm7

5726422,0,t3_3tklbi,My son and I have started the tradition of building the daily Star Wars advent calendar sets for the past couple years. This year has been a little rough and stressful for us and I was short on funds at the time the calendars came out so I wasnt able to get one early like I usually do. I figured they would still be available still as the past few years Ive seen them stay on shelves pretty much up until closer to Christmas. Well I was wrong. And EVERYWHERE was sold out near me and even in cities in another state I have family in. Not wanting to pay twice the price on eBay and other places online I made a post a while ago and ufastlindyrick offered to help. I havent seen my son this excited and happy in a while and it nearly brought tears to my eyes seeing his joy. So after I asked permission to post this I wanted to let the Lego community how much my son and I appreciate this kind gesture. Edit As not to confuse anyone I did pay them back for the set plus shipping. We would have just gone without this year as I didnt want tocouldnt afford to pay the inflated eBayonline prices. I just thought it was awesome that a kind stranger stepped in to offer their time and effort and trust to make my kids holiday.,lego,cx6x2p4,103,t5_2qhm7

I got it when I was  and we never had a lot of money so I had little parts but made the most of it and I always wanted a train. I loved the idea that it could actually move. I envisioned train robberies mobile cities everything. So I begged and begged and finally bought it and it was great. But I didnt have money to buy any tracks so I was left watching it spin in circles for months and months. I tried everything. Making a semistraight line. Making it run into obstacles. Stripping the train and making my own. But eventually I got bored of it and threw it all in my big Lego bin.If I never bought that train I could have lived in ignorance but having that train for years and years and only having it spin in a simple circle was horrible for me.Eventually I finally started getting money for tracks but then I didnt have room and my focus moved on to other subjects. ,lego,cy9h1zf,-1,t5_2qhm7

Vader training a secret apprentice so he could kill off the emperor. so secret that the apprentice was working totally off the radar and you had to kill stormtroopers and Jedi. sure some stuff was over the top like the apprentice using the force to bring a star destroyer out of orbit and the sequel wasnt great but over all I thought the concept was great. certainly better than a lot of EU stuff.,lego,cyldvjb,1,t5_2qhm7

6203680,0,t3_40jxnj,Check shop.lego.com for the MSRP. If you buy sets at the MSRP then its a good idea to buy direct from Lego as youll get VIP which basically amount to a  discount. Its not much but it pays off in the long run.Sets dont typically decrease in price. The MSRP never changes. Some sets will be available on clearance typically towards the end of their lifespan that is after being on the shelf for  years. However this is unreliable as some sets may sell out or become scarce long before their prices are ever reduced. You may come across deals from time to time but if theres a particular set that you want then dont hold expect to find a great deal any time soon. That said Target and other retailers to have sales periodically which reduce the price by a little bit but these arent usually major decreases and shouldnt be relied upon.Ten cents per brick is a typical benchmark and sets at this price or less this are considered a good value. Typically licensed sets will cost more per brick and this is to be expected.,lego,cyusjcl,1,t5_2qhm7

LEGO brick is an object you step on at nightProper Use of the LEGO Trademark on a Web SiteIf the LEGO trademark is used at all it should always be used as an adjective not as a noun. For example say MODELS BUILT OF LEGO BRICKS. Never say MODELS BUILT OF LEGOs.Also the trademark should appear in the same typeface as the surrounding text and should not be isolated or set apart from the surrounding text. In other words the trademarks should not be emphasized or highlighted. Finally the LEGO trademark should always appear with a  symbol each time it is used. ,lego,cz7two4,-3,t5_2qhm7

Im not saying its dirty its clean but not as clean and pristine as Disneyland.  I took my family  years ago. The fun didnt seem as intense as Disneyland.  Its kind of a long walk between some of the areas at Legoland and the rides are generally on a smaller scale than what DL has.  There is NOWHERE else in the world that I know of that has as much big Lego creations on display as Legoland.  If you have kids the treehouse playground or whatever its called near the back of the property is pretty big and IMHO better than any of the playgrounds at DL.  Definitely worth going once.  After your trip you can decide if its worth going again.We went during winter so the waterpark wasnt open.  Another minor thing is that because Lego doesnt own the Legoland parks anymore you cant earn or redeem VIP points in the Legoland retail store.,lego,czh3cqi,5,t5_2qhm7

6571892,0,t3_45k37z,Yellow CastleIt wasnt even mine. A friend had it and I would play with it at her house. Eventually my parents started buying Lego for my sisters and I. When I started earning a little money mowing yards in the neighborhood I went bonkers on Castle theme. According to brickset.com I hadhave  Castle sets from between  and  costing . I dont think I bought any other kinds of Lego during that time and likely there are several I failed to include when filling out my Brickset profile.My interest in Star Wars is rather mild but I loved the giant Star Wars Lego sets primarily because they were giant. Again according to Brickset my  Star Wars sets total nearly x as many pieces and cost as my  Castle sets.Now Im more excited about Technic. Probably due to complexity and functionality more than anything. A  set every  months seems to get my Lego fix. And I enjoy puttering making inane contraptions that serve no purpose.When I watch my nieces and nephews play Lego its very much about make believe for them. Story telling and such  so the minifigs are important and little misshapen vehicles. But I want to make stuff that actually functions even if its useless functionality.,lego,czz36lx,1,t5_2qhm7

It should just be enough to have made a MOC of this and shared it on Flickr and Reddit. The true spirit of Lego is to build what you want what you see in your minds eye as in all  fans of this movie can and should just MOC their own truck thing.  Lego still needs to sell IP to stay profitable this will never be profitable IP for Lego though. Edit sorry for hating I dont like putting down creativity at all but as an offender myself I am uniquely qualified to comment on this.  I had an idea reach review it was a terrible concept and should never have been made it wasnt I only submitted it because the photo of the MOC had gotten mildly internet famous and I thought I should capitalize on that.

I was pissed he didnt even ask me if it was cool to do so or if I was OK with the box like that  hes just trying to get the line moving again which I understand but damn son. I had only stopped by to pick up a birthday and gift card on my way to a party so I didnt have time to get through the customer service line and deal with it on the spot. Rotten luck or so I thought at the time. When I got a chance to go deal with it the return went off without a hitch I got back to the toys clearance Isle not only to find a spaceport box in better condition than the first one I picked out even before cashiermanagerbrucebanner hulksmashed the bejesus out of it but discounted yet again to  gtgtgt and right smack dab next to a Lego creator set down to  gtgt.

Dont be afraid to use the lower lip of the separator as well. Ive also included a few photos because sometimes you have to build tricky columns using xs and keep them aligned.

Im also looking forward to a time when we can setup the growing Star Wars sets in a functional way to play since a good majority have been bought in my adult life and only been used to display. ,lego,d1pqv7k,2,t5_2qhm7

The Star Wars stuff I like is in the  range but as you want to mess around without the instructions an UCS model probably isnt your fit.If you have that budget tho Id suggest to take a look at  Tower Bridge a very impressive build with a lot of tan pieces allowing for some Star Wars Tattooine scenarios. In the end it probably comes down to the modulars like  or  if youre into city stuff that is. Very cool models with a lot of flexibility for a good price. ,lego,d3znf8x,1,t5_2qhm7

8190514,0,t1_d51clkt,Thats definitely a thought.  So I was thinking that if I finally get good at using LDD or whatever that I might try to make a third gray triangle ship thatd be about a inch VSD or ISD with directions  sort of a massmarket version of the Tyrant that lots of other people could build.  Itd be easy to make the model interchangeable between a VSD and an ISD depending on preference since all youd have to do would be to alter the bridge and add on the little atmospheric wings.  Apart from that the ships look the same especially at a smaller scale.  Id make mine a VSD but the ISD would be way more popular Id think.   inches would be about to scale with the Tyrant.  Thatd be smaller in size than the UCS which people might find disappointing but I dont think people quite realize how fast the mass increases when you tile the whole ship and add an interior.  So thatd probably weigh in at  lbs k bricks maybe which is doable.,lego,d51d6dj,14,t5_2qhm7

8229294,0,t1_d567bkl,So mining in Bitcoin is this really creative and nuanced thing. Ill try to make this really simple.So anyone can mine Bitcoin. But what is that process really? Fundamentally mining is a guessing gamecompetition between all the miners.So if you have a computer and I have a computer we both are trying to use our machines to guess the correct number between  and infinity that the Bitcoin protocol has chosen. The only problem is that I have a Windows  operating system and you have Windows ! So your system is way better at making more guesses at that mystery number is a shorter amount of time. Example My computer can only guess  numbers a minute but yours can guess  numbers a minute. This means you are more likely to guess the right number that the protocol is holding behind a closed door than I am.So your computer is better at mining. Whats the consequence of that? The reward!For solving the equationfinding the hidden number you get a reward! But once you find the number the competition starts over again with a new number behind a closed door that everyone is try to find. We call this process finding a Block. So Bitcoin mining is basically the biggest guessing competition is humantechnological history.there are three parts to the reward which you get for finding the correct number. The first is that you get the base reward of . Bitcoins deposited to your account like we discussed in the previous post.The second is that you get to choose which transactions to recognize as valid that are waiting to be recognized on the ledgerblockchain this is a entirely different rabbit hole Alice so I wont get into that...yet. But why should you choose some transactions as valid over others?Because there is a transaction fee that you also collect as a reward. And this is the third part of the reward. You get all the transactions fees associated with the transactions you choose to verify!WOOOOOOOOOOOOOW,lego,d567v6w,1,t5_2qhm7

8317905,0,t1_d5h9zq9,gt Not everyone is in the same financial situation as you.A fact Im more aware of than you are.gt is a lot of fucking money.It really isnt.gtStop acting like this is a simple situationWhy? It is.gtbecause I sure as hell dont make enough extra money to be able to afford that kind of stuff.You either do or you could and the problem is your budgeting. Im  certain of this. Eat lentils every day for a couple months or go get a better job youll be at SDCC next year.Oh you wont eat lentils for a couple months? You wont get a better job? Then stop pretending this is a financial problem and start admitting its a personal one.gtI have to rely on the generosity of others to fund any extra expenses including this entire hobby that I love dearly.For extra funds while I was in college I did private tax preparation. Ive seen people who were dramatically worse off than I was living dramatically better lives due to the effort theyve put in and Ive seen dramatically better off people than I living dramatically worse lives due to the amount of effort they wouldnt put in. The guy who drove me to DragonCon one year in exchange for tax preparation made less than ten thousand dollars a year working in a gas station at night and he went to DragonCon which at the time was a much more expensive event than SDCC is now.You can live in a hovel. You can eat cheap food. You can cook every meal yourself. You can bike and bus everywhere you go. Any of these you dont do is a personal choice that puts financial strain on your budget not some sort of hardandfast financial barrier. gtWhere I reside we do not get paid a living wage.This may blow your mind but you can move or get a better job. Jobs dont historically come back to communities for a minimum of a decade no matter the reason they left. The period of employment fluctuation from peak to peak or dip to dip is ten years at a minimum for a region. Its not worth desperately clinging to an area thats dying or dead in hopes anything will change.Or if the problem is education as in you didnt get your HSD then there are free GED programs in many places and really really cheap ones in most others. Is there not one in your area? Move. Lack of a social safety net on such a basic level is not an indicator of no its objective proof of a selfconsuming lowincome hellhole.And if the problem is that you didnt get an education as in you didnt get a Bachelors then stop making things up. I know security contractors literally just guys who walk around malls at night making k on an HSD. You can get a better job. It may not have hours you like or be in a field you want but its a better job and your financial problems will disappear.Will you not move? Will you not get a better job? Will you not further your education? Then stop painting your personal problems as financial ones. Its insulting to people who have real financial problems like multiple thousands of dollars of medications they need to stay alive every month.,lego,d5halx0,0,t5_2qhm7

Is it all one thing?I have a few with those early minifigs such as    and one of my favorites of the era .What are the old sets near the bottom of the second picture  the white building with a red roof and the blue and red building next to it?

We have some grocery stores where I live that carry Lego products and employees get something like  off everything in the store. And they dont discriminate Lego products.Another one of the best deals I got was a lady selling off her boyfriends stuff on the account that they just had a bad breakup.Also possible that a parent is selling off their kids toys because they are bombing in school this is what my mom did when I was a kid and just shoved everything in a box and sold it for  at a garage sale.I wouldnt say it was necessarily stolen.,lego,d8j4qhr,5,t5_2qhm7

9478892,0,t3_5am1bw,I got a request last week from uDeAuTh to do Hooh and since I had no other ideas I figured Id give it a shot! Deauth specifically wanted to Bricklink it so I challenged myself by only using parts available IRL e.g. Bricklink and keeping the model at a smaller scale than I normally build legendaries at to minimize cost. So anyway here it is! All you have to do is order the parts on Bricklink. No idea how much  thatll cost. Im fairly pleased with how it turned out constraints notwithstanding. In terms of the head there was no way to fit four feathers on top and making super realistic eyes was always going to be an uphill battle so I did the best I could and I think it looks alright. The most technical aspect of the model comes with the tail which is made from two stacked parabolic rings one of which is rotated  degrees so that the two feather rings protrude at different angles giving a much fuller look. If youve been following my other models youll also notice that the feet are very similar to Combuskens feet from last week. Getting bird feet right at this scale is quite difficult and I havent figured out a better way of doing it yet.One of the challenges of digitally designing MOCs that are intended to be built IRL is ensuring that any joints are stiff enough to hold up the portions in question. For the wings I used hinge plates to get that curve upwards and eventually decided to double up on them just to ensure that the wings wouldnt sag as they got heavier. The legs are attached to the body by small ball joints for maximum posability which Ive never used IRL so Im not sure how stiff they actually are. Im fairly confident that the model can stand on its own two feet if you fold the tail up. Speaking of I also included a standplatform for the model in the LXF file so that you can pose Hooh like I did in the render albeit with a rod sticking out of its butt. I uploaded directions and a parts list generated from LDD in html format to my Bricksafe where you can also download the lxf file itself. Let me know what you think!And if you build it send me a pic!Edit Thanks for the gold! D,lego,d9hh755,8,t5_2qhm7

Ive been prototyping it with the colors I have all the wrong ones but have recently begun ordering all the right colors on Bricklink. Over the next two weeks I will have almost every piece I need for the final build. With a little luck it should be ready in January but further delays wont surprise me one bit. Two main reasons for delays so far are  Budgeting.  I started planning it in dark red but that turned out to be cripplingly limited. Lego doesnt produce all the pieces I need in dark red and I had already purchased a bunch of pieces in this color so I had to switch to regular red which is more accurate  should have done this from the start.EDIT Heres a photo of part of the mockup ,lego,dbeyd6l,1,t5_2qhm7

I lost interest when the first Batman came out and with all the suits it completely put me off the game.

10958994,0,t1_deab77u,Yup probably. Weve tried with the full high speed and we have had the cargo train go round on its own but ive not tried the cargo with all its carriages yet. That part was always going to be a gamble tbh. If Jakey wants to play with trains proper well set them up on the living room floor as we always have where theres loads of room for more interesting track shapes.Edit Just tried it the full cargo train can get up with plenty of welly and back down with care if its wheels stay on the track. Something about the engine set of wheels is not quite right doesnt have the same turning circle as the high speed and keeps catching on the underside of the train and derailing  even on flats. Ill have to check weve built it correctly as I cant find anything online to suggest this is an issue with the set itself. If I get it working Ill update with a gif of it going around.,lego,deacc51,1,t5_2qhm7

I think most people find that set to be overpriced so maybe well see similar sales this year on something like Encounter on Jakku .    I wouldnt be surprised to see the Hoth UCS set on sale at some point but I wouldnt expect it on sale in May. Im guessing sales are low on that set but not sure.

I can vouch that both hair pieces from the Fun in the Park set  were disappointing. I resorted to using tiny amount of putty adhesive.,lego,dgkxa57,2,t5_2qhm7
