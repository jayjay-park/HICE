244202,0,t3_1wwr69,Watercolour pencils are very different from regular coloured pencils. Watercolour pencils are designed to be blended with well water. Regular coloured pencils work with a wax base and therefore blend better.A good way to potentially erase watercolour pencils would be to blend them out with water and then use either a dry brush or a paper towel to soak up the majority of the pigment.Also dark coloured pencils cover graphite easily so if you have trouble losing your initial outline you could potentially keep the outline under the darker portions of your piece.Otherwise...just takes some scratch paper and experiment.,learnart,cf62azl,3,t5_2s6fc

739590,0,t1_cgoaxes,Im gonna get downvoted for this but anime and manga are the worst places to start learning how to draw properly especially when it comes to human proportion.Anime and manga use a particular style that is based upon realism but in itself is not very realistic. Those artists were taught traditional and realistic art techniques before picking up that animemanga style.Its one of those you gotta know the rules before you can break the rules scenarios and its probably why youre confused on proportions.Hit your library for a how to draw book and start there. Or look around online. I recommend any how to draw book by Andrew Loomis or Jack Hamm. Both of those artists make excellent books for amateurs and pros alike.You can always work yourself into the animemanga style later on. However if you start with the animemanga style and eventually try to draw something different youll just be making a lot of extra work for yourself as you try to unlearn the animemanga style before you can start working on whatever the different style might be.I hope that makes sense.,learnart,cgocgf9,10,t5_2s6fc

940295,0,t3_24vlqc,First off you need more contrast. Your darks need to be darker and your light needs to be lighter. The way that it is now is ok but everything seems too much like a blur of grey especially when the reference photo has very bright spots the sky and very dark spots shadows under the archs and tree bark in background. You also seem to take shortcuts with the flora in the picture and just made them blurs and scratches of grey. That made your drawing lose the atmosphere that the reference picture exude.Im not sure if youre looking to replicate the picture exactly or if youre simply attempting to reconstruct the general shape and structure in the picture. If its the prior then you are relying too much on straight lines in a single direction. It makes your drawing look flat. Theres no texture to the stones or the ground which made it look like you were drawing the inside of a clean building instead of ruins covered in plant growth. If you were looking only to correctly grasp the shape of the structures then you should attempt more modern buildings with sharp lines and smooth textures so you can focus on drawing with correct angles.Id advise you to focus on making your drawings as congruent as possible. The pillars should stand up straight and their vertical lines should be fairly parallel. Being a few degrees off can make a big difference especially on a small picture. You need to work on your scaling too. The arch nearest is too wide and those in the back are too small giving your picture a somewhat reverse?fisheye effect.Most of all you should focus your attention on the lighting. You rely too much on giving objects a concrete boundary with a line when you should focus on showing how one object is darker than the other. E.g. the top of the arches is darker than the sky yet you felt the need to draw a line to separate the two which wasnt necessary. What you could have done was kept the sky white while giving some shading to the arches keeping a clear definition between one and the other. The same can be seen with the shadows under the arches too. The edges of the arches have a line much darker than the shadows themselves when both are one and the same and should be fairly uniform with a gradient as it tapers off.Try different shading techniques. You are keeping with a simple back and forth motion in a single direction and we can see just how you did it which you should be trying to avoid because it makes your drawing look amateur rushed and not a lot of effort put in to make accurate depiction. A picture needs some variety and most of all you want it to look polished unless you are intentionally going to a unrefined look.Invest in a ruler if you plan on drawing buildings or anything with a lot of long straight lines itll make drawing much easier and cleaner.,learnart,chb615k,3,t5_2s6fc

1214467,0,t3_280fho,I would say start working on anatomy and work on using cleaner lines.The way to work on anatomy is to study figure drawing. Heres one and two videos to give you an idea how its done. Theres no cut and dry way to do it there are only guidelines. In one of the videos the guy even says that the rules are meant to be broken. But its good necessary even to have SOME kind of method for it. Study people and use them as references even if youre drawing a long fingerlong neck alien dude. Once you learn how to properly structure and draw figures just practice it a lot. Its something you kind of just have to get the feel for.And on that note practice drawing using smoother lines. Theres no way to do this except draw more. Slow down and dont scribble so much. A lot of the motion should come from your elbow not your wrist even if youre using a tablet. Sketchiness is fine for a rough sketch thus the name but even if you want a scratchy style the scratchiness of the lines should be build on a foundation of smoother more solid lines underneath.

So I find myself tilting my head while drawing and start to skew it twords straight.  Then it starts getting off because I halve to kind of tweek stuff to fit the new angle.The shading is great and at a glance I can see the resemblance so the drawing isnt that far off but that angle thing kind of throws all the stuff off just a bit.

Thats a really common error. It slows you down breaks your rhythm and you end up with a hairy looking line. Try this. Draw your knife ten times and use only one line for each drawing. Put the pencil on the paper and draw one smooth line and only lift the pencil when youre done. Dont scribble back and forth or erase anything and dont worry if you get the shape perfect. Just draw nice smooth lines. If they still look scribbled then draw faster and faster until youre forced to draw smoothly.

Were not resultsoriented.Externally your drawings are ok but internally theyre not even there. Theres no life to them theyre just shells.

2211925,0,t1_clkz2zu,Its not a problem at all. Just saying theres no practice to CampC about overpainting.  Ill just assume you were looking for realism in which case you did well with the shading and light but youll need to pick more closer colors. Some examples Eyes are never really all the way white. As you can see if I draw a white line through this picture  Its not gray either. Its got this brownish tint. Its ever so slight but its there. This is because its hit with a lot of reflected light and because the whites of the eyes arent really white. The skin is a tough since skin tone contains a lot of variation but in general this one could be improved with some lighter values to pick out form changes. Too many dark values make her look very tan. The gradation on the lips have too strong a value change and make her lips look very sharp.Smoothing out that line could probably help it not look so glued on. The hair on the right side is very very dark and kind of blurry. The darkness isnt a problem the blurriness kind of makes it seem a bit unrealistic I guess. The hair on the left seems to have the age old too much detail problem. Too many strands of hair. The reason why lots and lots of strands often looks fake is because of two things. First that when there are so many strands and they arent actual hair sized usually we cant avoid drawing them a little bit thicker than they actually are it will look fake just because. But the biggest problem is that a bunch of strands takes away from the shape of the hair and makes it look very bristly. Hair clumps together even if we can see individual strands. For some TLDR info Push your values. Darker darks and lighter lights. Push the differences to get more shape and form. Be careful with hard edges.Hair. Work larger shapes first then work your way down to detail. Color. Go over it again and pick closer colors to your subject. Be meticulous.

2685842,0,t3_2qouks,Definitely do this! Since you already know what you want to paint buy a tin of pencils in various hardnesses and a sketchbook  preferably at an art store. Online dickblick in the U.S. is good. Art store because not all paper is very suitable for drawing and not all pencils are made equally. Just get the cheapest option at the art store and it should be fine Like others said it is a skill that can be learned. Buy an anatomy for artists book that has dogs in it. Take lots of pictures of your dogs and sketch away. Learn how to set up a drawing get proportions right. Get the values right in greyscale. Then learn some color theory  James Gurney light and color book and how to mix color  Ive found Mark Calders tips on this subject very helpful but would rather judge and mix by sight than the way he does it. Set up a sketch in canvas and start painting. Make a choice about what type of paint you want to buy. Oils or acrylics. You can switch later but stick with one first  you cant mix them. You can paint oil on top of dry acrylics. You can not paint acrylics on top of dried oils.Acrylics dry fast so you dont have to wait before you can continue but they dont blend or glaze very easily. Clean up is easy. Oils blend and glaze well but dry slowly. Clean up involves turpentine   smell! unless you get water mixable oil paint  then its an easy soap and water clean upLook at deviant art website or Google images and look at a lot of paintings done with acrylics and a lot in oils and you should pick what effect you like best. You do not need a lot of colors to be able to mix a lot of different colors. You can of course start painting at the same time as you start to learn drawing but it helps if you at least have some knowledge as a basis unless you dont care about realism or likeness at all  likeness to either reality or to what the finished image in your head looks like.,learnart,cn95r4a,1,t5_2s6fc

The aim is not for showcase although you can always show it to people if you like it I do that anyway but for your own learning for your own art fitness and to remind yourself why youre drawing in the first place.But of course I have seen people who become good at art without doing all these things as in they only do their main projects and not practice much outside of that.

4483352,0,t3_3chrg3,Since you said your light spot was coming from the top right the bottom left would logically be the darkest area. This also depends on where exactly the light is too. Is it more infront of Blitz or behind him? You have to remember life is  dimensional so top left only indicates  dimensions figuring out if the light is infront of or behind Blitz is your rd dimension.If the light is infront of him his right leg would be mostly out of the light due to the mass of his body kind of like how the splash art is yet you coloured the leg with the same brightness as the rest of him.Dont forget about the shadows cast from other object. Like how I mentioned the right leg should be darker it is because his body is casting a shadow over his leg. When the light hits other parts of his body they also cast shadows. His head should cast a shadow like in the splash art. In the splash art it is from the blue electricity on Blitzs right hand and the shadow is cast on the left side of his neck. Also look at the spikes. They too cast a shadow onto his neck area. See the two shadows? This is caused from the unknown light source coming from the top right of the splash art.All in all you have a pretty decent idea of how to start your shading. I would continue to study the splash art and utilize similar shading techniques. For practice at home to get an idea of shading you can use a desk lamp and aim it at different objects with different surfaces like a shiny apple or a dull cardboard box and try using the light at different angles round the objects. This will help you get an idea of shadows being cast by the object and how the lamp lights up the objects. You can also try grouping objects together to get an idea of how they cast shadows on each other.,learnart,csvsj7d,2,t5_2s6fc
4575707,0,t3_3dltbi,The horizontal line where your hair starts on your forehead  dont draw that. Just show that line exists with the vertical lines you drew for the strands of hair. The shape of your face is not the same as the one in the picture. In your drawing your cheeksjaw are too wide. It may be a good idea to draw from a better quality photo of yourself so you can include details like eyelashes. Your eyes in your picture are too big and your eyes in real life droop down more on either side. You learn in art class that eyes are almondlike and thats generally true but theres variation. You would do better not drawing almonds but just drawing the shapes you actually see for your eyes. Parts of your nose like the the part close to your left eye should be shown more through shading than through lines. Also and this is really important theres no shading in your picture. So much can be shown through shading such as the structure of your forehead see above your eyebrows towards the side of your head it goes in a bit? so theres some shade there cheek and jawbones etc.Remember to draw things as you actually see them and not as you think they should look conceptually. The oval shape of your head in your drawing and the almond eyes are two examples of that. Maybe your art teacher told you to do that but you really shouldnt listen. ,learnart,ct7djce,1,t5_2s6fc

5835344,0,t3_3v5fyb,Right now Id say stop and think. Figure out what exactly it is that has your interest as right now things seem very vague and uncertain. Thats understandable but if you make big decisions like this without a solid understanding of what the fields youre looking at entail you could just end up in another situation where things did not turn out the way you expected. It happens but that can often be mitigated.Right now youre not doing what you love. What exactly is it you love? Think about specific tasks you can see yourself doing and dont worry about associating them with specific jobs just yet. Pin down what it is that you would like to be doing first.I can tell you right now the concept of combining art with programming can be misleading to a lot of people. I myself went into college with that mentality and I majored in interactive multimedia design. Both programming and concept artillustration were my hobbies and instead of settling on one to make a career I entered a college program I figured would allow me to nurture both.I cannot speak to all interactive multimedia programs but the one I graduated from did delve into a wide range of topics including graphic design d modeling d animation game development web development programming photography illustration video editing and so on but because of the broad nature of interactive multimedia it was like a buffet. You tasted this and that and then the bulk of your experience would come from taking on a role in a group project.In the long run youd either establish yourself in a specific capacity and do that every time or you would do a bit of everything and become a jack of all trades master of none. Its not always up to you however as group work can have you filling roles you might not choose on your own largely because of vacuums that need to be filled and work that needs to get done. I got stuck with that a lot of the time  I started to lean more towards art as far as my interest and preference went but my roles all went towards the programming end of things just because I was good at it and most of the people in the program were not.Through the course of the program I came to realize that I was not combining art and programming  at least not in the way that I had hoped I would. I was aware of both worlds but I was still serving a specific purpose that was either art or programming. Not both. There is definitely a massive benefit from being aware of all of those roles and how to accomplish them to an extent but that comes second to being really good at what your personal role is. Being a jack of all trades puts your priorities in reverse and may make you okay at all sorts of things but if you dont have one thing you can do very well and that youre willing to do for a company all year round youre going to be a harder sell as a potential employee.That is why I say figure out what it is you want to do. Each and every role one can play in a company has its specific set of skills and this loose idea of blending interests doesnt exist in the way we want it to. That absolutely does not mean that a role does not exist that will satisfy you in exactly the way you need it simply means that you need to figure out what each one involves.I can tell you about various roles in the game industry that do exist  at least the ones that I know enough about Game Design People treat this as an umbrella term but its not  its a very specific role. A game designer excels in understanding the psychology of the player and how they will interact with a game. This focuses quite heavily on understanding puzzle dynamics which means both obvious puzzles as well as interactions the player will experience where the puzzle elements are hidden and more subtle. Knowing how to arrange challenges and pace the player through a game so that theyre not constantly facing impossible challenges and not constantly just taking a walk in the park. Understanding your player is key. Understanding how and where your player is willing to invest money is also key especially in this pervasive market of freemium mobile games. Game Programming You should be pretty familiar with this  its just programming though game logic certainly has its own particular flavour to it. Your compsci design patterns and all of that still plays a major role here and most of the game programmers Ive met have come out of computer science programs. Concept Artist  A concept artists job is to communicate visually. While illustration is definitely a component of the job and has increased in importance over the last couple decades what with the importance being placed on art books and presentable visual concepts the key is still communication. The concept artist takes the ideas that are floating around in the early stages and fleshes them out. They make the design decisions when it comes to characters environments props etc. The best way to think about a concept artist is crates and barrels  no one ever even bothers to think about the crates and barrels but theyre pervasive in environments in all sorts of games. Nobody even notices them but theyre there  and its the concept artists job to design them such that they belong. Crates and barrels are their bread and butter. UI Artist This is more graphic design heavy  a good understanding of typography layout gridding colour theory etc. is key. Knowing where to use simplicity knowing where to apply complexity and knowing how to balance it all so that it is not only cohesive as a design but also so that it joins with the underlying game graphics in such a way that it is draws your attention or blends in where it needs to  this is all the realm of the UI artist. D Artist The D artist takes the fleshed out designed concepts from the concept artist and turns them into viable game assets. The main thing here is D modeling pushing vertices laying out UV maps and so on. More and more these days D artists are also being expected to be familiar with D sculpting tools like zBrushsculptris and mudbox. Another facet of this is texture painting which may or may not be separated into a separate role depending on the studio. The same goes for animation  there are character artists who do everything from modeling to UVing to texturing to rigging to animating and there are artists who will do sections of this. Overall theres a balance between artistic and technical aspects to this with modeling texturing and animating focusing on the creative side of things while UV mapping and rigging move towards the technical side of things. This kind of thing can be quite different from the kind of technical experience one might glean from programming however. Its really an entirely different beast  one you might enjoy as a programmer or one you might hate.Personally I graduated from college got a job as a game programmer and quit after a little more than a year. I decided that Id prefer to program my own projects and that Id be happier drawing for a living. Unfortunately my art was not up to par so I took my savings flew down to Los Angeles Im from Canada spent two terms six months at Concept Design Academy first brushing up on my fundamentals then focusing on more applicable skills like illustration and understanding of form languagedesign. Came back to Canada and used my new skills to construct a fresh portfolio that focused on the things that I wanted to do as an artist for a company. My portfolio included full illustrations that focused on demonstrating strong composition use of colour and storytelling as well as designfocused pieces that included environments with complex and detailed cut out drawings of interiors and characters that walked through every step of the design process.Im working now as a concept artist but I have to admit that my skills as a programmer have played a big role in my being hired and my dodging the layoff axe. I work for a small studio  an environment where everyone needs to be able to play multiple roles in order to stay relevant. I might spend a month doing environment designs and then the next two months developing a standalone analytics data visualizer because theres no other art that needs doing and the other programmers are busy working on the core product. The additional skill keeps me relevant to the team but whats most important is that I can serve my primary purpose as a concept artist when needed.So in conclusion  figure out what you want to do. Figure out what you would be happy doing for an employer and then see if there is a role out there that will match. Then study to do that. Its not always easy to decide on a particular path without having the chance to dabble but youve done four years of school already. Time and money are precious so a few months of dabbling on your own to figure out what you enjoy most while continuing to work your programming job will be much cheaper than going halfway through a masters program and realizing this also is not what you want to do.Lastly  when youre looking at schools look beyond the dazzling lights. A lot of schools will offer you the moon and give you a yellow paper plate at the end of your journey. This is doubly true for Multimedia programs.Oh yeah if you want to sharpen your skills for school portfolio reasons the lessons I post at  might help.,learnart,cxkjgsr,17,t5_2s6fc

6060107,0,t3_3yj4pm,If you want to improve your values then consider working in grayscale so you can focus purely on that. Likewise even when working from imagination it can be handy to have photo reference again ideally converted to grayscale.When comparing your drawing to a reference photo the thing that most notably stands out is the extreme whiteness of his skin. When rendering something try to think of the local color or local value of that object. White male skin despite the name of course isnt purely white. Its tan colored or a desaturated orange and has a light gray value. Where untinted light hits perpendicular to a surface you will observe the local color. The more the surface angles away from the light the darker it will become. In a vacuum once the surface angles parallel to the light source no light will be able to bounce off that surface and it will appear  black. Usually however there will be other objects in a scene from which light can bounce off and lighten up the shadow side of an object this is called reflected light. In this case the surface parallel to the light source will receive the least amount of reflected light and therefore be the darkest also known as the core shadow. The brightest spots on an object will be the active highlight. These appear when light bounces off the surface of an object directly into the eye or lens of the observer. These spots therefore change depending on the position of the observer whereas the other aspects of light stay consistent.Because the skin of your character is too light it makes the image appear as an overexposed photograph. The shadows are also rather dark. In most normal lighting scenarios reflected light would lighten the shadow side up more. A good rule of thumb for generic lighting situations is going halfway to black meaning taking the local value of the object and then picking the value that lies in the middle between there and pure black. This will be the darkest part of the shadow.To make the values of the skin on your character appear more natural and less over exposed you could lighten up the darks and darken up the lights. You could then go in and add active highlights here and there. Like the values the color could also use a little less contrast. The skin quickly moves from a very desaturated yellow to a saturated pink. Drastically reducing the amount of hue shifting and slightly saturating the lightest areas would make the color appear more natural.Finally regarding the visibility of the characters contour this is largely about contrast. The higher the contrast of an object against its background the more it will stand out. Currently there is very little contrast between your character and the background. This because the light value of the skin sits against a light background whilst the dark value of the pants sit against a dark background. To make the full character pop youd want to have your background the other way around.While you could make the whole background contrast with your figure another approach would be to selectively contrast against key focal points. In an image the area of highest contrast will stand out the most and is where a viewer will likely look first. By controlling where this area is you can lead the eye of your viewer to a chosen focal point.Currently the area of highest contrast in your image is probably either the light value of the lower fist against the medium value background or the medium value of the upper pants against the dark background. This is probably not what you want the viewer to look at first. A good choice for a focal point is usually the head of a character. You could make this focal point pop out by putting a dark background around the head. Another important focal point for this pose is probably the foreshortened fist coming at the camera. Currently this fist is poorly visible because it blends in with the rest of the body. Finding a way to increase the contrast between the fist and the torso would really help with the readability of the pose.,learnart,cydz44y,5,t5_2s6fc

6308887,0,t3_420z9q,There are most likely two reasons as to why you are having trouble. Firstly to be able to cast an accurate shadow you must understand how the object you are lighting exists in d space. This because you need to know which planes of the object are facing the light and which are cast into shadow. To learn this you need to have a foundation in perspective and need to be able to construct objects out of d primitives.The second problem is not knowing how light interacts with form. This includes things like knowing about the core shadow or reflected light as well as knowing how to plot cast shadows.

One of the benefits to working digitally as you are is that in order to check up on your proportions you can paste your drawing over the photo as a separate layer.

Try reading Perspective Made Easy and How to Draw by Scott Robertson for some good technical stuff. Make sure you know what the picture plane and cone of vision are.Think of it this way there are three dimensions back and forth side to side and up and down aka X Y and Z Every D object you draw exists in these three dimensions. Each vanishing point corresponds to one of these three axis. Every object has its own vanishing points like so but objects that are parallel to each other share the same ones. So why do one and two point perspective exist when there are  dimensions? Because if an axis is parallel to the picture plane it will never converge. Heres an example with minecraft Because the red blocks are parallel with the picture plane in this case my monitor they are never getting further away so they never get smaller and will never converge into a vanishing point. However if I turn my character ever so slightly the red blocks are no longer parallel to the picture plane and start to converge into a vanishing point off screen as they are slowly getting further away from the picture plane.So in  point perspective  of the axis are parallel to the picture plane. In  point perspective only one axis is usually the updown axis. In three point perspective none of them are.Hopefully this helps. I suggest downloading google sketchup placing a few cubes and observing how they change as you change perspective or when you rotate them. Even if you think you understand something it can take lots and lots of practice before you can put that knowledge into use so keep practicing!,learnart,d1g57fi,7,t5_2s6fc

7087292,0,t3_4cllrf,Professional animator here. First off good luck. You will learn quite a lot while in animation school about design and characters. Expect to put in a lot of work on your own to improve your actual animation because most schools focus on the art side of things over animation. It thankfully relates to itself and knowing one makes the other easier and vice versa. They will also push you away from drawing in the anime style because it is a portfolioreel killer outside Japan. Your own adaptable style is much more important than falling into a rigidly defined style that many people already copy.Your head design is pretty good and on point. You should really spend the same amount of effort on the rest of the body where your anatomy falls apart. The reason this is important is because in animation everything is collaborative. If another artist was given the design and told to animate with it it will be be off model almost immediately because it is missing landmarks and the anatomy is wrong. The hip line for example should be slanted to show which leg is taking the weight. If it isnt there the artist may interpret that as the character having a longer or shorter leg a problem with the spine something weird with the costume etc. The same can be said of the boots the eyes the ridges of the hair etc. Also anatomy wise in a contraposto that you are attempting your shoulders are tilted the wrong direction. I wont talk about the hands because in d animation hands can be almost anything and be appropriate though from a design standpoint the level of design for the whole character should be of a consistent level. You dont want a character with a realistic face and a stick figure body it would just look weird. The same can be said of the less exaggerated version of that.Keep at it though. You have some good potential. Life drawing would be a significant benefit to you. As would gesture and looser drawings.,learnart,d1jpnaj,7,t5_2s6fc
7105205,0,t1_d1logu9,To elaborate a little on that something that took me a while to realize was that you dont use a marker the same way you use a pencil. Inking and using markers are techniques unto themselves if anything its closer to painting than drawing but not exactly like either. You need to intentionally practice making smooth continuous lines of different lengths and thicknesses and weights just like you need to practice accurately drawing objects or composing an image.  Actually drawings like yours are perfect practice for this since the beauty of the line is the whole point. It might help to look at calligraphy as well. As for good ways to make a pencil sketch permanent Scan it or take a good photo. Pencil will always smudge and fade no matter what you do to try and stop it. ,learnart,d1lqy94,2,t5_2s6fc

I was super nervous when I went to take my first drawing class last fall because I had never drawn around people nor had I taken an art class before. I found out quickly that it was not as scary as I expected it to be. Artists are generally really supportive and nice sometimes so much so that you cant get any really good feedback especially in real life. I doubt anybody is going to blatantly point out that youre very very bad in fact there may be people even more beginner than you. The only way I found I could stop being worried about people seeing my art in real life was to just force myself to do it and let them look at it and talk about it when they wanted to.

7697623,0,t1_d3gi3eo,There are many benefits to attending a degree program in artdesign but I think the greatest advantage that is literally not possible to achieve by only going to workshopseventsateliersbeing selftaught is being surrounded every day by an extraordinary concentration of creative people in one place for a period of four years. Before I went to RISD as an undergraduate student I had never actually met a true working artist who had an actual professional career.  The professors I had at RISD were the real deal  they had thriving careers in their field they exhibited their work at high end galleries they won prestigious grants in their field. Ive lived in several different cities in my lifetime and I have never found a community that had that many accomplished artists in one place who I was exposed to for such a long period of time. The students I met were incredibly focused serious and their presence inspired and pushed me far beyond anything I could have done by myself.  I think all artists including myself have a tendency to get stuck in their own heads and you need other people around you to get a fresh set of eyes to critique your work. Workshopseventsateliers are all good experiences but the problem is that conferences are only a few days tops workshops are generally a one time event and ateliers tend to be very small organizations where you dont get to meet as many people. In a degree program you foster deep long lasting relationships with your peers and professors over the  years that you spend at the school and this is an opportunity that is simply impossible if you are self taught. One of my former professors from RISD is now one of my closest friends weve known each other for  years!  I would never have developed that friendship if I hadnt gone to art school. Yes there is an unprecedented amount of art knowledge available online today but so much of it is so poorly organized and scattered in so many different places that I think one would have to wade through a lot of poor content before they found anything that was actually helpful. Ill talk about this more in some of the questions below but not only are these artistic relationships crucial to your growth and progress as a artist but they are the gateway to your career.  There is no artist who makes a successful career entirely by themselvesask any artist who has been successful in their careers and they will probably name at least  or  people who were instrumental in helping them. Art school is terribly expensive and its really not fair that so many people cannot attend for financial reasons.  And some people can piece together instructional experiences but that continuity and depth is really only something you can get in a degree program. ,learnart,d3h6497,2,t5_2s6fc

If you look at this you can see the petals of the flowers closest to us the flowers in the back you cannot see the petals but you can see hightlights and shadows which gives a nice texture to it. Right now it seems a bit flat below the trees because you arent giving us any indications of space between what is closest to us and what is further away.

8474825,0,t3_4vry34,People learn from mistakes. Its a basic principle of learning  you do something maek the mistake find out what went wrong then learn to change it. What youre describing is the same thing that everyone that has ever drawn something goes through  those that keep pushing themself through these moments are those that eventually suceed. Heres what I would do  draw that character in your head. Do not erase the lines when you make a mistake just draw. Work out what youve done wrong  for example the eyes are the wrong shape. Then draw the eyes. Look at reference noone has ever created anything without reference and keep trying. Get to a poitn where youre close to what you want  fill entire sheets of paper with eyes if you have to. Try different designs and keep going. By the end of it youll still not have anything that looks like the image in your head. But thats okay. Becasue the next time you draw it youll be a little closer to what you want. Its called practise. So keep drawing. Do not stop. Use reference draw what you see draw everything. Draw whats in your head even if you cant draw it perfectly. Just keep going. I would also recommend doing a lot of gesture or figure drawings to help get a good grasp on anatomy and strucutre  this still implies if youre drawing anime or cartton characters  as itll allow you to create a more accuracte and dynamic figure. Another small tip  use a light pencil to do foundations a H or even a light blue pencil if you dont already. Use as little pressure as you can when drawing foundations so your detail isnt obscured by the foundation  it may help you get a better sense of what your drawing. As for a lack of talent  I was born with a condition known as Dyspraxia or DCD. My hand eye coordination is horrible and I was told I would never be able to draw anything half way decent. I kept going though and am a somewhat capable artist as long as you dont ask me to paint anything. I may not be as good as i should be or as the insanely talented teenagers that produce masterpieces but I can still do decent work. Talent is irrelevant  practise can make all the difference. TLDR Practise use reference do figure drawing dont erase your mistakes keep drawing. Work out what youve done wrong try to improve that. Do not give up. ,learnart,d60w7qp,2,t5_2s6fc

Now as for whether you should work in the targeted size instead of bigger to scale it down later... Its up to you really. Scaling it down serves the purpose of hiding rough parts and have more pixels in your larger base picture to work on details but if you think you need none of that  cant because of your computer go ahead.

So the top right corner is very light white which makes it look like the main light source is high up and even behind you implying that the lightest values of color on the face should be the upper right sides like the top right corner of the forehead. You put the lightest values in the face on the opposite side and in the middle almost like a spotlight shining directly in front of the nose.

10233573,0,t1_dc3c9yi,Yes but you dont necessarily have to wait until its super dry to the touch although you can too. Sometimes overnight is enough but it also depends on the pigment  some of them dry longer than the others. Off the top of my head some of the pigments you have to watch for are the whites titanium white zinc white flake white etc.  they tend to use safflower oil as the binder which dries a lot slower. Those might need two or three days. It helps to experiment and do tests or just learn through trial and error so you can develop a feel for it. The thickness of the paint will also affect how fast it dries. Unless youre going for an impasto style you dont really need to apply paint thickly. A little goes a long way especially if youre working in layers. It will also help your painting dry if you can store it somewhere with good air circulation  it dries through oxidation.The paint will also be less inclined to mix if you dont use too much pressure on the brush. Try to be decisive with your brushstrokes and not overwork it.You can also kinda work around the drying time by changing the viscosity of the paint  add more linseed oil to increase the viscosity. For some reason paints of different viscosity wont immediately mix so you have a tiny bit of leeway there. Getting the right pigmenttolinseed oil mix will take some getting used to at first and it will also change the opacity of the paint.Try and see if you can get some books or lessons on wetonwet or alla prima painting techniques  those painters will usually work on one sitting. Off the top of my head Jeremy Lipking amp Teresa Oaxaca are good examples. And of course Bob Ross too. They make it work through a combination of painting technique and knowing the properties of the materials.By the way Winsor amp Newton has a nice guide here for drying time of their paints ,learnart,dc416yz,2,t5_2s6fc

If you take this painting into photoshop and turn it into black and white you can see that your values are a little unorganized.I think a great way to approach a painting is to simplify it break the painting down into  SIMPLE value shapes that are clearly defined and then add detain within those shapes. If the values in your painting are working then everything else will fall in line but if the values are not working than there is nothing you can do to save it.,learnart,ddqq143,3,t5_2s6fc

Another example would be to exaggerate some aspects even more push the artwork beyond whats considered acceptable for fandom.

That said all you really need is a basic round brush with its properties set up to your preference.In the brush settings menu F you can turn on Shape Dynamics and set the control mode for Size Jitter to Pen Pressure to enable dynamic line weight. By altering the Minimum Diameter you can control how little or much the line weight can vary.In the Transfer tab you will probably want to Opacity Jitter Control to Off. This way you will get pure opaque lines. Otherwise if you put it on Pen Pressure you will get transparent lines whenever you press softly.,learnart,defd1ur,1,t5_2s6fc

11089468,0,t1_deoyxgs,Follow rule  if it looks good it looks good. In most cases here it seems like the variation is there since the artist drew in each strand instead of an entire outline around the head. In other words they didnt draw the whole outline in one go and decide on the variation in each place they just let the smaller parts make up the entire outline. But you dont need a strict guide telling you when or how to do things. Sometimes a line without variation around the head looks nice and at another time you might want different widths as well.

Anders Zorn did a bunch of portraits using only  colors a yellow a red a cool black and a white. Like in this self portrait Though I think in that one he used a green for his tie he would often throw in a single splash of green as a fifth color accent. What you can do is mix up a black of your own rather than using straight black from the tube. Ultramarine blue and burnt umber make a pretty good black and you can cool it by adding more blue or warm it up by adding more umber. ,learnart,dfxkto2,4,t5_2s6fc

If there was any evidence at all of dry brushing I might think she used a brush here and there and she might have for some of the big areas of black but there arent any marks on there you couldnt get with a flexible nib pen and maybe swapping out for a stiffer one to handle the more uniform hatching if youre heavy handed. ,learnart,dg26zky,1,t5_2s6fc

11775847,0,t1_dgukt37,Absolutely! Whenever people talk about art they say You have to find your style. What they dont say and what is very true is that you can have more than one. Best of luck to you ,learnart,dguttu7,2,t5_2s6fc
11794147,0,t1_dgvx8wk,Its a good bit more contrasted irl than in the picture the soil is drawn by hardpressing with B but it could still use contrast anyways! The focal point was supposed to be the robed creature of course. Haha.,learnart,dgwwn3k,1,t5_2s6fc
11796678,0,t3_6889f2,Contrast. Its a beginners bane. You need to push the contrast. And start losing the strong lines. Form not lines. In realism lines dont exist. Its edges and blur. Soft and hard edges but no lines. ,learnart,dgx6zd1,1,t5_2s6fc
