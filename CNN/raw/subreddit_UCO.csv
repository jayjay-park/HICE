506165,0,t3_1zx7yk,I know some of the student activity emails can be unsubscribed at the orgsync website. Im not sure of the address but I know you can find it by using the search box on the main UCO website. Also if you cant find a way to unsubscribe then you can always make an email rule to put all of the infouco.edu emails in a folder so they dont clutter up your inbox. ,UCO,cfxsy4i,3,t5_2s1fw
