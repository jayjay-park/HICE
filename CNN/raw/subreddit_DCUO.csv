7380256,0,t1_d2h2pvk,I hear ya on that. Once I figured out what it is I had to do and what end game was then I pretty much took it for what it is. Cool content. Some cool instances and progressing my gear and lair. The lair can take awhile. ,DCUO,d2h31wk,1,t5_2rzg0
7404931,0,t1_d2jucat,Ooh ok thank you very much it seems the other subreddit is at least a little more active ,DCUO,d2jw4ga,2,t5_2rzg0

7468339,0,t3_4hbtev,The reason there is a queue is because the servers are at maximum capacity.When the servers are Full another player can not get in until someone logs out or is disconnected.As of  AM this morning there were  US Xbox characters created and  EU characters created.,DCUO,d2r3rke,5,t5_2rzg0

7591982,0,t3_4iy2lf,Last night I had a  minute queue then right when I got in the game I decided to reroll a new hero with some friends.  Little did I know thats a full log out and I was back in another  minute queue.  Then as soon as I logged into that guy I realized that there was a network conflict with one of the guys who was playing on my LAN and I got kicked to the title screen.  Had to wait in a  minute login queue three times last night.  ,DCUO,d35657d,3,t5_2rzg0

7937146,0,t1_d485sp8,Thats exactly the problem my buddies and I are having. Im on play through  almost  and havent been convinced to go to the membership yet. I got the bundles which isnt bad. ,DCUO,d487kvz,1,t5_2rzg0
8464447,0,t3_4vfe7f,I would recommend having Biggun in your loadout as it is one of the best supercharges in the game.Munitions has several viable loadouts due to the number of Bullet Frenzy powers. ,DCUO,d5zlcih,1,t5_2rzg0
8626699,0,t1_d6jx2o0,I know what you mean. Most of what I got as drops last night was more red than green. There were only  items that were better than what I have now. I did get a number of RampD plans though. I took those most of the time. Quite a few of the items werent usable by me anyway.,DCUO,d6jxvpt,2,t5_2rzg0
8629948,0,t3_4y23gu,In this game the achievment system is essential to progression.  Achievments are referred to as Feats and getting more feats earns you more skill points to use to increase passive stats amp learn more weapon skills.Eventually youll have to subscribe to get access to everything or buy new content piece by piece.  Subscribing is likely the better deal but if that sub lapses you downgrade again and lose access to that content.If youve done all of the side missions amp  Booster Golds exploration missions take a look at solos duos alerts and PvP.  I think you can get best in slot PvP gear without subscribing so theres quite a bit to do before you absolutely have to sub but eventually you will need to to get the most out of the game.,DCUO,d6kck6q,2,t5_2rzg0
9234250,0,t3_56fwhf,I think at least you got a pretty good picture of the state of the DCU subreddit!,DCUO,d8mibr1,1,t5_2rzg0
9242931,0,t1_d8nkc4q,Literally the opposite of a taunt. Its a cleanse that removes all aggro from you so that enemies attack other targets if there are any.,DCUO,d8nlx7y,1,t5_2rzg0
9659171,0,t3_5dckbl,Are you FP or Sub? Do you like pet based characters or do you prefer being more in control of how you takedeal damage? ,DCUO,da3p12f,2,t5_2rzg0

10048740,0,t1_dbh8de6,The powerback mechanics for damagers are being removed.There will be self power regeneration where you gain back a fixed percentage of your power over time.  You will need to Spec into Power through Skill Points and Mods if you want to be able to rotate your powers from the tray.  A larger Power Pool  more power regenerated over time,DCUO,dbhdk8a,1,t5_2rzg0
10155919,0,t1_dbppz0r,Agree to disagree.There is enough life in DCUO to make it enterteaining.Queue times are still fast EU or US Hero or Villain.,DCUO,dbv8ab0,1,t5_2rzg0

10751512,0,t3_5t122e,Thank you sir I took your advice after  days the test server finished downloading bloody launcher would randomly close lol and I was not using my pc I obviously couldnt try munitions but I did play with electricity. I tried the same alert with sp spent then  then  then everything and even at low sp it was very effective and the more sp spent the more godlike it felt I very much like the changes and am really looking forward to give feedback on munitions Thank you for being rational and logical its made all of this a much better experience ,DCUO,ddoxpl7,1,t5_2rzg0
11078648,0,t3_5xz3m7,Managed to fix by restarting the game. It seems if i play for too many hours in a row i start getting UI bugs,DCUO,denr6c4,1,t5_2rzg0
