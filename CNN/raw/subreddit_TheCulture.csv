Their intelligence is measured against that of an average biological member of the Culture a socalled . value drone would be considered the mental equal of a biological citizen whereas lesser drones such as the menial service units of Orbitals are merely protosentient capable of limited reaction to unprogrammed events but possessing no consciousness and thus not considered citizens these take care of much of the menial work in the Culture.

For Star Trek we can imagine subspace to be this field and we can let it pervade all of known space. Then subspace or at least some property of subspace would define a particular frame of reference at every point in space. When you entered warp you would take on the frame of reference of subspace and keep it regardless of your velocity with respect to subspace. This would ensure that normal everyday warp travel would not produce unsolvable paradoxes as we discussed in Section .. .,TheCulture,cns6n8t,1,t5_2svdh

7180855,0,t3_4dtsoy,The Idirans were described as being religiously driven to conquer planets  so they at least were doing fighting on the ground.  Though the culture did not have many planets I dont recall the apendix in Consider Phlebas and if it listed many lost Rocks or similar bodies lost but Id suspect so but their allies and neighboring civilizations did.  Given that its certainly possible that the Culture would like Sparta of old send citizens to lead or instruct other civilizations in warfare.  That seems very much their style.Another possibility is that in The Hydrogen Sonata there are some discussions about certain classes of ships with small crews being too eccentric and unpredictable.  The consensus among the ships in the discussion is that Culture Minds need humans to take care of in order to be more levelheaded  though whether this is for their perspective and input or for the same reason that people with pets tend to be more emotionally fulfilled remains unstated.  Of course its anyones guess as to how widespread this view is among Minds and even within that book there are obvious dissenters but at least some combat ships would  probably have had human crews.
