2769035,0,t3_2rrmdi,This was the most future set Ive seen to date. what the fuck  reduced to tears amazing Opting for true live analogue hihats in his performance a very good choice Brought out some true vinyl not any of that timecode shit good to see Juggling two tracks at once Putting the stylus IN the center hole of the record. Never seen any other DJ do that before. Two discs one platter Start lifting shit up Fuckin THROWING shit Lifting up both decks live without the help of sync Scene of destruction Start hitting the hats on the platters A fucking violin cue stick Hihats on each other for natural percussion Lifting the decks again Hitting and punching shit Slapping the platters barehanded Hat locked neatly onto center spindle Those angles!! FinaleGlad to see he has a metric shit ton of albums released FUCKING  ALBUMS. True DJ god.RIP those styli though,VinylGore,cnitupr,6,t5_2v21u
