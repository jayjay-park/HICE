4963640,0,t1_cuk6hgy,Well it may be equally useless but heres another useless ability for what its worthExistenceNullWhenever someone loses sight of you they completely forget your existence. After admittance into the esper training program and with excitement at the knowledge that you could even be as strong as a level  maybe even level  if you worked hard you are completely devastated to discover that suddenly your parents dont remember you. Your friends ask sorry do I know you? and the landlord starts showing people your apartment while youre still living in it.Youd probably end your own life since youre basically a ghost anyways but thankfully your esper power doesnt affect computers so you still exist to the government you still have a bank account and you can still attend school though that quickly gets tiresome as you get reintroduced as a new student every day.With academy city working more and more on computers and cybernetics technologies its possible to maintain relations with people  as long as they only ever know you through the internet or a computer interface and never meet you in person. Such an interface is also how academy city personnel work with your power since it would be insanely powerful to harness for covert operations.So you are still living but you cant interact with anyone in person except for a certain level zero provided luck would have you meet him and realize that he can inexplicably still remember you.,toarumajutsunoindex,cuk7ewc,2,t5_2t51t

5998042,0,t3_3xl0vu,Ill just echo to say that I would like to see season  animating  while having volumes  as a three part movie. Hopefully they can find a way to work in the sidestories into it. Although a threecour like they did with Durarara might be neat to see. An interesting idea I heard a while back was to have an Accelerator anime adapt the manga  if its first arc ever ends while trying to add volume  and . In order to make it easier for the eventual Index anime. ,toarumajutsunoindex,cy5vh7q,1,t5_2t51t

6466742,0,t1_czo6lgv,Oh so youre mainly having trouble with all the redundancy and extra details in the novels. My bad for misunderstanding Im not sure how I should answer that. He still does that to a certain extent mainly by reminding the viewers of old information in conjugation with new information. Something like Indexs  magical grimoires stored in her head wont be useful in this situation! and things like that. But it does still happen. Although I guess that may be due to month long breaks between the novels and the sheer number of them. I guess he may find it best to remind the viewers of details like that in new situations. I find stuff like that easy to ignore but if that really bothers you can gloss over bits like that if you want to.The extra details bit is just additional information in order to better paint the scene in your head. Revealing ancillary information thats purpose is to give more information about the environment or character. I guess I can see how one might think he might go a bit overboard with those details.  Thats a strong point for criticism. I guess you could always skip over the fluff if you want to since theyre not essential information. Im not really sure if theres been any improvement in that field over the novels it may be something only for a select novels or it may just be his writing format. I havent payed attention to that so I cant helpfully respond to it. ,toarumajutsunoindex,czo7g6a,2,t5_2t51t
6662869,0,t1_d08hhgg,Yeah then the lenght would be pretty similar to previous seasons.I dont know how impactful SS will be compared to the first one but if its nearly as important then maybe they could animate it into the season instead of SP and make it an OVA or something instead because I dont think SP was really all that important to the story line. Mainly the Stiyl chapter only.,toarumajutsunoindex,d08hxo6,1,t5_2t51t

8084337,0,t3_4pyg7q,Reactions while reading A lot of characters making reappearances for an allied gathering. Miss the old pope though. This time Touma has a harem of three english girls. Mark is always tired of Birdways shit lol. Q The french representative in the allied meeting was the Holy Woman of Versailles right? I cant wait to see what the three childrens picture books will do against Othinus. Daaamn England just got played by Loki. Yay Stiyl finally appears in New Testament. Lets hope his battle will be a good one. The way Gremlin has all of its magicians named after Norse myth characters it reminds me of JoJo where the enemy stand users stands are named after tarots egyptian gods or western music. Ill bet money on that Kagun will bump into Maria now that hes going to intercept enemies. Its nice to see Tabigake enter the main story novels too. Did not expect to see Oriana completely forgot about her. So many battles are starting in numerous places. YES! Touma finally accepted the help of others! You dont have to do everything always alone you big idiot! Freyjas mother with the magic charm reminded me of Touya with his charms in the Angel Fall incident. Cool Fiamma finally got his spotlight on the good guys side. Othinus Hahaha you have activated my trap card! What the hell?! She did not actually destroy the world right? That black screen at the end is worrisome. What a cocktease ending.Thoughts about the volumeA decent volume but as I expected its mainly setup for the actual stuff to happen next. The only lenghty fight was Touma and friends vs Freyja which was an alright encounter. I liked that the stage was in the roof of a moving train and that Index and Mikoto finally gave a helping hand to Touma. Also we can see once again that Gremlin members are not necessarily evil they just joined a necessary evil for a personal goal.Even though it was just mainly planning I liked the politics between the allied nations in America. Reading about all the leaders going through their respective plans and disucussing on how to deal with Othinus was good filler for the start of the arc. Also it was nice to see Vasilisa and Sashachan in their usual habitat again.Hoping all the other fights develop into something awesome. I almost wanna jump straight into the next volume after writing this because of that damn cliffhanger..PS I recently bought Stardew Valley from the Steam Sale and its starting to consume my life. Hopefully I remember to read next week too!,toarumajutsunoindex,d4or4z8,6,t5_2t51t

8816040,0,t1_d76h2x6,Okay it was a joint out of a socket. I guess in this chapter we see a break.I think the current Unified Calendar says the Manga date is Oct  but that is pretty old and hasnt been updated since NT. The Saten arc seemed to be all over the map in terms of taking place weeks to months before giving enough time for Saten and Frenda to become friends and going tosometime after OT. Still hoping that possibly another chapter is added in the Tankbon as a few points feel like they jumped past some events.While I think these events happened before Battle Royal Im not sure that Battle Royal from ITEM or Uiharu will be covered in the future. While I would love to get to see it from ITEMs or Railgun groups POV I think the main reason it hasnt gotten to OT is that Mikoto suddenly is worried about the growing conflict world wide as well as the phone call with Touma and leading up with OT Spoilers Mikoto knowing about Toumas memory loss feels like to large of an event to skip. SCHOOL also is introduced in railgun enough that even if you read the LN are left with way to many questions about their fate.,toarumajutsunoindex,d77kgr8,1,t5_2t51t
8842205,0,t1_d7aoy95,As much as I want the Yuiitsu business to be over with I personally want a break from it because frankly shes starting to annoy me and she was just another kihara now shes like the new major villain. In NT  Misakas Nearly destrowed her with AAA but she survived which I guess was fine once    but in NT Kamisatos Made such a big deal over getting revenge on her and it was hyped up only for her to still Survive I know shes powerful but her near unbeatable nature is kind of annoyingsorry if that upsets anyone  and I definitely agree with you. The Laura stuff has been on my mind since my first read of NT . And why would she stop Aleister from knowing? And what are these pieces? And what was settled in NT ? And true. The Mikotos mental state will go down hill stuff was forgotten so easily. So these are alot of questions to answer haha ,toarumajutsunoindex,d7aphe7,1,t5_2t51t

10346595,0,t1_dcgtnfq,in Railgun SS two characters were introduced that also appear in Volume  of preNew Testament AKA OT.and Railgun SS sets up the event for OT.you are not required to read both but youll definitely appreciate some characters more if you do also one focuses mostly on Saten while the other on Mikoto so you if you love both youll like what those two volumes offer for you.PS  there is also the Railgun manga from chapter  which you probably need to read before OT,toarumajutsunoindex,dcgugs0,0,t5_2t51t

However in Railgun the LVL Arc actually takes place in the second or third day of the Sport Festival while the whole fiasco in Index was just on the first day. yeah Touman just doesnt get any break. PS  please complete both Railgun and Index anime  the movie before you go further on just to get a general idea about the series but most importantly youll appreciate LN Touman even more so because of hes bad adaptation.,toarumajutsunoindex,ded4f30,6,t5_2t51t
