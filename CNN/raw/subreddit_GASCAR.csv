409247,0,t3_1yrpl2,S Class Recap Viking won the pole because Top missed qualifying. The race started fine Viking got to the lead followed by Top Dodo Whisperer Vin Doctor and a lagging rph. Top and someone had an accident to bring it the first caution. The race restarted with Viking in the lead and he peacefully led the race for quite a few laps until Tops Mich faster Saleen caught up. They raced and Top ran into something. Some more laps passed by until everyone in S class pitted. A little passed halfway Vikingwas paying B class cars until a Niveous locked then up in a braking zone and they collided bring out another caution. Top started in the front of the group and pulled away. Viking was faster than Vin and Dodo and snuck through. Over the final  Viking jumped every curb and subsequently caught up to Top and gave him a run but wasnt able to cut enough corners to make up for the  second Top had on Vikings Honda. ,GASCAR,cfn6o7d,1,t5_2yeu8

3602117,0,t1_cq2sd4x,He ran over the inside curb when he took the corner too tight I think. Either way he got sucked up into the tire wall the ass end bounced off and swung back out to the track so his car was perpendicular to the tire wall and continued that way across the finish line. I nearly hit him. After I got by is when he started flipping. ,GASCAR,cq2v7yu,1,t5_2yeu8
3602504,0,t1_cq2lwm8,I guess I had just enough power to slightly run away from people on the straight. Though I thought the way I took turn  a and b was pretty slow compared to the field but climbing the hill plus taking the last corner slow enough so I could hammer the gas early and keep the car off the outside curb seemed to make up for that. Looking back on it I feel like I shouldve kept the tire saving mode comment to myself. I noticed that from that point on is when I extended my lead the most. Although your tire wear wasnt too far behind mine I feel like you couldve run to the end and not noticed much of a difference. I hope it didnt get to your head and caused you to push harder and that tire wear was actually the reason you started fading away. I wouldve loved to have you catch up and force me to run hard on the worn tires. I hadnt practiced how long I can run on a set so it wouldve been quite the show... maybe I should turn damage back on for practice mode lol. And to be completely honest I was a bit nervous on the last restart with you starting right behind me. I expected you to be all over my ass based on both your dirty practice lap what you said you couldve run in qualifying and the fact that you were driving by the field up to that point in the race. Hell I even tried to even things up a bit by not taking off right away on the restart and gaining that advantage. I waited until about the second word green or in between the second and third before I took off. Still seemed to catch some people snoozin. Either way great run last night. You seem to be getting a lot better over the last few races. I havent raced against you for position a whole lot but I would imagine you are better at racing others in addition to hot lapping. Keep grinding. If you are able maintain this level over the final three races I see you moving up to a firstround pick. Just gotta stop beating yourself Sebring kind of Road Atlanta but not really. ,GASCAR,cq2wt7h,2,t5_2yeu8
