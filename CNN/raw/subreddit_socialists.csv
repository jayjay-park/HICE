329622,1,t3_1xuora,rsocialism is just becoming the selfparodying Social Justice circlejerk that ranarchism became awhile back. When half of the comments in the entire sub are coming from a single troll account and the mods actually agree with the troll which is hilarious you know where things are headed. My guess is bans for ableism or spelling women correctly are next.,socialists,cfexpw0,1,t5_2sbo1
352137,0,t1_cfeynhh,Yeah. And youre obviously not banning his accounts. Given that you are banning pretty much everyone who disagrees with the mods Social Justice Warrior stances it stands to reason that this is a deliberate thing.,socialists,cfh9lrh,2,t5_2sbo1
354898,0,t1_cfhjkga,I think its fair to say that he was until  at the very latest. After  he was the editor of the Italian Socialist Party newspaper Avanti! He had done a fivemonth jail term for participating in a protest against Italian imperialism in Libya. He was expelled from the party in  for support of Italian intervention in WWI that great earthquake that exposed the rot in European social democracy. He became a social patriot and then founded the fascist movement which directed itself especially after the war in physically attacking socialists and workers.

607266,0,t1_cg92xod,SA has received an endorsement from what amounts to a section of the capitalist state the SEIUA steaming sample of antiMarxist BS. This is where Norths minions end up in trying justify their scab socialism  i.e. their opposition in principle not to the procapitalist union bureaucracies but to unions themselves. SEPs current version of socialism clearly has no use for the most basic Marxist texts such as Lenins State and Revolution... and why would it?Supporters of SEPs politics are by necessity trained to develop a unique kind of spinal elasticity when it comes to political principles. For decades NorthampCo were fawning press agents of the most rightwing sections of the union bureaucrats in the U.S. ... only in  came their about face declaring unions themselves the class enemy.The completely socialdemocratic framework of the SAs campaigns are clear enough from their program itself... which is limited to appealing for reforms from the capitalist state. These reforms may indeed be well to the left of what the Dems offer but remain within the framework of bourgeois politics and loyalty to the bourgeois state in particular the postwar British Labour Party  from which SAs program derives.,socialists,cg9aryl,-2,t5_2sbo1

805172,0,t1_cgvqbjj,Oh this is tiresome. Quite obviously there is an argument in the text. If you would prefer to ignore it and read chan instead then well its your life who am I to stop you?Also I am nor asserting anything just trying to engage with you on the points mentioned in the text. If I was to reply to you with similar arguments you be all you have no counterargument. Im not that petty however.,socialists,cgvsved,1,t5_2sbo1
1823478,0,t1_ck8wi9i,gt The WSWS reserves the right to edit comments for brevity and clarity.gt gt I have no problem with thatOkay well lets see if that is what happens here eh? Maybe someone is editing for brevity and clarity there is no need for that really though but you say you are okay with it... and a response is also being formulated?As for the other instances Id still like to hear more about them ie. the subject matter but really all you can recall.There was no intended criticism from me at the length of your post. As I say I dont think in this day and age there is reason to edit anything anyone else wrote for brevity and clarity. Put it out there and quote what you are specifically intending to respond to. Weve got plenty of space!Let people say what they want to say. And if it merits a response respond. If it does not do not. There is nothing sicker than censorship.So much is lost the more it becomes accepted....So no I wasnt criticizing the length of your post just pointing out the fact that you shouldnt have let a couple of extra taps on your keyboard amongst s result in you now only being able to so vaguely accuse wsws.org of several more instances of censorship since.......Anyway lets hear what these other instances were about. Im still very curious about all of this.,socialists,ck8x34w,1,t5_2sbo1
