9174269,0,t1_d8ewa7f,That makes a lot of sense thank you very much! How do you know what to sideboard out? I have no idea how to value each creature in each matchup and I dont think I cut CoCo maybe stampede against fast decks?,ElvesMTG,d8ewmss,1,t5_3c1ex
9263700,0,t3_578y5h,I think shaman can be clunky and white cards in the board have been performing really well. If youre on chord I think white is the way to go.,ElvesMTG,d8q8nmh,1,t5_3c1ex
10686608,0,t1_ddi5mda,ive been playing it mb since I started playing elves earlier this year. it does come in handy,ElvesMTG,ddi8s81,2,t5_3c1ex

10710701,0,t3_5sr63f,Elves are great. Im on Abzan elves and have gone a total of  matches during my past  FNMs. ,ElvesMTG,ddkq8ca,2,t5_3c1ex
10784501,0,t1_dds7s0g,Yes I now realize I should have specified that I am not playing Chords. In my own meta Ive found its more valuable to reload my hand and be chunking it out there quickly than to be searching for a sliver bullet with Chords.,ElvesMTG,ddsccky,1,t5_3c1ex
11141138,0,t3_5xyjtv,I like black in the current meta Shaman makes your deck operate sometimes a turn faster than it normally would and there are tons of fast decks out their. ,ElvesMTG,deuu4s5,1,t5_3c1ex
11209005,0,t1_df27cmq,Thanks! I only have one Push but maybe I should pick up a second. ,ElvesMTG,df2j0ol,2,t5_3c1ex
