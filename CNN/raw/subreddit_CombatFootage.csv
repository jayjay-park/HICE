Even if youre not shooting its handy to have something like an ACOG just to see things.I dont have experience with machine guns but a lowpower scope like the ACOG will increase the effective range of an AR carbine M out to about m before having to account for serious bullet drop so I imagine it is similar with the M and even greater with the M.Its not that people cant hit faraway targets m with iron sights basic qualification in both Army and Marines but in combat on concealed or moving targets its another task altogether.,CombatFootage,cfcfsaw,4,t5_2v0c6

Khrushchev allowed them to come back in  and Soviet plan were to allow half the population back by .

During that time Chechens faced apartheidtype discrimination in the USSR and the first time an ethnic Chechen was allowed the top Soviet post in ChechenoIngushetia ASSR was after ...In  after his election victory Yeltsin sent a representative to Chechen Vice President Zelimkhan Yandarbayev telling him if you dont return to the Russian Federation we will use the army to bring you back to where you were in the th century i.e. an open threat to massacre civilians in response to a democratic movement for selfdetermination.Islamic terrorism is the result of  things cultural amp intellectual repression and desperation. The lack of contact in the USSR with the Western world meant precious few people knew enough about liberal democracies and the bulk of the educated youth in  were from Islamic universities in Cairo and Amman. The good thing is that societys rejected the strictIslamists but the bad is the damage their ideologys done.However terrorist attacks were genuinely inspired by Islamic fervor only after the wars ended and the insurgency became PanCaucasian. During the wars terrorist attacks were undertaken for the purpose of forcing the Russians to stop bombing civilians and killing people in Chechnya. Beslan marks the last time terrorism was seen as a legitimate tool by even rogue Chechen commanders.

The jam was caused when the empty casing got stuck in the chamber after the first shot most likely due to dirt and that locked the gun up. I doubt that the way one pulls the trigger really does any difference in such cases. Since all the trigger does is basically release the firing pin so that it strikes the primer on the bullet. After that the expanding gas from the bullet does the rest and cycles the mechanism. The M is notoriously sensitive to dirt but ironically i think in this case it actually saved a life. ,CombatFootage,chx34ew,2,t5_2v0c6

When that order is given they can only fire on targets that have been PIDd. After a while they see the target again and open fire. It might sound hectic and unorganised but its really not.

2199856,0,t1_cljcbfs,Yep thats basically all it is war in a nonthird world country which is rare. The countries split from the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact participants in general are a rather interesting situation. After  years of rather strict central control the end result was basically a bunch of countriessocialist republics with borders set out of political convenience with essentially zero regard for the inhabitants  historical friendships and antipathies due to ethnicreligiousetc reasons. Strict state control basically kept them all in line but the adversarial rivalries never went away. Add in as well what basically amounts to Russians colonizing these outlying republics. The whole time though they were building all sorts of modern expensive projects just like any other advanced country. Then when the Soviet Union basically imploded it was like taking the lid off a pressure cooker and the whole thing just started boiling over. Yugoslavia already precarious after Tito died fragmented almost instantly into half a dozen angry countries fighting over control of border areas with mixed populations. Ukraine is basically the same thing with claims that Crimea was never historically part of Ukraine mixed populations with variable degrees of national allegiance etc. TLDR Soviets kept the lid on a bunch of internal rivalries while building a modern country then they fell apart and those rivalries are resulting in civil war in what are fairly developed countries.,CombatFootage,cljgf6x,6,t5_2v0c6

2225386,0,t3_2kmct7, Good NVGs are expensive and hard to acquire. Theyre an extremely restricted item for sale under ITAR and the US is one of the only countries that makes the good ones anyway. The crappy ones often use active IR illumination which is like wearing an infrared flashlight. As such anybody else wearing NVGsNight Optical Devicesanything that can see IR light will see you very clearly. Even the lesscrappy passive IR ones PVS PVS etc are often fragile and drain batteries quickly. Monocular NODs that feed an image to both eyes ANPVS some PVS mountings have poor depth perception obviously and limit your field of vision. Binocular NODs like the PVS are better as are the PVS mounts that only cover one eye. Up until the most recent GenIII NODs image resolution was poor especially past a few hundred meters. I can go into more detail if youd like. FLIR and all other IR optics systems FLIR is just forwardlooking and refers to the targeting pods mounted on many aircraft are very good when they work. However cloud cover and other weather effects seem to decrease their usefulness and anything that reduces the targets heat signature or insulates it will reduce its visibility on IR. These systems can function during the day as they measure the difference between heat in objects with varying degrees of precision. There are infantry thermal sights like the PAS and PVS that can be mounted in helmet NVG mounts or on weapons. However often these have a relatively low field of view. Yes. Mostly. Actors like Daesh have the capital to buy these systems in some small quantity but cannot or do not. The best systems are simply not available to nonstates and most states for that matter regardless of cost. Im sure there are individual fighters or even small elite wellequipped veteran units that have accumulated stolen or captured NODs just as there are some fighters with Ms and Aimpoints. EDIT Two things I forgot to mentionjust realized.First It has been the overwhelming experience of terror groups in that region for  years now that the enemy owns the night. The superior quality and quantity of NATO nightfighting equipment has been so strong in that AO for the entire conflict that Daesh and other groups as well may simply not find it worthwhile to sink resources into their own nightfighting equipment since the enemy will always be better anyway. This is obviously not true for the FSA and the Kurds and probably not for the SAA either but this experience may have been so ubiquitous for their fighters and commanders that it has affected their planning and doctrine for all conflicts not only those against powers with nightvision supremacy.Second a copied answer from a question below about NODs and situational awareness Walking and moving in NODs takes getting used to. Many civilian law enforcement and military classestraining programs for night fighting include a large block of time for NOD movement familiarization basically getting used to seeing the environment in depth perceptionlacking green. Not having as much depth perception and seeing the ground with a whole different range of reflected light can be disorienting to move in at first. This is one more reason why actors with limited access to NOD tech and familiarity often just forego them.,CombatFootage,clmp7w5,23,t5_2v0c6

That and since this was the fall of the USSR a lot of Russian soldiers were conscripts who were not even told as to why they were going to Chechnya.

Its become a symbol and moral boost for Ukrainians. Its also an airfield that the Russian military can use to unload humanitarian supplies for rebel forces. Donetsk is also the self proclaimed capital of the Donetsk Peoples Republic the defacto state of the rebels. The airport has proved to be a massive graveyard for rebels but at this point I think theyve stopped their daily assaults because they all kept dying.

Just say those two words most of the Marines in Ohio know exactly what your talking about. Lima Company.

By the end of the deployment Lima Company alone would lose a total  killed and  more wounded. Their parent Batallion  would have  killed.

2667003,0,t1_cn6lz22,gt I was on vacation but holy shit you are just really stuck in your ways and completely not worth arguing with.Im not stuck in my ways Im asking you to provide some evidence for what youre saying.gt If you dont see the financial aspect of the war. The fact that both of them were wars between two banking systems fractional reserve and national socialismDo you read what you say before you post it? National socialism isnt a banking system.gt and that that war is still going then there is no useful conversation possible to be had between us. This just isnt a fact at all youre claiming it to be but not only is it a highly controversial claim its also one youre not backing up with any evidence whatsoever. Youre now just going durr there is no useful conversation here because you have made a mess of trying to explain yourself.gt The burden of proof you are putting on me though is completely in appropriate. It is ABSOLUTELY appropriate. You are the one making grandiose claims that challenge the historical consensus so why are you not providing some evidence? You havent given me a single source for your information nor referenced anyone who supports your point of view. Youve literally just pulled it out of your arse as far as I can tell.gt Just because you dont know what Im talking about doesnt mean I automatically owe you an explanation. No it just means that your ideas have zero credibility. You cant blame me for being unfamiliar with your worldview when it is basically conspiracy theory nonsense that nobody else Ive heard of when Ive studied this era has heard of. Trust me buddy I have been and will continue to be studying the build up to the Second World War over the course of this academic year and if your ideas were held in any weight by anyone they wouldve come up.gt Im sorry you dont know but Im not your teacher and no one taught me. No I do know a bit about national socialism and WW and WW and what caused it whereas you are clearly completely misinformed. No one taught me? So what youre saying is you came up with all of this yourself and noone agrees with you? Oh good you are crazy then.gt The only reason I know is because I was in the same position and did my research instead of just babblin on about what you admitted you dont know about. Then show your research! The only thing youre right about is that I dont know much about your theories because clearly theyre hardly mainstream or even niche theyre almost anonymous. I DO know about the history of the period we are talking about though and you clearly dont and I know that.gt Youre asking me for a favor which you dont deserve cause of how rude you asked for it.Im not asking you for a favour for me Im asking you to do yourself a favour and to prove what youre saying or back it up. The burden of proof isnt inappropriate or anything and Im not undeserving of explanation because Im rude youre just unable to provide any source for your claims. You boldly asserted WW was a genocide against the German people that fifty years of European history were just a struggle between banking systems and that both sides were equally bad in WW without citing a single historian or statistic in your favour nor have you actually explained why youre right.gt To tell you how I know would make that learning process much easier for you which I would gladly do had you not been so confrontational and combative. Except I already have learned about the period of history we are talking about from people like teachers and historians who are actually qualified on the subject matter. And what I have learned stands in complete contrast to your own knowledge which is evidently based on nothing but your own assumptions. Im not asking you to educate me or something Im telling you that your argument is wrong and correctly asserting the facts which are that your argument is unsubstantiated bullshit and noone of any note seems to agree with you. If youre uncomfortable with that truth that is your problem.gt  Because right now the only thing youre using against me is semantics. No Im using the fact that you have no argument or evidence against you. That isnt semantics. Im not sure you know what semantics means.gt I could have worded my opinions better It isnt just your wording its the entire content.gt but I said what I had to say and by now yea all youre doing is twisting my words around imagining what I would say and jumping to assumptions.Nope.gt  Very far from a rational debate which is the only kind Im insterested in having.You were never interested in a rational debate because your opinions are not rational. If you were interested in rational debate you wouldve refuted my arguments rather than just accusing me of being rude and whining because your selftaught history education is wrong in about a hundred different ways.gt Im sorry youre so emotional about this but Im just not.The only emotion Im feeling is amusement mate.

Assuming of course the rest of the scope is fitted for like m m etc. but just ignoring that minor difference in angle from scope to barrel.   Like couldnt you just account for that difference on your own in the final moment of shooting? Say you know the scope is exactly parallel to the barrel at  extra inches of height and properly sighted for distances. If you want to shoot a brick wall and specifically one brick couldnt you just aim  extra inches higher than your actual target? And in this case kind of aim for the brick above your target?

3079643,0,t1_coh711a,from wikipediagtThe first confrontations between the AK and the M assault rifle vs battle rifle came in the early part of the Vietnam War. Battlefield reports indicated that the M was uncontrollable in fullauto and that soldiers could not carry enough ammo to maintain fire superiority over the AK. A replacement was needed A medium between the traditional preference for highpowered rifles such as the M and the lightweight firepower of the M Carbine.gtAs a result the Army was forced to reconsider a  request by General Willard G. Wyman commander of the U.S. Continental Army Command CONARC to develop a . caliber . mm selectfire rifle weighing  lbs . kg when loaded with a  round magazine. The .mm round had to penetrate a standard U.S. helmet at  yards  meters and retain a velocity in excess of the speed of sound while matching or exceeding the wounding ability of the . Carbine cartridge.gtThis request ultimately resulted in the development of a scaleddown version of the Armalite AR called AR rifle. However despite overwhelming evidence that the AR could bring more firepower to bear than the M the Army opposed the adoption of the new rifle. In January  Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara concluded that the AR was the superior weapon system and ordered a halt to M production. At the time the AR was the only rifle available that could fulfill the requirement of a universal infantry weapon for issue to all services. After modifications Most notably the charging handle was relocated from under the carrying handle like AR to the rear of the receiver the new redesigned rifle was subsequently adopted as the M.interesting history,CombatFootage,coh7b6z,5,t5_2v0c6

These are fucking democracies we live in. If you disagree with the direction your country is moving start persuading your neighbors. Picking up a gun is the answer of brutes and idiots who dont understand their beliefs well enough to articulate them convincingly.    A rebellion is a serious and dangerous thing. You can only legitimately do them when the elected officials have breached the social contract. Ousting a corrupt President is not necessarily a perfect scenario but is hardly an excuse to start a civil war.   These guys are fucking assholes bottom line.

He describes in some detail conversatoins with delta guys and how the Delta guys in Mogadishu had ditched the heavy kevlar helmets worn by the rangers.  They thought that the kevlar at the time didnt provide any real protection against a bullet and the helmets were heavy awkward and prone to getting knocked off. Instead created their own lightweight helmets out of skateboard helmets or climbing helmets that fit better and served to protect from head bumps and light debris which was half the purpose for a helmet anyway. the military since took a cue and contracted out kevlar helmets that are more streamlined and lightweight and have rail mounts for hte stuff that Special Forces guys want ,CombatFootage,cqe9vj3,10,t5_2v0c6

4993441,0,t1_cung6fp,As with many missiles the powered part of the hellfires flight is actually rather short. Because of the potential for an airborne target to significantly change directions or velocities relative to the target the motor burn of an airtoair missile must last longer in order to maximize the terminal velocity i.e. velocity upon impact dont know what else to call it and as a result maximize the missiles ability to follow and strike a maneuvering target.However since it is designed to hit ground targets the hellfire as well as other AtG missiles can afford to follow a flight profile that is mostly ballistic because the target is not going to suddenly go from mach  in one direction to mach  in another direction. Very few corrections actually need to be made by the missile midflight.Here is a diagram depicting a standard LOALDIR flight path for a hellfire. Note that less than  of the total trajectory is comprised of powered flight. So if the missile reaches its maximum velocity that early on in its flight and continues to climb on a ballistic trajectory its highly unlikely that the missile could remain supersonic all the way to the target.

ISF seems to have no backup plan on how to retreat from such an assault in this case they get routed and picked off in small groups afterwards. I also could not see any CAS. When IS captures equipment they immediately turn it against the ISF another example was a machinegun position in the overrun camp which oversees a valley they used the position to fire at retreating ISF soldiers. It seems to me that the IS patrols move pretty coordinated through the area when they get caught out by the ISF soldier at  only one IS fighter was really in danger because they move so spread out.,CombatFootage,cutk8hd,2,t5_2v0c6

Such situations should be resolved rapidly otherwise you risk of letting them go beyond your control Georgia and Crimea are examples of quick and decisive reaction from Russia while Eastern Ukraine is example of the contrary. Hence diplomatic solutions or any military half measures i.e. supplying arms dont look like valid course of actions.Russias decision not to act may lead to grave consequences including considerable loss of influence in the region that is regarded as vital for Russian national security. Turkeys possible involvement will most likely not deter Russia if things go hot for the same reason.Armenias CSTO membership provides Russia with the most obvious and easiest casus belli.

However the first symptoms of blastinduced neurotrauma BINT may occur months or even years after the initial event and are therefore categorized as secondary brain injuries. The broad variety of symptoms includes weight loss hormone imbalance chronic fatigue headache and problems in memory speech and balance.

It just so happens that this Hind was in a slow level flight and doesnt seem to have been targeting anything more specific than the city block so the entire concept of bombs on helicopters looks as weird and as unorthodox as they are in this video to those not familiar.,CombatFootage,cx8r3f6,1,t5_2v0c6

Opposition cant win this war by ambushing government forces. Simply Taliban did not fight a war like this therefore it is very apples to oranges. I dont think hardness has much to do with it. No matter how tough you are airstrikes will still kill you.

But USA need to have the other side of the Syrian civil war to win to be able to do so. If USA take out ISIS Assad takes out his opposition since he dont need to worry about ISIS. Also foreign politics is very complex and its A LOT you cant do just because you think its right. A lot of laws and a lot of countries to consider. ISIS will never threaten USA as a country anyway. Sure they can lead terrorist attacks. But will they ever take down USA? Lol no. If the US wanted they could deal with ISIS so fast it would be consider genocide. Will they do it? Good luck deploying soldiers into Syria with no consequenses. Syria will never have that. And even if the US could they wouldnt. Why use money and risk consequenses about something that will never evolve to any risk to you and if they even become a small risk you can wipe them in weeks. ,CombatFootage,czxjqzf,0,t5_2v0c6

So Im guessing they charged this position Iraqi troops fell back without taking casualties. Then later they counter attacked and pushed ISIS out?

9392881,0,t3_598zra,This is a continuation on my series on South Asian wars and conflicts. My previous submission was on Pakistans War against the Taliban in Northwest PakistanWaziristanThe Kargil War was a shortlived war between India and Pakistan in  that was fought in the mountain ranges of Kashmir where the Himalaya mountain ranges met the Karakorum range. The war was fought against the backdrop of nuclear tests conducted by both India and Pakistan in the same year. It marked the entry of Pakistan into the club of nuclear armed nations. Although much smaller in scale compared to the previous wars fought between the two nations the backdrop of nuclear weapons and their possible use sent alarm bells throughout the International community.The war itself was a major logistical nightmare for both sides as it was fought in the towering peaks of the Himalayas and is considered a classic example of highaltitude warfare.General Musharraf Pakistan was largely responsible for the initiation of the war keeping of a good portion of the military and the civilian government in the dark with the exception of a handful of close generals and officers. Neither members of the Pakistani Air Force Pakistan Navy nor the civilian government was aware of these developments and neither were many generals in the military. Gen. Musharraf had actually approached the Army and the government with these plans in the late s which was rejected by military leaders and Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto. Fast forward to  when he was appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Army by PM Nawaz Sharif he had troops move into abandoned Indian positions in the Kargil district just over the LoC Line of Control overlooking major Indian highways catching India by surprise. These positions gave Pakistan the advantage of striking into India with artillery gunfire etc. while having the protection of the high altitude of the mountain ranges. However there were several setbacks for the Pakistanis that did not yield to longterm success. For one most of the military and government were unaware of Gen. Musharrafs plans and did not have the full backing of the military or the government. Secondly no proper logistical supply routes were established leaving many of the Pakistani defenders with limited supplies and reinforcements. The soldiers on the peaks were largely left to fend for themselves while supply lines were being established behind them. Pakistan had not only failed to establish a proper supply route they tried doing so without any proper air support as Gen. Musharraf sought to rely on stealth and quick movements. Finally the Pakistanis were completely outnumbered as a total of  Pakistanis were deployed against nearly  Indian soldiers.Setbacks werent confined to Pakistan as India faced many of their own problems. For one they actually left these extremely strategic areas abandoned and the Pakistanis simply walked in and sat down. This meant that India had to fight a literal uphill battle....the hills in this case are a series of mountains that are part of the highest ranges in the world. You can tell now where Indias logistical nightmare kicked in. India was successful in shelling the supply lines and carrying out airstrikes on dugin Pakistani positions.  After weeks of shelling the Indians would launch an infantry assault on these positions. Despite the Pakistanis lacking fresh supplies and reinforcements they put up a ferocious fight using the high altitude to their full advantage. The Pakistanis were even able to shoot down several Indian jets. Eventually Indian persistence paid off and Pakistani soldiers were forced to withdraw from these positions. By the end of the fighting Pakistan had lost  men and India had lost around  but India recaptured all the lost territories and declared victory. In Pakistan there was general outcry in the Parliament and in the government as investigations were launched as to how the events transpired.These events lead to the souring of relations between Gen. Musharraf PM Nawaz Sharif and the civilian government at large. Three months after the end of the war he launched a military coup that overthrew the civilian government and lead him to declare himself as President of Pakistan until  when he was forced out of power through mass protests.VideosHeavy artillery fire traded with Pakistan Indian perspectiveInterview with Pakistani POWs w English subtitles Part  amp Part Indian soldiers hand over the bodies of dead Pakistani soldiersIndian soldiers carrying out artillery strikes on Pakistani positionsEdit I welcome all new information and corrections.,CombatFootage,d96m4i1,52,t5_2v0c6

The issue is that its not the US that supplies most of their weapons and funding but instead regional powers namely KSA Qatar and Turkey. Currently the US has oversight of that through two operations rooms in Amman and southern Turkey but if the US pulls out it will lose that influence.  At that point Turkey Qatar and KSA will be responsible for backing the rebels  Qatar has explicitly stated that they will continue to do so  and they have very different ideas about who to support and to what degree.,CombatFootage,damxzrw,3,t5_2v0c6

10002965,0,t1_dbbebz3,Because its fairly easy to achieve precise alignment of a post and a notch in open sights. The post precisely fits into the notch so its pretty obvious visually if you are not aligned. With peep sights you are placing the tip of the notch in the middle of a relatively large circle the peephole. Its more difficult to visually tell whether the post is exactly at the center. So a cheekweld is kind of a cheat which places your eye close to the peep hole and utilizes your instincts to put your eye exactly at the center of the peep hole to get the biggest field of view.Having said that I think training for consistent cheekweld would be beneficial even with open sights because it would allow for a faster alignment.,CombatFootage,dbbeycv,3,t5_2v0c6

It is important to knew this because when it only jihad then the actions of the US and what led to them to attack Iraq would be justified. and we all know that is Wrong.Secondly as you claim to be in Iraq you should know that Moqtada AL Sadar was a prominent IraqiShia Figure so you are telling me that Sunni government and military members were fighting the Shia Majorty and the US following the Fatwadecleration of a Shia Figure. you must sort the chronical order of how things went down.you can not admit that there were a real resistance to the american Invasion which was nationaly motvated and i know later the Jihadist movement took control of the Insurgency. ,CombatFootage,dc321uk,0,t5_2v0c6

Even some of the nonArab groups such as the Nubians and the Darfurians are pretty Arabized culturally. Its a lot easier for Arabs and East Africans to pick up each others languages since theyre all Semitic languages.gtBut this makes me curious.

Most of them served as soldiers or government officials. Theyre known as Siddi or Habshi which basically denotes that they came from East Africa and are mostly Muslim but theres a sizable Hindu and Christian minority among them.

10560988,0,t1_dd511m5,I invite you to reread my post Hitler. You claimed there was no such thing as Muslim terrorism before  as if America was to blame for Islamic savagery. I clearly showed you that Americas very first major interaction with the Islamic world as a country was one of conflict that was began by Muslims acting in the name of Islam against Christianity  this disproves your notion that America is somehow responsible for Islamic violence.The definition of terrorism has obviously changed from the post world to today but Muslim violence has not. Youre being disingenuous by pigeonholing all Islamic violence into a fairly modern term st century terrorism whereas Im arguing its part of a larger picture of Muslim violence that has taken place for more than one thousand years now. Youre simply retreating behind the semantics of the word terrorism.And the funny thing is the only person in this conversation that has provided any type of source so far is me. But here Ill oblige you. Im wasting my time because youll probably in true nazi fashion attempt to discredit the sources andor split hairs for every single example but you cant say I didnt try to help deprogram your brainwashingIslamic terror in the United States from  to todayIslamic terror s and onwardsThis took me two seconds to search Adolf.

10918796,0,t1_de63gfs,gt You just face the camera straight downIve done the maths that small bomb was dropped from more than  meters of altitude probably around . . Nothing assures you that the yaw axis of the drone is perfectly orthogonal to the ground as its configuration is used to stay still and make small adjustments. At such an altitude just a really tiny  difference means your bomb is already about . meters off target and this is cumulative to other errors.. even if the camera has a setting such as to be pointed in the direction of the yaw axis perfectly down relative to the drones plane this is done to a certain degree of accuracy. Controls and mechanisms werent engineered for such an accuracydemanding use. Same reasoning as before a small . error leads to more than m off the target. Cumulative. Bombs are mounted horizontally released and only then they get more or less vertical due to aerodinamic forces. Everyone with an understanding of aerodinamics gets that this will give the falling bomb an horizontal speed which in base of the initial configuration which will also sway the bomb even if points  and  are perfect. Hard to calculate the more altitude the more important this is as the previous  points. Intuitively its a big factor in a  seconds drop id go for  gt meter.And then yeah wind for how small residual drone movement etc which are even more important that previous points. To sum this up when bombing from such an altitude even in best case scenario you aint so accurate to reliably hit humvees.

10940897,0,t1_de871p4,Partially correct.Yes the USSR and Nazi Germany did the same thing.Well its doubtful whether the people who did this can be considered devout muslims. At best they are devout followers of a very modern deathcult based on Islam. Saying IS are devout muslims is comparable to saying that the Mormons who killed travellers during the s the Branch Davidians who died in Waco the followers of Jim Jones Peoples Temple were devout christians. It is like saying that Aum Shirikyo nervegassed thousands of people in Tokyo subway because they were devout Shintoists or like stating that the  Movement who kill unbelievers in Myanmar are devout Buddhists. To me they arent nor is IS a group of devout muslims. Groups like these profess to be devout and boy they usually know their scripture! But they twist it to their own purposes and are loathed by the mainstream adherents to said faith. IS is NOT islam.No they dont think that we are animals. According to the quran there are four types of people Muslim Ahl alKitab People of the Book Kufar often translated as unbelievers but more literally heathens and Murtadd apostates. A muslim is a person who believes in a singular god who sent his final and definitive will down to earth through a guy called Muhammad. The Ahl alKitab are people who believe in a singular god but dont believe in Muhammads message  Jews Christians Sabians and Hindus for instance. Then theres the Kufar or heathens who believe in multiple gods because they never heard of Muhammads or Jesus or Abrahams or anyone elses messages about there only being one god. Neither of these groups are considered evil unclean or like animals. Hell the Quran goes to great lengths when it comes to outlining the way each group should be treated! Apostasy is a different matter though. An apostate is one who knows that theres only one god that a long line of prophets have made his will and intentions clear yet refuses to acknowledge this. Such a person should according to Islamic scripture be put to death  as in Talmudic and biblical scripture I might add. So what do groups like IS do? They claim that everyone who disagrees with them is an apostate then kill em. But this still doesnt mean they regard everyone but them to be animals. In Islam apostates are BELOW animals. Animals dogs and pigs included have a place under the sun or a raison detre. Otherwise why would God have made them? The unbeliever is a different matter for they were created through the power of ShaitanIblis and thus must be rooted out. EDIT Mixed up the plurals.

Of course everyone interprets international law as suits their purposes anyhowincendiary rocket from a helicopter hits the enemy in urban combat? Goodthe deployment didnt endanger civilians and thus was justifiable.Rocket misses its target?
