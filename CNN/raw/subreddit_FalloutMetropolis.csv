10950053,0,t1_de9dwd0,Youd dive into the hornets nest of Vault  to try and stop Keziah only to realize that once again you and Philips were too late. But you can find clues as to where Keziah has gone  where the ritual is going to take place. Aside from that maybe in the plasma weapon workshop you can find a discarded prototype.I dont think the Philips family would have a tradition of foiling Yag cultists. Rather Philips wound be aware of a long line of people for whom fate has chosen to combat the followers of Yag. A few might have been relatives of his. Most werent. But all the same he feels the weight of history on his shoulders. Likewise there have been many incarnations of the Yag Cult. The Dunwich family has been involved numerous times but were not always in the picture or at least not always in charge.For the last  years theyve been excavating the ritual site theyve unleashed the GillMen from the secret labs theyve revived the three spawn of Yag from their  years of hibernation and theyve been clashing with Philips and others like him over artifacts left behind at Dunwich Corporation facilities all over the East Coast. Theyve also been repairing and improving the machinery needed to summon Yag and securing nuclear power sources to fuel said machinery.,FalloutMetropolis,de9f599,1,t5_3j195
10978421,0,t3_5wp234,I like how the name the tribals give the aliens is derived from The Day The Earth Stood Still. So the Zetans attempt to abduct you like in Mothership Zeta when the humans on the moon save you? Thats a fairly decent way to start the DLC. Its certainly better than you getting in some crackpots homebrew rocket to go to the moon.,FalloutMetropolis,decdgpe,1,t5_3j195
