Yes you can get a power ticket for something like  but it only gives you  in credit to redeem enough for a foot long Rockies dog with peppers and onions mix and sauerkraut to only cost  cents at almost any if not definitely any stall in the stadium but YMMV. There is a lounge that has live music before shows from various local bands and the rooftop where it takes place in has booze. Lots of it. Usually from the Tavern or the Tuaca lounge.House rules dictate two drinks at a time dont act like a drunken incoherent jackass and dont be pissed off if you bring your beer to the counter and I deny you the two beverages you ordered Im bound by house rules to only let you carry two at a time. With that said I know that the Tavern and stall  on the rooftop have  oz beers before scheduled first pitch.Anyway you can buy a lot of stuff there. My recommendation is Extreme Dog behind home plate on the first floor since its basically chipotle but for foot longs. However the monster nachos are one of the best deals at the stadium.Let me know if you have any other questions.,rockies,ctmihs4,1,t5_2ufh6
