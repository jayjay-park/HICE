1374764,0,t3_29t5hs,A lot of people gave suggestions for your website the last time and its still a problem. LCS said it pretty well.Your website sucks. It has no personality nothing grabbing me making me want to sign up for your service. When I open up your home page I feel as though Im looking at a screen within a screen. Whats with all the white space? I wont ask you if it looks good Im telling that it plain doesnt. When I go to your booking page Im met with a simple Launch  form nothing else. No reassurance no comfort no anything really except where Im supposed to dutifully enter my credit card.For example from the most basic SEO perspective the lttitlegt tag you have is Home. Good title tags are essential. I Googled your company name and the result is displayed with the hyperlink Commercial Cleaning. When I visit your website you seem to be more than just a Commercial Cleaning company. Why not let people know that? Same with your meta description  you have one but its a little boring and uninspired. Door hangers and radio ads arent likely to convert many customers.  From what Ive seen on this sub Id far sooner recommend flyers as a traditional marketing method rather than door hangers.

Youre going into business for a variety of reasons one of which should be that you think you can do something better than your competition. So dont start off from day  by copying your competition. Also you might know what they charge but you dont know that theyre a good a business. You dont know their margins. They might be a couple months away from going out of business. They might be a front for another less legitimate business. They might have a nice BB niche competent that brings in the real cash. But first figure out your costs.

Your second question depends on whether or not you are going to be doing subcontract or employee route. Whichever way you go you wont want to start by breeding a culture of hurrying to get to the next job or your reputation will suffer. I would suffice to say Team A this job should take  hours but if you are coming up on that time frame and its not finished you need to stay longer and make sure its  complete. Remember you have to be customer focused first and foremost or the model will not work.I am also curious though if Launch software can make this happen behind the scenes.

I tried something small on the side but its not going well and I wish I had instead focused on my website. I just want this to be a place where people can go to make plans for their companion animals in the unfortunate event of a death. Its morbid but its important. I see so many animals on kill lists and in shelters because they hadnt been any plans made in case something happened  Im hoping this site can help cut down on those numbers and help spread awareness at the same time. So there really isnt room for money to be made other than ads  but I doubt I would make the money I need to make to support my family just by having ads on that site. Thank you for saying that my idea speaks volumes about the kind of person I am that was kind of you.

4985661,0,t1_cumx8mf,Most of my best selling products are not private label either. That said I still try to bundle them or include an extra or do anything to my listing that may prohibit someone else from hopping on.For example if I sell guitar straps maye I bundle my strap with a pic so other sellers cant hop on my listing unless they also want to go buy pics and include them. Thats a stupid example but anything to keep other people off your listings. My experience on Amazon is whoever has the lowest price is going to sell the majority of product. I have a lot of competition with auto pricing scripts or something where as soon as I undercut them  minutes later they are a penny under me. I dont like getting into price wars to where were all packing orders for nothing so if you have something you can private label my advice is to private lable it and eliminate your competition. I didnt mean you cant make money with non private lable products it will help you make larger margins and not deal with other sellers on the same listing though which is valuable. ,EntrepreneurRideAlong,cumyg30,3,t5_2twzl
4995011,0,t1_cungj52,You know whats funny yoga mats and silicone baking mats are two products I have had on my backburner for a while. I kind of had a cool marketing thing and a niche brand for each. I like that they are light which makes shipping from China more reasonable as well as shipping to AMazon FBA. I also like they are low price items as well. I was super nervous the first time I dealt with factories in China or people on Alibaba. Just use suppliers who accept Paypal and youre pretty safe. Id also suggest sorting your results only by I forget all the terms but gold sellers whove had factory inspections and inventory inspections. Start small. Just because a seller says min order is  pieces if you contact them they will probably do  pieces. Dont ask for samples in your first email and when you do offer to pay for them or youll be ignored. Also dont mention your just starting out or youll be ignored. ,EntrepreneurRideAlong,cuo32fp,2,t5_2twzl

11524517,0,t3_64431x,Inapp quoting where the quoting procedures themselves arent open to being viewed by the clients.Eg my company quotes by floors windows bathrooms. Severity .x .x .x multiplier etc. Dont want clients to see that Im multiplying their job by . because their house is severely dirty. Id want to store all of the quote information in the SaaS for scheduling purposes but only send the dollar amount quote. Which leads me toScheduling purposes to be able to schedule to the minute from a quote amount would be wonderful.Eg I charge  per man hour undisclosed to clients. So a  job two cleaners will take one hour total. If the quoting app calculates a total of . for a job Id love it if this would automatically convert to scheduled hours. Which leads me toOptimal mapped routing per the scheduled hours. To be able to push a button and the days regularly cleaned houses are scheduled to the optimal route respective to my teams would be wonderful. Naturally with allowances for breaks travel time etc. Which leads me toPush notifications sent to my team leaders informing them of all necessary job requirements per the quoting information as captured earlier. Followed by push notifications reminding my team leaders at timed intervals of the time schedule  minutes until you leave. Better start mopping. Which leads me toWhen my team leader checks out of a job Id like an optional text message sent to the client informing them the clean is complete. Which leads me toEfficiency control. Team leaders being able to check in and out of jobs would prove incredibly valuable in terms of efficiency control. To be able to say why are you always late with that house? Do you need more time? Are we undercharging? Etc.Just a few thoughts. Good luck.,EntrepreneurRideAlong,dg2b0vm,2,t5_2twzl
