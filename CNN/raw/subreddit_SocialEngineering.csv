99308,0,t1_cepe3hy,This is of course a matter of opinion but IMO using manipulation techniques to get better prices is kind of a moral gray area.  I like expensive shoes myself and this sort of technique isnt something Id use at a mom and pop shoe store or a respectable corporate chain.  The place I buy from treats me well and stands behind what they sell.You mentioned that SE techniques could be considered to be sociopathic.  This is certainly true but as an individual person its important to keep in mind that a lot of the entities you have transactions with on a day to day basis are sociopathic as well.  Large corporations are sociopaths almost by definition due to the dilution of individual responsibility for the corporations actions.  The only way to get a fair deal with a sociopath is to be a sociopath yourself.  This doesnt mean its okay to commit fraud just that when youre dealing with someone who is going to use every legal means at their disposal to get as much of your money as possible while giving you as little as possible acting the same way is just good business sense.,SocialEngineering,cepqiwh,4,t5_2qlud

I personally had one of these teachers at school and she was in the same situation until something inside her clicked. She used to be very quiet polite and say thank you for your apology after someone said sorry no matter how sarcastically. In the second semester this is what she did First she used a general good way to gain control of crowds is to separate them. This can be done as simply as sending the kids out of the classroom. Also dragging eachother away from friends helps. Next she threw everything nice she knew about herself out the window when it came to communicating with the usual culprits she. was. cold.Another very effective technique was to bring them back to the work the students had submitted. For example after an essay if a few of the kids were acting up again she would walk up to them and place a note on their table pointing out what they did wrong in the essay. She followed up by saying I wouldnt talk if I were you. These pointers have to be delivered embarrassingly but with enough detail for the kids to take it onboard. hoped this helped ,SocialEngineering,cm5r4f7,20,t5_2qlud

6207272,0,t3_40l3pv,Sorry about the wall of text. I have depression and used to struggle a lot with selfharm in addition to my social anxiety so this issue is important to me. I hope what I say is at least mildly helpful. Feel free to ask questions if you want here or privately. You probably wont be able to get someone to seek help unless they already feel open to discussing their mental health with you so I am going to answer your questions in the other order. How I would get someone to open up to me Id probably try to find anyone they know and who they see as normal who suffers from a mental health problem and talk about that persons struggles with them in a nonjudgemental way in my case I would use myself or one of my friends. If you dont know of anyone close to you who has a mental illness you can talk about celebrities or book characters or people in the news. Find someone with a mental illness and express empathy and understanding for this person. This will give whoever youre talking to an avenue to open up to you and establish that youre good at listening and caring about people in a mental health context. Obviously be careful not to say anything dismissive or judgemental about the people you are discussing. If you come across as uncaring there is probably little to no chance of coming back from that. Once Ive established I can relate and am nonjudgemental I often ask direct questions like Person X said some days they just dont want to get out of bed. I think that happens to me a lot too. Have you ever been depressed like that? I always try to include some aspect to the question in this case the fact that Ive experienced it too that shows Im not going to think less of them if they do say yes because it means theyre less likely to lie. When theyre more comfortable which usually comes naturally after sharing information like the above questions then you can start to ask more general questions and discuss it more seriously. Id ask things like How often does it happen to you? and so on still being careful to make sure they know its okay to say ALL THE TIME or only rarely. Once we have one conversation I would tell them Im worried about them and ask if its okay if I talk about this more with them some other time. Usually theyll say If you have to or I guess because no one wants to be all enthusiastic about talking about depression  its depressing. Some people say No thanks. I usually ignore that and bring it up later anyway but try to be sensitive and pick a moment other people arent around and make sure I explain WHY Im not just letting it go After that last conversation I was worried about you. This will piss some people off so its important to be careful in how you approach it and not annoy them. How I would convince someone to seek help After you two have established trust and communication and theyve communicated to you that they actually have some of these depression symptoms that would be the time to start suggesting finding help. Id try to make the initial steps for them as easy as possible  provide specific websites that you know are reputable and supportive provide the phone number to suicide crisis hotlines always do this  studies have shown that if the number is RIGHT THERE people are more likely to use it when they need it offer to attend appointments with them if theyd like you to only if theyre already comfortable around you offer to help them get to and organise appointments if they want eg call the clinic to make the appointment drive them there cover for them if they need to lie to someone etc. However be careful not to push yourself into their life and try to force help because it wont work. You need to take it slow and be nonjudgemental and accepting of their decisions even if those decisions dont make perfect sense to you and they often wont because depressionselfharmsuicide rarely makes sense. Even if they decide seeking help is not right for them at that time accept their decision and let them know youll be supportive if they change their mind. Then keep being supportive and nonjudgemental and keep listening to them whether they decide to seek help or not. Help is often ineffective if the person doesnt want it so youll have to let them take their time to realise help is something they want. The only time you should not accept their decisions is if theyre saying things like Im worthless or I should die and those you should challenge without making a big deal about it. For example if they say Im worthless you could say Youre not worthless to me and then either discuss it or change the subject follow their lead. Disagreeing with this emphasises that you care about them and will make them more likely to believe that you appreciate them in future. Obviously if theyre about to kill themselves distract them if you can and call an ambulance if necessary probably this did not need to be mentioned but just in case. If they die then your attempt to help was unsuccessful so try not to let that happen if you can avoid it. If someone seems reluctant to find help you can still try to make them more likely to accept the idea. I would allow them to gradually escalate the help they receive rather than shoving THERAPY at them first. So start with supportive online communities where they can sit back and watch at first then hopefully theyll voluntarily join in because no one wants to be isolated when there are people right in front of them that can understand and maybe even help. Those communities are often best at suggesting help because they can suggest from the point of view of someone who has already had that problem and has resolved it using the tools being suggested. Even if online communities are not their thing I would suggest finding them someone else who suffers from a similar issue to talk it over with. Suggestions are always better accepted from someone who truly understands. Ways to change stigma Meet others with mental illnesses and realise theyre just normal people.  Challenge people who think mental illnesses are scary. Imagine finding out you HAVE that illness! Its terrifying to the people who live with it too but they dont have a choice.  Challenge misinformation spread by the media. e.g. Half the time on a TV show some character will have a mental illness which magically never actually interferes with their life except one time which is quickly resolved by the other main characters. That or theyre dangerous criminals.  Going with the above point dont let people assume mental illness means crazy dangerous criminal.  In fact most who have mental illness are more likely to be victims rather than perpetrators of crimes.  Be open and honest about your own mental health struggles and the likelihood of those around you having them. For example I read earlier today that  of people will experience a mental health condition in their lifetime. ,SocialEngineering,cyv77uw,5,t5_2qlud

Often times its even to the point where if you arent charging enough youll be seen as less valuable or a liarscammer etc. This can be seen often among rich people when buying brands perceived as luxury  if the price tag isnt high enough then it clearly isnt luxury.The comment I replied to also mentioned a very good point backed up by a book and the CIA even  Number  of using random rewardpunishment conditioning cycles... though that might tip your moral radar a bit too much. gtThe CIA suggests using rewards and punishments in a random illogical manner so that the subjects regress into a childlike dependence.Thats really what gatekeeping is about at its core though  just varying levels of severity. ,SocialEngineering,d30vs4v,2,t5_2qlud

Dont spend your time trying to prove him wrong using Google. Try to be an example of how he can phrase things in a better way.  Shaving makes hair grow back thicker because he saw it once when a friend shaved one eyebrow.  Its not that it grows thicker the broader angle just makes it look thicker. If its a common enough misconception that The Mayo Clinic has a page on it. Id give the guy some room.  Glass flows because the glass in his old barn is thicker at the bottom.   Hes right. Glass in an amorphous solid. Its quite common for older glass to exhibit waves or distortion over time.  An engine requires exhaust backpressure to run properly.  Similar to the Mayo Clinic thing this is a common misconception even among car enthusiasts. If its counterintuitive enough that even a few of the gear heads mess it up you can give the guy a pass.  He claims that climate change isnt real  This is a hotly contested and highly controversial subject for a reason. Educated people on both sides make compelling arguments. It may surprise you to learn that John Coleman found of The Weather Channel is an outspoken critic of global warming. Just because someone holds a viewpoint that is different from yours doesnt automatically make them wrong.  Hes told a pot grower of fifteen years who has excellent product that his whole setup is wrong and wont work  This sounds like more of a humility issue and possibly a demonstration of the DunningKreuger effect.
