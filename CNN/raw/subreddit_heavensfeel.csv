So how do you think your A could possibly take C with B inbetween?gt Im assuming you thought I meant B to A instead of AThat wouldnt make any sense why would you move it into your direction?gt since you would just use your knight in that caseDont remember any knight capable of getting to A... did I miss something?gt so lets just play with that insteadSo which of those two does matter now? A or B?  Also we can continue with how you intended it if we can clean my or your memory up again DHere is how it currently looks on my side D,heavensfeel,cxokp71,1,t5_3b64w
5895675,0,t1_cxsftm4,Robert felt a brief moment of excitement nobody usually cared about the subject presumably out of fear. Magi have always tried to ignore the very thought that there could be an existence superior to their own.Yes Dead Apostle Ancestors to be precise. Theyre commonly referred to as Vampires powerful ancient beings with powers surpassing even that of most Servants. Surely youve heard the legend of the fight between our old man Zeltrech and Crimson Moon?After taking a brief pause Robert realized he was getting ahead of himself.Ah I apologize. Im using a bunch of terms youre probably not familiar with. Talking about them is frowned upon as well so it might be in your best interest as a new student to pursue this stuff on your own.,heavensfeel,cxsggry,1,t5_3b64w
5902832,0,t1_cxtd1nc,You silly girl. hes just a bookworm he bears you no ill will. Im now calm again and somewhat embarrased by my own thoughts. Kishtar appears to have immersed himself in another book. I see. That is indeed very noble. Personally my mindset is more that if an opportunity presents itself you should seize it. Once again putting down my book. Well enough about my little box. Can I ask what you are working on? You seem very engaged in it.I rest my face in my palms and shoot him a smile. ,heavensfeel,cxte8io,1,t5_3b64w

6796240,0,t1_d0mjh08,Well I would rather see him as Rider since his NP cannot be used on foot though I guess Lancer also would be fine as long as he does get horse like Artoria Alter Lancer or manages to find some vehicle.

Normally a C rank Noble Phantasm but upon chanting Venimus vidimus Deus vicit. it shines with white light and crushes anything on the path of Riders charge. Like Ionioi Hetairoi it comes about through the combined efforts of the companions who all shared his dreams ambitions and beliefs. Though the principle behind it is copletely different because it resembles the tactic of Winged Hussars. Like the formation which during charge gradually gathered pace and closed ranks while approaching the enemy to strike as one warrior Rider instead of performing many simultaneous attacks gathers all power into a deadly charge and amplifies it by the will of all his former soldiers. The devastating glory of the attack is so great that opponent can only run away or stand in awe. Due to that all Noble Phantasms or Skills used to defend or counterattack suffer one rank down two if opponent can be labelled as foe of Christianity.,heavensfeel,d0mn7th,1,t5_3b64w

She wondered aloud trying to determine whether or not she wanted to be here.Her indigo hair was let down for once allowing it to flow over her thin frame from behind her black veil and her sundress had been exchanged for what looked more like a high schoolers prom dress meaning to say flashy and flaming purple.Seeing a fellow woman she unconsciously went to seek help from them even though it looked like she was in conversation with a man.Hey there how are you doing? You have got to tell me where you got that dress! It matches you so well that I have to ask  are you a fashion guru? She bubbles excitedly to mask her underlying emotion of exasperation.

8669559,0,t1_d6paxpf,In response to the question Alberich chuckled a little. Youd be surprised at how much a drop of claret can revitalise the body. Truly transformative. Ill pass on the coffee.Placing his weight on the cane Alberich looked genuinely deep in thought as he accessed his centuries of experience not that this was his field of expertise.Commander I am no military man though I have seen my fair share of wars so I will add merely my opinion. From my perspective it is likely that the enemy has gained access to our planned route and coordinates either from our communications or from inside. And on top of that they appear to be ahead of us in reaching the Leader. Which changes things.It is our top priority to crush the force to send a message. So that the South do not think to try to invade again. The Leader himself is no matter. We can manipulate whoever they choose to instate as replacement. For the moment he acts as magnificent bait. I would suggest a good oldfashioned pincer strategy between our forces and the North Korean military. In any case we must ensure that we approach by a new path and that we prevent any radio monitoring. By either the North Koreans or our foes.This is merely my suggestion. I havent needed to touch up on my military strategy for years. I shall leave the final decision and logistics with you. The only imperative is that the opposing force is crushed. The consequences can be managed later.,heavensfeel,d6pbcym,1,t5_3b64w

8989155,0,t1_d7s14y0,Zane looked over towards where the smoke was coming from and groaned a bit Max wasnt going to like this. Getting up he went towards and woke Max up. Max made a pathetic groan Zane what is it now. Zane simply pointed where some smoke was coming from the color was different than a fire so it was probably a smoke grenade. Max took a deep breath and just looked at Zane get Reyn back here by whatever means necessary If you guys arent back near this clearing before enemies attack then stay close but out of the way this clearing is the only fully safe spot from the defences.Zane looked Max over will you be alright to fight alone of nessecary. Max just started laughing Zane These guys interrupted my sleep bombed my hotel made me blow up my car forced us to camp in the woods ruined my favorite conbat suit and now they interrupt my nap. IVE HAD ENOUGH EVERYONE OF THEM DIES NO SURVIVORS!!! Calming down from his yelling Max gave his final order to Zane. I meant what I said about the traps though so I give you permission to use our surprise weve been working on so get Reyn and eviscerate whoever gets in your way.Zane had a grin of pure glee at this declaration aye aye captain he said with a salute and turned toward the smoke and got into a sprinting position. Glowing lines appeared all across his body signifying his reinforcement roughly doubling his speed but then runes glowed all around his clothes bringing him up to triple speed and strength and with a blur he was off towards the smoke only needing seconds to disappear going at the speed of a little over  miles a hour.,heavensfeel,d7scwmk,2,t5_3b64w
