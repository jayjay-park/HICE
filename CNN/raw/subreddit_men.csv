210273,0,t1_cf2doop,I have too. The point I was trying to make is that most men seem to think that if a guy is attracted to his female friend he deserves a sexual relationship with her. By that logic a gay dude being nice to you to just get in your pants should mean he gets your junk because he a dude and hes attracted to you. Its a double standard. But fine lets say the problem lies in her reaction. But what if you turned down the gay friend and he started saying stuff like but I was nice to you were close you always say you want a relationship with someone your friends with? I imagine youd probably lose your cool at some point.Its interesting because this showed up on a subreddit for women a day or two ago. My wife showed it to me. Apparently this is the way women feel about the matter because there wasnt a single disparaging thing written by any women on this. Also chica in this comic didnt berate the dude she got pissed off. He then tried to defend himself with some garbage about how he was nice so he deserves a date. She felt objectified and lied to which led her to realize that she didnt want to be friends with someone who was ultimately just friends with her to achieve his own ends so she let him know where he stood with her and left it at that. tldr  The chick reacted the way I imagine anyone would react if they were propositioned by a friend who then got indignant for not being let into their pants.,men,cf2e7ip,2,t5_2qkr8

940238,0,t1_chawvws,thank you.  I can understand if it were an emergency and he REALLY had to go but this is like oh your using the facilities?  well Ill just treat the tub like a urinal then.  I have explained to him that peeing occasionally in the shower is different than using the tub like a urinal but he tells me its a guy thing and Im nuts to say anything.. the validation that its not a normal guy thing helps thank you. ,men,chb5sra,2,t5_2qkr8

3226847,0,t1_cowg4xz,Id like both but as far as myself is concerned I have that already mostly figured out. Purpose wise I dont know what Ill do but as long as it can support me and a family it wont matter to me. A jobs a job Ive had some worse than others but so long as I get paid and its not causing me injury Im fine with it. As far as women go I dont really know any. I dont even know where to go to meet any. I could go to the bar here in town but as its a small town theres not much. I can go to the college town not so far away but every time Ive done that I just end up going home with less confidence. ,men,cowgu08,1,t5_2qkr8

3577505,0,t3_31bi3p,This is such cookiecutter bullshit. People are going to live their own lives and go their own directions. This is a best a guide to live in a materialistic corporate controlled world. Steve Jobs and Bill Gates didnt live with these guidelines and they made out very successfully. ,men,cq02axb,0,t5_2qkr8
