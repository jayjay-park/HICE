104102,0,t1_ceq9wy9,NonCompete Clauses are totally at the discretion of the producerpromoter. Its sole purpose is to discourage acts from playing shows that would impact their ability to seel tickets. More likely than not if Bonnaroo SuperflyAC works anything like C theyll jsut use the NCC to drive down the price of certain artists who are playing other festivals. Its unlikely that youll see any drastic impacts on the roos lineup due to these. The only thing that Id really watch out for  if a potential headliner was playing a nonfestival arenalarge venue show in NashvilleMemphis in April  July.,bonnaroo,ceqa7oz,2,t5_2rg7a
105361,0,t3_1vat1y,I went to the first Counterpoint and camped. It was fun but it doesnt really compare and its not really meant to. I actually see my neighbor from Counterpoint everywhere! I ran into him twice at Roo last year and also at Bassnectar NYE this year! Heres what I can think of Its much smaller and cheaper. The site was absolutely amazing much better than the Farm but unfortunately they have given up that site and weekend to TomorrowWorld now.  The crowd skews younger and the lineup leans much more electronic obviously.  The vibe is pretty friendly but its not as relaxed as Roo and way more of a College vibe though not so much that its terrible.  They didnt have enough porta potties the first day. They eventually got more but didnt clean them enough.  Security is about the same as Roo There was only one free water station last year which pretty much always had a line and they made you dump your camelbak at security which I later just ignored since they would tell you to do it but then let you walk past them and turn to the next person. Happy to answer any other questions. DOh Also I am planning on going this year but I may just do Day parking since I live in Atlanta. ,bonnaroo,ceqfdbm,3,t5_2rg7a

162893,0,t3_1vye13,PLEASE LET THIS BE TRUE. I just saw him in December everyone it was seriously insane. He came out on time played for  and  hrs and even had a  min Kanye rant mostly about the Grammys and about how much he loves Christmas ALL IN AUTO TUNE. His stage set up was obscenethe mountainhim climbing the mountainthen a monster with these glowing red eyes came out and chased him around stage. Then during Blood on the Leaves THE MOUNTAIN CRACKED OPEN AND JESUS CAME OUT. I honestly had to sit down and have a moment. He broke his set up into movementsfighting fleeting falling rising power. It was just.....so. Fucking. Good. In  he played Bonnaroo only about  months after his mom died. He had a break down I cant fault him. He was trying to tour to ignore pain.

165919,0,t1_cexb35c,This is what I dont understand and what Ive pointed out in this thread.

193098,0,t3_1wbckn,I wasnt at that Roo either but I still have no interest in having him on the farm. I am actually shocked so many people want to see him there. I thought here recently Kanye is being seen more and more as a joke especially with his recent video with Kim. I am going to say something polarizing which always brings on the downvotes. I think part of radiating positivity also involves giving and getting respect. I do not think Kanye is a remotely respectful person. Not just with the Bonnaroo debacle but everything he has ever done. From interrupting Taylor Swift the Bush doesnt like black people during a Red Cross event AIDs was manmade and placed in Africa again during an AIDS awareness event saying Zappos sells shit etc. I dont give a shit that he THINKS those things its the fact that he does things that are incredibly inappropriate for their time and place and reacts poorly when people dont like it. Jay Z can rule the rap industry and not act like a total douchebag so its not like it is some unattainable request.I am held accountable for my actions every day whether it is at work or in my personal life. If I do things that offend people it can lead to blow back in both areas. And I understand that if I choose to do things that are disrespectful I risk losing opportunities and relationships in both areas. So Kanye can do and say as he pleases but I will not support his career. I have a hard time having the mind set to radiate positivity toward someone who seems to have a hard time radiating anything other than self worth.And on top of that I really dont think he will put on a good show. I havent liked anything from Kanye since Graduation. Like I said I didnt really think may people took him seriously anymore so I am surprised that there are so many people who feel the way you do. And I am fine with others having a different opinion than me so it really has been a learning experience to see why so many people support him or still hate him. If he is at Roo I may not be. If I am there I sure as shit wont be at his show. ,bonnaroo,cf0fn37,12,t5_2rg7a

324317,0,t3_1xrwzy,Ive been GA the last four years and going VIP first time this year. I think for  me the biggest advantage is just eliminating all of the stress that comes with timing arrival waiting in car line getting a far away spot or not setting your tent up in less than  minutes to claim your space waiting in centeroo lines getting close for shows the list goes on. Driving  hours to Roo gives you a lot of time to stress about the uncontrollable things.  That said you need to do GA at least once to get the real Roo experience VIP almost feels like something my group has earned. If you do your homework and come prepared GA can be a really nice experience too but Im ready to kick back and get the most out of Roo this year. I think the exhaustion of walking and waiting in the heat played a big part of not getting the most out of it as well. Some times those late night shows just feel a little too far out of reach especially for those who are drug free. Thats my two cents! Either way youre at Bonnaroo the best fuckin festival in the world. ,bonnaroo,cfedwrz,4,t5_2rg7a

They were pretty great and their new light show is absolutely phenomenal but it lacks a bit of the energy of their old show.

My sisters boyfriend went last year and told me it was a great experience. He invited me to go this year with his group. Being in college and having pretty much all my remaining money designated to living expenses and other college expenditures I simply cant afford luxuries like this. I already told him I probably couldnt go because of the cost but he said theres room for me to go if I still want to. Ive never been and this will definitely make my summer since I never have the money for luxeries anymore. Thanks again for doing this and for your consideration. ,bonnaroo,cft7xqw,3,t5_2rg7a

The closest thing I can compare it to is an amusement park for music junkies.

583804,0,t3_20jwbv,My girlfriend and I usually bring a propane camp stove with us to Roo so making coffee in the morning is super easy. We also bring gallons of water. We use one of those ceramic drip coffee makers  just place coffee and a filter inside and pour hot water over. Makes great coffee and very easy too. Sometimes we will buy an iced coffee on our way to Centeroo which is awesome but know that you will have to finish it or dump it out before entering. Coffee stands are easy to find inside Centeroo as well. Hope that helps!! Edit Ours was actually a collapsible rubber drip filter you can buy at REI. One year we actually brought a French press. ,bonnaroo,cg6msja,1,t5_2rg7a
583935,0,t3_20g5sq,You are going to have a life changing experience. Bring a camel back for your backpack which will only enhance your stay at Roo. If you get a group together you can get a flag on a stickplastic pipe that isnt taller than you it is a rule and that will help you keep together in the massive throngs of people between huge music sets. Try to have cash for a variety of things  If you smoke cigs bring them. They are really expensive at the Roo store because of cig butt cleanup tax. Which means you should have a Gatorade bottle to throw them inside. Bring PeaceBuds they are awesome earplugs that are designed to allow you to hear concerts without damaging your hearing or experience. Do not speed in Tennessee when driving to the line. Tennessee cops will be everywhere until you are inside. Having a blanket or towel to sit in the glass field during daytime shows is a good idea. Good luck! Sorry people downvoted you. There are great people there but it does attract the less experienced as well. ,bonnaroo,cg6nbt6,1,t5_2rg7a

I guess if that Special Guest is someone really really amazing I could change that tone but theres not really a must see name on here I wont get a chance to see somewhere else except maybe Massive Attack Id like to see them. Roo has more names that are kind of rarebig gets for me i wont get many other chances to see Frank Ocean Damon Albarn Nick Cave superjams Kanye to an extent since this could be it for his US touring for a while.

Anyway me and my brother decide to go and tell this guy to cut it out then things get violent. He charges after us and I push him back. Meanwhile another guy comes over this guy happens to be black. Here we go.The unruly character decides to call this guy a Ni right to his face. This was a BIG mistake. I dont know if this new guy is exmilitary or what but in one swift move he clotheslines the violent man and puts his foot on his neck. Riot police and horses come and its all over.

1058570,0,t3_2680y8,For future years let me share how you buy a single VIP ticket copied from a different time I told someoneThere is a way to get a single VIP ticket from Bonnaroo that costs just a liiiiittle more than if you bought a pair and divided the cost in half. What you do is buy a GA ticket then you go here scroll to the bottom and and select the VIP upgrade and shuttle. You never have to actually use the shuttle. Add the upgrade to your cart when you hit next it makes you add the GA ticket to your cart.What happens is you receive a GA wristband and upgrade voucher that they exchange for a VIP wristband when you arrive on the farm. Well that is how it used to work maybe they send you a VIP band if you buy early enough.The total price for a regular set of tickets  is .. By upgrading you pay . you also do not get a parking pass. ,bonnaroo,chom3xe,2,t5_2rg7a

1091956,0,t1_chs6bcz,Going to try to answer my own question since Im seriously considering this setup with water ice frozen in bottles and this has been running through my head.In higher relative humidity environments warm air from the fan passing over the ice bottles would transfer some of its heat energy to the colder Ive bottle which makes the air colder before exiting the cooler but in the process some of the energy transfer would be spent condensing water out of the humid air resulting in an air that is not AS COLD as it would have been had the inflowing air been less humid. My intuition tells me that this setup would still provide some cooling just not as much but as an added benefit this would suck some of the humidity out of the air in a partially sealed environment like a tent so long as the water that is condensed on the cold bottles is drained away.Ive read in other places that this is a recipe for more humidity that may be true when using uncontained ice that can evaporate adding moisture to the air but if the ice is sealed in bottles it would not be possible for this system to add any more moisture to the air. On the contrary I think it may even remove some moisture from the air at the expense of some of the cooling powerEdit uugnaught did a great job explaining this with more science words and with a less optimistic conclusion,bonnaroo,chseqd4,1,t5_2rg7a

1196090,0,t3_27sy3a,I know a lot of people do canopy only. Ive never done it but some of the guys were going with do it every year. They bring tarps to use as walls in case of rain. Zip tie the tarps in place.. roll em up if you want it open during the day. A lot of people highly recommend it as its much cooler than a tent.Personally Id bring both. Maybe youll get lucky and be one of the few that has a huge camping spot. Maybe you can put your tent up and put your canopy over most of it so you can still use part of it for shade while the rest is shading the tent. If not oh well. Use the canopy. If I had to choose between one or the other Id choose canopy without a doubt.,bonnaroo,ci46fqv,3,t5_2rg7a

1240019,1,t1_ci93j6v,I didnt make any decisions on who got booked.. But it seems like if his rants and piss poor attitude are expected then he shouldnt be there at all. It goes deeper than different tastes.. It has a lot to do with humility and positivity. When an artist turns the crowd on itself hes doing something horribly wrong.. And if was expected then several people involved did something wrong. Worst vibes at a festival Ive ever experienced. ,bonnaroo,ci949o9,4,t5_2rg7a

While you love his ego and believe that hes supposed to rant to the patrons that are paying him to be there its easy to see why thats a huge turnoff to a lot of folks. That seems to pretty much be the antithesis of radiating positivity no? Rightly or wrongly people like that are always going to rub some other people the wrong way and it shouldnt come as a surprise when they do especially give his history at this festival.

I knew there wasnt stores listed on the map but I went to it anyway and two boys were hanging out at the map... CHEWING GUM!

My job is super demanding I work  everyday in sales and sometimes Saturdays with a quota every month I need to hit and an . hour commute every day. Bonnaroo is my only release. But Im back now and Im just so much more relaxed. Theres so much more to life than just work and Im trying to instill that mindset everyday. Though it may not be a positive mantra Im trying to turn it into one... Fuck it! Hey that sale didnt come through today as planned... fuck it! Ill get the next one. Ah shit Im on the late train again fuck it! Ill be on time tomorrow. Though it seems less responsible its actually improving all parts of my day because Im not crazy stressed am more amicable and able to deal with the ups and downs a lot better.

Our neighbors next to us were very friendly shouldnt be hard to find someone to mingle with in that area.  And once youre in Centeroo and at the stages its even easier. I split up from my group and went solo to about four shows and just placing yourself in the crowd youll make a connection with the people around you either through conversation and sometimes without even saying a word to eachother and just vibing out. Tagged along with them to different shows after was pretty cool. Feel like solo Roo would be a unique experience but by no means a bad one.

3985556,0,t3_362i3e,First are you a man or a woman? Secondly cotton. Cotton all day long. They breath and dont trap in heat. If youre a woman those cute see through tops are very adorable but they are normally synthetic and trap heat like a freaking oven. Yes they look breezy but unless they are silk they are not. Third dont wear swim trunks or bikini bottoms all weekend long. They do not breath and you dont want to deal with what happens when your trap all your parts in synthetics in  degree weather. Lastly whatever you wear the most important part of your outfit is comfortable shoes. I plan all these outfits and always wear my chunky black tevas that shorten my leg and dont really match but IDGAF because Im not dealing with swollen ankles. P.S. If youre an over packer or have a hard time deciding what to wear plan your outfits and pack them in gallon sized ziplock bags. Pack everything for the day accessories underwear everything. You can only wear whats in that days bag and youre not allowed to argue with yourself. I always pack one extra outfit rain gear and one extra layer. Makes a HUGE difference and everything fit a tiny little day pack. Im a dressmaker so Im obsessed with fabric and I live in Florida so if you have any other questions about heat happy clothes Im happy to answer them. ,bonnaroo,cral7l6,1,t5_2rg7a

I dont know enough about all the names to go through and pull out DJs comedians etc. But last year their full lineup list had  entries in total.

6234611,0,t1_cyyash4,Yea Im getting burnt out on all the talk now. I have seen enough to think for sure that the final announcement on Tuesday could be different in a few ways. Likely we wont lose much if anything. And we are getting at least some big names. To assume we know the only big names we are getting seems too good to be true or even cocky though we have good reason. Either the top  were on the list or artists who were too busy to  confirm yet arent there or an entire what stage cast or just the three or four we all think. One end I have come to is that if Death Cab Ween and rdEB are the only recentlegacymy slightly younger generation rock acts not top  I underestimated that genre. But there really is a LOT of good stuff in there and as long as I can stay busy on the farm I always can then I will have a blast.

But even then a lot of that goes back to paying tour costs.Edit Also Im not trying to argue that they could pay for the flight it just sounded like you were implying that they personally made millions.

A ton of people straight up gave me goodies. At Roo last year I encountered some straight up mean people. I think the vibes were about even. It really does depend on a hi youre around though.

One of us the Asian... had to look borderline of age and there was zero mention of carding anyone. I dont think they even consider this at the tollbooths. We had over the amount of beer for the two of us and they said nothing about it. Their search basically entailed opening the trunk and shutting it. When they DID find a GLASS bottle of whiskey they made us get rid of it because it is glass. They had zero issue with us getting rid of it by dumping out two bottles of a huge value pack of water to store it in there and then taking the remainder of the handle and walking up and down the car line offering shots through car windows till it was empty.

7893115,0,t3_4ncz5e, was my first year with  of my closest friends. Great lineup great first time. Been going with and without members of the original group since  was somewhat of a solo year and had just as much fun as ever except for this year. My mom went with me in  and  her first year she suffered a heat stroke and was ambulanced to the hospital. When it struck her and she hit the ground I was in shock I immidiately propped her up on her side as I was taught in First Aid and screamed for help. The surrounding Roovians rushed to our aid and supplied us with an umbrella damp cloth and water. long story short I was completely distraught so it was a HUGE surprise to me when I found her back at camp later that night. She told the doctors after she got stable was I have to see Neil Young. After that year Ive always brought a first aid kit or as much of a first aid kit security would allow and carry an extraclosed bottle of water with me so I could give it to someone that looked like they desperately needed it. Life is such a delicate and treasured phenomenon we have to live it to its extent while respecting it for its a fearsome and unforgiving at the same time. Metal Gear Solid  taught me Loyalty to the end and Bonnaroo has reinforced the value of comradery and how precious it is not just to your friends but to everyone. Im with you OP and with everyone that couldnt go and everyone there.rant,bonnaroo,d439d47,3,t5_2rg7a

8068624,0,t3_4pokzo,I did Bonnaroo in  and Glastonbury last year. To answer your questionsIm curious if any of our Bonnaroo community has ever been there before? Not really a question but yes Ive been to both.Did you have a good time?  It was phenomenalWhat was your experience there?  Again. Phenomenal. To give a short story I was inspired by my time at Bonnaroo to go to Glasto actually decided Id do it the Saturday I was at Bonnaroo. Luckily got a ticket in October . Booked my flight in Feb  which turned out to be just about the best time to buy. I got the ticket and coach package since I knew I would need to take a bus to get there anyway. I went to Roo with a friend but went solo to Glasto. I stayed in a hostel for two nights padded time to make sure I made it even with a delay before catching my bus to the festival. The hardest part of the whole trip was carrying my  lb  lb is the airline max suitcase and a backpack the mile from the bus drop off to where I found to camp. Most people arrive on Wednesday which I did at noon notable music acts dont start until Friday. For the first two days I explored made some acquaintances ran a k with an antibullying charity saw a movie and the doc Amy before it came out. Once the music started I saw  acts all phenomenal. Okay except George Clinton was bad so I left that to see the end of Kanye and yeah I skipped Kanye at Roo . The first act was Hinds which I immediately became obsessed with they are amazing. How was it different? You camp between and amongst the stages. No cars means everyone is packed in and relatively close to everything. I could go back to my tent more frequently than Roo. Even though its rural there are sound laws. They  largest stages close around midnightish. But also the party goes later than Roo. There is a whole corner of the fest that is like  open air night clubs. Its crazy they build it for just a week of use. I saw an act Fat White Family go on just before sunrise. Food is better The weather is completely different. Everyone said how hot and dry it was yet it never got above  F and I was ankle deep in mud at times. This year and most years are colder and wetter. I didnt know this and was almost unprepared. The Brits have a different concept of hot. I was wearing a sweater while others were shirtless. No matter what itll get so cold you will see your breathe at night. My main takeaway was over there there is a concept of personal responsibility. I nor anyone was searched going in. You are allowed to bring in alcohol. People light and wave flares in the crowd for ambiance. And yet we all survived. There is no ice vendor anywhere yet there is a milk truck every morning.   BEST OF ALL one of the charities they support is WaterAid. SO there are plenty of water bottle refill stations around with the best coldest water Ive ever had at a fest. For those of you going there from the US how difficult was it to camp there as an international traveller?  I packed a tent tarp sleeping pad sleeping bag knee high boots and clothes. Would have been great to share the tent weight with someone else.Bought booze at a Tesco. Tip I learned stash your liquids under your tarp and tent the ground will keep it a bit cooler but ice wouldve been nice. Did you just check a small tent on the plane and then take the train to Glastonbury? Checked a two person tent and took the bus.How did that work out? Stressful getting on the bus at am for both bus trips but it all worked out.Any more questions?Edit tried to make it as legible as possible,bonnaroo,d4mzmuz,11,t5_2rg7a

10229929,0,t3_5mgw9k,Most memorable time was when I saw Sir Paul McCartney. I remember an older man and his wife were sitting in their lawn chairs next to me. They were sitting there all day to be able to get the spot they wanted. The man told me all the different performances he saw and how they were pretty decent and he didnt hate them. However he willprobably never listen to them again.  When Paul came out he started with  days a week. The man nudges me and says how he saw the Beatles many times and they never played this song live. Not once. The fact he opened with it was basically history. He then handed me the joint him and his wife were smoking and told me to enjoy myself.Also when he played Hey Jude everybody lit off those floating lanterns. There were soooo many of them in the air. It was just a sea of people singing nah nah nah nah nah nah and the lanterns were the air the weather was beautiful and I was with my two best friends. It couldnt of been a more perfect  experience.

10490088,0,t3_5q86l8,We built a full size canopy for our groop of  people.  It didnt cover the entire camp but gave us a huge chill area.  We used  or  ez ups to cover the rest and tarps to block out the sun from the east.We didnt want to only just use ez ups because their design makes them prone to trap heat underneath them.My friend who built it is out of the country right now so I dont have the exact instructions or final cost.  Ill get those from him on Tuesday and give you an update.  Until then Ill try and explain what I know about it.  For the full canopy we bought some metal posts and this a big piece of light colored clothlike material that looked woven or kinda porous.  We secured the canopy to the posts with ratchet straps.I think the whole thing cost maybe .  It worked great and gave us plenty of chill space.,bonnaroo,dcx5txj,3,t5_2rg7a

10499723,0,t1_dcv5ddz,Hand broom isnt necessary. Toiletries and stuff just bring what you have at home. Also sometimes sponsors are giving away free shampoo etc. I barely take one shower when Im at roo. Eating tools? Grab plastic silverware from a drive thru. Napkins salt pepper etc. not sure what else youd have to buy?Theres medic tents if you really hurt yourself. Just bring a few bandaids just in case. No need for a full first aid kit. A dishpan?? Are you cooking food or something? For me I find it easier to just eat food in centeroo instead of buying all the equipment to cook food plus the actual cost of the food Ive added it up and for me it just becomes a wash. For me eating know centeroo with friends when Im hungry is better than having to go back to camp and cook food then clean up etc. I bring alcohol to keep at camp and some other beverages and some chips and other easy snacks but other than that I usually spend about  total at roo on food alcohol souvenirs and random other things. Thats easily worth it to me for sheer convenience.  Instead of earplugs I fell asleep just listening to my headphones. Obviously that doesnt work for everyone but if youre near the stages it can be loud if you try to sleep early. Check of marshalls or tj max for cheap pillowsblankets etc you can find some really nice stuff there!Edit forgot to addBring some garbage bags to hang up at camp! Keeps things clean and easy!Some ziploc bags to keep phone and stuff in incase it rains! Flip flops for the showersSince you have such a large tent for just one person a fun thing to do is make a chill out area with a blanket on the floor of your tent and throw a bunch of floor pillows on there its great for chilling with friends on!! Previously I just grabbed the pillows off my outdoor patio furniture at home and it worked great! I know you already bought the cot.. but for anyone reading this later on what Ive done before is I have a beach chair that folds completely flat and I bring a inflatable pool raft that fits perfectly in the chair and turn it into my own personal cotbed that keeps me off the ground! I lay a breathable blanket down over it and some sheets and pillows and its perfect. Also I can take out the blow up raft during the day and I have a chair! Also its easy to clean the chair and blow up raft incase I get it muddy or something. A headlamp flashlight is a miracle when youre trying to pee at nightBaby wipes Washcloths bring at least one for each day to wipe down with. ,bonnaroo,dcy963r,1,t5_2rg7a

During the daytime is one thing but few things are more annoying than being woken up at am after an exhausting day by some amateur DJ blasting music in the campgrounds. Bonnaroo specifically asks you not to bring speakers into the campgrounds I dont know if they enforce it or not but I can tell you that for every person dancing around your campsite will be someone laying in their tent resenting you for disrupting their sleep.Again not trying to be a jerk but Ive dealt with many sleepless nights at various festivals including Bonnaroo because people couldnt respect the campsites around them. I know to a certain extent its part of the festival experience and you just have to deal with but its still rude. ,bonnaroo,dd56lt6,3,t5_2rg7a

If you already answered this in the original thread just shoot me a link and Ill check it out there.I mean there are two reasons why the booking philosophy would have changed so dramatically  or incompetence.  We can poke fun but I bet the major talent buyers at Live Nation arent complete idiots so I feel like there must be a goal in mind.

Thats when I decided to walk around the line stating that lines are just a social construct that we create and none of us need to stand in any lines after we make it into the festival.

11454608,0,t1_dfud77t,A few months ago I gave their sound a try and didnt like it. After the lineup came out I gave them another chance and listened to their music and some live shows and Im hooked. I hope more people have had the same experience! Itll make for a crazy show. ,bonnaroo,dfuddsm,3,t5_2rg7a

11656372,0,t1_dgh9fcb,Exactly. Dont be stupid leaving illegal substances sitting out. I honestly just drink beerliquor at bonnaroo. Occasionally I go green but maybe once or twice a weekend while Im there. But people who leave drugs sitting out on your table youre asking for it. Not hard to put it away when youre done using it,bonnaroo,dgh9ixw,3,t5_2rg7a
11668499,0,t1_dgimmp2,Yeah thats just my personal opinion. I saw him last year before he released some singles think he only had Alone and he was pretty cookie cutter. But listening to his new music and remixes he has some solid material that I think is unique but I feel like a lot of it is too simple and doesnt really sound all that great. Hes definitely worth the skip IMO considering his potential time slot but if theres no other conflicts itd still be a good time. ,bonnaroo,dgin1ri,4,t5_2rg7a
