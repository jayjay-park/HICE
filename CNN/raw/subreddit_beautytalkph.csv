8070859,0,t3_4pn20a,When I am foundation or concealer shopping I will bring with me in my handbag a product I already use that I know is my match. Ang hirap mag tantsa ng color lalo na sa paibaibang lighting sa store or counter. So iswatch mo yung match mo sa arm mo then compare to a new product you are considering.Seconding rnatchioz na punta ka sa MAC counter find your shade then note for reference. For drugstore foundations that are NC above Revlon and Loreal have darker shades. Dont worry if you got something a little too light with a bit of bronzer around the perimeter of your face pwede mag mukhang tan.Yung lipstick and blush colors depende sa undertone mo. Go for deeper colors to avoid the dreaded concealer lip. When shopping for lipstick try this trick by Wayne Goss hold the lipstick horizontally in front of your lips and look in the mirror. Here are also some suggested nude lipstick colors for brown skin,beautytalkph,d4n8ouw,1,t5_3ers2
8079781,0,t3_4ptcaq,To be honest Im a huge Daiso fan. I have some of their cute cosmetic trays and containers to organise my makeups and brushes. Highly recommend their brushsponge cleaner solution to really clean your stuff. I use Ellefar Princess Liquid Eyeliner in black rounded container for those days na hindi ako masyadong pagpapawisan kasi its not really waterproof but it doesnt smudge and very easy to take off. I also use the Princess Duo Color Cheek Blushes in peach which has a blush and highlighter. To be honest I swirl my brush and mix it up before applying it on my cheeks. Its buildable but fades throughout the day but I use setting spray anyway so it stays a bit longer. I like it because it gives me a subtle glow gives me no allergic reaction and its so cheap XDEdit I tried to bold some words but Im typing from my phone so it didnt work Edit  Also shoutout to daiso Eyebrow pencil  Idol?

10234841,0,t1_dc459vv,Introduce each product one at a time. If you use them all at once and you get a bad reaction you wont be able to pinpoint which one is causing it. It might just set you back further. A week or two in between is enough or until youre sure the product isnt breaking you out or irritating your skin. Also before starting with the BHA its important to invest in a good moisturizer first. Actives can be quite drying.rAsianBeauty is a good source if you want to learn more about AB skincare.,beautytalkph,dc46d04,1,t5_3ers2

11449101,0,t1_dfhkica,I just purchased the Cream Tint from Human Heart Nature!! I got the Petal shade. Im really happy with its nonstainywatery texture not like what you usually get with most cheek tints and because its thicker and creamy it seems to last for hours. I love the healthy flushed look it gives me. Paired with my Benefit Watts Up highlighter I feel like I look so freshhhhhh. ,beautytalkph,dftqv6g,1,t5_3ers2
11485634,0,t1_dfx19wa,Other than through sheer trial and error from the last how many years of playing with makeup I look towards undertones to see how they go well together. Theres also the fallback of going old school with using a bit of lipstick as blush. It also depends on the look Im going for. Grungier lip colors demand a cool diffused rosy hue on me while dark warm browns make me reach for sunnier hues.  Hope this helps! ,beautytalkph,dfxw88g,2,t5_3ers2

11504557,0,t1_dfxzo7m,For me thats not true. I have shitty hair texture and my hair is thick. If you have a sort of thin hair that wields on you command maybe yeah they wont need styling.

11511662,0,t1_dfy6a96,Ah yes! My GP briefed me about it I think that is the procedure. She said its more accurate that way. Im very nervous about the whole thing. Ive procrastinated going to my GP for a long time I know I know I deserve a sermon for this Amen to taking baby steps to a healthier living. Ive been following Izabelle Daza Erwann and Solenn Heussaf Anne Curtis Raymond Gutierrez and the lot on Instagram. Theyre my current inspos although my lifestyle certainly doesnt match. Doesnt hurt to aspire especially towards a good wholesome goal which is being healthy in general.  ,beautytalkph,dg0uk84,2,t5_3ers2

11765533,0,t1_dgtd8bt,Laura Mercier Oil Free Primer for me. I also like Quick FX No Shine Mattifier. My friend swears by the Essence UV primer which is on my to try list once Im done with a few other primers I have though she does tend to have drier skin than me but still curious!  Another thing Ive had my eye on but cant afford right now is the Heimish Artless Glow Base! Maybe look at that too? ,beautytalkph,dgtnj0a,2,t5_3ers2
