6376551,0,t1_czc7hub,Nice work! I also disagreed with some of the points made by the author. For instance as you mentioned in your presentation All information and knowledge is based on written language from our past. In my opinion language is not the only way to transmit knowledge. Knowledge can be obtained from seeing and imagining.,WayneStateTechComm,czeg05i,1,t5_3bgba
6663820,0,t1_d01njth,Hi Sabrina nice job on your presentation! The snowflake aesthetic was an interesting choice. A lot of circles for your female viewers. In the future it might be helpful to use spell check or have a friend proof read to avoid spelling errors. In regards to your concluding question I do think I probably responded to your presentation differently than my male peers. However when it comes to teamwork and problem solving it is a good thing. Having an array of people with different gender ages and races is undoubtedly beneficial to any group. Even in the so called male dominated S.T.E.M industries females and their unique cognitive abilities are making influential strides.  ,WayneStateTechComm,d08lh7m,1,t5_3bgba

7339784,0,t1_d28d9qi,I think that I have mostly developed collaboration by naturally going through the education system. In high school I have worked together in teams for a large portion of projects and assignments that the teachers have assigned. I think that this has helped me to be able to work and communicate more efficiently in a team setting now. I think I am able to quickly understand how everyone in the team works and how we can work together to finish the project or solve the problem.,WayneStateTechComm,d2cheth,1,t5_3bgba
