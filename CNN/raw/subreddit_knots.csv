1197207,0,t1_ci3yw3i,I havet done it with a bowline but I have done it with a truckers hitch. Wasnt exactly the same because Id figured the idea out long before ever learning or being taught any real knots.Are you actually looking for the bowline specifically to see how people did with untying it? Or just the usage? Because we used it to tie a lounge room in res shut from the inside without anyone left in it. It was hilarious,knots,ci4ayk8,2,t5_2r57p
1501716,0,t1_cj4736v,No sliding hitch of any kind mentioned. My list would be Slippery bowline  good general tie off for stake loops or bear bagging Sliding hitch  nice if you dont have cam locks Truckers hitch  for more stressed guy lines say at a windy site Alpine butterfly  for tie outs in tarp lines also can be part of truckers hitch Square knot  faster than the Albright and uses less cord to join two knots,knots,cj4ii8q,1,t5_2r57p

4752956,0,t1_ctt7km6,I second this. Good climbing carabiners make excellent pulleys for medium weight loads.

5249955,0,t3_3mve6b,Well you could double the line and only have to tie it on on side.  You could choose to join the two ends or use a timber hitch for each end both on the same tree.OrYou could still double the line up and tie each end of the line to each end of the arch probably using a bowline or any two secure loops used for tying loops on fishing lines like this Snell knot ,knots,cvit498,1,t5_2r57p

5801759,0,t1_cxfk0nv,gt The one I like for no real reason is the adjustable loop.One reason I can think of is that its better. It has much less tendency to slip in the undesired direction compared to a tautline hitch and the similar ABOK .,knots,cxg9hkf,1,t5_2r57p
6024790,0,t1_cy9bw3l,yeah i have an elastic but since the holes are drilled with a  drill bit the elastic which threads apart is too thick and difficult to get through. maybe i will need to make bigger holes to save myself the misery of tying a million double fisherman knots!!! ,knots,cy9dej6,1,t5_2r57p
6203421,0,t3_40j514,Ive used multiple daisy chain knots or chain sinnet that are finished with an overhand knot to keep it from coming undone at the end. Gives the paracord some width and you can take it apart easily if you need extra cord!,knots,cyurh8j,3,t5_2r57p

7062352,0,t3_4cccp1,Im a big fan of the constrictor knot. It can be pulled tight and will stay that way as long as its tied around a somewhat round object and either the object or the rope is at least slightly flexible. It can be very hard to remove once its pulled tight. The reason why it unties so easily in the video is because both the dyneemacore rope and the pole are very rigid and I didnt pull it as tight as I could.Basically you can use a constrictor knot almost anywhere youd normally use a ziptie but it can be pulled tighter because you have two ends to work with and it tightens continuously. If you use fine string you can use it on very small objectsThe constrictor knot is pretty easy to do in the air but sometimes you dont have the option to put the finished knot over your object so you have to tie the knot around it. This is usually quite a bit more difficult.I tried to find a quick and simple way to do that and eventually came up with this. Im sure Im not the first one to do it this way but I havent seen it anywhere else and I havent found a faster way either.,knots,d1gvmz1,4,t5_2r57p
7092343,0,t1_d1k8atg,I did overlap both sides. I think the problem is in the possibly different tensions in the red and green cord stopping the green cord  keeping the red loop loopy. This is enhanced further by cow hitch being so weak it practically opens itself.Tension on the red cord twists the knot asymmetrically. You might get a better knot if you tie a cow hitch or some similar knot on the red line that way youd get two symmetric loops that pull in different directions. It might still collapse if the green cord isnt tight enough idk.,knots,d1kaaw1,1,t5_2r57p

7420321,0,t1_d2ll53z,I looked up how to tie one and replicated it for myself but it doesnt seem exactly right. Its about as close to what I have as a noose is which is pretty damn close but not quite there. If I were to tie the heaving line knot around my closed loop I would be wraping the rope around five other segments of rope rather than three. I do appreciate the reply though.,knots,d2ln4pb,1,t5_2r57p
7431147,0,t1_d2ml90p,I doubt it would be useful for storing paracords. Because the loop cant be shortened the knot can not be quickly untied like a noose which is usually untied by pulling the loop so short that it passes through the coil of rope like a slip.,knots,d2mvhck,1,t5_2r57p

8630803,0,t3_4y2czs,Uh no. Bowlines do untie easily but if youre using the knot properly you should know how to avoid that. Bowlines are a very safe knot.All of your linked text images are testimonies from either the knot not being used properly being unloaded or not being tied properly. The knot itself is fine.,knots,d6kgfhs,6,t5_2r57p
8726592,0,t1_d6vz2g9,gtEdit actually I just realized that is bad advise in case you need to tension everything. In that case feed the line with the overhand through the loop pull everything tight and then and make two half hitchesId recommend a slippery hitch instead of the two half hitches.  Thatll make untying it much easier.  If youre concerned about security you can make an additional half hitch with the bight of the slippery hitch.  Since the first hitch will take the load that second really shouldnt draw up tight.,knots,d6wgszd,1,t5_2r57p

8877232,0,t1_d7ewgxk,I normally use an Alpine Butterfly for the starting loop although it too can be hard to untie after heavy load.
