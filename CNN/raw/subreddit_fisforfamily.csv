6013012,0,t3_3xfdqo,I wish the first season was longer because it was the fifth episode where I felt like the show became genuinely hilarious. The first four episodes were decentgood but the fifth? Oh I was almost in tears.,fisforfamily,cy7u1mb,1,t5_3467o
6021096,0,t3_3xyiqr,This idea has good potential but I think it would take away from the theme of early s idea of a nuclear family. Which consisted of blue collar versus white collar unions and raising families on a meager salary. Placing Frank in a radio station would withdraw that appeal in my opinion which really is a heavy source of the comedy. I see Frank possibly getting his pilot license as was hinted in the show a really great idea would be to bring another vet into the fold as a main character to help Frank get his license. A slightly shell shocked veteran pilot could really fit into the dynamic of what is turning out to be a good show.   ,fisforfamily,cy8w146,10,t5_3467o
