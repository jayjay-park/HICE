3203852,0,t3_2wqaw1,The essay seems sorta material i guess. Is this for a writing class or science? Because if this is for a writing  class you should make the essay more personal so the reader can feel more attached to the paper. You want to lure your audience in to the point where theyll protest those who are antivaccination by holding signs in DC. Or at the very least make an angry tweet about it. You really want an essay like this to be very argumentative. For instance as you know a huge argument from the anti vacc community is that vaccines supposedly cause autism. Well you could argue how the notion of how autism is necessarily worse than the diseases vaccines are meant to prevent is incredibly disrespectful to anyone high functioning living on the autistc spectrum. or something like thatjust scratching the surface here. And if you can try to make sure your deepest most though provoking provacc comment is in your conclusion. It van make for a great synthesis!Good luck ,ratemyessay,cou2uc4,1,t5_2zfuw
