Youre talking about employment so Ill say that out of the hundreds of hiring decisions Ive ever been a part of for UX positions exactly zero of these every came down to this school is better than that school.  School reps being almost a nonfactor and your own reputation  if any  your delivery in the interview the strength of your portfolio and how good a fit you are with a places culture usually being the deciding factors. ,hci,crhpe02,1,t5_2qo19

5535319,0,t3_3pysev,Im doing something very wrong but I graduated around  years ago with a degree in HCI. I am struggling to find work and keep working. Im in the NYC area where there should a healthy amount of work but I cant seem to get out of my rut. My total years of professional experience is pretty much  year divided between UX design and research.,hci,cwj6p8g,1,t5_2qo19
10772553,0,t3_5p1onc,As a DePaul HCI online grad I can tell you that the fact it was completed online was not frowned upon as much as youd think.  I was nervous about that as well but when I talked about it in interviews I mentioned it gave me the ability to attend a well known school while still working full time.  When I attended there were often times that you could log on in real time to attend the class virtually and ask questions through chat or voice.  I am not sure what your working situation is like so that might not help you but I was able to use some of the work I had produced during the program to discuss my design techniques and process.  I was also able to mention that Ive gotten really good at working remotely with a group in the event the company you are hoping to work with has any offsite teams.,hci,ddr3ze2,1,t5_2qo19
11008311,0,t1_defqymw,Ive been deaf for most of my life  years which gives me that unique perspective. Also in terms of work experience I used to manage a website that catalogued available assistive tech devices and technologies for the deaf. Ive also got  years of experience as an UIUX designerresearcher and software development.What sort of study are you working on?,hci,defreyn,3,t5_2qo19
