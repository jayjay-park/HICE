454122,0,t1_cfrka0o,Its deeper than Burton not approving of her.  I think that Burton has an interest in her.  Ill just use that word for now because Im not sure he even has the wiring for love or romanceRemember the look he gave her when she first moved in and she was in the pool with a tiny bikini on SE and the way he sniffed the bed before he started the cleanup in the motel room SE.,Banshee,cfrvs1i,6,t5_2w042
454952,0,t3_1za8io,They had to make sure they had one element of the show that would seem implausible  because if not it would just come off as your run of the mill documentary. ,Banshee,cfrz66u,26,t5_2w042

3343831,0,t1_cp9ambq,I actually like shows that do between  episodes. It has become a chore with some shows still doing  episodes. So many of them end up being filler. When they do less episodes there is less of a chance for that to happen. ,Banshee,cp9f6p2,1,t5_2w042

3407277,0,t1_cpggurh,The fighting feels reaslistic compared to nearly all other action scenes from movies and shows. Very satisfying with interesting moves and attacks. Burton fight is easily the best. The army base colonel was a bit tough like a real life boss fight.  shotgun blasts to the chest  no problem m. Hes a fuckn terminator that guy.,Banshee,cpgnkzb,3,t5_2w042
3420058,0,t1_cpg6vom,Thanks forgotten about that.  He was at her funeral then picked up Deva.  Other than that he disappeared.Ill be disappointed if he was solely there for the cops vs indians plot line and disappears.  ,Banshee,cpi40st,1,t5_2w042
3535041,0,t1_cpu7ik6,Usually  months would cover  episodes. I wonder if they do a lot of rehearsals and such maybe that is why. But  months to do  episodes would be a lifetime I would think.,Banshee,cpv7v0h,3,t5_2w042

7199685,0,t3_4dz3ca,I really think BurtonProctor killing Rebecca is a red herring. I think we are suppose to look one way and the killer is the other way. I am still not convinced it isnt a woman behind some of it. ,Banshee,d1wjo9k,2,t5_2w042

7668195,0,t1_d3dsd5u,I could see him doing a show again at some point. But  years is a long time to do a show.  months he was away from his family. But he has been an actor a long time he is guesting on The Blacklist right now. But he is mostly a movie guy. ,Banshee,d3dtw4o,2,t5_2w042
