250643,0,t3_1wrskm,Im thinking about starting an independent post about this but I figured I should respond to you since its related.  A lot of this reddit seems to be focused on presenting the dominant or in control side of our gender.  For some of us genderfluid people we dont have the need to present to match our gender.  Instead we express our gender through behavior and changes in our thought processes.  For me my sexuality the peoplegenders Im attracted to also seems to be linked to which sides on top.  Im not saying either way is wrong the need to present a given gender vs behavioral changes and if you find yourself on the need to present feminine side of the spectrum my post isnt going to be much help.I also want to say that I was US Army many years ago during DADT and even with the recent policy changes I dont envy you...hope you stay well and hope that my post is able to help you.,genderfluid,cf6qf51,2,t5_2u0nr

2910607,0,t3_2s3vql,I use a number of different labels to describe myself. DFAB genderfluid transgender nonbinary gender nonconforming and sometimes even just queer although that is really for when Im describing both my gender and sexuality simultaneously. None of those labels are wrong and how you identify doesnt really depend on ifhow you feel dysphoria. I was hesitant to use the term transgender to identify myself for quite awhile because I didnt feel trans enough Based on what little body dysphoria I have and my lack of physical transition. As long as you are respectful and know that these words can and do mean different things for different people then just go with whatever you feel comfortable with. ,genderfluid,cnyxz5t,1,t5_2u0nr
2920238,0,t1_cnyx77n,I have a question for you when those days that you cant wear what you want you say that you wear mens boxers? Assuming that you have female genitals Which kind of boxers do you prefer? I know its about preference but knowing that women have kinds of discharge do you wear female panties and boxers or just a certain type of boxers? Sorry if this is too personal.,genderfluid,co01g8r,1,t5_2u0nr

3865157,0,t1_cqwu22h,Same thing happens to me.  When I was married I was very much the man in the relationship but with my last partner I let my femme flag fly. Gender chameleon.,genderfluid,cqwv1m7,3,t5_2u0nr
3865647,0,t1_cqwvwm7,Id say give her some time. Shes watched you grow up. Known you since you were born. Shes had this predetermined expectation of how you will turn out based on how you grew up.The genderfluid thing is completely out of left field from the past ltyour agegt years. Youre doing things shes completely unprepared to think about right now regarding things shes never even heard of. And it means youve kept this secret from her... thats gonna hurt her for now. Maybe if it comes up explain why you feared telling anyone before. Ridicule or confusion or whatever.  For myself it moreso comes down to everyone I know has seen me as a guy my entire life. How could I go and shatter everyones view of me? And then I realized I act basically the same anyway. I can just wear what I actually want to now.You will have to take the first steps. She likely just wants everything to go back to normal and is probably hoping this is a joke of some sort. Shes gotta see youre being completely open honest and want this. Once she sees youre taking these first steps on your own she will begin to accept it and help hopefully.But yeah shes only had one day to think about this her emotions are gonna be all over the place for a while.One step at a time my friend.,genderfluid,cqwx1yb,3,t5_2u0nr
3867554,0,t3_34p23l,Sometimes the first part. Im prone to overall empathic mimicry anyway. Ive never really experienced the second half though. If I find myself leaning way to the opposite of a person its usually because they are demonstrating a gender extreme and I tend to go the opposite way right off the bat.,genderfluid,cqx4v53,2,t5_2u0nr
3971974,0,t3_35uffa,I am afab present like a kinda butch lesbian and am one of those pushover people who doesnt want to make anyone uncomfortable. So I say to call me whatever you want. I get some theys some hes mostly shes. All OK with me. ,genderfluid,cr91dxd,3,t5_2u0nr
4428082,0,t1_csolhu1,Thats also what I did. It seems to do the trick. People get used to seeing your username and thats better than reintroducing yourself ya know? Plus the people that truly matter wont have a problem with it even when they are corrected. ,genderfluid,csoumeg,2,t5_2u0nr

4517569,0,t3_33jgin,Im new here. I just noticed this is  months old. I love that cut and color!  I was born female but Ive never felt right in a  female role. Ive always hated my hair long but most of my life I listened to others pressuring me to keep it. I usually had it in a bun or pony. It was not a good look on me. A few days ago I said fuck it and went from super long thick hair to a super short asymmetrical pixie cut. I feel great! I immediately felt like myself. I say dont listen to anyone   just do what makes you happy with your style.,genderfluid,ct030ab,1,t5_2u0nr
4971097,0,t3_3iz7mu,Im sure youve heard about how when someone is transgender their mental gender is the opposite of their physical sex i.e. born with XY chromosomes and male parts but is actually a girl and transitions to look like a girl.  Genderfluid is similar in that their mental gender doesnt always match but the mental gender can change sometimes male sometimes female sometimes inbetween.  Your friend will probably dress differently to present as male sometimes but they might not even when they are identifying as male.  You should ask which pronouns to use some genderfluid people want their pronouns to change based on how they are presenting he when dressed as a guy she when dressed as a girl some use a gender neutral pronoun like singular they and some just use the same pronouns they used before coming out.,genderfluid,cul56r4,1,t5_2u0nr

8505316,0,t3_4w11z2,Well Im Genderfluid and whenever I want to be really female its not too hard cuz Im AFAB I just slap on some Berts Bees lip gloss! Berts Bees is a good organic brand that can be found at any Whole Foods or CVS. Its good because it doesnt look super obvious unless you get the bright bright cherry red my personal favorite but the other colors are more subdued. The perfect way to be subtle but still girly!,genderfluid,d64pwc9,1,t5_2u0nr
