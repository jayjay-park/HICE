316694,0,t3_1uncp5, Ive always been interesting in the psychology of cats. Ive wondered what they think of us what they hear when we speak what they think our speech is and most important of all do they know they are cats?I hate when people respond to serious cat questions with clichs and one liners. oooh they are evil master minds they think they own us!  Or the ever present  they bring home food because they think we are bad hunters!,catfanciers,cfdlewk,1,t5_2u4e1
