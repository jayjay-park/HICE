If I got invited to a bachelor party that entailed me celebrating with someone I havent spoke with in months or years arranging lodging and transit and wrecking my sleepwork schedule I would definitely want to pass.  Couple that with everyone figuring that other people will fill the void and that is a recipe for  fades.  I doubt they hate you but they could be rather indifferent or have legitimate competing interests.  Instead of inviting out  people good luck connecting with that many people in one night anyways just grab your closest few friends and have better time than you would have by trying to do something extravaganttraditional.  At the very least it sounds like you have  solid friend the one attempting to arrange it.  Even if just the two of you go out that sounds like a good time to me.  Hell even a sibling or parent could be a great time.  Stop hating yourself.  Purge your fake friendships and strengthen your real ones or grow new ones.  Stop focusing on whats going wrong and appreciate what you do have going for you!  Youre getting married you have at least one friend.  Get a cat and call it a day sounds like a solid life to me.  I hope this doesnt come off as me dismissing your problems I dont mean to do that and focusing on the bad in our lives happens to all of us on occasion.  But what always helps me is focusing on what is good!  Look around youll find it.,SelfHate,d2a004w,1,t5_2wihz
10522377,0,t1_dcpjtyl,Ah but heres the problem. Im perpetually plagued with a single question what do I have to show for  years of my life? And I cant think of a single response. And then I think... if you havent been able to accomplish anything in  years what makes you think you can do it now?Well the problem basically boils down to me changing. Ive tried finding part time jobs work from home because reasons and Ive had very little luck with it. My resume score on the website is below average and things like that.Ive since tried to change my habits made a timetable for study and stuff but I havent been able to stick to it. Im just absolutely deplorable and I hate myself more everyday because of it. I havent changed one whit. I cant focus.. sigh I dont even know why Im asking people for help over and over and over again. It seems like something no one can help me with. No one can make me focus. I just have to do it shrugslol Im sorry for the ranting. Im just getting tired of this.,SelfHate,dd0tpoa,1,t5_2wihz
