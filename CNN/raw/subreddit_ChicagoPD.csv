I like seeing the beat cops its a nice break from the heaviness of VoightIntelligence. Im also hoping to see her and Ruzek together again and if she moved to Intelligence I dont think it would go well. I agree about Jay and Mouse. Id love more Atwater!! We got a little taste of his life outside Intelligence earlier on but nothing since then. Id also love more scenes with him and Burgess maybe even them becoming partners again for an episode until her new partner is introduced. ,ChicagoPD,d3xw3gi,6,t5_2x7l8
