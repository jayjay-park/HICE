7660835,0,t1_d3cvova,Ours was set for June too. I couldnt wait that long!I got a private ultrasound place to do it. They start them at  weeks. Only ! ,NovemberBumps2016,d3czrxs,2,t5_3eli0
7757459,0,t3_4ljb9h,YES! I havent started worrying about what ones to register for but holy cow it already looks overwhelming. I live in the Boston area and theres a woman that owns a cloth diaper shop  and she actually hosts short lessonsinfo sessions about cloth diapers and you can try them all out. You might find something similar where you live. EDIT I actually just googled the website and she offers a lot of information on there as well that might be helpful! Also theres a ton of websites just simply talking about the differences between the major types. I would start there instead of delving into the actual brands. Then you can sort of narrow it down by what kind of cloth diaper you want  all in one prefolded pocket diapers etc. Also I have found YouTube to be a great resource for this as well  so many Moms have posted informational videos about the process how to do it with each diaper so you can actually see whats easiest. Ive heard from a few friends that the best brands are G BumGenius and Simplex which are pretty expensive. I also have seen that most people suggest buying one of  types of brands after doing some research and just seeing how they feel. Baby Gear Lab has a good sort of visual about what the different types are and the pros and cons of each  but the more research I do the more I find that each person has such a different expectation and a different set of needs budgetary constraints etc.  ,NovemberBumps2016,d3nyptf,1,t5_3eli0

8509704,0,t3_4w4oju,I dont know because I havent found a stupid house to live in yet. I would love to stay in my house but we need to move. I have to leave my beautiful house with perfect space for the baby and move to some house I wont love as much ,NovemberBumps2016,d659oha,1,t5_3eli0
8536078,0,t3_4wo44o,I think anchoring the furniture now isnt a terrible idea. Im definitely the kind of person who will say oh Ill do that later when I need it and then forget so its just easier for me to do it now as we assemble the nursery. I dont plan on covering outlets or anything until shes more mobile. Those are way easier to do than drilling holes in the wall though ,NovemberBumps2016,d68kr69,4,t5_3eli0
8584101,0,t3_4x9z6f,I am currently in the waiting room finishing my three hour test. If I fail does that mean no sugar or just limit? I didnt think I ate that much sugar in the first place but I failed my  hour at . ,NovemberBumps2016,d6elkqy,1,t5_3eli0
8589019,0,t1_d6f1a7t,It sounds like you guys have a good plan! Were pretty set on  and sure it would be nice to have one of each but Id be perfectly content with  girls. We arent setting up a nursery per se...our house wont be done being built until the spring so my parents I think I mentioned our land is next door to their house? generously offered to let us set up camp in their finished basement while its being built to save some . Its basically like a studio apartment so instead of a dedicated room for a nursery itll be more like a nursery area lol. By the way I never in a million years that at  years old have my MBA owned a house and have a family of my own that Id be moving back in with my parents LOL. We have the changing table and my rocker recliner set up already but thats about it. Were going to wait on a crib until were in our house and have more space so a bassinet will work for now. Were in the process of moving right nowloading up the moving truck tomorrow actually since we sold our current house a couple months ago. Talk about stressful! My poor hubby has been a champ since Im basically worthless and cant lift much haha. Are you having a baby shower??,NovemberBumps2016,d6f7sxt,1,t5_3eli0
8748426,0,t1_d6z61qv,I want to keep her and honestly have the means to for the most part. I work a nice well paying job the issue is that I work all the time. Once I made my decision final my inlaws have been relentless about attempting to coerce me into giving her to them to adopt so she can be raised in their church.,NovemberBumps2016,d6z7i2p,3,t5_3eli0

8877974,0,t1_d7e5gs5,Thats exactly what I keep thinking. I dont want him do be dumbfounded when the doc talks to him about stuff. I also dont want him constantly looking to me for a translation or anything. ,NovemberBumps2016,d7f0a2k,1,t5_3eli0
8914402,0,t1_d7jd8s5,Kudos to you. I have a desk job but Im finding it getting tougher already at almost  weeks. Having to sit at a desk for  hours while little one is kicking hard at my right ribs and giving me hell if I accidentally place my bump against the desk its no picnic. So massive respect momma! ,NovemberBumps2016,d7jdpfr,1,t5_3eli0
8914903,0,t3_52davr,I am so not even remotely close to being readyprepared. Like at all.As much as pregnancy has been miserable for me with all the not sleeping and heartburn and such Man being  months prengant sucks being  months pregnant is gonna be worst I just am not ready to have him on the outside yet. lol,NovemberBumps2016,d7jfvja,1,t5_3eli0
9069612,0,t3_54h8hv,I have a uterus malformation that apparently makes me prone to more BH. I started getting them at  weeks usually just a few a day. Mine range from feeling like my entire belly is balling up with pressure to feeling kinda like period cramps that wrap around from my back to my belly. I have quite a few days where I get them up to a minute long and  minutes apart but they usually stop after  hours or become irregular and longer between. I have ended up at LampD once because they lasted almost  hours at under  minutes apart and I wanted to be sure I wasnt dilating. Taking tylenol usually helps a lot when they get uncomfortable but it doesnt usually stop them for me.,NovemberBumps2016,d820qyd,1,t5_3eli0
9132234,0,t1_d89kozg,My little man has been in position and dropped for like  weeks now and hes pushing his little head against my cervix all the time. I have a little over  weeks technically but...I can totally see him line jumping by a week or so for sure. Im miserable. The waddle is real. And my hips and pelvic bone wanna detach from my body. Bahaha.,NovemberBumps2016,d89krbs,5,t5_3eli0
9272949,0,t3_57cy47,Im  weeks and my baby girl is still breech. I have a possibility of having a csection if she continues to be stubborn. Can you walk me through it? How long til you could hold the babies? Would anything be different if my baby girl doesnt need the nicu? ,NovemberBumps2016,d8revi4,1,t5_3eli0
9278450,0,t1_d8s3wtx,Ha ha sorry! I know its nice that is early I would have liked at least two more weeks to incubate this beastie. ,NovemberBumps2016,d8s3zgd,1,t5_3eli0
9313749,0,t3_580onv, here and I cant even tell if hes dropped or not. It felt like it for a day or two but now its like hes in my ribs again but my pelvis is still killing me. Im just going to assume this kid is tall like his dad and I just dont have enough torso length for him. I have an appointment in the morning. Ill ask what my midwife thinks and let you know. ,NovemberBumps2016,d8wl4gr,2,t5_3eli0
9363403,0,t3_58serm,I think at this point last time I was so fed up of being pregnant I lost all the fear and just wanted it done.I didnt find it too bad with gas and air but what helps to know is theres always the epidural. Youve got this!,NovemberBumps2016,d92vmt3,3,t5_3eli0
9416786,0,t1_d99loem,Mine would probably say the same thing. My goal is try to find the middle ground between that and being a paranoid FTM.,NovemberBumps2016,d99n5tr,1,t5_3eli0
9443251,0,t3_59bllj,Im cm  effaced and am wanting to read into it sooo badly . Im definitely in that read every story I can and find out how long it took them to go into labor phase now.,NovemberBumps2016,d9czz9k,1,t5_3eli0
9671356,0,t3_5dk72g,Grrrr yes. My due date was Sunday. I had two membrane sweeps  one on Saturday and one yesterday. I am  cm dilated and  effaced since Saturday  had made no progress as of yesterday. I definitely feel like things are happening but nothing really productive or measurable yet. My OB was supposed to make an appointment for me to be induced on Monday but he didnt call me today so I have no idea if Im actually scheduled or not and Im going nuts. I really REALLY dont want to spend Thanksgiving in the hospital!,NovemberBumps2016,da57477,1,t5_3eli0
