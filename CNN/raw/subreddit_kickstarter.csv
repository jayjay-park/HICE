356130,0,t1_cffkb8d,Get ready for the woo SirJefferE . We are of course referencing the controversial works of Jacques Benveniste and Masaru Emoto. Ill explain further that were from Northern California so it is fair to say that were more apt to considering controversial new ideas without the quantifiable scientific evidence that others might require.We accept that Newtonian thinking is still the norm and that makes sense when we can see those laws being practically applied before your very own eyes every day. However the ideas and hypotheses being purported in Quantum Mechanics have opened the door to there being perhaps more at work than we might understand and we happen to find that interesting. We respect your position of course and acknowledge that not everyone shares our enthusiasm for these new theories and concepts. ,kickstarter,cfhogt2,0,t5_2rquu
356593,0,t1_cffp3ru,DominusDraco. Were sorry you feel that way. Weve addressed the shipping issue in our comments above so rather revisiting that again let us assure you that we are doing everything we can to minimize our footprint. We are using an infrastructure that exists and yes absolutely what we are doing will require energy to be expended. In time we hope to minimize distances travelled by having local sources and local facilities in various places. For now though we have to start somewhere. Our bottle is not an alternative to Kleen Kanteen or Sigg or refillables. That is by far the best choice you can make for the planet. Problem is that message is not landing for the majority of people in the US and sales are exploding so we decided to create an answer to the specific problem that single use plastic bottles create. The diehard green folks keep hammering us for bringing out another bottled water but they need to understand that we are not trying to sell to them. Our goal is to provide a greener alternative to Dasani Arrowhead etc. You will never change peoples behavior by making them feel bad or guilty. Go try that in a Texas Sams Club and see how many people you convert. Look you are right about tap water. When it isnt inflammable thanks to fracking or contaminated that is definitely the most responsible approach.We are so happy to see the passionate responses here on Reddit. This is why we are doing this. To provoke conversation and get people thinking about the impact their choices have. It is guys like you who will advance these conversations.We are targeting a specific customer of a specific market. They are not going to stop buying water bottles overnight so we better give them an alternative that is committed to stopping this damage continuing.,kickstarter,cfhq6up,0,t5_2rquu

603772,0,t1_cg8spt1,Lets tackle these in order Apollo missons The basic idea of traveling to the moon was conceived at least as far back as the nd century appearing in True Story by Lucian. Most likely the general idea stretches back well before then and by the midth century people were beginning to draw up semiserious plans on how to attempt it. Flying Birds have been doing it forever and so no one really ever considered it absurd. The only doubts were whether it could be made practical reliable and safe. Electricity Again weve known about it for a long long time from electrical fish. While there was an academic distinction made between static and dynamic electricity until Ben Franklins research in the th century it was hardly a new phenomenon. Wireless communication Again weve known how to do it for years and years and years going back to ancient times with light. Encoding signals into electromagnetic waves was predicted in the s. This suspicion was announced by a wellregarded if obscure mathematician at the time called James Clerk Maxwell. Instant communication We knew this was possible with light and long arrangements of mirrors. Speed of light measurements have been attempted for centuries with light sources great distances away and various timing mechanisms. Fast longdistance communication was never regarded as impossible just impractical. Gravitational waves come out of Einsteinian general relativity. When he published his famous paper in  he was the preeminent physicist in the world not some nobody that had no prior work to back up his claims. He was also building on relatively known mathematics even if those mathematics werent entirely understood for several decades.  BBT The formulation typically pointed to as the genesis for modern BBT is due to Lematre. At the time Lematre was a professor of physics at a very prominent university in Belgium. He was notable and persuasive enough to draw the attention of Einstein who soundly rejected his work for various reasons. Medicine has been practiced by pretty much every civilization ever discovered. There may have been some early humans who called the idea stupid but they certainly havent been alive in the past few millennia. When germ theory was postulated we could literally see the germs under a microscope. There is no equivalent standard of evidence for this kickstarter. Various evolutiontype theories had been proposed well before Darwin and the basic mechanics of natural selection had been used by animal breeders for centuries. The most radical part of evolution was that it applied to humans as well as animals which brought it into conflict with a lot of prior religious teachings and common sense at the time. While at the time Darwin published his famous book he did not have much of a reputation he presented it in conjunction with a wellknown colleague and had an incredible amount of supporting evidence from their travels.None of your examples support the idea of an unknown lone inventor producing a sudden significant revolution in their garage. They have all been either ideastechnologies that included a years of supporting evidence building to that conclusion or are concepts humans have been comfortable with for centuries. Why is this guy whose company screams scam supposedly an exception? He has no mechanism no known technology no background in this field hes introducing it on kickstarter instead of making hundreds of millions licensing it out to a biotech firm and the company itself has no infrastructure to produce the goods theyre selling.,kickstarter,cg8whxn,5,t5_2rquu

If you come up with a nice mechanic  wouldnt it be cool if...  then turning it into a card game is not that difficult.Also if you want to make a living designing video games then you should be able to make a good board game. Or more specifically you have no business designing video games at all if you cant make a good board game.As such a lot of people who would be making PC games can make board games. You can work out every single detail of the game and polish it to perfection without needing more than  of index cards and a friend. There is no risk involved its not possible for a board game to fail in RampD.The only costs are printing and shipping which are both very easily calculable ahead of time.Its a simple and easy type of campaign to Kickstart. It produces a nice measurable highquality results with no real risks beyond might not get funded.And of course most of these boardcard games are actually quite good.

3387304,0,t3_2yzi4h,Sumzine is a slowfashion magazine based out of New York City. Initially started as a onewoman show the community quickly outgrew the capacity for one person. Thats why we need your help! After a decade of working in the fashion industry Sumzine founder Jamie Ortega knew that she wanted to see a change. The industry employs over  million people and affects billions. Whether it is the  billion tons of soot released into the air or the  lives lost at the Rana Plaza garment factory collapsethe casualties of the fashion industry are clear.  When Sumzine was founded a year ago it was a cutandpaste zine about slowfashion. Jamie had initially planned to design it in PowerPoint and print it at Kinkos. Yep! But before she was able to pull out her booklet stapler a designer friend stepped in and polished it up. This changed the tone and Sumzine was born. With a bit of press from Vice Magazine Alldayeveryday Styleite and Opening Ceremony it grew even more. When  people celebrated the release of issue  during NYFW it was obvious that this was a hitting a note bigger than anticipated.Were now building a masthead to support this global community. So far we are carried internationally in New York Los Angeles Berlin Stockholm and Toronto with our early adopters being Opening Ceremony and the LACMA Shop.Who are we?Sumzine is the authority on slowfashion and were building an international community to change the industry. This dialogue has existed before but we are filling a space that is greatly needed. Our contributors come from all corners of the industry. Theyve been published by Alldayeveryday T Magazine Oyster Bullett et cetera and come to Sumzine to share their diverse voices on this unifying subject.Slowfashion can mean a lot of things but at its core its about making better choices. Whether its the material used or ethical practices its about creating less waste. In the words of Dame Vivienne Westwood Buy less buy better and make it last! Issue  collaborators include Andre Herrero Emma Anderson Franey Miller Hayley Morgan Jayne Lies Katie Miller Luke Abby Natalee RaniiDropcho Patric Dicaprio Sam Bates Brady Gunnell Madison Stephens Tiffany Jen Raquel MedinaCleghorn and more.Why do we need your help?So far Sumzine has been completely selffunded. We are creative collective of working professionals who all donate our own time and resources to this project. Everything has a price tag though. Shoots are costly when considering studio fees rentals crew meals and wardrobe. Printing is the biggest cost of all especially when you tack on international distribution.  We know that we need to grow so we can expand our message. This includes moving into the digital sphere and creating a web platform with blog features a lecture series teach workshops and even producing a Sumzine Fashion Week.

3680396,0,t3_32jifi,I was doing some late night Kickstarter browsing and stumbled upon a really cheap band. I have Microsoft Band which I paid  for  and the thought of getting something similar for only  intrigued me... and then I began reading the comments.In the comments one person brings up how a guy with a degree in accounting got so far building such a piece of technology. Another commenter links to this page which shows an identical product on sale for . I did some digging and found the same product on Alibaba for even less especially when ordered in bulk. If you check the comments page for the project you can see that the guy is a huge bullshit artists  here are a few highlights from his replies thus fargtVidonn is our team in China. We combine the Chinese manufacturings advantage and our designamp service teams advantage here in U.S. in order to bring you the most at least cost. We incorporate two different companies in both U.S. and China due to many complex concerns from local policies to marketing strategies. In addition to what I replied to ivir earlier here is more detailed information we launched two different versions of our product in two markets due to the differences in wearable market and policies one in China mainland the other for the rest of the world. The main issue for the two versions is the quality and the customer service behind the product. We believe that our product is more suitable in the more developed market with all the top quality materials continuously updated firmware and customer services we could provide. I believe that you would agree that the product itself would worth much less without all these.gtSo they have a team in China who built the EXACT same product  but they feel they can build it better even though their company didnt even have a website until February th  Seems totally legit. TLDR  A Kickstarter that has  backers  and has raised more than its  goal with  days left is simply reselling Chinese products from Alibaba.

3822054,0,t3_343ot8,They claim to be more capable than TOR yet  No discussion of statistical traffic analysis to deanonymize traffic  Make ambiguous statements implying encryption provides anonymity How do they avoid their version of exit nodes being able to read unencrypted traffic to third parties e.g. reddit pre presenting bad certificates to attempt to MITM HTTPS traffic?  The great thing about Sever is the person youre establishing communications with doesnt need one. This definitely implies they have all the same issues that TOR has w.r.t. exit nodes having full access to any unencrypted traffic.  Dont even describe their encryption algorithms  DNS Security? DNSSEC? Something else? Why no discussion of this at all especially considering DNSSEC has some pretty noteworthy criticisms?  Unique PeertoPeer Network is it? How is it meaningfully different than TOR? The network isnt described.  Secures your network orly? Does it provide a stateful firewall? Intrusion detection? Can it determine if theres a malicious device or traffic in your network? How?  Increase network speeds up to X lolno. If you pay your cable company for mbps you arent going to get mbps by plugging this in.  Protects against cryptolockers malware and bots How?  What wireless security options does it provide? No discussion of supported modes at all.  and so on...They are ignorant andor liars and I would not trust them at all after looking this over.Edit Found their page about this on their website They dont actually provide any more meaningful information there but it does seem to confirm the TB thing is at least not onboard storage as the listed capacity of the device is MB of flash.Im also amused at their claim that this prevents MITM attacks. That could only be true if their undescribed PP network isnt susceptable to them and they prevent MITM attacks after your traffic leaves one of their exit nodes which they dont document how they might do hint they cant. It definitely seems like they repeatedly conflate any of their features that will only affect a subset of your traffic as protecting all of it in all circumstances. Its remarkably dishonest to do this.If they want people to trust them they need to provide real threat models with meaningful descriptions of protocols and encryption and how their design addresses those threat models including the threat models they dont protect against.,kickstarter,cqry2nt,5,t5_2rquu

4737767,0,t1_ctrpcbl,Your words ring with the sound of cynical realism. Thats a pity  the implications of the cynical realism that is not the words. Youre right about the world being a cruel place for truly advanced inventors. If memetic networks were easy they would been implemented many years ago. If you go back far enough the Xanadu project comes to mind. It was also ambitious but its inherent flaws and misguided ambitions doomed it to perpetual obscurity. I once thought that the Groove project had promise but it turned out to be a much more limited effort hiding behind a yet another wall of hype. Ive been watching for many years and nothing like what I have in mind has ever emerged from the mist.Im not terribly fond of being met first by a post from the very rude person who thought it funny to attack me personally but Ive had much exposure to the flaming battlefields of FidoNet and the Usenet newsgroups that came later. This guys a piker at insults. Many comments thus far here contain just the sort of insights Id been seeking on a possible reception at Kickstarter. Sure the insights are unpleasantly pessimistic but its better to be warned with a sharp nip earlier than to be later chomped up in a single gulp by the shaggy beast of reality.Patreon sounds like an interesting website as well!,kickstarter,ctrqmad,0,t5_2rquu

5002970,0,t3_3jg0kh,ruggar Great point. We actually really wanted the Hue to work for us... and heck it wouldve saved us a lot of trouble! But heres what inspired us... A Philips Hue costs  to get started incl. hub vs . You have to set up a wifi connection and the multicolor bulb can only do lumens not enough for supplemental light therapy. Also since you need wifi if you travel you cant really take it with you  youd have to bring the hub set up the network at the hotel etc... with The Up Light just unscrew the bulb toss in into your suitcase and youre all set. once you get to the hotel switch out the bulb in your hotel lamp change into your PJs and get to bed. While we absolutely appreciate the Hue we really wanted to make this availableaccessible for the general public and make the experience flawless by focusing on the features people will use everyday. Its gotta be something I dont have to go home and show my mother how to set up you know what I mean? And thats why we came up with the Up Light. ,kickstarter,cup1nhy,1,t5_2rquu

We just gave a lengthy interview to Dazed and Confused Magazine where we explain the tech in more detail which we thought would go too far on the kickstarter page. The company we are working with is from Switzerland. That means they are uberexact and they would never hand out a fabric that doesnt match their strict quality criteria.

It also has a unique workers placement system that profoundly impact the tactic of the game in a very intersting way.

I think you should definitely show more of it but not mostall of it because you do want them to buy it to find out everything. Pick a few pages that really stand out to you as your best and show them. She does it for a lot of her illustrations in her video.You do have a shot of your pages on the table but the angle of the camera and the shallow depth of field sort of obscure them. I would reshoot that with the camera a wee bit angled down to see more of the pages and a slightly deeper depth of field so I can make out more even if I cant read them.gt Ive actually taught in the preschool setting in my past so Im definitely in tune with children  have experience reading to them. I can definitely get some footage of kids reading the book in there.Yes this is exactly the kind of thing you should focus on in the video. Your most likely target is an adult wanting to buy something for a kid of course and knowing you have a history of working with children and a genuine passion for creating things for them will be what sells your product. ,kickstarter,d6kirys,1,t5_2rquu

There is free shipping to USA Canada and EU involved in the first tier and let me tell you shipping for kg is not cheap.Also your  estimate is quite low. We wanted to design a good looking and functional product. That takes time and money. For example wooden handles are hand finished and laser engraved. The bottom end it hand welded and even the box it comes in is made out of wood not cheap cardboard.Sure that drives the price up which sucks for us and our customers. But we like to think we made a well designed great looking product that will last a long time and do a lot of things in your kitchen not just make kickass pizza.

10762850,0,t3_5tvhf4,Neat project nice budget break down nice image examples neat rewards. One issue I have is some of those massive images of text would be way better served as actual text. Itd be countless time easier to read. I think thats a really poor design choice as is. I just love the old Back Page ads style on the rewards image. Got a real kick out of that. I really love the idea of the project. Its a nice overall pitch though I would nix those walls of text images ASAP!Hope this does well and goes to print! May end up picking one up myself.,kickstarter,ddq3wt8,3,t5_2rquu

10829684,0,t1_ddwz1m6,So youre saying big companies that are perfectly capable of funding and running their project independently yet flood Kickstarter as free marketing is a good thing? I dont get this logic. The whole point of crowdfunding is a group of random people that are interested in an indie project chipping in to see it becomes a reality. Crowdfunding was never about taking the risk of a new project away for big companies it was also meant for startups and small companies and by Kickstarter not regulating it it completely devalues the purpose of Kickstarter. ,kickstarter,ddx07m1,5,t5_2rquu
10845975,0,t1_ddynzia,Of course we cant force the politicians to read their email but we do have recorded instances where congressman have referenced the number of emails they get about a particular issue to support their concern about a subject. It makes sense for politicians to use emails to get an idea for what their voters want. And thats a pro of this project Even if you believe your email is just going to be a  to a statistic quickly skimmed by a staff member or summarization software youll be more happy with this model because thousands of others are working with you to send that message across the nation. Even if all a congressman knows is  people emailed this month about X issue thats an accomplishment and I think many people will want to believe in that. I think many people also will opt to send the message as a letter for  and thats an option that may give a higher degree of confidence that the message wont be ignored.,kickstarter,ddyoplb,1,t5_2rquu
10889706,0,t3_5vmcmd,I am sorry this happened to you. Ive had similar things happen to me with Kickstarter and it can be disheartening. Remember that as a Kickstarter backer youre more of an investor than a customer. The money you pledge is money that youre willing to risk losing if things go poorly. If youre going to back kickstarters you need to prepare yourself to make critical judgements about the people making the pitch. ,kickstarter,de3720j,2,t5_2rquu

11244357,0,t3_60hhiy,Ya... I dont know dude... A few items that fly outYes may be possible technically but dev on a product of that nature is going to take a TON of coin so unless these guys have some heavy hitters behind them I would be cautious.Latency would be a concern here for me at least that being said so long as your not talking action style games... Meh who cares.I have a hard time imaging apple would let this fly in their ecosystem. Without Apples buyin this would not work on their devices.. engineers is at best th of the people needed to bring this to market. And that assumes you have a team of fucking rockstars as in could be earning Kyear elsewhere.  The . is because head dude has to run the company he will not have the time to be in the trenches  hours a day digging ditches.Touch ID this is the biggest red flag for me. The security precautions taken by AppleSamsungGoogle etc for touch ID style systems are not trivial. There is ZERO chance these companies would allow anyone let alone a startup into that side of the hardware. They could have their own modules or they could be trying to piggy back off the existing modules but thats going to open the door to other not insignificant technical amp security issues.... The fact that THIS is on the features list which has no business being a feature on an MVP makes me think eitherA they have woefully misjudged the complexity of implementing this feature which calls into question what else has been misjudged or B something something in the state of Denmark. ,kickstarter,df6j4t6,10,t5_2rquu

11635335,0,t1_dgeuaxd,Yes its not as fully featured as you might like but you can ask exactly what you want and every backer response is tied to them their details and their pledge. I just finished one which had  choice options for the lowest pledge and a whopping  choice options for the larger pledges so I had to carefully word the survey and there were only a couple of misunderstandings. Perhaps the problem was how you dont get these answers until after the funding period has finished? Its irritating to have it fully funded after a week and then spend three weeks waiting to find folks choices when if youve got the capital you could have started production early or at least started ordering materials or stock etc. ,kickstarter,dgevmb2,1,t5_2rquu
