4105195,0,t3_3727kz,Fitting is always an interesting thing because what works relies so much on skills of the pilot and how you want to fly. This is why I say that blindly copying other peoples fits without understanding them is a bad idea and that using external fitting tools like EFT PyFa or o.smium is good. Even if you are flying doctrine ships knowing why they are fit the way they are enables you to pilot them more effectively. This is also why I am not keen on having a lot of corporate fittings for solo use.That said there are a lot of common fitting mistakes out there and it comes from limited understanding of how things work together and of applicable game mechanics. Is this the pilots fault? Not always  fitting is just one aspect of the game and some people enjoy it and come up with some esoteric fits that work scarily well while others see fitting as a means to an end and just throw together something that follows the common principles.Because people will inevitably ask common fitting mistakes are mixing guns both type and range and mixing tank  thinking that cap boosters make you cap stable fitting agility mods that do not drop your align into the next s bracket not paying attention to any drawbacks a module has not fitting rigs,evescout,cro7tfe,1,t5_35o42
