I figured out thats why it was displaying bigger for me in Firefox I changed it a long time ago and forgot.  ampnbsp  The default browser size is . You and Brooklyn might prefer a setting of  or  if small print is hard to read. The path to change it in Firefox is tools lt options lt content. In Google Chrome click on the menu three horizontal bars in the upper right corner then settings lt  show advanced settings lt web content. Chromes default is medium so try large.

Just as whatever harm you may do to any OTHER groups or individuals will be inherently justified by your own self interest as a necessity simple collateral damage or whatever rationale you choose.In other words if you have the power to implement a change of whatever degree and most of us DO have some power...You will choose to exercise it til YOUR expectations are met which are defined by your own self interest.,Hulugans,ci8jncz,1,t5_31i8d

4439061,0,t1_csq61g9,Its easy to forget that the civil rights movement was what?  years ago? Black people still didnt have civil rights after the holocaust was over. We want to distance ourselves from it but it really wasnt that long ago when minorities couldnt use a white bathroom or go to a white school and were getting dragged out of homes and lynched. Just because Nazis were horrible people doesnt mean we were stellar humanitarians back then either. The Nazis were worse isnt a great defense P     Today we think of the confederate flag as good ol boy southern values but old folk dont see it that way. I think they see it for what it really meant then not what we want it to mean now. We want it to mean freedom of speech now but I think its too late.  My point is blacks will never be OK with it. Its their swastika because of how we used it. We didnt use it the same way we used the regular american flag. Just  years ago it was adopted by racists as a symbol of opposition to civil rights. Its also a question of being insensitive and selfish. Im not saying you shouldnt be able to fly a confederate flag in your own property you should if you want but flying it over a state capital building is atrocious in my opinion. ,Hulugans,csq88af,3,t5_31i8d

5560578,0,t3_3go06d,I knew Cam Newton was going to be good the first time i saw him.  I dont like the guy. I think he is full of himself and think that if he keeps celebrating first downs  and touch downs like he just won the super bowl guys are going to want to take him out. He needs to cool it on that. BUT i also think if that guy gets a few more weapons around him the way he has progressed he is right on the cusp of if hes not already elite. I definitely have a lovehate feeling towards that guy. But hes going to be one of the best for years to come barring injury.   And since this is the game being played Andrew Luck seems to have taken a giant step backwards. Im sure it has something to do with the O line but its just odd to watch. He doesnt seem to handle the pressure well. Maybe he should shave.   Cam REALLY is asking for it though man. Giving grown men who already want to hurt you that much more reason to want to hurt you is just not smart. Someone needs to get this through to him.

Evolution still applies to us humans unless we DO destroy the planet though weve effectively nullified the natural selection aspect which is the most powerful engine of change in the process.The ironic thing is weve actually increased the degree and altered the parameters of natural selection for most all other species on the planet so THEY will improve in a manner of speaking...evolution doesnt have a goal faster than we will BECAUSE  of us.,Hulugans,d45orfj,3,t5_31i8d

Adrian Peterson was the number two RB so lets use Julio Jones who was the number two receiver on ESPN. Julio had  receptions and  yards as well as  TDs. Adrian Peterson gained  yards and scored  times. So if you give AP nothing for touches he would get . pts for yardage and  pts for scores leading to a total of  points. Julio would get . pts for yardage pts for touches and  for scores leading to a total of .. Julio would be worth two Adrians!,Hulugans,d7enhqf,2,t5_31i8d

I just realized you can also just click anywhere on your name or logo as well to get there. Click that and then at the bottom of that page you will see keepers and then hit the edit keepers button. Thats where you can select your keepers. However there is no way to see the cost of the keepers inside the app. So here is a screenshot of what your players will cost you.

So what Ill do is once the rosters are locked at the end of the year I will go through and edit player values so everyone knows how much each player costs. As of right now its also very difficult to keep track of costs anyway. Once the new fantasy site is up it should become much easier to track costs. ,Hulugans,dff6900,1,t5_31i8d
