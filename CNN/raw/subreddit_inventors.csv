10971878,0,t3_5mxa1c,Hi! If you believe that your device is more efficient than others then there must be technical features which allow to achieve such effect. If the known devices have not such technical features then your invention is new! This one of the patentability criteria. I recommend to get in touch with a patent attorney and discuss with himher if it is the case to perform a professional search before filing a patent application. I also recommend this web platform  patentprojects.net  to find a patent attorney. Just post your project free and without obligation and receive offers.,inventors,debo6wp,1,t5_2sq62
