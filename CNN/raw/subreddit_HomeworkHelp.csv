Also heres the general layout of my formulaFd    water density  Velocity distance in meters time  . drag coefficient  . m crosssectional areaSo all I had to input was the velocity. If this helps here are the results right now  C Coated UC Uncoated This is the messed up old version forgot to convert crosssectional into meters and change the crosssectional area for the small set. Although you still get the impression that the coated plastic balls have a higher drag.This is my method so far.First fill the  mL beaker up to  mL with water..Next coat one large plastic ball with GClean Hydrophobic Rain Repellent a hydrophobic substance..Measure all of the plastic balls lengthwise to find the crosssectional area A through the formula pir..Record data..Insert a thermometer into beaker to find the temperature of the water..Record data..Drop the  large uncoated plastic ball into the water at . centimeters over the water..Run the timer from the point of the drop until the large uncoated plastic ball hits the bottom of the beaker..Record time..Drop the large coated plastic ball into the water at . centimeters over the water..Run the timer from the point of the drop until the large coated plastic ball hits the bottom of the beaker..Record time..Repeat the steps  for  times..Repeat steps   times except use the small plastic balls instead of the large..Next take the recorded temperatures and convert them to the Kelvin scale ...Look at figure a  and find the dynamic viscosity of the water..To find the Reynolds number use the formula REpVL. Plug in the dynamic viscosity as ..Use figure b  to find the drag coefficient CD..Use the drag formula FDpvCDA to find the drag. Plug in the velocity from the recorded times. Plug in the crosssectional area A.So in the end my question is Shouldnt the coated plastic balls have a lower Fd? Does this have to do with the higher velocity? How do I explain this in my project? The uncoated plastic balls had a lesser drag force the coated plastic balls had a higher drag force?

You need  beef patty   cheese slice   buns gt  cheeseburger.  Now remember that a mole is simply a number.  Like a dozen is .  A mole is .x.  So now you could alternatively say that in order to make  mole of cheeseburgers you would need  moles of buns.  As well as  mole of cheese slices and  mole of pattys. So if you were asked how many buns do you need to make  cheeseburger?  The answer would be  buns.  How many moles of FeCrO do you need to make  moles of CO?  The answer looking at the formula is we need  moles of FeCrO.  This is where the  mol over  mol came in for my equation.  Lets take it a step further.  How many moles of FeCrO do you need to make  moles of CO? moles of CO.  Multiply it by our conversion factor knowing that for every  CO we need  FeCrO.  Set it up so that you can cross out CO units and leave only units of mol FeCrO.    mol FeCrO   mol CO.    times   .  We need  moles of FeCrO according to our formula to produce  moles of CO.  Now if masses are added we have merely to convert the mass to moles using molecular mass andor convert moles back to mass using molecular massAnyway Id take Fuzzykins up on his offer to look over your work when you are finished.

318297,0,t3_1xqejk, Maximum likelihood you say? While its definitely not the easiest concept to get your head around youll get it once you have seen it a few times.So you are all over the probability density function a likelihood function is sort of like a backwards version of a PDF. What I mean is that if a PDF is a function giving the probability of an outcome given certain parameters then a likelihood function gives the likelihood of some parameters given a certain outcome.To find a likelihood function given a PDF first find the joint probability density function of all the observations. And if you have an independently and identically distributed sample then all you do is multiply the densities together. So at this point you have something that looks a bit like fx | theta  fx | theta ...  fxn | thetaSorry for poor formatting. Now consider that the likelihood function is a function of the parameter theta with the x as the known constant.The joint density here is the likelihood function that you need.From here you maximise the function yay calculus! and there you have a maximum likelihood estimator.As for whether or not it is biased the expectation of an unbiased estimator is the parameter that it is estimating. So take the expectation of your MLE and given all the wonderful things you have probably been hearing about maximum likelihood estimation you may be surprised by the result.Hope this helps.,HomeworkHelp,cfdre3n,1,t5_2r6f3

451171,0,t1_cfrghlh,I tried to post a response but guess it didnt go through....ah well.So from what I am getting you seem to think your current thesis is rather generic and perhaps unoriginal. Thats a good catch on your part and Im wont to agree with you on it.I think theres a couple ways you can say essentially the same thing but in a way that is maybe more what you are looking for.Heres a couple techniques I usually use.... Incorporate the work into you thesis specifically refer to Oedipus Rex instead of just saying The human search for identity..... you might say In Oedipus Rex or something like that. Dont be afraid to include a  little depth in your thesis. People make a big deal about a thesis should be this or this long. I dont think it  really matters within reason. I like to be detailed in my thesis. So for example if I were talking about symbolism in the Great Gatsby instead of saying The Great Gatsby contained a large amount of symbolism I might say The Great Gatsbys use of colors and heat are symbolic of the intensity of the characters interaction..... This is the part I find that makes your argument yours. As you can see they are saying the same thing but one sounds a lot better because I was specific about what in the text I was going to talk about. Even though I say in both that I will be discussing symbolism there are dozens of examples of symbolism in GG and the essay is about ONE example by orienting it around that specific symbol I am better able to give my writer an accurate preview of the paper and my thesis sounds more developed and original. Try and think about the evidence you have for your thesis you may notice some patterns blinding hurt upon the revelation of truth inevitability of fate ? within the play you may find it useful to try and mention and work these patterns into your thesis. Dont be afraid to do the thesis last. This just works better sometimes. I dont know what I want to write a lot of the time until I actually write it. This makes writing a thesis prior impossible. Dont feel obligated to complete the thesis before moving on with your paper. Alternatively it might behoove you to make an outline if you havent done so already just so you get an image of your ideas on paper. I was taught that your thesis should be a sort of preview or promise for your paper. It shouldnt give away everything but should give the reader what they need to know. I think think this is helpful when it comes to forming a thesis statement.Let me know if I was unclear about something or you have any questions. Its a lot harder to do this kind of stuff in text haha.,HomeworkHelp,cfrjoq4,1,t5_2r6f3

564531,0,t1_cg4dunc,gtOkay so when writing a thesis for the critique it should be your own? Yep I would say so!gtAlso to add further analysis to my thesis would something like this be okayIt depends if you only briefly mention these things in your essay or use them as evidence I wouldnt put them in. My general rule is its alright to put something in you spend a paragraph or a good part of one talking about. If you only mention it briefly or are using it as evidence I wouldnt mention it in the thesis. You want to be sure you actually have something to talk about later! Assuming you do spend a good amount of time on supportexamples and logical fallacies I think it looks like a great thesis. Specific but not to the point where it looks like its giving away all your evidence.gt  I was going to look at the authors claims and the evidence the information clarity logical fallacies and etcI think this is a great list. You can put any or all of these in your thesis provided you are talking about them all in depth devoting a paragraph or good part of one.gt should I address two arguments into one paragraph such as clarity and evidence. OR should I expand on each argumentclaim in its own separate paragraph?I think that depends on how much you have to talk about and how well related the two ideas are. If the ideas are related but you have a good amount of info for each I would just put them by each other but make them their own paragraph. On the other hand if you dont have a lot of info but the ideas ARENT related I would either leave it out or see what you can do to tag it onto another related thought. If youre going to try and combine some of them just remember that you need to make an overall point for the entire paragraph. So for example if you were talking about lack of clarity and poor word choice you might make an overall point of The writer harms his credibility and therefore the strength of his argument due to his lack of clarity and poor word choice.,HomeworkHelp,cg4fyan,1,t5_2r6f3

758083,0,t3_22t3q0,First you need to draw yourself a FBD so that you can visualize the forces acting upon the object.There is a gravitational force pulling the object down and a buoyancy force pushing the object up. However there is also a tensile force in the string pulling the object up to keep it in a static position not moving.For a static Fnet   solution and solving for the tension in the string Ft  Fb  Fg   Ft  Fg  FbNow in your solution you correctly used the density of aluminum to determine the mass of the object which displaces the fluid. However youre not supposed to use the same density to help you determine the buoyancy force created by the liquid. Buoyancy is the weight of the displaced fluid therefore the buoyancy force requires you to take the fluids density into consideration not the objects.It might be helpful if you used subscripts to try and differentiate the different densities  Ft  mobject  g  fluid  Vdisplaced  g   Ft  object  Vobject  g  fluid  Vdisplaced  g  Now because your object is fully submerged the volume of the object is equal to the volume of the displaced fluid. You can therefore simplify   Ft  Vobject  g  object  fluid   Ft  . m  . ms     kgm   Ft  . kgmsThis means that if there was no tension in the string or no string the object would sink into the ethanol. This makes sense because we know that denser objects sink in less dense liquids. Therefore in order to keep the object suspended in the ethanol without moving the string needs to pull it up with . N of force.I know this is late but I saw that you didnt get a full answer. Hopefully this helps.,HomeworkHelp,cgqg8lg,1,t5_2r6f3

The reddening and increased temperature is due to increased local blood flow vasodilation of blood vessels. The swelling comes from the formation of an oedema due to fluid filling in the interstitial spaces.

This works just fine but it becomes quite complicated when you solve fx for imaginary solutions imaginary solutions can not be inflection points on the real plane.  I believe you would set the denominator to be  which in this case would return x.  This however is not in the domain of fx so these do not work out to be inflection points either.But if you find the critical points and test the regions  critical points will give  regions because it splits inf to inf  times fx will tell you the concavity even if there is no real answer  the critical points as they couldprobably will be asymptotes ,HomeworkHelp,cgytvnx,1,t5_2r6f3

It can have any value from  to infinity but NOT zero like your table says. n is the lowest value it can take because  other QNs depend on the value of n. If you relate it to the periodic table n is the rows of the periodic table. The n row refers to HHe n refers to LiNe.  angular QN refers to the type or shape of orbital. It can take any value from  to n. In the case of H and He n so  can only  . For LiNe n so  can equal  and . These numbers that  takes refer to the shape of an orbital s p d f g... so for H and He they only have an s orbital s LiNe have both s orbitals s s and a p orbital p. m magnetic QN refers to how an orbital is oriented in space. It can take any value from  to  including zero. For an s orbital  there is only one value for m m meaning there is only one s orbital that can hold  electrons. For a p orbital  m    values meaning that there are  p orbitals that can hold  electrons each for a total of . You might see these xp orbitals labelled as px py pz referring to how they are oriented as if theyre on a d graph.Just as a side note from there  electrons from an s orbital   from the xp orbitals   which related this back to something you will know  the octet rule that all the early elements like to follow! more m For a d orbital  there are  values for m       meaning there are xd orbitals. Same deal with p orbitals  there are  values for m         xf orbitals. Just a note here too when it comes to putting the number in front of the orbitals if you need to do that the d orbital is on the th row of the periodic table d is on the th etc.  drop the number by . For f orbitals drop it by .As far as anything realistic that you have to deal with this is it. What you need to remember is that every time you increase  by  there will be  new values for m. The geometries of f orbitals in particular are quite tricky to get your head around but visit the orbitron website and see how these look in d space.

865553,0,t1_ch2bvpu,I think I could try to explain what might be happening then. As you know an underdamped system will overshoot and oscillate around its steady state value. So in an extreme case a highly underdamped system will pass the settling point very quickly but overshoot pass it again overshoot etc.But if the underdamping is very close to the critical damping then not only will the underdamp system hit the steadystate value but it is possible that it wont oscillate on the other end outside of your .m limit.Heres actually a good image that describes itYou can clearly see that the teal line is underdamped because it dips below the steadystate value. But it settles within a small range faster than the critically damped red line.And heres another exampleLets say your acceptable settling range was .. If that were the case then the overdamped actually reaches the settling range faster than the critically damped!So the answer to your question it seems and if its not too late that it really depends on your settling range. So if you were to use the values that showed the underdamped system converging faster and changed the range to .m instead Im certain you would see a switch in which system settles faster.Im so sorry I was late on this.

So for example although you would have been told a NaCl bond is an ionic bond its actually a mostly ionic slightly covalent bond. The model will however assume the bond is purely ionic and ignore the small covalent character which is what makes it inaccurate.Note The only a exception to what i said above is for bonds between atoms that are same. For example the bonding in H or O is a purely covalent bond. The reason why some bonds have more ionic character than covalent or vice versa is because of electronegativity differences between the atoms.

Able to form hydrogen bonds among themselves as well as with water eg. amines carboxylic acids alcohols. Able to for. hydrogen bonds with water only eg. esters ethers aldehydes. Polar but no hydrogen bonds eg. haloalkanesbar fluoroalkanes. Nonpolar eg. alkanes alkenesAmong categories  and  I would consider the number of hydrogen bonds it can form with water the more the better and for  I would consider the strength of dipole moment of the molecule.The reason why I feel considering polarity only is uncomprehensive is that sometimes there might be molecules with no overall dipole moment at all but still can form hydrogen bonds with water such as the hypothetical molecule formed by joining four OH groups to one single carbon atom. For these molecules I think they would theoretically still be soluble in water since hydrogen bonds are formed between them and water despite being nonpolar.

You could look at facebookNSA as an example of contracting privacy rights and then at say gay marriage or whatever as an area of expanding privacy rights. Then you might say something about how it looks like privacy rights are expanding in some areas and contracting in others.

Oftentimes this is a point about the human tendency to deceive oneself the character is lying to themselves  and possibly the audience too the fallibility of memory the characters memories have compromised credibility or the falseness of external perception how the reader perceives the character  not who they really are the character has a dark side etc.. In the first person point of view unreliable narrators can conceal or obfuscate certain elements of the story or details about themselves that change how the reader perceives them. Sometimes this also leads to twist endings.Examples some of these contain major spoilers which I have blacked outdeceiving oneself In Chuck Palahniuks Fight Club the narrator thinks he is entangled in a destructive relationship with Tyler Durden. In fact Tyler is his alternate personalitys. The same things happens in Daniel Handlers The Basic Eight. Can also go under falseness of perception because the narrator is deceiving themselves and you the audience.fallibility of memory The Sea by John Banville Max Morden thought that a girl he knew in childhood Rose was in love with a man named Mr. Grace. In fact she was in love with Mr. Graces wife insteads. He later finds this out when he grows up and returns to his childhood home.falseness of the readers perception Humbert Humbert is the charming welleducated affluent narrator of Vladimir Nabokovs Lolita. You later learn that he is an unrepentant pedophile and murderers. The TVTropes page for Unreliable Narrator has tons of examples as well.I hope my explanations and examples made sense.

Im not sure I understand your question though.gt  interest paid annually but in advance at the beginning of the purchaseLets straighten out the language here a little bit. Our bond has a face value of P a coupon rate C paid annually. It also matures ten years out. That means were owed ten interest payments theyre either paid out on schedule that is at the end of every year or in a lumpsum today.In the first case wed receive P  C a year and the principal P at maturity. In the second case wed receive   P  C today and the principal P at maturity. With P   and C  . youre correct that in the case of a lumpsum payment the yield to maturity Y equals .. This is given by the first equation in my original reply to you.In the case of annual payments however we want to solve the following equation for Y  .  Y  .  Y  .  Y  ...  .  Y    .  YTheres a few ways to do this. The first is to use something like Excel to calculate the internal rate of return for the set of coupon and principal payments.The secondand what uPiratesSayARRR was getting thatis a shortcut that applies when a bond makes periodic coupon payments and when we know that the bonds market price is equal to its face value. That is it applies to any bond that has the following payment schedule Pay fixed coupon rate C at the end of each period Pay principal at maturity.For any bond whose cash flows can be described as above we know that the yield to maturity equals the coupon rate when the bonds price is its par value.Does that make sense? ,HomeworkHelp,cj6wpze,1,t5_2r6f3

1734443,0,t1_cjx2be0,Good question. Its part of coming to terms with this new material.gt  on a red green and blue pigment which is white. But it isnt white. Its black. The orig Q never explicitly said what color the wall appeared. But the info  the answer i guess  was that it was black.A white sheet absorbs no colors at all it reflects back all the light which is why it seems white.Can you try it? Paints inks or ?? The more different ones you put on the paper the closer it gets to black  not to white. You may not get a good black cuz it can be hard to get the balance. But you should get close enough to see the idea.You can also try it with food coloring and look at the light that goes through. May be hard to tell but try if you want.Ask your teacher if she can demo this. Youre not the only one who is wondering. Or see an art teacher. They are expert at this! A couple more points... The Q talks about colors of light and the colors of the pigments. Its really important to keep them separate.If you ask only about the colors of the light... no walls reflecting then colors add. Redbluegreen lights  white light.  Each light is giving off one color. Using three lights gives you more colors. The sum of all colors is white.But the Q is about reflection  with pigments that remove light. Thats a subtraction problem. If you use a whole set of pigments you remove everything  and get black. If you know about whiteners as used with laundry thats yet another issue which we can discuss if you want. Its fun but is more than you need here. It involves a type of pigment that actually gives off some light too. Ok go reflect on that. ,HomeworkHelp,cjxshav,1,t5_2r6f3

So I will explain it in nonesymbolic logic and then show you the equivalent in symbolic logic.Modus PonensAlright here is what a modus ponens argument looks like in nonsymbolic form If there is a hobbit in the garden the cucumbers will be eaten. There is a hobbit in the garden.  Therefore the grapes will be eaten.This should seem obviously valid. If  is true and  is true it is the case that  must be true. Try not to get confused by thinking the hobbit could be in the garden and decide to not eat the cucumbers or eat the tomatoes instead! That is not what were concerned with here. We are saying that if both premises are true then  MUST be true in that case. In symbolic logic it may look something like this      pq       A      p          A      q         MPP sometimes the first premise might look something like this  or Here the letters stand for propositions. Think of a proposition as a statement that could be either true or false. So they couldnt be commands like close the door or questions like how are you?. In the case of the first argument p would stand for a hobbit is in the garden and q would stand for all the cucumbers will be eaten the horseshoe sign andor the arrows mean if....then so pq would be if there is a hobbit in the garden all the cucumbers will be eaten.The A to the side of the first two premises stands for assumption. This really means that it is a statement that is not a conclusion of any other two premises. The MPP stands for modus ponens which is just the logical law used to derive your conclusion and the  are the premises from which your conclusion follows.

1929492,0,t3_2gpyyk,Philosophy in a somewhat general sense began with the preSocratics scattered around the Mediterranean in a general attempt to account for the world by means other than religion primarily by the employment of reason and and endorsing a scientific  or natural explanation.Socrates asserted that philosophy was an important human endeavor that sought the truth of things by fearless questioning. Plato was the first philosopher to attempt a unified account of the various branches of philosophy A.N.Whitehead famously said that all philosophy is but a footnote to Plato which branches were later defined by Aristotle who also spent a lot of time figuring out Logic. While Socrates wrote nothing himself both Plato and Aristotlesort of composed works properly philosophic and formed schools that were in many ways similar to later institutions of higher learning.A good source for a more thorough discussion of the PreSocrates and the philosophers you want to write about is the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy online. The classic discussion of the PreSocratics is H.Frankforts Before Philosophy and a very good overview of its general conclusion is provided here ,HomeworkHelp,cklou03,1,t5_2r6f3

1967664,0,t3_2h70zu,nb Ive not read this piece so Im using your summary.First to reshape your thesis consider this In Arts Education Pays Off Livio DiMatteo points out that governmental funding for the liberal arts is unfairly low in comparison to scientific fields. DiMatteo argues that this difference in funding is largely due to a lack of immediately tangible results.Minor things and these are all unless your instructor told you otherwise of course Punctuation goes inside quotation marks. Scholars dont explain they argue. Result of results is repetitive. Your sentence is partially passive who is funding the lib arts? better to have a subject. I split the idea into two sentences because the difference in funding levels is not argument I assume its fact. The argument is the why  the nontangible results. Is DiMatteos piece a book? If so use italics not quotation marks some instructors prefer underlined titles but thats getting to be archaic. If an article quotation marks are appropriate. Your essay will need to delve into sources of funding. Ive no idea where the loot for Canuckistani universities comes from but in Murrica theres a strange mix of publicprivate funding at ostensibly public unis. Much the same as in your example STEM folks get the lions share of the funding for a few reasons not the least of which is the private money that comes in to support potentially profitable research. With sweeping budget cuts that have hit most states in recent years after paying the football coach theres little money left over for history and English. So what? Well it seems that DiMatteo is arguing that a similar situation exists in the land of Timbits. Funding is being directed to fields where there is a measurable return on investment a consequence of the businessification of government and removedredirected from areas where there is an ephemeralintangible benefit. This gets at a fundamental question  what is the purpose of education? Is it to provide what is essentially job training? Or is it to expose students to ideas and teach them to think about those ideas. While the question has come to a head of sorts in recent decades its a very old question going back at least a century. Then youll need to explore how DiMatteo argues that the ephemeralintangible benefits are in fact real and worth paying for. ,HomeworkHelp,ckqaz97,1,t5_2r6f3

2012153,0,t3_2hrx97,Id imagine that there are numerous classification systems out there for movies  just look at Netflix catalog for example.Alternatively you could move away from classifications like scary or comedy and use date of production usetype of special effects does the film contain CGI? geographical setting for example US Asia Europe Africa does the film cast include any award winners or nominees etc.The alternative categories can provide useful information in some cases  for example what can be learned about how effects looked on screen prior to CGI? or are European movies longer than African movies? Niche information perhaps but it could have use.Bear in mind that this seems to be an exercise in seeing how you categorize and prioritize things. For example if you were to go with the continental categorization it might indicate that you like to group things by very inclusive variables and see small differences as less important. Whereas if you get into date of production it might show a romance or disdain for the past. Or it may not.

2795991,0,t3_2s3fr4,First you would need to find the initial vertical velocity. Lets call it Vy. You would use the fact that the maximum height is .. Since the ball was thrown from a height of .m the vertical distance it covers until the maximum height is .m  .m  .m. Also at the point of the maximum height the vertical velocity is . The whole time the acceleration is .ms which is equivalent to . Nkg. The formula to use for Vy is V  Vy  ayOnce you use this equation to solve for Vy you can find the initial horizontal velocity which we can call Vx by using trigonometrytan   Vy  VxThen you can use Vx and the horizontal distance of .m to find the time the ball is in the air t x  Vx  tFinally you can figure out the height of the ball after it has been in the air for t seconds. Besides the t you just found you would use the Vy that you found earlier and a  . Nkg. Plug them into y  Vy  t    a  tThe y that you get is the height gained when the ball is in the air so youd need to add it to the .m initial height. The result is the height of the ball when its level with the basket. If the result is less than .m then he definitely misses. If its slightly more than . then I guess hed make the shot. If its way more than . then he will overshoot the basket. Its possible hell bank the shot but nothing is said about that in the problem. ,HomeworkHelp,cnlw6s4,1,t5_2r6f3

A digital signal like one you make in matlab is not a continuous function but a discrete function of finite length. It has to be a power of  because of the way that Matlab will actually compute the DFT. It uses an algorithm called the FFT or Fast Fourier Transform which is an efficient way of computing the DFT of a signal. The tldr of that is the FFT is based off merge sort which is a computer algorithm that is based on dividing data into halves.  To define the length you need to create the time scale and the sample rate. If your sample rate is  Hz the code below would be a place to start.     fs   sample rate    Ts  fs sample period    length  .    t  linspacelengthTslength generates the time vector    pi  .That should be enough to get you started. linspace is a matlab command to generate a vector between  and length  Ts the length in seconds of the signal with length number of points. ,HomeworkHelp,cnsib7a,3,t5_2r6f3

Furthermore a good strategy in these kinds of problems is to find the expression for the potential first and then the electric field using the relation E  . There are many things that can go wrong in adding the electric field vectors but potential is a scalar so you can freely add them without worrying about directions.Let Q   C Q   C Q   C.Now we need to find the potential at a distance y along the yaxis. The equation for electric potential at a point due to point charges is    Qiri  Qy  Qy  Qy  y  y  y  yNow we can see that the potential is a function of only y that is   y. Since E   we can find the min or max of  by setting E    . Since   y we have E  ddy  . Therefore we have ddy y  y  y  yy  Plugging that into Wolfram Alpha you get y  ..

This means that in changing the denominators from b and d to something else youd multiply each of them by something different  implying you have to change the numerators via multiplication too. So you wouldnt get acLCMbd youd get first find LCM which youve called f then acknowledge that in order to reach f b must be multiplied by some integer b  fb  f note fb is an integer because youve defined f as a multiple of b implying that b  some integer  f same for d d  fd  f so you can use multiplication to change the denominators to what you want  but you have to multiply the tops by the same thing So ab gets turned into a  fb  f and cd gets turned into c  fd  f now that they have the same denominator NOW you can add them afb  cfd  fUnfortunately this just leads back to simplifying to ab  cd.

3454399,0,t3_2zs45m,My very general understanding is that Pavlov studied the triggering of reactions while Skinner studied the effects of reinforcement of reactions.I would say behaviour and not reactions. In Pavlovs case he focused on automatic behaviour in reaction to a stimulus while Skinner focused on how a reinforcer or punishment increased or decreased the voluntary behaviour before the reinforcer or punishment.So in your example the feeling of pain the child gets when seeing the hot plate after being burnt is a classic conditioned Pavlovian response. Shying away could be involuntary or voluntary so part of that response or a behaviour induced by the fear reaction. To be clearer Id skip the shying away or rephrase so its obviously an involuntary action flinching away maybe?.If shying away is a voluntary response it would be a behaviour reinforced by negative reinforcement less fear an operantskinnerian conditioned behaviour.From a Skinnerian standpoint the pain is a positive punishment that will decrease the likelihood of the child touching the plate again.This can be very tricky..let me know if anything is unclear!,HomeworkHelp,cpm10eg,1,t5_2r6f3

4948693,0,t3_3in0n8,Just my two cents but my professors have always stressed that the kind of problem solving you have to do requires you to make assumptions. Ideally the problem statement will tell you mole ratio or mass ratio specifically but if they dont then what? Obviously if its real world you would ask but if you cant ask you have to write your assumptions. Just like when dealing with fluids when no one mentioned a temperature just make a note at room temperature or the like. You could go by context in the problem or when all else fails I would typically assume mass percent for solids or volume percent for fluidsit just seems like thats the most likely way either thing would be measured.Its worth pointing out that you should always check a composition for .

5124672,0,t3_3l6z9l,Sometimes the hardest part about college is that it can be so openended. Profs will often ask you to create your own ideas rather than do a predetermined task and that can be a bit daunting at times. But not to worry! Youre obviously a smart person with interesting perspectives so lets focus on drawing on those as a method of leading you to your topic.First things first before getting carried away with what should I pick to write about try taking stock of the have vs. the have not What do you already know? What dont you know? What would you like to know? What topics stood out as interesting in the weeks leading up to this essay? Did anything in particular pique your interest? Use that as your guiding line. Even if the idea is a bit nebulous its still a starting place. Also a good piece of advice for openended essay topics is to write what you care about. Is there something in your life that youre really passionate about? How can you tie that into a discussion about Hinduism or Buddhism? For example maybe you really like to travel...so you could talk about how tourism affects and impacts religiously significant areas such as Tibetan Buddhist monasteries.

Well would you say i should have a method for presenting the menuusing the code you just showed me and then another one for letting the user choose a type incrementing by one up until  or until the user wants to leave and then another loop letting the user choose their variation of that type? I want to try this all but I am just stuck in the beginning part how to actually set it up. I understand that inside of the variations method ill need to increment the proper cell for the counter array so that in the end I can scan the columns to get the most ordered type and then for the most ordered combo. In the method for getting the variations id need to increase totalCost by whatever the proper cell is.

Where is cosa positive or negative? Where is cosa   positive or negative? If theres any circumstance in which one part is positive and the other is negative then their product will be negative violating our condition. Both of these functions have the same basic shape so this only happens when one of the functions have gone from positive to negative and the other hasnt yet or vice versa. In the general case cosa has roots at a  pi  n and cosa   has roots at a  pi  n  . You can show that for no possible apix using integer x will a be strictly between these two roots meaning that all the values you could possibly check would have both parts positive both parts negative or either part equal to .

Slope is defined as the change in the y value of a line for a given change in x value in other words slope is the rise over the run for a line. Mathematically slope is often expressed by the variable m. m   y   x  where the symbol   means change in. You express a change in yvalue the numerator by looking at the difference between the value of y of two points on the line. So take two points that lie on the line. Call P x y and P x y.  y  y  y and  x  x  x.m    y    x  y  y  x  xYou can use this formula to solve b directly.For c and d you have to know the form of the equation of a line. A line is expressed in the form y  mx  b where m is the slope and b is the yintercept. So this equation will tell you where the line intersects the yaxis it intersects the yaxis at the value b and how steep the line is which is all the info needed to graph the line. Since you are looking for the slope and slope  m parts c and d can be solved by looking at the coefficient in front of x. Finally a deals with a vertical line which is a special case when it comes to slope. Imagine a vertical lines rise over run when you go up the line by a certain amount how far do you travel sideways? What does this tell you about the slope of the line?,HomeworkHelp,d1b6qlh,1,t5_2r6f3

7223206,0,t3_4edcdf,All of the trig functions measure properties of angles. I dont mean that in an abstract way  theyre literally measurements.Cosine measures the rightness of an angle the proportion of a line at that angle that goes right. To find how far right you go you can just multiply the distance you walked by the cosine of the angle you walked at.Similarly sine measures the upness of an angle and tangent function measures steepness the slope of a line at the angle you give it.So how can we calculate the cosine of an angle? Well walk along a diagonal line at that angle measure how far right you went and divide by how far you actually went. Refer to this shitty MS Painted diagram if youre still confused.Wait a minute... that looks familiar. Too familiar. That dotted line connecting the end of the measure this line to the end of the walk this way line makes a rightangled triangle. And were dividing the measure line by the walk line... which we could also call the adjacent side and the hypotenuse.And we could do the same thing with the dotted line and the line you walked along to measure the sine! And divide how far up you went by how far right you went to get the tangent!This is where SOHCAHTOA really comes from! The reason we use the unit circle is because dividing by the line we walked along takes a lot of work and were lazy. Dividing by  is easy. If we just walk to the edge of the unit circle then the cosine of our angle is x or just x and the sine of our angle is y or just y. And if we use the Pythagorean theorem we can get opposite  adjacent  hypotenuse. Divide all of those by hyp and you getgtoppositehypotenuse  adjacenthypotenuse  hypotenusehypotenusegtsin   cos   Thats where the trig identity sincos comes from! Trigonometry all comes from just measuring angles!

You might also look at lower stakes situations like Jane Elliotts famous experiment with schoolchildren. I wonder if the outcome youve observed isnt more a result of how people identify with the persona that they imagine belongs to their assigned positions. For instance in the Elliott example children who were told that they held lower status adopted behaviors that reflected the label though that conformity must have lowered their selfesteem. Certainly the intensity with which people took on their tasks as guards at Stanford seem to have involved selfimportance and a corresponding increase in contempt for others. But without this kind of situational encouragement without a culture of hierarchy that makes a policy of disrespect people dont necessarily treat authority as a pass for exploitation which is what Id expect if power per se made people prone to such abuses in order to boost their selfworth.   ,HomeworkHelp,d22wiph,1,t5_2r6f3

They take the derivative of both the numerator and denominator individually because evaluating the limit as it is will give you an indeterminate form lim ln t  t will give you infinityinfinity. lt one of the  indeterminate forms  if Im not mistaken.To find the real value of this limit they used Lhopitals rule for limits.

9251169,0,t3_571816,I actually think what you have in the middle of your paragraph about rushing through the list of side effects is one of those oh yeah I have noticed that let me keep reading moments and that would make a great hook. If you form it as a question e.g. Have you ever noticed that at the end of drug commercials the narrator begins talking at lightning speed? What they are doing is rushing through the list of possible side effects... or something like that I think it could be a good start. If you do that your current hook that most people watch TV  minshr is ads will probably have to be scrapped but I think thats okay because its not very relevant to the rest of your paragraph. Instead what I think you should do is use the rushing through side effects as a hook then expand a bit on why they do that prevents people from hearing side effects are usually negative etc. then put your thesis statement which is why they should be more clear.I think your thesis statement is pretty good although I dont like bad advertising and poor advertising appearing one after the other. I feel like you can get rid of because of bad advertising because thats sort of implied when you say in the beginning of your thesis want the side effects to more clear in the advertisements but thats sort of a nitpicky thing so Ill leave that up to you.

The force you are experiencing is actually friction because as you walk you attempt to push your feet backwards. Frictional force resists this sliding motion and pushes your foot forward instead! If you were on really oilywet slippery ground instead of being able to walk forward your feet would slip back and you would fall down. Car tyres also work in a similar way and the friction is pushing the car forward. However this force would not exist unless there was energy expended in pushing backwards against the ground as the car continually moves forwards so the conservation of energy still holds! ,HomeworkHelp,d9b5yd8,1,t5_2r6f3

Culturally anthropologically youd would discuss ways of communication like twitter the proliferation of translators or on a grim note the mass extinction of languages. Coming from an neoclassical economic perspective you might discuss free trade the growth of wealth financialization innovations as development. Or a political economy critical theory perspective would discuss how free trade create global inequality restricts labor movement commodified everything even cultural artifacts destroys indigenous populations etc. Psychologically I think its hard to discuss globalization. Its a macro theoretical term and psychology is inherently micro. Any ideas I have here are sociological like the sociolinguistics of globalization or intersectionality in care work womens work.

10528657,0,t3_5qpkvx,The poem is about survival through generations of daytoday hardship how a woman goes on about her business in a community where violence and privation are commonplace.  I think you could take the title in a few ways one that the speakers words are addressed to God or two that her resilience is a kind of spiritual practicethat she manages to bear on through life in the service of her god.    The speakers description of uptown houses straight as Dead men contrast with the no place where she is Happy to be alive and suggest she finds the safer quieter read more affluent whiter communities from which she is excluded to be desolate and sinister. Their grim pallor silence and order are juxtaposed against the vibrant sounds of ray charles and hollering the pushing on through life of the the place she twice identifies as the inner city Or Like we call it Home.     The poem is an explanation of individual resilience in a troubled neighborhood. An outsider sees the speaker and cant understand how she doesnt despair and give up on her life. The poem is a challenge to this individual who fails to grasp how generations of going on women have withstood their losses through their commitments to those they love. She turns the tables on the critical observer offering back to them her negative perceptions of uptown as a forbidding and colorless place. Make sure you mention that refrain where she takes the critics characterization of the inner city and returns it transformed each time in the voice of her community as Home.,HomeworkHelp,dd1jdi4,3,t5_2r6f3

Dividends usually have a stated rate. In this question the stated rate is .. This means that each preferred share has to receive . before the common shares receive anything. If the amount of dividends declared is less than this amount number of preferred shares  stated rate the common shares will receive nothing.Preferred shares can also be cumulative or noncumulative. If the preferred shares are cumulative this means that any dividends not paid out to the preferred shareholders in the year i.e. . each will accumulate as dividends in arrears. The next time the company declares dividends the dividends in arrears AND the current years dividends must be paid out to the preferred shareholders before the common shareholders receive anything. If some dividends are declared in the year but not enough to cover the stated rate for all the preferred dividends the preferred shareholders will receive as much as possible and the remainder will accumulate as dividends in arrears.In this question the preferred shares are noncumulative so we dont need to worry about it.Hopefully most of that was familiar to you.

11603597,0,t1_dgb8l9i,Well dont tell anyone we get our feelings hurt easily but not many th grade Americans are doing that level of math Sadly Im not much use either. a. is a derivative but I only remember how to do polynomials b. I dont remember trigometric integrals but theyre online a. and b. are just arccos and arctan respectively noting that theyre in radians and not degrees  is logarithms.  My brain freezes up on logarithms  a is just asking you to factor the binomial b is asking for the point where the slope of the curve is zero the curve stops increasing and starts decreasing...since the major term is x its an inverted parabola.  The slope is the same as the first derivative so theyre asking you to take the derivative of the equation and then solve it for zero find the value of x that will yield zero. c is asking you to again take the st derivative and compute the slope at x  .  Then you can plug x   into the original function and get the value of y at x.  Now you have an x y point and you have the slope so you can generate the pointslope version of the line which is what they want. d. Starts out similar.  Its perpendicular to the last line so its slope is the negative reciprocal m of the other slope.  Since you know the slope you can solve the st derivative of C where it equals the new slope and that will give you the x value of the point where the new line touches the curve C.  You can then generate the y value of that same point by plugging the new x into the original equation C.  That gives you again the slope and an x y point on the new line so you can generate a slopeintercept line equation for the new line.  Now they ask you to find the point A where the two lines intersect.  I think you can do that with simultaneous equations or via matrices  there are different ways to solve systems of equations. e. Since you now have the coordinates of A I think you can just use the distance equation to find the distance to the new point  I dont see how its relevant that the new point falls on L although I might test if thats true to check your work on the earlier steps. f. There are websites describing how to take the area of a triangle formed of  arbitrary points.  Again I dont know if the statement that D is on L is a red herring or provided to help you check your work.Caveat I suck at math.  Good luck ,HomeworkHelp,dgb9zl6,2,t5_2r6f3

The educational content is mainly in the text not the artwork so that might help guide you to find a balance.,HomeworkHelp,dgj97ir,2,t5_2r6f3

11783537,0,t1_dgvorv1,gt atever compound has the biggest electronegativity difference is Are you sugggesting that the strength of a the ionic bond does not depend on the ionic charge? But surely if the ionic charge is greater the electrostatic attraction is also greater why is the electronegativity considered instead? Thanks,HomeworkHelp,dgvpagk,1,t5_2r6f3
11795803,0,t3_688zwl,As for q I believe because there usually is such a small amount of SO  in solution because most of it might be HSO because that is a weak acid and thus more stable then SO. Besides that the chances of it reacting in the first place are really low and I think it is also not very reactive on its own in most of the cases it is used.Also you have to add an electric potential to it which you wont have in most reactions.Regarding the other question the voltage being applied makes it so that only copper can get reduced to Cu s because the other ions being created probably need a higher voltage to reduce. I might be wrong since I currently have no access to a table with reduction potentials. But my guess is the conditions are preferable for copper and others wont react until either the voltage changes or all copper has become solid on the appropriate electrode,HomeworkHelp,dgx3ens,1,t5_2r6f3
