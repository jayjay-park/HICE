10286534,0,t3_5nanly,The image of god on the cross is a very important one historically. In antiquity the manner of your death revealed something about the way you lived think of Achilles. Deuteronomy  reads cursed as anyone hung on a tree. So the image of a godman on the cross is what caused the Romans to laugh at Christianity and the Jews to denounce it as Blasphemy. Nietzsche believes that the Christians used the image of the cross to gather up all the rejected elements of society to revaluate all values and declare war on the roman state.  If the Romans valued dignitas the Christians were humble if the Romans were indulgent the Christians were ascetic If the Romans valued conquest the Christians valued turning the other cheek. Basically Christianity launched a meme war against Rome and won. If you are interested in this subject I would suggest looking into his Antichrist  ,Nietzsche,dca19tz,13,t5_2qxbg
11021777,0,t1_deh5c0r,Alright thanks.Honestly though the Genealogy was the first book of his I picked up and I dont remember it being heavy in philosophyI only stopped reading it because of the insistence of the author or maybe it was the translator? that Beyond Good and Evil should be read first. And I was at a loss with BGE since he starts it off right away by attacking specific philosophers. And of course once again the translators introduction to BGE says readers should be familiar with Nietzsches earlier work.I think I ought to finish Human All Too Human  Ive heard that was his first major work after the whole break with Schopenhauer and Wagner and German philosophy but shit if it isnt his most boring book too lol I would probably skip it and start with a later work if I wasnt so far in. After that Ill probably skip ahead to BGE.,Nietzsche,dehadtj,1,t5_2qxbg
