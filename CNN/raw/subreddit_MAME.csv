375513,0,t3_1yd0w3,Its all incredibly confusing and frustrating. I can help you with the Raspberry Pi part. Dont use PiMAME or RetroPie. Theyre both pretty bad. Just download Raspbian and install MameallPi yourself. Its an older version of MAME that works on lowend hardware. You wont be able to use the ROMs that you already downloaded .. Look for ROMs for MAME Android. The Android port of MAME uses the same version as Mameallpi. The games play really great even without overclocking the Pi. One problem is that the sound eventually starts to lag. Not sure what to do about that.I ended up writing my own frontend in Python and PyGame.I cant help you with the controller you chose. I built one myself using a joystick the reunion one from Happ and a iPac. The iPac has a way to press multiple buttons at the same time to trigger ESC etc. so you dont need an extra keyboard once you get going.Good luck and feel free to ask followup questions.,MAME,cfjoqyo,1,t5_2rbl1

Ive only done testing so far but the board seems to be a very high quality build.  The LED controllersoftware seem to work well.If youre doing a full  player build with a trackpad youll need an additional controller as theres not quite enough button inputs to have the Howler be a complete  player standalone unit.  Id love to see the next version of the Howler have an additional joysticktrackball input and another  buttons even if they didnt have the RGB LED drivers.You definitely want to go through Paradise amp pickup a kit as getting LGB LEDs isnt trivial.  As I kickstarted I didnt get a package but the board itself.

You cannot use a longer cable with it without running into problems.As with all GSync monitors there is no hardware scaling so all you get is scaling provided in the Nvidia drivers. Scaling on this monitor sucks though. Youd expect half the resolution to look perfect but it doesnt. It adds noticeable blur. Youre running at this monitors native resolution or youre not using this monitor basically.It wont run at higher refresh rates at lower resolutions.It really depends on what you want.

2840456,0,t3_2sml85,The ultimate arcade II Id be wary of the dimensions for a  monitor but it might be fine.I dont know much about the WG monitor but the reason youd go with that opposed to a regular monitor is it should in theory have a much better range of resolution and refresh rates that its capable of which is very important for old arcade games.You say regular monitors have much better specs for resolution.. if you mean by higher thats actually not helpful.  Old games run at p or so resolutions.  Having one that goes high doesnt help you at all and just means your pc will have to run things at a higher resolution to not be blurry.But I guess that depends on what you want to run.  If its going to primarily be for arcade classics pre it might not be the best choice.  If you want the occasional old game thrown in but most of the time youre running PC games like SFIV and other modern games youd want that higher resolution.,MAME,cnqyg0d,2,t5_2rbl1

Youre really going about this the wrong way.Removing nonworking games is not the best idea.I mean what if its fixed in the next release youll need to download it again then merge it into the list you just deleted it from.How do you plan on playing the games?Most front ends  mame variants will show you which games are working  nonworking.Also unless you have an amazing machine lost of modernchd required games that actually work wont run fast enough to be playable.So how are you defining nonworking?Lots of games too run but have a flaw which means the dev team doesnt want to mark it as working.Like maybe doesnt have working sound and is marked as nonworking but plays fine without itAnd roms and chds arent all that comprises of a full mame experience!The versions of mame that have a built in gui and many front ends make use of various extra files.I think all in the mameextras might run to a few TB too.videos PCB pictures icons flyers etc etcWhy do you want to get rid of nonworking games btw?If I were you Id download the roms pick my exe and depending on the exe possibly a front end too get some extras to make it a nicer experience then use the mame exefrontend to have a look at the CHD games that look interesting and get them.,MAME,cvg6nsu,2,t5_2rbl1
