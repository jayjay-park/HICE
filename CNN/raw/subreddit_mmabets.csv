4647223,0,t3_3emgzv,Tates striking has definitely evolved as well as Caraways. Still wont be enough to beat Ronda and I doubt Caraway beats someone like Aljo or Almeida,mmabets,ctgch4e,3,t5_397ct
4724624,0,t3_3fkbwg,I dont know about the ad time.  Because generally if theres a first round finish they fill in the time with ads and analysis and dont show the next fight immediately. So they still get their ads in.  I do feel that they bring out easy knock outs on the free cards so casual fans will be more interested.  This next fight night is stacked with st round finishers.,mmabets,ctq2ube,5,t5_397ct

There are a lot of fights on this card with the under set at . though so yea you can parlay all of those together. Those are actually great to call if youre confident about them.,mmabets,ctvebi5,1,t5_397ct
