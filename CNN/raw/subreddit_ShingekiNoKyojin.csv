15151,0,t1_ceg5fha,I dont think they reanimate it fully. I dont know how animation works in Japan today but I would assume its all done with layers of cel inkings so the eyes for example would just be one separate layer. Then they probably have some kind of technology that would just insert the photo of the layer into the sequence? lol Thats what I would think at least. ,ShingekiNoKyojin,ceg5qo7,3,t5_2we2n
17713,0,t3_1uaxnq,Id disagree with the assessment of either character as a Mary Sue.Mikasa has an extremely noticeable almost fatal set of flaws and I dont mean Eren. First we see during the Trost arc as well as Manga Spoilersm the pursuit of Riener and Bertholt after Erens capture that while Mikasa is extremely selfless and protective when it comes to Eren and Armin she often feels criminally little responsibility for others. During the Battle of Trost her initial leadership of the attack on the surrounded Garrison Headquarters showed a callous indifference towards the lives of her fellow soldiers. Manga Spoilersm She even goes as far as to imply that she would cut down Christa during the armored titan chase if she interfered with their attempt to recapture Eren and coldly declares that she decided long ago what lives she cared about protecting. Yet at the same time she hesitates to kill Riener and Bertholt when she has the chance... Given all of this Im inclined to view her as a more complex character than shes sometimes given credit for being.In addition Mikasa is also just as emotionally impulsive as Eren. She arguably does more to hurt the situation than help it during the standoff with the Garrison over Eren. Anime Spoilersm Her attempt to kill the female titan against orders would have resulted in her death were it not for Levis intervention. Worst of all she arguably ends any chance at a peaceful resolution to the confrontation with Annie in Stohess when she abruptly decides oh Ive had enough and suddenly draws her swords without orders.As for Levi the most common criticism Ive heard is that he utterly fails when it comes to the charisma department. This does nothing to help the Scouting Legions political ties and hes outwardly emotionless to the point that hes accused in the anime of lacking basic humanity. He might be a Mary Sue when it comes to combat and the military and even then its evident that his teamwork and leadership are somewhat lacking but as a character hes far from perfect.,ShingekiNoKyojin,cegg7lc,3,t5_2we2n

33601,0,t1_cei85sd,gtWell the question with your theory is how on earth the humans would have forced the shifters to make the walls. The DMG was invented after the wallsafter humanity moved inside the walls so there were no real way to kill titans and given that cannon fire did nothing I presume it would be very difficult to kill titan shifters and even more difficult to kill colossaltype titan shifters.I see where youre coming from but theres always the possibility that they were able to imprison the titan shifters somehow probably before they shifted. Hell one could even assume that the wall cult worked in secret with the government to enrol individuals with a minimal desire to live and then induce the titan shifting ability into them to use them to build the walls. I dont know maybe if they could have thrown some more light unto when exactly humans approached the walls it might make more sense. Im just saying that its a plot hole that you can easily go around.gtThe ability for titans to become titan shifters appears to be tied to the consumption of another titan shifter which begs the question how the first shifter was created.... I got that from the section where Ymir describes that she was in the endless nightmare until she ate BerwickMarcel ReinerBertholts flashback scene. Because BR were shifters and Annie who later became part of their group was also a shifter I think its fair to assume that Berwick was also a shifter and that Ymir by eating him was able to regain her rationality and consciousness.So were a bit on the same page when we talk about the zombieish lore. When you turn to a titan you can only regain consciousness when you feed on another one. While I do agree that this may work for your average titan however Annie Reiner and Bertholt have different body structures than your average titan such as Ymirs average one. The more plausible theory would be that Annie Reiner Bertholt and Eren may have shared the same method of possessing titan abilities while Ymir didnt share that method. Annies flashback with her father may have indicated that their village may be some sort of titan factory building up titans to retaliate against humans no matter how much they hate them. That part with her father indicated that the village may be sending certain individuals as inside agents for the village but thats not as a solid a theory.gtThe titans that we saw inside Wall Rose in chapters  were human beings that were induced into becoming titans somehow. I personally think that the Ape Titan who has shown the same ability Eren had to manipulate titans is the culprit here he seems to be the only logical choice as of yet. The Ape Titan is why the induced titans who were formerly of Connies village were able to move around at night and why they exhibit some strange and abnormal behavior including what appears to be a pregnant titan bizarrely huge eyes and two titans fighting each other.Possibly. I remember how he talked to the titan trying to eat guy whom I forgot to take his D maneuver gear so maybe he normally communicates with the titans otherwise he wouldnt have shouted at the titan unless that was only for the sake of entertainment.,ShingekiNoKyojin,cei99df,6,t5_2we2n

51331,0,t1_cek9gys,Manga Spoilersm I agree on that part she is strong enough as it is. But maybe that would help explain some of where her strength comes from.

I dont really watch anime my only real exposure was the old Toonami days but I follow this show and the manga now religiously and I know a few other people who similarly dont watch anime much but know all about AoT and love it too.

450935,0,t1_cfqw21e,From watching Episode  They say about a shaft probable a piece of the equipment that needs to be changed after major use which i believe trost wasAnime spoilerm Around  minutes into the episode they are getting their DMG checked and you can see that something about the shaft replacementfixing or something had to be reported and documented which gives me the idea that they are issued apon a request and the old ones are either reused or stored or just reforged. so thats why she would need to put forward marcos one she could of easily had both hers and marcos ones reshafted which means she could kill with hers and put marcos forward in the inspection so it appeared if she had been a good girl and not misused her gear as we find out later they need Permission to use in the first place.Which gives me a question how do they practice with there gear to stay top of the line if they need permission to use it,ShingekiNoKyojin,cfripua,1,t5_2we2n

But even then in the outer walls and districts MP presence is much weaker so thats also another factor to consider.

582655,0,t3_20o211,The time frames here dont make sense.The change in royalty could have been relatively recent and it could have been in Grishas lifetime.  Before that humanity was on a hiatus from scouting.  So the royalty change would likely be connected with that.  Or not.The titans were originally created over  years ago.  The conspirators behind it manipulated people with shifting ability into creating the walls.  Afterward the peoples memories were erased.  The official story is that they arrived from another continent and found the walls already constructed but this could trivially be contrived and its likely to be the official version of events that was fabricated.So even if the king made the titans to gain control it was more like the kings grandfather who did that.,ShingekiNoKyojin,cg6i34o,2,t5_2we2n
584829,0,t1_cg6qtgx,I think its fairly rewarding to see the differences in how its done between the anime and the manga. There is something to be said I think for reading the manga in the appropriate order. The manga chooses to prioritize action and intensity in the beginning over characterization whereas the anime chooses to prioritize chronological sense and cast exposition which leads to some different interpretations of some of the characters IMO Annie and Marco but thats just my opinion. If youre simply going to go back and forth between the anime and the corresponding chapters then that would also be interesting I think but in a different way specifically more towards the Stohesscapture arc than anything else. ,ShingekiNoKyojin,cg6qzg5,1,t5_2we2n

869170,0,t1_ch1sm00,An interesting possibility is that Titans are a kind of forced evolutionary fork as seen by Eren and hinted at by ReinerYmirBertolt the Titan bodys natural state is to force the human brain to degenerate into a primal hindbrain that lacks intelligent thought. Only through physical isolation from the Titan body and intense emotionalphysicalmental discipline can a Shifter retain higher intellectual function. Note that the Titan body seems incapable of fully integrated the human brainstem it would seem that the most primal instincts of the brainstem protect it from being assimilated the brainstem lacks conscious will but it can prove incredibly resilient when it comes to lifeordeath and in this case being assimilated is equivalent to death it thus provides a default will to live as a human rather than as purely Titan which would be why Titans are only ALMOST immoral rather than actually immortal.Maybe the Titans are still people but in the same way as a vegetative patient or zombie is they are not capable of higher thought or function but the facilities exist. This seems to be how Ymir reverted to human form. Its actually very interesting to view them as zombies because then all of the socioethical issues dovetail with Titans i.e is it ethical to kill them can they be saved etc. ,ShingekiNoKyojin,ch32v27,1,t5_2we2n

1008591,0,t1_chixftz,Great points. But would you agree that their initial goal was to find the coordinate? Or was that just something they happened to stumble upon after they infiltrated the walls? EDIT Reread your post. So you think they initially were sent there for other reasons. I guess I just wonder why they initially infiltrated the Walls. The way Reiner talked it always seemed like they were sent there with a specific mission. Which made me wonder if they knew there was a coordinate within the walls but they didnt know who it was or they knew a human was a shifter but they didnt know who. Which would make sense because then infiltrating would mean they could wait until this person revealed themselves and then they could take them.The question then is how did they know that there was I. A shifter or II A coordinate before going.Basically I just wonder what their initial mission was why they were sent there. But you are right Eren was clearly their goal after they knew he was a shifter. Hence why Reiner tried to get Eren to go with him after Utgard. Even as a shifter Eren is dangerous. It would be a shifter that is fighting for humanity. So even on that level it makes sense to take him back with them.,ShingekiNoKyojin,chixnle,4,t5_2we2n

When Mikasa said Sasha passed gas it was more akward than funny really plus we finally got to see some Levi action! Now all I need is to hear a few of my glorious Erwins lines.

Haha oh yeah I believe that we all like our ships a little too much. We just dont admit it most of the time. P But...nothing wrong with a good ol fashioned ship I say! Yes He Chose Titans is on AO! I hope you had a chance to find it. The writer deserves far more recognition she is supremely talented.And I do not have Tumblr I still dont know why I should really create an account haha. It is very interesting that you say that though because I am an artist. I just do not post online though this may change in the future. Same thing goes for writing. I am just scared of having my work stolen and passed off as someone elses. An artists worst fear certainly. maybe there is some kindred mindreading happening here where you have an innate sense that I draw? Ok ok thats a stretch but seriously.

Your muscles organs and bones or a Titans arent made of red blood cells theyre made of many different kinds of cells and other structures that arent cellular in nature. All RBCs do is deliver oxygen to existing structures. This is all assuming a Titan body is like an enlarged human body which weve learned is not the case as Titan limbs are incredibly light and Titans lack digestive systems. In that case this explanation makes even less sense and its likely that the mechanisms behind Titan anatomyphysiology especially that of the Shifters are another secret we have yet to learn.

1542078,0,t3_2bdjle,Excellent theory.  I always thought it was strange that Eren has a no memory of his Titan tromps.  How could that be?  Well if he were infact coordinating a Titan that is not esoterically himself then that that would explain it. notalot I very much am in agreement with all except for your assertion that Eren is the only other Beast like Titan when infact Ymirs Titan is without a doubt the most beastlike.  Its shocking there are only two Titantypes that do not have human feet.  MT himself has apelike feet with opposable  thumbs.  Ymirs Titan has batlike feet also with an opposable thumb.  Ymir also has a history of talking to Titans Ex Ilse  Theres so many theories that arise from these bits of knowledge.

After the debacle of that mission Shadis resigned shaved his head and gained that gaunt look then went to instruct trainees after that illfated mission.He also knows Grisha Jaeger personally again often overlooked so no doubt hell be an important character later on.Also this fascinating tidbit from Isayama himself courtesy of the wiki gtAccording to Hajime Isayama he remains single because he does not believe he deserves happiness after so many died under his command.,ShingekiNoKyojin,cksz2pd,10,t5_2we2n

2080899,0,t3_2iotb6,Cant say I didnt see that coming So how many did Grisha eat and why did he do it? Frieda yeah the wife and one of the blackhaired younger children look dead on the floor and he was grabbing the eldest son while Rod was fleeing. I guess its safe to assume that he ate more than one because he said their memories in an early chapter. Another question is does their prayer repel Titans? Assuming that at least one of them has the coordinate potentially they could have done something about the fall of Wall Maria.So Grisha gave Eren the coordinate because well he stole it and I guess they wouldnt have suspected the son to have it since it would mean sacrificing his own life. At least until it became publicly known. Rod Reiss fearing the safety of his only remaining heir takes care of a loose end.Does this mean its unlikely for there to be a cure in the basement? Recent revelations dont paint a pretty picture for Grisha. Theyll probably find syringes filled with the stuff that makes more Titans.

2471366,0,t3_2nut44,Erens dream in the anime differs drastically from the one he had in the original manga. In the manga he simply dreams of a band of survey corps members attacking a titan one of them might be Keith Shadis the instructor and it ends with Mikasa saying goodbye Eren.  In the manga Eren really doesnt dream of anything that he couldnt have experienced previously The Smiling Titan the walls being breached.There might be some foreshadowing going on from the anime production crew about events that the manga still hasnt caught up to the windmill the toys on the table etc. but at the moment Ill take a wild guess and say that they simply wanted to create more suspense with the rapid motions in the anime. ,ShingekiNoKyojin,cmh5rmc,3,t5_2we2n

At the beginning of the manga Isayama wanted to have large trees protecting the towns instead of walls. During the Female Titan arc the forest Annie goes is the one with big trees. In the Clash of Titans arc after Erens and Ymirs kidnapping where do Reiner and Bertholdt go to rest? A forest with big trees. While it may be a coincidence it could also be that RBAs village is on top of trees or inside a dense forest as they know titans arent as dangerous there. Also it could be a way of maintaining the original idea without changing the plot.  ,ShingekiNoKyojin,cmptupu,8,t5_2we2n

Having multiple official translations happens because multiple companies have bought the rights to a specific way to air the show. Crunchyroll for simulpub and digital streaming and Funimation for the more traditional home media release and TV.The Kodansha translation for the manga is the only official one so thats an easy choice but like you said the anime has two official translations Funimation and Crunchyroll.

2794009,0,t1_cnlmrrh,I find it highly unlikely that Rod didnt know Grisha at all. For starters even if he didnt know him personally he was a famous doctor. Then there is the fact that Grisha knew exactly where the Riess family was and found them within a day. Keep in mind this is counting the several hours it takes to get there in the first place not to mention the fact he knew exactly where the trap door led as well. Moreover in the flashbacks we see Grisha in he looks very desperate and is pleading with the Riess family which indicates to me that his attack was not planned before the breaching of wall maria but was instead a response to it. This would mean that he did have actual business to attend to and considering the fact that he had titan serum to inject Eren with that means he either brought it with him for his business or also knew where the Riess family kept the stuff.

Thats pretty funny to think about coordinate users looking like Titans when theyre angry.  Ymir is back! kinda  Holy fuck whod have thought that tiny  blonde could Judo flip her own dad? Historia really takes matters into her own hands here and shows her badass side.  Eren began to get on my nerves before he stepped it up. Does he not remember using the Coordinate? Hes more than capable of taking back the walls especially now that he got his hardening powers. Kenny is being really immature. At first he was trying to overthrow the kings and gain the ultimate power of the Gods. Now hes.... I dont even know. Its all a game to him and thats one villain archetype Ive had enough of. Rod is the most pathetic motherfucker in the series. He let his own brother eat his father then let his daughter eat his brother and now wants his daughter to eat some poor kid that lost his family? At least hes dug himself into a hole he cant get out of quite literally. I dont think Rod will die just yet since hes way too hot to get close to. Hell probably stay there for all eternity causing earthquakes and shit. I guess Rod said he cant become a titan because hes too fucking fat? Theres a whole bunch of antiReligion shit going on. Im really hoping that Isayama doesnt turn the series into one big Religion is bullshit message. gt Historia screaming about God not being realgt All the religious characters being assholes gt Making god a titan power Im honestly worried about Kenny and his squad the latter more so than the former Im really interested in learning about how he assembled his squad and why they follow him so closely.  God. This trainees that spent years together all of them putting their faith in their friend. Its a beautiful scene and it reminds me of why I still read AOT. Mikasa asks Historia if shes OK before even regarding Eren and her being the only one who doesnt give him encouraging words.... I really dont know what to think about that... Annie is back! kinda Regardless I love how Eren never forgets every wrong decision he makes or anyone who died for him.  Then again there really is no wrong decision is there? The science is really fucking confusing now. How does ingesting the spinal fluid initiate a transformation just as quickly as injecting it? Its heavily implied that the blood is where the powers are stored besides the spine so shouldnt it take a couple hours or at least minutes before the chemical actually enters the blood? .........Super Armored Colossal Rogue God titan hype?....WHAT WEVE LEARNED The God titan wanted a world ruled by titans Frida had a dark side due to the Gods will Historia is stronger than we thought Rod is the largest titan weve seen theres an Armored titan serum and Eren eats it.

3099648,0,t3_2vmumw,. New Chapter Spoilersm We learned in the latest chapter that the coordinate holder is influenced by the will of the first king. So even if the coordinate holder wanted to destroy all the titans they couldnt. Because the will of the first kings keeps them from doing that.. I think he was interested in the DMG simply because he has never seen anything like it before and to him it meant that the humans inside the walls had an idea about what is in a mindless titans nape. I also dont think that RB and MT are from the same group if he came in as a distraction to get them out why would he sick the mindless titans on them when they were at the castle? Also Ymir said to Eren that MT is the one that RB are looking for. I think its likely that MT is another coordinate holder and he was the original target of RBA. ,ShingekiNoKyojin,coj9zj3,4,t5_2we2n

Eren even says something like Youve been acting weird since mom died I think it was the end of episode ? Anyway it was also a given that he met his dad after the wall broke because how else would he have gotten the basement key? His dad took it when he left in episode . Edit Actually sorry I think the Youve been acting weird since mom died was only in the manga? or at least it wasnt in episode  lol.

3161618,0,t1_copon3s,RIP Sonny and Bean.I just need Armin to live I can handle Levi dying but little baby Armin has to survive to become the best leader or something. He deserves it. The Grandpa hat scene still gets me. Thats more sad to me than Erens mom which might make me a cold hearted bitch but whatevs.Connie was just too funny to me in the beginning but hes sort of lost steam and is just dragged along. Unfortunately I think hes soon to go. I will be sad.Sashas in the same boat but she has a larger fan base. Only difference to me. Also her cool unique wow so talent skill is pretty...useless. I love her though and will be sad whenif she dies. There will be much rioting. I will be very sad.Im so on the fence with Historia. I change my mind like every four seconds. I dont think shes capable of taking the throne or commanding the people or whatever else they want her to do. She may have finally shaken off the chains of being a shitty side character but I just dont see that much going for her. I think once Hanji has Rod I love that theory I want this to happen and now that Eren has ingested whatever was in the bottle theyll be able to piece together the rest with or without Historia. So long as Eren doesnt revert and has to eat someone all over again. I dont think thats too likely though.If she gets more going for her then I have no objections to her staying.Ymir is like eh. I think people like her more than she deserves because omg actual lesbians or something.She ended up being really devoted or whatever but she seems so wishywashy to me and the whole topic of the shifter village just seems...I dont know. I dont have anything solid to say about Ymir or RBA right now because I simply dont know enough of what impact that village is going to have.Levi is bae and I just need him to live long enough for Armin to be put in charge. Then he can die.Thats one thing Im pretty sure of Armins gonna get some heavy responsibilities.And I said elsewhere that Eren and Mikasa are both not really suited to the role. Sure Mikasas all stoic and cool but shes almost constantly emotionally compromised and Eren cant make up his own damn mind how is he gonna make up someone elses.Erwins a sociopath or something but I mean hes seen some shit and has to walk over the bodies of everyone hes sent to death like every day so I probably would be too.But yeah I think humanity loses anyways.,ShingekiNoKyojin,copp7mm,0,t5_2we2n

The titanshifters would kill off the walled city people so nobody else can kill off the titans who are in fact humanitys population. And they dont want to do that until the Monarchy is gone so they cant just brainwash everyone.

3772536,0,t1_cqma1jg,Its a name Isayama picked himself so whatever the reason was for him picking Yeager over Jaeger or Jger  or literally any other name it doesnt really get more accurate than that.Its true that the manga has some Germanic influence it was the anime and its soundtrack that amped it up to  you cant say that because of that influence the characters names need to be exactly germanic. If the series was very definitely said to be set in Germany and the characters said to be of a German nationality then Jger would be the most accurate choice given the aforementioned.But it isnt its just influenced by the culture among various others. Its like saying that the main characters name in Kill Bill should be an Asian one in order to be more accurate just because the films take influence from Asian culture. Im sure you get the point.Like I said the series has influence from German culture and the whole the hunted becoming the hunters theme is very prevalent in the series and the Japanese absolutely love inserting foreign languages into their lyrics so its pretty fitting for Revo to use German which if Im not entirely mistaken hes used before as well. Not to mention that the composition of the openingending themes is done entirely separate of writing for example. Yeager is also not a German word so theres that.Im sure the note about the lyrics was mainly a joke but keep in mind that Erens last name was Yeager according to Isayama years before that line or song was even written.,ShingekiNoKyojin,cqmap01,1,t5_2we2n

If the writers of the liveaction movie put any actual thought into it they could reverse the whole last halfAsian story thread to be that shes now the last halfnonAsian.

At some point in the series every main character could be considered a villain. Then Id either go SEED which has humans on earth fighting against genetically modified people in space colonies or G Gundam.

4678642,0,t3_3euvou,Oooh this is such a great topic for someone like me who likes to ramble a lot.Character Eren Mikasa Armin Historia and Ymir. Which one of them I like more depends on how much character developmentstory focus theyre currently getting. So at the moment I favor Eren and Historia naturally. I dont think I can adequately rank them among the other characters that I love because I need their story to be concluded first some of them coughMikasacough are simply not developed enough yet. That said due to her character arc that resonated strongly with me for personal reasons Historia is currently my number  in my top five favorite female characters of all time the first three being Sam Carter from Stargate SG Aeryn Sun from Farscape and Olivia Duhnam from Fringe.Moment Damn so many. Every single emotional moment with Ymir and Historia Live your life with your head held high sniff Eren protecting Mikasa from the Smiling Titan in chapter  Eren seeing the excited kids and breaking down crying after the disastrous th expedition Mikasas eyes filling with tears as Eren wraps his scarf around her Armin coming to a realization that his friends never saw him as a burden and giving the Big Damn Hero speech moments later... But if I had to choose the one moment that made me understand how much I care about these characters that would be Mikasa and Armin embracing Eren after he first emerged from his Titan. Its probably my second alltime favorite moment in any media after a scene from Buffy the Vampire Slayer Becoming Pt  the fight with Angelus in which he taunts Buffy and she responds in a most awesome way and then she grabs the sword hes pointing at her and shoves it into his face. Nothing has topped that so far!. Chapter Chapter   just utter perfection. This chapter is the one that solidifed my ErenMikasa and YmirHistoria OTP feels  but thats far from being the only reason why this chapter is amazing. Its such a perfect blend of plot emotions and character growth! I cant compare it to anything else as SnK is the first and only manga Ive ever read. DuoTrioGroup The Shiganshina Trio has the potential to be my alltime favorite group of characters but Im dissapointed with the way theyve been written lately no emotional bonding moments little interaction the latest reunion with Eren being very lackluster etc. So at the moment theyre number  number  is the Mass Effect squad. OTP ErenMikasa and YmirHistoria. Again I need to see how their story will conclude before I can rank them but both pairings are kind of special to me in that EM is the first het pairing Ive shipped in a very long time and YH is one of the very few canon pairings that Ive felt strongly about. My favorite canon pairings are ShepardGarrus from Mass Effect well not quite canon but they are a possibility unlike say ShepardJoker so... potential canon? and JohnAeryn from Farscape and YH is so far number three. The number of noncanon pairings Ive shipped is huge so ranking EM among them would be quite difficult. ,ShingekiNoKyojin,ctkahbd,4,t5_2we2n

5081400,0,t3_3kldfi,They knew the coordinate had to be a shifter and they seemed to know or later came to the conclusion that it would be in some way connected to the wallists. When they saw Eren transform he became a candidate they probably didnt expect to encounter the shifter until they reached Sina which is likely why they were surprised. When Annie found out Krista was connected to the wallists she became a candidate its unclear when Annie obtained this information I think it was probably after she joined the MPs. Erwin  knows RB know the Survey is looking for whats in the basement since he for some reason told them during his pitch speech that there was a huge secret in the basement. They also know something massive because when Ymir is revealed to have Titan power Reiner says something like So she knew humanities greatest secret.  This could be whats in the basement if it is its unclear if they care if people find out about it. If they dont they can simply grab Eren in the next chapter and leave without having to fight.The inferences characters have made so far have usually been accurate and ages ago Hange said something like  Its obvious that RBA had allies within these wall. If they do have as of yet unseen allies they could simply be telling them what the Survey is up to so theyd know about the hardening. Also since no one knows MT is with RB or what he looks like as a Human he could have gone to RoseSina and looked around during the last  months seen the guillotine and found out about the hardening.As far as Grisha goes its hard to say. The only concrete thing both groups have in common is that they wanted the coordinate and would do anything to obtain it.tldr They know tons.,ShingekiNoKyojin,cuyi2by,20,t5_2we2n

5260223,0,t3_3ms0ud,Sorry wall of text incoming. I have two theories about this. If we go with theory number one all Titans are trapped in a hallucination like what Eren went through in Trost. They are simply reliving scenes from their human lives over and over again. They may have some awareness that something is amiss but most probably dont give it much thoughtnot that they can really. Its part of the curseinfectionwhatever. Following Trost Dream theory Ymirs endless nightmare had nothing to do with being a mindless Titan and everything to do with her past life. She describes it as horrible with people hating her just for being born.  Her nightmare was therefore repeating that hellish life endlessly without hope of escape. I cant imagine someone with her strong will wouldnt know on some level that she was hallucinating which must have made it worse. The second I really hope isnt true and that is simply that all Titans are like victims of lockedin syndromeyou are aware but are helpless to do anything. In this case that means they would be perfectly aware of eating and killing people and wandering around in huge deformed bodies all the time without end. I imagine that a large amount of them would have gone mad after a few centuries. Unfortunately this theory is supported as the OP mentioned by Connies mother since she seemed aware that he was nearby and she certainly made no move to attack anyone and actually seemed quite docile. Even without usable limbs a normal Titan would have tried to bite or something. On a completely unrelated note did anyone notice in chapter  they waited until Connie left to mention the the possible mental state of Titans? I thought that was pretty tactful though it could have been that Eren just wasnt thinking about it then.,ShingekiNoKyojin,cvk1viz,2,t5_2we2n

And there wast much chance for her being able to do that within the walls as he was constantly around Levis squad and wasnt exactly with the original group. And escaping with a kidnapped Eren would prove difficult too unlike outside the walls.So she needed to be part of the MP to further investigate the internal politics  execute their plan to capture Eren.

She was so badass and I thought it showed Eren wasnt the only thing she cared about. Similarly her reaction to Erens death by deciding to move forward even when the other cadets were scared shitless was amazing and unexpected.Then for the next  chapters her personality reverts to Ereeeeen! Its sad that the most development Mikasas gotten was in the very first arc. Im really surprised Isayama has said that he doesnt know what to do with her character. The best thing for Mikasa might ironically for her to be separated from Eren and have to carry on without relying on the thought of him being there. That or having her develop meaningful relationships with other characters. I think her and Levi becoming studentandmentor wouldnt be too farfetched and would be great for both characters but at this point I dont have high expectations.,ShingekiNoKyojin,cybvxqx,18,t5_2we2n

Annies dad knowing martial arts would explain why he kicked Reiners ass so easily. What I dont get is how they attacked at the perfect time. Had the coordinate owner been a little older their titan abilities would have been enough to stop Erens dad kill every single enemy titan shifter and rewrite the memories of the fight and wall breach from every citizen.

6497018,0,t1_czqxoj5,My rebuttal goes back to the fact that RBA were children when they were given the mission and children when they carried out the first phase of it. Reading any sort of material on child soldiers and the way theyre indoctrinated and trained shows the enormity of the psychological damage all of them likely have. Your comparison to the Nazis misses this point. Most child soldiers are psychologically impaired to the point that their responsibility for their actions is not considered equivalent to the responsibility a rational adult committing the same actions would be held to.Theres also a difference between the likes of Himmler Goring Hoss Goeth Eichmann and others with your average Hitler Youth or young Volkssturm draftee. The former chose to adopt the ideology and carry it out while the latter were indoctrinated into it and they had little say in the matter. Culpability does not equal responsibility. RBA are culpable to be sure but are they actually responsible beyond a superficial level? If they had refused to carry out the attacks it seems pretty clear that Zeke would have just found someone else to do it.

I still dont think he would change something that worked well and didnt leave the viewers befuddled we wont know until the nd season as this is where it will explain the First Kings ability to control holders of the Coordinate.gtIf hes willing to make one modification to the story via the anime it stands to reason that he may have proposed more.The Fire Titan is a huge change as oppose to Annies reaction. It change how the climax to the Female Titan arc ended. Isayama original version of what happened in Stohess sounded much more concrete than what happened in the anime so it doesnt make sense if he actually suggested these changes as it would be all interconnected regardless how much he wanted to be changed in the final battle with Annie.gt Its also common for anime teams to consult closely with the manga writer when it comes to adaption.An example against this is Fullmetal Alchemist. The first series varied much from the manga and it stands on its own. Your other point on writers regret and the story being changed may be valid with this too except they ended up making another series FMA Brotherhood that aimed at being  canon to the manga. All the problems I had with the first series were almost nonexistent in the second the source material was better IMO. With the first series the anime director didnt seem to be consulting with the manga writer as much as Isayama wanted to change Annies reaction to being cornered from a smile to laughter.Also Isayama seems like he would be too busy to be consulting closely with the anime team as he was and is still working on the manga.gtYou are absolutely right that it is out of character for Eren to go so completely out of control against annie. That is actually the whole point of my topic. Im proposing that it was the First King and not Eren that was in control at the time.All of the coordinates before Eren were shown as peaceful and nonviolent Uri made the person trying kill him into his servant instead of killing him Ch  and Frieda was also shown to be a calm except when she berated Historia for crossing the boundary on the farm most likely because she was a bastard child to the Reiss family and King disliked Historia for it. The king has nearly full control over them when they had the power yet was never violent to anyone who opposed him. It would be out of character for the First King to make Eren act so violently and vicious. gt Not sure why you think otherwise. It wouldnt make much sense for them not to its their story after all.They dont have to be respectful to source material since they have the rights to adapt the series. Working with the manga writer would more courteous and not something the would be logical to do with making a series. Most producers have the same thing on their mind when making something money. Some focus on being able to fulfill their bottom line and others try milk something for all its worth. I feel that what was the Production IG WIT Studios parent company is doing with Attack on Titan franchise producing the anime then the  numerous OVAs making compilation movies then producing a parody series and making another series that very similar to Attack on Titan Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress Monsters that eat people and try to break through walls while it takes place in a fantasy world and has an angry main protagonist.gtThe final credits scene of the second compilation movie already retconned the ending of the original anime showing that Hange and the gang saw the Wall Titan immediately after Annies defeat.gtI wasnt suggesting that Chapter  is the point where the anime was going to endOkIn the end this is mostly my opinion on the matter with my own speculations as information in most of these areas is unavailable If you happen to have sources that so can you please provide a linkEdit I am against the concept of the Fire Titan being canon.,ShingekiNoKyojin,d02ezhe,2,t5_2we2n

6651352,0,t1_d07akal,What does?Attack on Titan is a story of humanity on the verge of total annihilation against an incomprehensible foe that is so vastly more powerful than us that all we can do is cower behind a set of flimsy walls. There is no evident solution to the crisis and our most badass soldiers still die in droves when confronting the Titans directly.In Claymore humanity is not at any risk of annihilation. Yoma are a problem but not some unstoppable scourge thats driven us into a corner. They are about as much a problem as serial killers in real life a major local threat but not a threat to all civilization as we know it. The more powerful Awakened Ones are kept in check by the Claymores and the Abyssals dont really care about humanity they prefer to lord it over their own domains and generally just want to preserve the status quo.Not to mention that the whole story takes place on an island all we know about the outside world is that theres a huge war going on. And that suggests that humanity is still putting up a fight. Contrast that with AoT where as far as any of us know Titans have completely conquered the world. ,ShingekiNoKyojin,d07b2lg,3,t5_2we2n

So its either gonna be summer season or fall season. The most unlikely of which is the summer season because when Attack on Titan is as populat as it is it would already have been announced. While on the other hand if it aired in the summer they could finish airing it within . But nobody knows my friend we are all waiting here.

6850947,0,t3_49lrws,The first season is of the first  chapters cant remember the exact number but its around that time. So far there are  chapters the newest one having been released about an hour ago. Its a very consistent schedule of releases on a monthly basis. As far as Im aware of Isayama has never taken a hiatus. I dont think its likely that there will be a hiatus taken any time soon especially considering how popular the series is. Though sometimes this month long wait is a bit of a drag when there isnt any action happening its a good trade off for quality content.The manga carries on pretty strongly especially in the arc following where the anime left off at. You get a good amount of action in that arc along with several twists and new mysteries setting up for the following arcs. The atmosphere of the series is pretty consistent to me but it does shift away from action oriented scenes for an arc.

7894054,0,t1_d43cbzq,gt I dont want to take away from Armins plan as it was pretty clever and very heroic but Bert surely know his muscles seize up why wouldnt he take precaution and just block his nape? He was staring at both Eren and Armin. From what I can remember  he doesnt know anything about Erens hardening ability and even if he did he doesnt know the extent Eren is capable of. Hes probably more concerned about his coordinate power and from the looks of it the time in between everything this chapter was small barely minutes most likely. He sees everything around him and never takes into account that Eren can create duplicates because why would he? He even sees him trip and lose his emotions like he remembers.gt So there isnt much point having them escape since they were so utterly defeated this time there is no reason they wont be next timeThe element of surprise is gone and that was the only thing that won the battle. Even the podcast brought up that the rematch between MT and Levi wont be the same because now MT knows exactly what Levi can do. Bert knows Armins gone and how Eren has progressed into a much more competent soldier. Reiner wouldve won if it werent for Hange appearing out of nowhere. The only thing they dont know still is that Levi has the serum.gt I thought Bert seemed so evil this Chapter that all the work done to humanize him was basically undone to the point Bert was nowhere near the evil everyones saying. He saw his old freind come at him he pushed him back and realizing hes not falling he decided he should kill him quickly instead of having him burn slowly. His words showed nothing but regret.gt To be honest... I wished they all wouldve been blown away too...Hes saying he doesnt want to deal with killing them that he wishes it wasnt up to him.gt I want you to show me... What will you leave behind in your final moments?Whats Armin and Eren going to do? Im going to have to kill them please dont make this easy for me . As if he doesnt want to kill them and doesnt want to not be punished for killing them.Look at his eyes!!! Is he happy Armins burning? Hes very clearly saddened and distruaght.gt If its going to end like this for you... Then Ill put you out of youre miseryIm not gonna let you sit there burning Ill make this quick for you Armin. Bert is not being evil hes trying to suppress his feelings hes trying to get this over with as fast as possible but also wants to be punished for his actions. Hes being contradictory like multiple characters do in this series and honestly every human is contradictory in some way.gt RB shouldnt have talked about their Titan form near MarcoThis was a fuck up. gt Annie shouldnt have taught Eren how to fightAnd Reiner shouldnt have been a nice guy with everyone but their human Annie sympathized with Eren and decided she at least didnt want him to be defenseless like everyone else. How was she supposed to know hed grow  meters and beat the shit outta them?gt Annie should have killed ArminShe saw her old acquaintance and smiled she knew his life was in her hands and she finally had a choice. She decided that he shouldnt have to die enough people already have. Again how was she supposed to know hed get far enough to help Eren take down Bert?gtAnnie should have hardened her arm when she punched LeviShe was tired from her multiple fights and transformations and hardening has been shown to drain the shifters. Even if she hardened which she does later Levi was so fast she couldnt do it in time.gtAnnie should have captured Eren after she battered him in Stohess them hardened all of her fingers so Mikasa couldnt cut them offThere were also multiple SC and MP members chasing after her she had just gotten Eren off her back and was likely scared that Levi or someone else would catch her. She didnt exactly have time to capture him or think. Also she did harden her fingers not matter where she hardened Mikasa wouldve likely cut right below it.gtBert should have made a full Titan during the wall battleIt was a sudden fight and he felt it was better to focus on defense and endurance rather than offence.gtReiner should have done everything better during their escapeDont really know what you mean can you elaborate?gtMT should have got intel inside the walls no one had seen his human form at that pointThis was Bert and Ernies mission. He would stick out like a sore thumb when everyones looking for someone suspicious.gtReiner should have called in Bert immediately after he lost his eyesAgain not sure what you mean but I think this was also a fuck up.gtMT should be more aware of his surroundingsLevi wouldve beat him even if he was aware he was more concerned with Erwin and his charge which anyone would be.gtBert shouldnt have got too cockyHe didnt he kept his eyes on both Eren and Armin from his height he couldnt tell that was a decoy or even know Eren can do that right after tripping off the wall like a retard without taking attention off Armin.,ShingekiNoKyojin,d43d60f,5,t5_2we2n
7894374,0,t3_4nemiw,There was a almost theory that Ive seen recently that I kind of liked. It was the idea that SnK is based a lot around unfulfilled dreams and characters lives being completely meaningless. Thats the bleakness of SnK. An entire lifetime of hopes and goals and dreams a future of happiness and loved ones can end in an instant with no time to mourn. In essence it doesnt matter that Bertholdt Reiner and Annie were all characterized with evolving personalities and we could see where we hoped theyd end up because theyre all going to die someday and its probably gonna be messy.A fresh out of the oven example of this is what literally just happened to Armin. People with even basic knowledge and experience with character development in literature could see the path that Armin was heading on. He was going to become the cold calculating strategist that would lose all empathy and think of human lives as numbers to win a fight. We could see it. We could ALL see it. We wanted Armin to finally experience the wonders of the book hed been reading since he was a kid. We wanted Armin to carry on with the wishes of those to see the outside world. But hes dead. Hes dead and the person that once inhabited his charred corpse is gone with him. All of his dreams were for nothing. He never got to fulfill any of it. THAT is the bleakness of SnK.Marco wanted to go to war with his buddies.Hannes wanted to properly atone for his mistakes on the day of the breach.Petra couldve lived a happy life with Levi.Marlo wanted a comfortable life in the city with his notgirlfriend.Gelgar wanted his damn wine.Nick wanted stability and peace.Grisha wanted... Things.Carla wanted a safe life with her and her children.Honestly Im thinking that Petra and Armin are excellent case studies for Isayamas writing style. Both were immediately beloved characters that met horrible fates with unfulfilled dreams and people close to them that miss them more than anything.But going back to the topic at hand be prepared honestly for Reiner and Bertholdt and potentially Annie to die unexpectedly without their character arc concluding in a satisfying way. Very rarely does death only come after youve finished everything you always wanted to in life especially when the stakes are this high.So yes maybe everything is ruined. But its ruined for a good reason.,ShingekiNoKyojin,d43egih,3,t5_2we2n

8088916,1,t1_d4p8gd3,Yes it is antiIslam. For a reason. It has plenty of sources to the studies and statistics. You are trying to write it off as just another antiIslam site without even reading it and realizing how disgusting Islam is.Its far easier to act as if critics of Islam have a problem with Muslims as people than it is to accept the uncomfortable truth that Islam is different.And yes they do.   Links to the studies right there in the overview.But fine. If you want to believe that most muslims are good people thats on you. But let me just say that you are defending people who would never ever defend you and likely would kill you given the chance.No Islamic terrorism is literally following the Quran. ISIS is extremely great at following Islam. They are killing nonbelievers suicide bombing and raping women and children just as their religion intended.It doesnt matter if moderate muslims believe in different things that still does not change the fucking fact that they ALL believe in the same god who COMMANDS they kill and rape for their god. That is an irrefutable undisputable fact. You cannot deny that.Even if only  approve of ISIS which by the way is actually more around  thats still around  fucking million people. Take the actual number and you have around  million.  million ISIS supporters. Thats almost as much as how many people in the US there are. So imagine that every single person you pass by approves of ISIS. Does that sound fucking fun to you? Does that sound like a religion of peace? Are you still going to try and push the agenda of accepting muslims and their violent dangerous oppressive beliefs?Not all muslims? Yes all muslims. Islam is not a religion of peace muslims are not people of peace and you should not be falling for their bullshit. Even merely associating with muslims is enough for me to hate someone because quite frankly that is an act of violence against human rights. Youre associating yourself with someone who believes in some magic man in the sky whos ideal follower is a pedophile mass murderer. Fucking please. It is completely logical to oppose and hate muslims.Reminder that this is the shit they genuinely believegtQuran   And take in your hand a green branch and beat her with it and do not break your oath...  Allah telling Job to beat his wife Tafsir.gtBukhari   A woman came to Muhammad and begged her to stop her husband from beating her. Her skin was bruised so badly that it is described as being greener than the green veil she was wearing. Muhammad did not admonish her husband but instead ordered her to return to him and submit to his sexual desires.gtMuslim   Muhammads fathersinlaw Abu Bakr and Umar amused him by slapping his wives Aisha and Hafsa for annoying him. According to the Hadith the prophet of Islam laughed upon hearing this.gtIbn IshaqHisham   Requires that a married woman be put in a separate room and beaten lightly if she act in a sexual manner toward others. According to the Hadith this can be for an offense as petty as merely being alone with a man to whom she is not related.gtQuran   The punishment of those who wage war against Allah and His messenger and strive to make mischief in the land is only this that they should be murdered or crucified or their hands and their feet should be cut off on opposite sides... Quran   Remember thy Lord inspired the angels with the message I am with you give firmness to the Believers I will instill terror into the hearts of the Unbelievers smite ye above their necks and smite all their fingertips off them.gtQuran   The woman and the man guilty of adultery or fornication flog each of them with a hundred stripes Let not compassion move you. Not only is physical torture prescribed as punishment for moral crime between consenting adults but believers are told to suppress their natural urge for human compassion.Just a very small handful of the literal hundreds of verses like this. There is literally no alternative meaning to these it is exactly as it fucking says. I know you didnt even bother reading the website because if you did you would have not said this proIslam garbage to me.

8138756,0,t1_d4ugj4x,gt Ymir is a lot similar to Historia than many may realize. She also believed or used to believe at least that the world would have been better off without her and what little weve gotten of her backstory suggests she was suicidal like Historia as well going so far as to die for the happiness of a great many people.  Ymir goes out of her way to help people in her own way she even helps two people that are more or less her enemies simply because she felt bad for them Ymirs quite determined to rectify her past mentality which she perceived to be a mistaken way of life  as shown in the manga  Thats the reason she tried to motivate Historia to do the same in the first place. Yes! She did help some like Sasha overcoming their issues by giving them therapy sessions or helpful suggestions not risking her neck. As to her rescuing RampB my interpretation  is that theres a riskversusreward ulterior motive behind it  Quite cunning of her i may add. As far as i know Historia still stands out like a sore thumb as the only person who can drive Ymir to be completely selfless and behave irrationally  like revealing her titan form and potentially throw away her second life.gt In love with History or not I dont think Ymirs actions would have been all that different from what we actually got. Yet most more or less accept shes in love.Considering the points made above i seriously doubt that! Now you know why me as well as possibly most people more or less accept shes in love its pretty much the only legit explanation for Ymirs special treatment of Historia.gtIn that moment Historias intentions werent based on her suicidal tendencies she wanted to keep her promise. From Utgarde till the end of chapter  Historias goals and intentions are fueled by what she wanted most being with Ymir and living for their own sakes.Just as you said its as clear as day that love fuels Historias goals and intentions as well as her actions from that point on. Though what kind of loves still remained to be seen. The way i saw it shed had done the same for Frieda under similar circumstances.gtI dont really see how Im being patronizing to you but if it appears that am then sorry Im not trying to be.

8199270,0,t3_4rmu9w,I dont mind flashbacks but I do get annoyed at cliffhangers. Although I really wasnt expecting them to decide in this chapter. We still needed to see where a lot of things were  before they can decide. For example what happened to Reiner and getting blown out of his titan what happened to Levi Zeke and Erwin. We needed this chapter to show what happened to everyone. Sure it seems like dragging but theyre really just taking time to show everything and not rushing things. It makes us get ready for the next because the next one for sure will show us who will finally get the serum. As for me sure I dont like cliffhangers but I do want to enjoy the series while it lasts hoping they wouldnt rush anything. I want to get as much as I can out of it. As bad as I want to see Annie back I know she wont for a long while but thats fine. The more I wait for Annies comeback the more satisfying it will be seeing her again after all these years.

Notice how in a later part while angry and weak he angrily thinks of tearing apart his enemy and eating them. Eren here needs to control a entire titan while also keeping his emotions in check while it also requires a great deal of strength to use.

Youre right somewhat about them playing soldier when she saved Connie but not for Jean she risked her life trying to save Jean which Reiner has done for Connie but I was just saying that she has saved them and has let them into her emotions.And yes most of the things I said could be applied to Reiner and Bert but I never said they werent? I like Reiner and Bert as well they are my favorite characters it seems like you like Bert you were constantly comparing him to Annie. I never even said anything about Bert! My point was to explain why she isnt just someone who you see as a psychotic murderer. And while you can say that Annie never apologized like Bert did when did she have the chance? Before she could they were already suspecting her so it was obviously too late. Not like she would though her character is supposed to be cold and isnt supposed to show emotion.   Also in Annies laugh Isayama said he wanted the laugh to represent guilt lonliness and fear. Its her laughing from the burden of putting on a cold face to become distant from everyone and that the laugh is the real Annie.gtThis compassionate side of him doesnt excuse all the shitty things he did.That can be said about all three of them and if youre only applying that to Annie youre obviously bias.And why do you keep comparing her to Bert? I havent nor will I take away anything from Bert or Reiners situation.

He has made great decisions and is incredibly bright but we have also seen that he has the tendency to get nervous under pressure understandably of course but Erwin had the ability to rule with a constantly cool head.. Plus he wouldnt be the new commander either way. Thats Hanges role so it was a choice between the commander and a soldier as opposed to Current Commander and second in line... So in both rank and experience there was just cause to bring back Erwin.I do understand why Levi chose in the end not to though but that was an emotional decision not a practical one.  ,ShingekiNoKyojin,d6k82d9,6,t5_2we2n

When Jean says that he wants to join the MPs Eren and the audience see that as lazy and cowardly. Once we see just how brutal fighting that Titans really is we see that Jean was at least partially in the right for his choice. But throughout Trost we see that Jean is capable of being a good leader as noted by Marco and hes capable of doing the right thing over what he really wants to do by how he honors Marcos memory by joining the SC. As the series progresses he becomes a bit more mature and less of an asshole and his whole reluctance to take human lives adds a surprising new layer onto his character.,ShingekiNoKyojin,d6vxuxq,13,t5_2we2n

Youre just ignoring everything I say and coming up with really shitty contradictory arguments.gtI just pointed out historical examples of Walls that never fellIts indeed my bad there. Thats not my only comparison. Sill its the most obvious hole in your logic  You really expect something manmade even with our current technology level to stand the test of time Forever?? Even Nature landscape forests mountains sea... and the freaking Universe Planets galaxies... change and weathering over time hence the saying Time the devourer of all thingsAlso All of my other comparison Dark Ages The Cold Wars.. make sense  Exploration helps to boost scientific progress and society in turn to develop past the discomfort and restriction of the Dark Ages and nearly nobody would ever be content with  living under that kind of threat  Nuclear WarTitans  hanging over their heads all the time if there are other available options or solutions they can try. ampnbspgtI also cant believe you said humankind can achieve the impossible and also say its impossible to make things permanently safe.gtHumanity can achieve the impossible but its impossible to make an area permanently safe. It is possible and more logical to fight against otherwise impossible odds. And this seals the dealAnd i cant believe youre simply ignoringbrushing off my previous plausible points being made that dont fit with whatever idea youre behind!? Here allow me to remind yougtIn comparison to that according to nature law making something permanently safe is a fool errand  especially with their current technology level  everything withers and die one day.You are aware of the fact that the government assassinates people who might actually facilitate humanitys technological evolution and give them a solid chance to fight the Titans? And without real data and incentive exploration provide good luck with any scientific progress. No wonder the walled civilization remains stagnant for a whole century with the only real scientific breakthrough coming from the Legion DMG supreme horses most of their knowledge about the titans and their weakness paid with its own membersbloodYup! Seal the deal indeed!!ampnbspgtI also just pointed out that SC exists despite the majority of people not wanting them to. You said doesnt matter what the people want because its the government money and permission that allows them to exist. So who are they beholden to?Of course for the government! You think who granted them permission and the fund needed to organize expedition outside the wall in the first place? And the government has every reason to keep the SL running up until the Uprising Arc at least as stated before.Additionally the Legion operate with an altruistic goal finding a way to a better future free from the titans for the people paid with their own blood. Therefore some part of the populace still espouse their cause and are willing to offer themselves to the SL in service of that cause.  gtThey dont have to follow the governments orders though since theyre volunteers but also paid soldiers.They follow the governments order to frequently make organized expeditions outside the wall so as to justify their existence despite the heavy death toll on their part everytime doing so.The higherups entrusted them with the mission to find more knowledge about the titanss origin as well as the outside world with the facade hope to discover a method to eliminate the titans threat outside the wall for humanitys benefit not just the crown as demonstrated by their oath For the Glory Freedom amp Progress of Humanity. And the SL has always acted true to the tasks they have been given or the principle on which the organization is founded  make Mankinds longterm existence in addition to its freedom amp progress  a priority in all cases including the Uprising arcgtIts okay for Erwin get in the monarchys way its not okay for Rod to get in the SCs way even though theres no proof either of them is right. Whatever majority of the SnK fandom feels this way anywayBecause with the knowledge we have been given the populace and readers alike have much more good reason to give Erwin and the Legion the benefit of the doubt than Rod. And its the FKampcos fault for withholding important information from everyone else and blow their major opportunity provided by Erwin himself to prove their integrity.And as for Rods plan it was also immediately apparent that his plan was doomed to fail from the very beginning. All it took was a single question from Historia to break the masquerade why didnt the previous bearers of the Coordinate ever liberate humanity from the Titans? And to his credit Rod gave what could only have been an honest answer that the will of the First King suppressed the willingness of his hosts to use their power to liberate humanity.It means they FKampco are in other words the most immediate threat to humanitys longterm survival liberty and prosperitySo  Erwin  Rod. Resurrecting the First King will simply keep humanity trapped in the same gilded cage weve been stuck in for the last century.ampnbspgtI give up. You cant see the hypocrisy in all your arguments.

8841894,0,t3_51axu9,The only part the Titan marks are suppose to show up is in Ep. When he first emerges in Ep his face is clean in the Manga and again in episode  Just the burns like you mentioned The only exception being after fighting the female titan the lines are not as prominent here in the manga as they are now which is probably why they didnt bother emphasizing them in the Anime just yet.The titanisation marks are a sign of overtaxing arent they? At that point in the Manga and Anime he hadnt really pushed himself very much so its likely itll play an important visual factor to show his exhaustion. Itd make no sense to leave it out.

8880409,0,t1_d7f9m63,Yes! We must fill the conspiracy void that the basement reveal will bring!In defense of the supervirus maybe it does not effect shifters and so the warriors were fine. I would say that the virus might attract titans but the coordinate power seems to contradict that.The supersoldier theory does have holes but it could be a thing similar to the story of Dune. Very mild spoilers ahead. The Emperor has super soldiers that he trains on a prison planet with a really harsh environment. After they get to a certain point he takes them off and they tell them they were in an elaborate training program. They are the special ones and they survived. They are then lavished and given rank and pride. Basically turned into loyal servants through elaborate propaganda.Perhaps they did that in the past but the AoT city is a no longer used training facility. They are not pulling their trained superhumans out and so things have gotten stagnant. Perhaps the better trained people made better titans. Perhaps they had the titans fight each other to breed stronger better titans whose spines were then used to transfer their power onto even better trained fighters in further generations.Bertholt and Reiner show an obvious hatred for the people in the wall and so that kind of goes against the reasoning that they wanted to save the people. But what if all the people in the walls were the ones using the super soldiers and the villages were the ones forced into battle royal? Then later on people started feeling bad for them or in other ways were just acting up and so they had their memories wiped. Or perhaps the general populace were only needed for agricultural purposes.Regardless I think youre right that Bert and Reiner think they are doing the right thing. They may have be thinking that as a coping mechanism to deal with what theyve done under orders but I think that is clear.,ShingekiNoKyojin,d7fatdy,2,t5_2we2n

8932067,0,t3_52m1gf,. A new culture created after the complete destruction of the previous to the point where most people forgot the ocean exists would definitely choose a new starting date for their calendar.  is arbitrary although why they didnt choose the date they started hiding behind the wall sis beyond me. Maybe there were  years of retreat before the walls sprang up?. If the vast majority of humanity is dead so is everyone who knows of certain technology how to make them how to repair them. All of the necessary equipment is outside the walls anyway. Lack of proper machinery would lead people to use cannonballs easy to make just make a sphere of iron rather than artillery requires interlocking parts complicated mechanisms and a lot more gunpowder. . If its in Germany land farther North wouldnt really be as cold as they say it is. I think that its actually flipped with Switzerland being included inside. The cold harsh north is the highlands near the Alps which have long been left as cattle grazing lands instead of farmland. As for the direction flip if all they have to navigate is compasses they wouldnt really notice a gravitational switch happens every k years or so enough to compensate.

8969609,0,t3_534vkj,I like DoA. I even like the Xtreme series. Nothing wrong with a bit of harmless fanservice. I could see it working but it would have to include male characters as well as the girls a mistake the DoA Xtreme series continually refuses to rectify. And definitely be based in the Junior High universe a field trip to a beach perhaps. You could have character traits like Mikasa sucking badly unless Eren is on her team in which case shes the best character in the game. Or Hange using her pet titans. Using the actual Attack on Titan universe characters would just be much too far removed from the reality of the thing though so I would say no to that. It would just be weird and too OOC.Another problem is that the latest Xtreme game is kind of bad dont get me wrong I enjoy it but its far less a game than  was and they left out a ton of characters. I dont think its something theyre going to be doing much more of. Honestly I think the Attack on Titan stuff is very much being left to the Koei part of KoeiTecmo.Attack on Titan characters appearing in an actual DoA game would be fine. Theres precedent for guest stars. Though generally there would only be one character and most likely it would be Levi. ,ShingekiNoKyojin,d7q0eok,3,t5_2we2n

9021769,0,t3_53rhnt,urivaere  You should include a TLDR just in case.Now if the Shifters intention is to turn the Titans back into functional human beings this makes me think Was the Reiss family punishing both the humans within the walls and the humans confined inside the Titans? What did humanity do for the First King to consider them sinful and completely deserving of their punishment? Does the punishment extend to the Titans too if thats the case? It seems to me that Rod Reiss might have been either lying to Historia or he simply did not know because he had refused the Will of the First King and everything he knew he gathered as a witness and not a participant. You see Grisha Yaegers attack on the Reiss family implied that the Coordinate can indeed be used correctly by Shifters outside of House Reiss. Furthermore given that your theory is true Zekes Shifters are attempting to gain the Coordinate under the same circumstances which brings me to this  Was House Reiss purpose to hinder the Coordinate? Is something bad going to happen when a capable being attains the Coordinate? This being Attack on Titan I wouldnt be surprised if thats the case...Edit A couple of things that I found curious are that first Zeke is still under the impression that the Reiss family is still on power and second that hes enjoying massacring human beings a little too much for his motives to be altruistic.,ShingekiNoKyojin,d7w9x92,1,t5_2we2n

Using his medical experience he will create a cure to stop people from turning into Titans and to find the progenitor. After a period of time marriage and a son. He finds out who has the progenitor and seeks him out. Its a bit strange this all happens during the big attack on the wall at the start of the series. So it was all planned out by the Mare government. After Grisha attacks the Reiss family and takes the progenitor power he takes up the memories of the very first progenitor. He saw why the th king fled. He knew why Ymir called upon the power of the Titans. His entire life of what he was told and what he wanted to believed was washed away to reveal a whole new truth. Knowing how he is hunted for this crime and the knowledge he now possessed he uses his son to hide the progenitor power away from Mare and from anyone else. For all humanity to survive it had to be done. The th king didnt flee to the island out of cowardness. He was building an army. An army of innocent ignorant soldiers that once the time was right they would burst out of the walls and invade the continent. But their plans were rushed with the invasion and Grisha knew he had to act fast to get the progenitor before the powers were used to turn  million citizens into Titans. Then there is the Ackerman bloodline. The reason the king oppressed this race  was due to the inability to brainwash them thus potentially revealing this plan to the citizens. Who would want to go mindless giant zombie mode anyways? Even if for a cause? This is why the Titans in the wall are inward and not standing outward. They were blocking the first of the wall before wiping out them memories. Also taking in the new piece of lore. I need to go back and find out what Zeke meant by Geishas sin. What did Grisha do that was a sin? Cured many people in the wall of the Titan effect? Or taken the progenitor power and hiding it away in Eren? ,ShingekiNoKyojin,d8keeps,1,t5_2we2n

It makes sense that upon founding the walled society the royal family that is the bloodline that can use the coordinate ability to its fullest renamed themselves from Fritz to Reiss and put another royal family in its place.This way when the Mare came to the walled society looking to acquire the coordinate or Progenitor Titan abilities they would target the wrong royal family.It seems likely that the Eldians have some ugly history too. Judging from the historical depictions Eldia made progress on the backs of titans  literally. Bridges are made using titans to hold it up. Walls are made from titans hardening ability. Each and every titan is a human being. So maybe the Eldian conquest of the continent was for raw titan materials. They forcibly bred with other people to produce more Eldian children who could become subject of Ymir ie. titans to use as building materials.

She was Annies only friend and the bit where Annie apologises to her headless corpse is so so sad. I think Armin was an asshole back then he didnt even fucking try to help her! Several people died while he sat there thinking about it. And he didnt even try or feel guilty afterwards. All he cared about was Eren and thinking back all he thought was I wish I died TOO TOO?! How about instead? I know it turned out for the best cos Eren discovered his power and saved a bunch of the th by taking out the ones attackkng the supply station but man fucking Armin he should think about Mina every damn day.Oh! And Petra! God how could I forgot?! Petra was easily my favourite SC member and her and Eren had an awesome relationship I wanted her to be his mentor and show him the ins and outs of the SL and maybe have some PetraMikasa arguments about him. Instead Annie fucking STOMPS her and then... AND THEN. Then Levi fucking tosses her body out of the cart and gets stomped AGAIN!! Man I watched that scene almost as often as I watched the Smiling Titan scene. Although since latest chapter Ive reread the parts with Smiley way more times. Anyway RIP Petra Rall. The Queen of the Corps. I cant wait to see Annie get eaten and then have her corpse vomited up and fucking stomped on. If the SC fucking forgive Annie then I will be so disappointed. And actually because of what we saw in chapter  and the implications  the Smiling Titans death makes my heart ache. Although theres a  chance it didnt die since we saw its head pulled off but didnt see it melt into a skeleton and Eren sent the titans after Reiner quite soon after so they might not have finished the job and it regenerated. Also while he totally deserved it seeing Bert screaming for Annie and Reiner with his face being chomped on was kinda sad. I mean he caused so much death but after learning the origin of the warriors its hard to say that he was truly evil. Although while I cam forgive the initial attack after learning the Wall Eldians were not evil or anything I cant say he had no choice in the second and later attacks. He decided his family was worth more than a million innocent people and he had a choice. He couldve faked hos death and lived in the walls eventually passing om the Titan power on hos deathbed. He chose not to and died for it. As for who WILL upset me if they die? Mikasa of course but we know she doesnt die. Getting confirmation of Ymirs death will be bad especially seeing Kristorias reaction. I guess seeing Siegs death will be bittersweet since really he was railroaded into his path of life and never truly got to choose. Indoctrination from age  and having his familys life held as collateral means that theres no right choice for him. I do hope that he feels regret for his actions at the end and his last words are For Ymir! ...and also my name isnt Zeke. Seriously what kind of silly name is Zeke for the child of royal blood and the hope of victory? I mean come on with all the Germanic and Scandinavian influences on the story isnt it kind of obvious that my name is Sieg?

9800115,0,t3_5fkd9l,Something interesting to note from the recent chapter when Grisha tried to tell the Marley officer that Dina was a Fritz he was quickly shut up by Krieger before the other Marlay soldiers heard what he was saying. Could potentially mean nothing of importance though I doubt the detail was thrown in there for no reason at all. Not sure what would have happened if the officer heard what Grisha said but I get the feeling Dina wouldnt have been made mindless if they learned that she was a Fritz. Ymir is connected in someway to Ymir Fritz how that may be is up for debate though it seems more likely with each new bit of info that she is at the very least part of the bloodline. If Ymir is in some way connected to Ymir Fritz then I think that alone would be enough reason for Marlay to at least delay whatever punishment she would potentially receive. With how Isayama is going out of his way to avoid giving too much info about Ymir it seems like everything surrounding her past and who she really is is going to be endgame stuff kind of obvious with her hinted connections to the person supposedly responsible for creating titans and shifters. So when she will be brought back into the story is anyones guess. If shes being held somewhere on the Island still then she may appear sooner than later.Perhaps EMA and whats left of the SC get sent out on a secret mission to investigate the area outside the walls and find the port Eren sees in the Grisha memories. Historia gets a letter from Ymir that possibly tells her what condition she is in EMA are under arrest and the SC are in shambles. Maybe Historia behind the backs of the Military leadership has EMA and the SC go find Ymir.

I could see Historia volunteering for that but since Levi has promised to kill MT already I think the next mission for the SC will be to kill Reiner and eat Zeke. Its also been looking like they are heading for a timeskip for a while now so Isayama might use that to train Armin in using his titan regrow the SC have them harvest serum from mindless titans clear titans from Wall Maria and give the warriors time to regroup. The  year rule would be kind of irrelevant if he was going to keep up the current pace of  months for  arcs. The manga would end before Eren turned . ,ShingekiNoKyojin,dbs8cys,5,t5_2we2n

We came to think about it with much naturality but it may not be that normal to the story.Kruger said the last words the th King Fritz said before enclosing himself in the walls. In those words he said that he made a deal or agreement with the Progenitor Titan but not even Kruger knew what was that deal about it was decoded by Hange in the last chapter. She said that the deal was the fact that nobody out of the royal bloodline could use the Progenitor Titan powers and that if such person of royal blood tried to use it with a different purpose than the First Kings the Progenitor Titan itself wont allow them to do so and suicidal thought would take possession of the person.So the Marley doesnt necessarily know that only royal blood people can master the Progenitor Titan power Kruger didnt know that either. Ir you add the fact that they saw Eren using the Coordinate in chapter ... they have no reason to think that only a Fritz or a Reiss can use the Progenitor Titan powers.Probably the Fritz were the only family having the Progenitor Titan in history Grisha was very likely the first person ever to steal that from the royal family. I guess everyone always assumed that the Progenitor Titan power could be transferred like any other titan power and maybe it was that way until the th King Fritz and his deal he changed the rules.,ShingekiNoKyojin,dc7j2qi,3,t5_2we2n

I dont think saving billions is an excuse to commit genocide especially when there are other options at hand. She knew Eren had the coordinate and not the royal family.

10630569,0,t1_ddbx21m,While its likely that he has lt years left its not necessarily proven by the fact that Reiner and Bertholdt recognize him. The  titans are famous in Marley  and Marley trained each of the warriors from the ages of  until they were . So its likely that they know what powers each of the  titans possess. The beast titan toy that Zeke is playing with as a child either has its image known to the public or Zeke was able to change the image of his titan. Either way Zeke could have as many as  years left even though he probably doesnt. For the timing of what happened outside the walls Grisha says that Zeke turns him in around his th birthday. Keith Shadis says that he met Grisha around  years ago. Grisha executed his plan to capture the coordinate after telling Eren he would take him to the basement. He then feeds himself to Eren. Its likely that he was  forced to act at the end of his  years. Since Grisha had inherited the attack titan he had gotten inside the walls established a medical practice grew some wicked sideburns cured a disease started dating Carla married Carla bow chicka wowowed Carla then  months later had Eren. Eren was  when he ate his father so its likely that Grisha was at the end of his  year timeline. The current story is happening  years after that. That means Grisha and Keith met  years ago from when Keith tells the story get your shit together Keith. Zeke was  when Grisha came to Paradis . Any estimation is really only within months. ,ShingekiNoKyojin,ddcgnkb,3,t5_2we2n

In the beginning of AoT you see Mikasa and Erin picking up wood. Even children play a role in the survival of the family. So Im gonna go with probably just not a lot of free time for such things.

10815496,0,t1_ddujfcq,Because the Trost attack stopped when Eren revealed himself as a titan shifter. The Colossal Titan destroyed the outter gate but the Armored titan never appeared like he did in Shiganshina.So Erwin induced that the enemy saw Eren in that moment. If they stopped the attack due to Eren was because Eren was somehow important so he induced that the enemy wanted Eren.Part of the th Training Corps was there and saw Eren. When Erwin made his speech to the th Training Corps to convinced them to join the Survey Corps he revealed crucial and very important tactical information on purpose the potential true that was in Erens basement even Armin was shocked at Erwin revealing such information to everyone in public. But Erwin was making a bet if the enemy was among the th Training Corps they would join the Survey Corps to get to that basement with them.The two titans used by Hange to experiment were slayed and that was a confirmation to Erwin that the enemy was infiltrated in the military.When they launched the expedition Erwin was already expecting someone to try to capture Eren although he didnt know exactly what was going to happen he was probably expecting the Armored Titan to show up.

11473637,0,t3_63r5jo,I think the Walldians making a DDay invasion of Marley is the more plausible options.By the end of Chapter  the Survey Corps recognized that the disappearance of the mindless Titans and the absence of any quick Marleyan invasion force is a calm before the storm but three years is too long a time for the SC to think that Marley is not in trouble. They should have at least an idea that something else is happening in the continent that is diverting Marleys attention away from the island. gt The military police could just sit back and remain useless.Id rather think that the MP should be reassigned as Paradise Islands defensive force while the Garrison forms the bulk of the Eldian invasion force and the SC remains the antiTitan specialists as OP wrote. The Walldians must have already conducted espionage and recon operations on the continent to gather intel about the enemy. They couldnt just sit back and wait for Marley to attack all these  years.And if the ending sequence of Season  gives indication the Walldians might actually use mindless Titans yes their own people for a seaborne attack on Marleyan cities. Except in this case they will be volunteering Eldians who have a clear idea of their decision as opposed to their brainwashed counterparts in Marley.,ShingekiNoKyojin,dfwj5qi,2,t5_2we2n

11707137,0,t3_6707bq,I like the anime and the show but sometimes it feels like its trying too hard to constantly kill off characters. Also feels like humans are truly powerless except for a select few even in that time period.  years of knowing that their are literal man eating giants on the otherside of the walls. Couldnt they have made a couple armies during this time? Im not talking about Garrison forces or Scout regiments as they only number in the thousands. Im talking about mass producing dmg and dedicating your entire society to the war effort more or less.  years could have been enough to have an army of atleast  total troops by that amount  men individual armies could be stationed at every district etc. with a  strong force alone it would be enough to theoretically dismantle the titans for everything they are. Having the Armies go on offensives clear all titans within a  mile radius every once in a while and actually reclaim land. I dont know the shows theme is society reverting to pretty much greed not caring about outside the walls is a cool idea but not a believable one. endrant. ,ShingekiNoKyojin,dgn18f1,-4,t5_2we2n

Not Zekes own son.Wed have to wait until we get the official translation to see what is what. I find it odd that Colt speaks to him so casually and not as if he were a parent for one he doesnt even know of Zekes royal blood which also came as a mistranslation in the source linked it says not only because of your royal blood but it should be its not like you have royal blood or something like that NOBODY alive in Marley besides maybe Reiner Know of Zekes ties to the Eldian Royal Bloodline.Like i said though just gotta wait for the official translations.,ShingekiNoKyojin,dgwqlld,7,t5_2we2n
