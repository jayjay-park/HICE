965003,0,t1_chdq9zy,Thanks I appreciate your warning amp it actually isnt the first Ive heard of working for DFPS in general. A good friend worked for Austin DFPS a few years ago and I have spoken with her about positions and how the work is trying. Doing this type of job is something I have always wanted to do and Im aware of the nature of the work. Thanks though was there anything specific your relative disliked? I know my friend mentioned that seeing the same families repeatedly and long hours are what got to her the most. ,austinjobs,chdzaer,1,t5_2siri

2746292,0,t3_2ns1py,I love how the people here act like Austin is practically giving away jobs. yeah one good resume is all you need...If you find getting a job easy you have a good education from a desirable university. that or you have exact experience needed. that or you got lucky... you had a frat brother who got you an interview. your Dad plays golf with a VP of the co. you happened to be at the right place at the right time... the job market isnt fair. Its a rough market out there. In the past decade weve had a financial industry collapse amp a double dip recession. Austin is one of the few cities not directly hit. People from all over have come here like the gold rush seeking work. Were promised the pursuit of happiness not happiness itself. Were all in a competition for every one person who gets the job amp rants how easy it was theres gonna be losers. lots amp lots. Good luck. ,austinjobs,cng8pw1,1,t5_2siri

7232150,0,t1_d2089ho,You know a lot of peoplebusinesses have their upfront biases or fears. What you really simply need to do is show them exactly how you can help them solve a problem. Speak to what you can do for a company especially if thats a need for them and you will watch their fearsbiases be put to ease. I really do think a lot of those issues stem from fear of companieshiring managers. Its tough to hire the perfect person. There is just simply no such person. ,austinjobs,d208qk5,1,t5_2siri
