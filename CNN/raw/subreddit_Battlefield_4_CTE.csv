2877651,0,t3_2t2off,Also if you are on a five flag map where the enemy has pushed your team into the spawn and you flank all the way to the farthest opposing flag that should be x points and maybe .x if you get the ones in the middle. There needs to be a reason for players to go after well held flags more points for capturing a flag that the enemy has held for a long while?.

2883682,0,t3_2t3qww,Ive played at  for all of BF and BF.  I had noticed it in the loading screens but no where else.  I checked a shadowplay of a round where I played commander and you are right it is there too but I swear I had never noticed it in  hours of BF.My honest opinion is that this is a very minor bug and Id hope Dice chooses to let this one go and focus on more significant bugs.  For example clicking a gadget from the Deploy Screen menu should give me a drop down of gadgets I could pick for that kit not jump me  into the config menu for that kit.  Thats just excessive clicks and a waste of time.Imagine drop down menus for Primary Weapon Secondary Weapon Gadgets and Grenade and IMO Field Upgrade tree should be added as the sixth config opion!  ,Battlefield_4_CTE,cnvvl6v,0,t5_35x9r

2909392,0,t1_cnyrtyq,gt Airburst I believe there is a bug here but I havent had the time to test and confirm it. It would appear that its possible for it to do more damage than intended when in the airburst mode. Could be hitting twice with both airburst and base value damageOthers are welcome to chime in but personally I have never experienced this against vehicles so far over  kills. It has always been  damage to armor and a mobility hit or critical depending on reactive armor. Against scout and attack helis its a potential  hit kill but only if you get close enough. The airburst makes this job easier since you dont have to collide however.Regarding the audio I agree it could become a nuisance yet I personally experience the drop pods on Hangar  as being audible from a much further distance. It may be a case of the UCAV travelling so fast that by the time you hear the noise its too late.,Battlefield_4_CTE,cnyszxu,1,t5_35x9r

I prefer for you guys to report issues through the reddit for now as any other system invested time in needs to hook into our JIRA in the backend. We opted for this more manual process as we await updates to our backend and the reason we moved to reddit from the forums too. While a public bug tracker is good  its also adding workload that might not be something wed want to spend time on depending on where we are in the process for the coming release. For QA initially like we are starting to creep up on Spring Patch development  their job is less about bugs and more about writing test cases that test new features being built in the cycle. The close we get to release the more existing bugs new bugs and certification bugs gets focus. During this period bug trackers are good  but before it would not be as interesting.

3057330,0,t3_2v5fcz,Love the TLDR. I think its a shame people are mainly using ECM as flares always just before the missiles will hit resulting in missiles always deflecting if the aircraft silhouette is small enough the US F jet helos. All you see is ECM jammer being used nowadays over flares.  Its  seconds of missileprotection and freeoflocking time with radarinvisilibtyversus  the  seconds of flares that dont give full protection against the underused  IGLA but do help good against stingers. I like the gtAfter a missile has collectively spent a certain amount of time inside an ECM cloud it would detonate. That is mingled with the gt To do that you add an altitude multiplier. The closer you are to the ground the less time the missile has to be in the cloud before it detonates.It would give some depth to the use of ECM jammer. But dont you think ECM jammer duration is a bit too long? For example nothing stops the scout heli from attacking even if AA launchers are trying to lock on to him all he has to do is pop ECM and finish the AAlauncher inf within the full  !!! seconds that he directionally SEES on his HUD.

Using mines to control the flow of vehicles is definitely something that would get them more used without making them too potent.Not really sure what to do about claymores first off they need a damage increase more times than not Ive survived running through a claymore.  If theyre gonna be a pain in the ass at least do it properly.Theres not a whole lot you can do with these low risk instakill gadgets.

3257386,0,t3_2uy2qj,As far as the Teamplay Initiative goes why dont you guys just implement some of Battlenonsenses material. His suggestions on spotting here are ingenious Do You Really Know How Spotting Works? The things that I note as most important are at where its discussing Audio Spotting I couldnt agree more with him about this than right at  where audio spotting triggers a ping rather than the real time tracking. Audio tracking shouldnt spot the enemy for everyone on your team just for those around the shooting. I would also suggest that if I am within the audio tracking radius of an enemy and I have a squadmate thats outside of that radius then he should see the minimap ping as well because hes a squadmate. Its the Teamplay Initiative you want clear communication among squadmates.Its too easy to exploit the Active Spotting System ASS  is a GREAT example of that. Though its GREAT to exploit the ASS funny right its never fun to be on the recieving end of someone else exploiting their own ASS Insert Bevis and Butthead. I DO think that the solution stated in  sounds like a great idead. I think that this Diamond will need quite a bit of experimenting in terms of just how big or small it should be. My suggestion is the diamond dropoff takes place at  meters and comes to a final point at  meters and remains a fixed point expceeding ranges beyond  meters because if theyre visible and youre able to aim accurately at them and use ASS you should spot them even if theyre outside of the diamond. You just need to be accuratly aiming at them. I also think the diamond needs to get larger when using magnified sights but also need to be significantly more narrow. This way theres more of an incentive to use medium range sights for all the other classes outside of Recon.  All this content about automatic spotting at long ranges... I think this feature needs to be removed as well. People shouldnt apear on the minimap unless someone on the ground has specifically set out to spot them. This opinion extends even as so far as Commander Mode which dumbs down the game for people who have a commander. And more often than not one team has a commander while the other team doesnt. So please nurf commander mode to the point to where his UAVs only extend around a  meter radius and the same with the EMP. I think EVERYTHING Commander should be nurfed to the point to where people will ask Why would I ever use Commander Mode? and the answer is ballancing and a better Teamplay Initiative. The commander would ultimately only be able to help a squad at a time for so long as hes in direct communication with that squad.He also has videos about the red durrito in the d hudDont shoot below the triangle! concept This video is quite good. However I think there should be an opacity differential depending on how close or far the enemy is. If the enemy is within  meters the durrito should be at  opacity. If their  meters  opacity. If theyre  meters away  opacity. Beyond that and yeah you can see the enemy Durritos at  meters off outside of the center screen at  opacity but once thei. center screen again at  meters theres no Durrito. But theyre on the Minimap.I would like to see all of this mixed in with the rules established in spotting in the previous video. Please and thank you. ,Battlefield_4_CTE,cozn0v5,1,t5_35x9r

3275120,0,t1_cp1eshj,From another comment of minegtI feel DICE missed a big opportunity to differentiate the sniper rifles by giving them all virtually the same amount of sway. Since they all behave virtually the same small rifles like the Scout Elite are heavily disadvantaged against the larger rifles because their main reallife advantage light weight is not represented.gtI think that big heavy rifles like the SRR  pounds should have lots of scope sway when not bipodded effectively relegating them to a more static longrange role. Lighter rifles like the Scout Elite  pounds would have less scope sway when standing and when moving making them better for highmobility usage but are balanced by their light damage at longer ranges. Medium weight rifles like the MA and CSLR would be allpurpose sniper rifles that balance sway and damage.gtThese changes would bring sniper rifles more in line with the usability of their reallife counterparts which is good for realism and immersion. More importantly it is also good for gameplay by giving each rifle their own unique role and identity on the battlefield giving them greater differentiation and making the metagame more complex.Just one part of my DICE should use equipment and weapon weight as a balancing mechanic idea for later BF installments.Also I think all weapons should get crazy sway when moving.

3302981,0,t1_cp4jje2,Im the guy working on night vision. Not sure why things got darker in the patch but Im looking into it. My guess is that parts of the night vision changes for Infiltration of Shanghai leaked through to the patch.Wall of text incomingThe night vision modes are pretty hacky due to engine and console limitations. Because of those hacks you get bugs like vehicles being much hotter toward the sun soldiers fading out as they get near vehicles and night vision failing completely when you turn the sun off in night maps. Its also why the snow in Operation Locker reads as hot. I did a pass on thermal in general for Final Stand but Infiltration of Shanghai requires a deeper rework of the system. The first pass of this is live in CTE. Players and vehicles should now be more consistently lit in night vision.The next step is to make the environment more consistent in brightness between maps and across environments. That change is coming but its going to take longer to put it together.The goal is to make night vision roughly the same as before in terms of functionality but more consistent across the board.,Battlefield_4_CTE,cp4rlqt,16,t5_35x9r

It doesnt change the fact that a console is an insanely inefficient way to play FPS till Virtual Reality becomes accessible at least nor that the situation has intensively dumbed down gaming in general. But because console is insanely more accessible is as easy to use as a television and is economically very smart console players pay their game an insane amount of money yet buy the console because it is cheap.

3345938,0,t1_cp9n0dv,gt Sprint If the maps stay as large as they are I think that unlimited sprint should stay. However in future Battlefield titles if the maps see an overall reduction in size I dont have an issue with limited sprint. Maybe  meters of continuous sprint before having to take a  ish second cooldown.I think the main problem is that you often dont get a vehicle at the start. This is very frustrating having to run for miles is not a good solution regardless of what system is used. The fix for not having enough vehicles at the start of the round is not unlimited sprint but having more vehicles at the start of the round. gt Overheat Depends on what exactly overheating means. Does overheating means that the gun stops shooting for a period of time? If so then no this wont play out well. Does overheating mean having ridiculously uncontrollable spread during full auto firing? Then yes I can see this being a viable mechanic depending on how its implemented.In BF the gun stopped firing which really was a very unsexy implementation. I suggest a system where the player gets more spread when the barrel is heated. An additional feature could be that smoke and distorted air rises from the barrel when it gets really hot making it harder to see but just a little bit.   gt Ammo I think that the current one magfour reserve mags is fine. Ammo pooling should not be present in normal modes because the newer players will be wondering why they run out of ammo so fast. As far as resupplying goes things can be changed here. Right now standing on an Ammo Box will give you one new mag per second approximately. I would like to see this time doubled so its one new mag every two seconds.I think the latter is the best solution for BF at this point of time. The magazine based system is however not hard to understand all you need is for the UI to show the number of magazines instead of the total amount of rounds you have.gt Sorry about the confusion earlier I misunderstood what your plans were.No harm taken ,Battlefield_4_CTE,cp9nukf,2,t5_35x9r

That works in games like Arma where one bullet can kill you and where youre forced to restart a mission or respawn miles away when you die. Dying is easy and there is a harsh consequence when you get hit. Thats what creates fear of  suppression.In Battlefield you can take a facefull of LMG rounds and still return fire with pinpoint accuracy. If you die youre back in the fight after  seconds.

With two guys shooting at me I will die most definitely because its two sets of bullets hitting me at the same time. Hard line solves this with low ttk.

Those are such significant differences from core gameplay that you cant do in battlefield that you have to do something else to make people motivated and care about something else than KD. So just pointing out game that plays in a completely different way is not a good example  I know its possible but its possible in other games just not in battlefield which should be team based game.There was one idea Ive really liked and that was raking players on each server and given these ranks based on stats collected from their performance they would get rewards like vehicles more often instead of bad players that would rarely get into them if they use them only for transports or camp with them. Obviously this would again change the gameplay and I have no idea if that would even work but I feel like Battlefield games need to start doing other things to reinvent the formula a bit.

3936094,0,t1_cr4uywh,gt  consoles actually perform pretty much the exact same as a good gaming pc as they have pretty much the same kind of hardware. Im sorry but I have to argue against that. You may be aware of Moores Law that states transistor count doubling approximately every two years. Its not entirely accurate but the basic premise that computing performance increases exponentially is. This means old hardware gets left behind quickly and the older it is the faster it becomes comparatively worse. Consoles go through a lot of development time. When they announced the hardware that would be used in them it was already available for PCs. By the time they get round to releasing the consoles are about as powerful as a mid range PC and then they get left behind quickly. Consoles can match a mid range PC at launch but a year later people will upgrade their PC. Not a whole new one but just a bit of money for new components here and there over the years keeps it running on current hardware. Consoles cant get this so they do not stay as powerful. I know my PC  years ago was nowhere near as good as it is now and its still not anything special. It wasnt bad  years ago but it would be considered bad now if I hadnt upgraded it. Just to be clear Im not saying its bad to play on consoles. If you prefer to play on consoles go ahead Im not saying thats a bad choice. Its all down to personal preference.

Also u had to run about playing shooting and STILL command the battlefield assets or be a bad player and stay in a building or bush near the spawn so u could concentrate on being commander leaving the team down a player. So with their assets being exposed u could blow the bits up like UAV radar dish commanders hut etc. Dont know how u could work all of it in like how do u stop a gunship deployment from their command center? Destroy a radio link? that means the gunship flys away from the map into the dead zone?On the BF commander i understand the frustration i get shot... and first thing i think when its suspicious is Oh let me guess they have a commander and im spotted.

4063547,0,t3_373p9w,Its damage against vehicles its relatively okay if its going down it should only be by a tiny bit whats NOT okay is its tiny reload time Sraw fanboy and having a Rocket not kill a soldier is a bit absurd.I hate every aspect of the way DICE nerfed the SRAW and the nerf didnt even work its still almost always picked for every scenario because of its massive damage output in CQB.What I think would be more widely acceptable and a better way to nerf the SRAW is and Im starting to sound like a broken record here After m putdown reload death The SRAWket becomes Dumbfire and flies towards its last aimed direction! This will stop long distance rocket sniping against everyonetanks infantry choppers as the SRAW is the slowest rocket in the game and is easy to dodge when its not turning. This will also stop multiole attempts on the same chopper and also stop Orbiting SRAWs aswell as SRAWs that come back down and hit the corpse of the user. Then we can increase its reload time and maybe even reduce its Lethal blast radius against infantry to curb how Amazing it is in CQB you can literally take out a tank in ltseconds and to reduce the likelyhood of the ranged unguided rocket being lethally unavoidable if you dodge you should survive barely not have the blast kill you Finally face it this is where all the Rage comes from remove the hko against aircraft instead drop them to hp crippled and on fire giving pilots the chance to use the !Fire Extinguisher! and survive the sraw or land and repair either way the copter is effectively disabled from combat because its lost its CMs andor is wounded and the pilot hasnt been killed by what could be considered unexpectable and unfair so isnt nearly as pissed off because they can still do something.,Battlefield_4_CTE,crjh1ve,1,t5_35x9r

4094636,0,t1_crmhobi,For the record Im not ANTI DICE all the way. If DICE truly fixed something and made it great I have no problem praising them for doing so. I would be the first on the forums thanking them. I want DICE to succeed... Hell I wish they would put out that amazing patch so it would renew my faith in a franchise that quickly became my favorite over any other. Ive never put the same amount of playtime in any other title ever! However I have no problem holding their feet to the proverbial fire. I paid good money as well as millions of others to get what has essentially been a year beta experiment. And then on top of all this Im told by a developer what essentially boils down to stop complaining  were giving you free content. Thats like taking a car that never worked properly to the dealership asking them to fix it but instead they say you should be happy  were giving you  free tires. If youre willing to put up with that then kudos to you. I prefer standing up for myself. Im not going to let someone piss on my head and try to tell me its raining. I also understand no software will ever be  bug free but I have played several titles where a patch was rolled out and it didnt cause more problems  Witcher  Destiny Borderlands there are plenty out there so get off of DICEs jock and acting like youre some sort of sympathizer who knows the inner workings of DICE or even software manufacturing for that matter. And if you want to pull that card YES I AM a QA engineer for a software company and if I let as many bugs slip by as DICE has for a patch I would be in the unemployment line right now.,Battlefield_4_CTE,crn0iew,1,t5_35x9r

4140697,0,t1_crqb5db,So there are  sets of distances and a constant that really influence how far you can see something through night vision Glow Light fog Dark fog Clipping plane Color changeGlow distance is the numbers Ive given you already but there are two parts to it. The end distance is what Ive given you already. This is where the glow completely stops. Theres a second distance that determines where it starts fading out. For vehicles seen through the vehicle FLIR this fade starts at  and ends at the  number I gave you before. It also fades in from  to  to make your own  vehicle a little less blinding.  Night vision still uses the color pink as the first step to decide if something is hot. So anything pink will still be slightly brighter than anything normal colored. This is why you can slightly see things past their glowing range. The First Shape Distance above.  Fog is applied over the top of everything.  It grays out the pink color eventually which is why that first shape distance exists at all.  Light fog is what makes the far distant stuff brighten up so you can see it against the sky. on the vehicle FLIR it fades in on a roughly parabolic curve over m.  Dark fog fades things to about the color of the sky in nearer ranges. For the vehicle FLIR this is over m. It never reaches full opacity but it gets close.  So as the fog fades in and the glow fades out the system reaches a point where the fog pulls the pink far enough down to not be hot anymore. Its one of those things where pulling on one of the numbers means the other two have to get adjusted too.RAWR  Im going to swap it for IRNV and well try that out.  Opacity is reduced to  and . With layers of smoke and how the system combines things this means that a single smoke grenade blocks at about .  For air vehicles I was planning on starting with the vehicle IRNV. That way pilots can see well enough to not fly into things without giving them the advantage of designating every target in the map. Would you rather have an alwayson FLIR?ulllBadVoodoolll also asked about togglable blackwhite thermal in the NV feedback thread. Its probably possible but we run into the fun of what button do I use on console issue. Dpad Up might be clear right now it toggles zoom state just like the trigger does. The two might be tied hard in code or they might just be associated in a keybinding somewhere.

4204727,0,t1_crzij04,There is why we need a ingame boot camp for the next battlefield and option to add test range in a server for practicing and teaching purposes.New players to the franchise will learn the game faster if they go through a ingame basic training where they can learn pretty much anything implemented in the multiplayer like classes vehicles weapons attachments gadgets modes features tutorials on map strategies teamwork etc. This way they can be more effective in the battlefield and have a better experience with less frustration. BF singleplayer style with bots should be considered for the next game. Its a more effective way to introduce the basics and prepare a new player for real MP matches than having to play a linear and script campaign that you are going to play only once and then jump into MP. New players need to learn basic teamplay before jumping into multiplayer.I dont see the point of making a complex game with tons of features and content and have a simple in game tutorial that only scratch the surface of what the game is really about and where pretty much everyone disables because is annoying and restricts the FOV. New players need to jump into action ready with some basic gameplay and teamplay knowledge about the game and not try to learn from scratch in multiplayer matches where everyone is trying to kill them with such a vast arsenal that can kill in many different ways and especially when the game launches with dozens of bugs glitches and crashes that makes even impossible to play by veterans. Its frustrating a big waste of time and makes most of them to give up and dont return for new content.PrimaGames eGuides is good enough for new players and covers a lot about the game but unfortunately barely anyone new to the franchise is aware of it or it would be willing to pay for it. The least you can do about this guide is to actively announce especially on battlelog so new players will know about it. I personally dont know anyone who ever bought the eGuide or the printable book.This game needs an interactive and effective boot camp where you can at least learn the basics to be a good team player in the battlefield.

Flares as well will also fail in the same way. Its a problem with the insane missile speed lockon missiles in this game have. Its  or  times faster then it was in BF which is just absurd and game breaking.

4296584,0,t3_3a63f5,The Hbar is fine as is. Your suggested changes would put it over and above all other attachments. IMHO worse hipfire is irrelevant since you should always be aiming your weapon past  meters.Realistically anyway the Hbar wouldnt decrease initial spread but instead reduce spread increase per shot to simulate the thicker barrel heating up slower and a slower spread decrease per second to simulate the increased length of time for the barrel to cool down. The weight of the thicker barrel would create less recoil. To better simulate poor mobility moving spread should also be increased to simulate difficulty moving and struggling to maintain accuracy while doing so. The attachment would be something likeSpread Increase Per Shot ..xSpread Decrease Per Shot ..xVertical Recoil ..xMoving Spread ..xOf course this is an unneeded change that only serves to add realism to a game that is not focused around realism but rather gameplay. Changes to make the Hbar realistic will make it redundant Essentially a StubbyPotato Grip Muzzle Break wrapped up into one attachment making either the Stubby Grip and Muzzle Break or the Hbar redundant.

4366788,0,t1_cshuwjk,gt So popping endless smoke at your feet and being able to shoot through it is an intended play style in this game?Yes. One of the advantages of IR scopes is their ability to see through smoke I remember when the game was released the devs basically said that the game was specifically designed that way with the hand flare being a hard counter. Seriously if you keep getting raped by some smoke monster with an MG try the hand flare if youre looking at someone with an IR scope and they throw a hand flare you immediately cant see shit.The reason you havent really seen the tactic used that much until recently is because the smoke used to be super useless at game launch. It didnt last very long and most importantly you could be spotted through it so anyone that tried to play smoke monster would immediately get D spotted and shot in the face.,Battlefield_4_CTE,cshveol,2,t5_35x9r
4366873,0,t3_3azvlj,This will probably never happen but its what Ive been suggesting for sniper rifles for a long time now. Minmax damage Light  max  min Medium  max  min Heavy  max  minYes those damage values mean that boltactions will no longer OHK headshot beyond their max dropoff ranges and m extremerange sniping will be dead. No more CQC sniping either trying to OHK people in the chest within m and praying they dont have Body Armor. Theres a reason Recons have access to Carbines and Shotguns. Dropoff ranges Light m DO start gt m DO end Medium m DO start gt m DO end Heavy m DO start gt m DO endThis will bring sniper rifles in line with all the other guns that got their range heavily decreased by Spring Patchs spread changes especially DMRs. Snipers will have to play within m of their objectivetarget which is still MUCH further than how far any other gun can reach. Muzzle velocities Increase all boltaction muzzle velocities by .This will make sniper rifles much more lethal within their new m limited range by addressing how easily soldiers can casually dodge sniper bullets with zigzag running or ADAD strafing. Rate of fire Further differentiate RoF between sniper rifles. Currently they vary from  RPM   RPM increase that to  RPM   RPM. This will make it more penalizing to bring heavy sniper rifles into a heated situation because rechambering rounds will take longer while guns like FYScout should fire at  RPM to make them more preferable for aggressive play. ,Battlefield_4_CTE,cshvr2x,0,t5_35x9r

Unless you are with an entire team of them they are garbage.  The best pilots will either kill you before the stinger can get to them or flee and use cover then come back and kill you.  The smaller choppers are massively OP in the right hands they can easily kill infantry and move too quickly for hit with a sraw in most cases even before the sraw nerf.So cry all you want but Stingers have been useless since the original nerf unless you have a lot of people using them in which case it should do its intended job and take choppers down.I rarely run them and would rather use srawrpgsmaw and have a chance when a tank rolls up on me too.

In all honesty Im pretty peeved off that they have already taken a lot of the vertical aspect out of the Rush maps in BF. They really have dumbed down the tactical element to RUSH already and turned it into a stand off. So long as rooftops are accessible to all then there really isnt an issue. Some maps are better played flat.... Dawnbreaker certainly isnt one of them. As for spawn beacons that is what a MAV is for. If ever I see a team using beacons all the time then I will use one and they soon switch to a different tactic when they realise they cant get their way.Id actually like to see a little more verticality brought back to Rush and in particular some little birds and more vehicles brought back in. The whole point of RUSH is intense teamwork and having to be in two places at the same time. You should be switching kits several times a game to do what is needed.Im peeved off they have taken a lot of verticality in other modes too like TDM and DOM.

4616410,0,t1_ctcfdof,I think APS kind of already is the muzzle brake of land countermeasures. Its certainly not hard to use any inexperienced player can turn it on and enjoy their few seconds of total invincibility from all directions. Its already basically an automated version of the BF reactive armor. Instead of having to be aware of what panels you still have and turning them toward threats to take zero damage hits you just mash the CM button and APS does all that for you. If ease of use is the goal of this CM choice then the quickest easiest thing to do would be to address all the little quirks that make it not work sometimes like moving while its on. Only experienced players are aware of that sort of thing.I think we could get to muzzle brake APS balance by buffing smoke in the manner discussed in this thread. Just because APS is the only option against air right now doesnt mean its good against air. It will buy you a few seconds to try to hide but with a  second cooldown youre just prolonging the inevitable. A competent AJ pilot can do three more passes on your before your APS is back but theyll only need one. If Im flying the AJ from the right height and angle I can just wait out APS and kill the vehicle on the same run a lot of the time. An AH can just break their run gain a little altitude get a new angle and be ready to immolate you the minute the red kill me light comes on. If smoke were altered so the cloud was large opaque prevented spotting and had a relatively short cooldown you could break spot and maneuver inside the cloud unseen to avoid being hit and do so frequently. The same and more would be possible against ground. You wouldnt have APS invincibility but if you were good I bet you could end up getting hit less. Think of it as the heavy barrel to APSs muzzle brake. And like I and OP said above if FE instacleared mobility hitskills and could be used more frequently than APS it would be a great choice for stuff like boats and MAAs that frequently spend large chunks of the game in mobility hit hell. That gives you a viable option that works completely differently from every other choice in the slot and enables a much different playstyle. The suppressor to APSs muzzle brake. Then theres IR Smoke. Like I said previously Im not sure how to make this an attractive choice since land vehicles take so many more unguided shellsrockets than guided. Something that only breaks locks is always going to be an inferior choice to the other three options that all help deal with dumbfire damage. So it kind of does something but has huge drawbacks that arent really worth it. Its the postpatch flash suppressor to APSs muzzle brake.,Battlefield_4_CTE,ctch6v7,2,t5_35x9r

4728254,0,t1_ctqe159,We approach bugs with a triagelike methodology.  We compare how much benefit the players will get from the fix amongst other factors against how long it will take for us to identify the cause of the issue come up with a solution implement that solution and how much potential negative impact that solution may have on the rest of the game.Like I said already this isnt one of those things we just change a few numbers and push to CTE.  The materials touch literally everything.  Should a projectile penetrate certain objects?  Should a projectiles impact damage certain objects?  Should a projectiles splash deform terrain?  Should it be able to break through glass?  Should it damage vehicles but not soldiers?  Should it be able to damage soldiers in vehicles but not the vehicles themselves?Its an intricate web of relationships.  Pulling one thread even slightly can cause a ripple effect throughout the rest of the system even in ways we cant anticipate.  We cant just say make splash do  damage since the damage values are multiplied depending on what is actually being damaged.  Vehicles might need to get  damage soldiers need  cardboard boxes need  metal needs  etc. etc.When I say We may come back to it it depends entirely on how many higher priority tasks I get in any given day.  Once all of my higher priority work is done IF it gets done then I come back to this issue and take a look on if theres anything we can do.

However I think it is fair to say that this suggestion is a step in the right direction and could help push players who just want a high score or something like that to play as a team.Sure there are players who only care about themselves and just want to run around killing people and if were honest with ourselves they have every right to play like that.

4814941,1,t1_cu1ew2r,A lot of what you said isnt true and not understanding of how AA works against air. You cant really use teamwork to lock down stingers since they are infantry and respawn faster than your counter measures come up. That is why a helicopters success relies more on the map than either team. You see helicopters doing great on dawnbreaker and flood zone because they have a lot of cover against helicopters. So a large amount of helicopter balance is the map.Secondly most players skip the things that kill helicopters for heatseekers which work more as a deterrent on that map. Get a transport heli and have a gunner and a guy with stingers in the side repairing and you will shut the scout heli down. Use any machine gun on vehicles to damage them and a rhib boat is especially deadly. You can also try RPGSMAW or better yet instead of locking on to them just try to shoot out the pilot.Very few people use the latter things and rely on lockons as the end all AA weapon. Which they are on open maps suich as golmund railways. I havent ever seen that map dominated by helicopters in fact they always get dominated on that map. Which is why heli balance depends a lot on the map. Yes MAA shuts them down there is almost nothing a scout heli can do to it and it can kill from spawn.Something needs to be done about anti air because lockons are near worthless on some maps and too strong on open maps.This is also complicated by the fact that lockons often go straight through counter measures disabling you and crashing you into things which get you killed in action. Its not fun to die to things you cant do anything about that require almost no skill to use.Its almost as if people also dont realize that each team gets one. I think if more people tried to fly they would understand the situations and things that kill the helicopters with ease. People just get worked up because there are a few maps that very skilled pilots can destroy on.gtThey insist they want a game in which their idea of skill is rewarded but theyre okay with unskilled infantry being slaughtered en masse by choppers while they do know the rock paper scissors system isnt applying to them in BF on many maps.This statement is so wrong I play on hardcore servers with an active skilled playerbase and I get shot out by guns or RPGed more than heatseekers by far. The problem is people want heatseekers to be the end all AA weapon and they more often work more as a deterrent.,Battlefield_4_CTE,cu1go9c,1,t5_35x9r

4909544,0,t1_cudcxh3,gtIn flight repairs are just as much of a problem as the old medbag that allowed you to soak up an entire extra bullet during a firefight enabling you to win any otherwise fair engagement An in flightrepair copter can take an extra rocket.Bit of a false equivalency there. If we break it down weve got a player in a vehicle force multiplier which requires an entirely new and difficult set of skills and abilities to operate versus a single infantryman with a lockon weapon that requires the least amount of skill and effort to operate. If anything is the medbag in this comparison its the lockon weapon. Dont forget that the player in the air vehicle isnt repairing himself that requires another player which means teamwork is being employed AND another soldier is out of the general fight for flags. All to combat a player on the ground using a lockon weapon by himself that is ridiculously easy to use for amount of power it provides.gtThe inflight repairs arent the biggest problem its passengers firing shit like STiGLAS and javelins off the sideseat through your own propeller into the opposing vehicles thats a problem rather than just a pair of heatseekers youll get faked out by one then have Three come at you while your CMs are down its absurd.I agree  with all this though. Hopefully Dice will change it so that players cannot use lockon style weapons out of the side of the Scouts or maybe change it back to how it was in BF where the players could not look forward to shoot.,Battlefield_4_CTE,cuddv3u,4,t5_35x9r

4994251,0,t1_culvbhh,Well see.Imo mines are actually in a pretty good place.If you are not running thermal   of the time which lets face it nobody is.Sometimes you will drive in rd or turn thermal off to actually see at a distance since they nerfed thermals range already and on maps like ZavodGolmud with all the brown clutterdirt and trees on the ground it can be quite difficult to spot sometimes a single mine.Not to mention that they are some glitched spots where it is pretty much impossible to see them due to them melting in the maptexture.The verge of the bridge on Shanghai is a good example.Sure it is not easy to get minekills but definitely not impossible.Good mineplacment requires REALLY good knowledge of map and armourroutes.And if you succeed with that you get an instakill with  mines or  SLAMS Not sure with SLAMS on any vehicle.And IMO an relatively cheap instakill should be hard to get.yes mostly due to the driver being not careful enoughchecking his environment etc. but stillEngis primaryengagmenttool to dispose of armour should always be the rocketlauncher.Which are already taking a backseat in BF  but thats another story...In my book mines or Slams in BF  are more about delaying armourexposing it since they have to destroy them if they wanna pass that area safely which also tends to light them up on the minimap and create huge craters in which they can get stuck and are highly vulnerable.Since no angle with a tank  sitting duck and obv catching drivers who have their guard down.Just my  cents though ,Battlefield_4_CTE,cunzrn7,1,t5_35x9r

The only thing I dislike is that they didnt give the naked attachements an additional bonus as opposed to negatives to everything else seeing as gunplay is fairly innaccurate already.And I would agree some weapons should get a better ADS spread. Stop making it completely based on weapon class  bullpup yn.

No tactical ingame soldier needs  perpetually regenerating opaque smoke grenades in their arsenal. This is silly.  It blocks visibility for both the smoke user and the enemy.  Youre heavily implying here that one who throws an opaque smoke has nothing to gain over the person on the other side. Heres the Why youre looking for A wellthrown opaque smoke has the potential to fully put the enemy in a bad situation and give you the upper hand...one in which they have no counter. I didnt think Id need to give an example but if it was so obvious you wouldnt be making these claims Consider an enemy just inside the entrance of a pillbox on Zavod. Youre outside on flat ground he spots you first and fires through the entrance at you landing multiple hits. You go prone because you are weak. You chuck a smoke at the entrance move horizontally from your last position and spam bullets through the smoke and get the kill.

Look at this video at  I check the map to see if the scout chopper has spawned it hasnt I assume Im safe to strafe what I can chopper randomly spawns during it and effectively one shots me it doesnt matter if youre Haimelik youre not getting out of that alive only the AA and scout chopper do things like this in this game. Well my first reaction without watching your video entirely is  and one of your deaths was from the teleport bug that put you in the water so  really how bad could it have been?Honestly youre doing it again. Youre making it look like all jet pilots just want to go XX with zero things capable of stopping them. Claiming you had trouble with some Scout miniguns in a game where you went  looks exactly like that.Edit After watching your video What the fuck dude?

This is the guy who killed you  KD  kill heli kills  HOURS in the scout alone. This guy is a top tier scout player not just the  but the ..And youre pissed this guy killed you ONCE while you got away with  kills and ONE death?!?

This video is proof of the exact opposite of that.gtI have no idea why you would think I want jets to be invulnerable all Ive asked for here is balanceYeah a weird version of it. Look I get it you want jets to be strong I do too. I personally think jets should be the strongest vehicles in the game at the top of the pyramid just like in actual warfare BUT for the purposes of this game its nice for other units to have the ability to take them out with combined force. And that is the exact thing the scout pilot utilized at the time he killed you plus your own negligence in this case. You were getting shot at by everything because you were already  on the scoreboard which is basically like being HVT in that everyone wants to kill you specifically looking through the range finder to drop a bomb and didnt see the scout that was in the perfect position to get enough bullets on you. All the variables required for that event to take place and it only managed to happen ONCE the whole game. The best part? That wasnt even the attack jet you were using it was the stealth.

5149731,0,t3_3lg4uf,Crouchwalking should let you bypass claymores safely.  Pretty sure that was the case in BF NFI why its been removed especially when by playing a team role and selecting smokes or flares you effectively remove any chance of destroying a claymore.  If DICE cant make teamplay work lol they dont give a fuck about teamplay the least they can do is not punish loadouts like medkitdefibflares by preventing them from doing anything but cleanup duty.  The concept of being rewarded for a wellplaced claymore is one of the most ridiculous Ive heard in a while even when BF is overflowing with ridiculous balance and gameplay concepts.  It takes literally no effort on plenty of maps to place a claymore that cant be shot so if theres no teamplay and the player who knows whats going on cant do anything its bad game design.  Ive been in the circumstance even on Lockers where I couldnt do anything and even asking teammates for over a minute to do something about a claymore in a critical position was like banging my head against a wall and sacrificing myself in the hope another claymore doesnt go up in the same spot before I respawn isnt a valid solution.  ,Battlefield_4_CTE,cv6qioq,3,t5_35x9r

5237518,0,t3_3mpg92,I dunno I think most of the nerfs were warranted. Its certainly not inordinately difficult to take out a tank now imo you need to take longer runs but you cant instantly lazor melt whatever you want  they have a bit more of a chance to be evasive.The nerfs versus air went a bit far imo. Air targets are already difficult to hit due to low muzzle velocity now dogfights are just a chore.The MAA will be a problem until DICE figure out an antiMAA weapon. I know its supposed to be a tank or whatever but thats completely unrealistic when the MAA is sitting behind  players often out of bounds.

5339276,0,t3_3o4aij,Personally I think the whole D spotting system needs to be revamped. At the very least for the next game. Several faults recon equipment is hard to tell when in effect. Same issue with proxy scan commander UAV is too powerful especially given they are almost always one sided as you said D spotting is too accurate with real time tracking and direction feedback especially from spotting methods such as gunfire the range on spotting is too much in some scenarios firing one pistol bullet then having a artillerymortar across the map be able to hit you on the head is quite simply just broken Personally the things that I think would be improvements three types of spots on the map Arrows the most powerful which are real time tracking and show direction which is what we currently have. Dots which show exactly where someone wasis but no direction or tracking. Heat or a faint glowing on a part of your minimap showing generally where someone is.  active spotting stays basically the same it gives arrow spots. When someone looks at an enemy and pushes the spot button the enemy shows up on the entire teams map as a tracking arrow for a few seconds. If the whole team loses sight any case where D spotting is currently lost it changes to a dot spot.  motion sensor spotting TUGS MAV pokeballs gets a a pulsing ring shown on the map. The ring indicates when and in what range the motion sensor is spotting. The spotted enemies show up as arrows that last for a second then fade. They get respotted on the next pulse soon after if still in range.  proxy scan same as motion sensors but only to the gunner using it or whoever it shows for currently passive spotting gets reduced to a dot and the dot only moves so long as target is still in the passive spotters cone and still spotting them. As soon as they leave it the dot stops moving and remains in place before fading.   commander UAV returns to a sweeping scan on short interval like BF. On each pass it spots people as dots which soon fade. The scan area and sweeping effect are shown on the teams maps.  gunfire spotting gets significantly nerfed. The spotting get range limited and less precise on the map. The range it would spot you in for enemies to see would depend on the weapon type sniper have further than pistols how long you fire for one bullet is a small range extended fire grows it ceasing fire reduces it again much like recoil and attachments suppressor no spotting flash hider could half the range or something so it has a purpose. As well when in the range the precision of the marker gets reduced. The heat system where when someone fire they cause a red glow on the maps of near by enemies in their vicinity.  vehicles remain the same though their gunfire spotting could use a range limit. ,Battlefield_4_CTE,cvu5glu,3,t5_35x9r

Such logic...and my answer to that would simply be that the guy with that actual name doesnt have a reddit account and this guy just hijacked the name.udarkheart further evidence to support this would be the continual and seemingly intentional as a joke misspelling of Dalian Plant.

5567693,0,t1_cwn72pa,gtI do not see it warding off jets in any way as ECM gives more than enough time to get away.Thats correct more detail Attackjet must use ECM with its runs due to its slower speed but SJs can better use flares for groundpounding.SJs can afford to use flares as they can use their superior speed with afterburner to quickly get away after damagedump then come back again with fresh flares to use them at the end of the nd straferun. Starting with the nd run takes one third less time than the flares reload time because of LGM distance locking on time and missiletraveltime.  ,Battlefield_4_CTE,cwn81p4,1,t5_35x9r

5585529,0,t1_cwp8fnd,I think you misunderstand what im saying.Not everyone wants to try hard or have people quote stats at them as a form of superiority so they play casually if you suddenly create a second stat like an ELO rank youve just given everyone another spot to point their finger haha you suck too scared to play competetive for statbashing garbage rather than just use the Skill system that is being worked on that gives a player a general measure of their Average skill rather than two stats of tryhard and casual where players will either not give much of a shit OR try really hard instead of just enjoying the game and being placed with people of equal skill to you in an environment where you dont have to worry about dropping a rank or all the other pressures that come with true competitive.Battlefield is a mix between arcade and milsim and its gameplay should reflect that rather than trying to Cram a competitive scene into it for example v just isnt a game of Battlefield its a game of tdm that splits the playerbase into two Different groups of Tryhardplay for fun rather than one group that tries for the fun of the game.Im not sure if the matchmaking prototype was meant to create a ladderstyle v scene or if it was meant to create a neat vs Mini battlefield but i sure as hell would prefer the latter as things like banlists to fix imbalances created ny the constricted playmode one tiny piece of it all Seriously piss me off but they claim you cant Not have a banlist for v and that just detracts even further from what Battlefield is supposed to be and handicaps the game into trying to emulate CSGO rather than create itd own unique and amazing identity where people can queue up for Matchmaking and be paired with equal skill level casuals for a nice fun lowstress game of Battlefield rather than a TIGHTLY constricted stressful do or die play experience.As you say why not stick to pub? Well other than all the obvious antipub reasons c trolls etc a big reason is that you would split the player base into two groups of tryhard and total casual that dont really care rather than one group of people trying for the fun of it all in a true Battlefield experience where your brothers in arms have similar training to you play experienceskill stat.Its just not necessary or good to split the playerbase in the name of competitive when you dont need to nor does it create a more enjoyable experience for all it creates a different form of enjoyment that not everyone likes and is the Total opposite of what the Battlefield game was built and designed to be a casual arcademilsim blend that you could comfortably load into for some crazy good fun.What im saying is that the competitive scene your looking for doesnt fit the Battlefield game and would further divide the community rather than unite them in one glorious load in Here for equal skill players on a Battlefield who care or troll about as much as you instead of load in Here for some intensely skillful tdm actionBattlefield should be Battlefield its own unique identity not a new engine emulation of csgos competetive scene,Battlefield_4_CTE,cwpfqd5,2,t5_35x9r

If following this logic the correct way to balance Active Radar is to treat it like a MBT LAW against aircrafts. Thus all DICE need to tweak is to remove the ability to cause mobility hits to aircrafts and lower the muzzle velocity to make it harder to hit moving target at long range but still effective on targeting the alleged hovercamping AH in OOB. ,Battlefield_4_CTE,cx5s2at,2,t5_35x9r

Rockets are suppose to have an advantage if they were on par with the M then there would be no point in using them. The M is just a secondary option for medics to replace their Medkit or Defibs in no way should they outshine a rocket at its purpose.gtHow easily it kills them is irrelevant since its just as easy if not more so to kill infantry with rocket launchers. Actually you are wrong killing with the M is quite easy. I find it easier than with a rocket. The splash range and damage allows you to miss but still do a good amount of damage to either shopt another or finish them off with your primary. With a rocket you have a slower reload so if they live the splash which they pretty much always do them you have to switch weapons because the long reload will get you killed.,Battlefield_4_CTE,cxdrs9m,2,t5_35x9r

6466412,0,t1_cznsgbb,gt I dont disagree with you but I would hate for my crosshairs to be moving faster than the gun. Even if it means picking up my mouse a few times. I dont want to be aiming at a target and have to wait for the gun to catch up. I want to fire when the crosshairs are on target.Well the idea is that your mouse location would follow your sensitivity option but as a pointer on which the actual crosshair of the gun would follow with a dotted line connecting the . Its pretty obvious which one is the gun crosshair and which is the mouse pointer. Those type of games generally offer a lock choice as well so your mouse cursor and speed is locked with the gun crosshair just like it always was with BF so if you prefer the locked choice theres no reason not to have it.The idea behind such system is to not only mimic real life and allow mouse users to keep their regular sensitivity but to change how players would approach tank gameplay. I prefer the fixed turned speed personally since I rather have the gameplay to be more dependable on tactical thinking and less on twitchy responses. Its totally subjective of course but I do feel its also the more accessible and immersive choice. As long as tanks gets a power buff obviously otherwise is a direct and unnecessary nerf.,Battlefield_4_CTE,czo67r6,1,t5_35x9r

6618243,0,t1_czpx29l, Passive Radar missiles can essentially give the pilot no lock warning if the missiles are aimed properly Stingers are not so much of a problem at close range but IGLAs are another story. Even if I pop my CMs early the missile keeps its trajectory and flies into my helicopter. It doesnt matter how early I pop my CMs nor does it matter how much I attempt to evade. A major cause of this is that the IGLA will fire its missile before the rapid beeping is heard taking away the pilots ability to pop counters quickly enough.,Battlefield_4_CTE,d03vsyh,1,t5_35x9r

Its best that BF support ends now and they start fresh with lessons learned from BFBF or so we hope.Considering BF came out in  were waaaay overdue for the next Battlefield title. EA chugged out casual shooters in the meantime like Hardline and Battlefront for some quick easy cash but neither have appealed to the core Battlefield audience.gt CSGO continues to receive support despite being born in Because CSGO was built around longterm competitive play.Battlefield is EAs cash cow where they push everyone to keep buying the next game  DLC. Both publishers are very different in what theyre trying to do. Valve seek longterm stability and building player communities focusing on PC players who embrace those aspects.EA seek shortterm easymoney tactics pushing yearly releases and DLC at every opportunity with consoles being their focus.

I like your idea but after reading the one posted by upotetr i think his idea is way better and flexible we still have the no repair in fight but still some emergency repair.id just point something in addition to all your math...  You forgot the repair switching. When the first repair guy went in cooldwon the pilot bail out and take his place while the repair guy take the pilot slot... By doing this you greatly increase the suvivability of your vehicle... Now imagine this on a boat...But to be honest vehicle need a lot of change to make them effective and teamwork focused Limited ammo No autorepair Limited turret speed Detailed hitbox to allow small weapons to maintain the state in fight like sniper shot in optics or vent etc new physics with some kind of inertiamass system... right now it looks like we pilot paper tank.
