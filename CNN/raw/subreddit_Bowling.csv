The key to switching to a shot using your thumb is not to default to getting back on top of the ball. Stay behind it or even continue to cradle the ball. Then just work on getting the thumb out of the ball clean. Your thumb is really only in the ball for added stability you shouldnt be gripping much at all once you get into your forward swing.,Bowling,cfob5m7,1,t5_2r3ex

I love the game and owe a lot of my life to it.Bowling alleys make their money on open play and birthday parties and unfortunately there is so much more competition for entertainment. We just have to figure out a way to make duckpin bowling more cool.I recently helped stream the oldest running tournament live on YouTube and it was a big success. And this was a tournament without headtohead play. I think Duckpins is a very compelling game to watch because there is more variance.

Usually you can tell if this is a problem if youre occasionally lofting the ball more than usual and you feel more strain on your ring finger during the lift.

Theres not really enough context here to say whether its good or not or if theres an approach that might help you adjust more quickly.That said Ive seen some systems for throwing a handful of predetermined shots to get a read on the lanes before fully deciding how youre going to approach it.  The one Ive been trying to find was in the USBC magazine several years and I think it was an article by Wes Mallott.Personally my first few practice balls for league are generally more focused on getting my bodyarm warmed up so I can hopefully have a couple throws to read the lane conditions before it starts.  ,Bowling,ci4hxn6,1,t5_2r3ex

I have also been experiencing a similar situation and am still figuring out how I should adjust to it. I have shortened my approach which makes me bowl at a slower speed so the hook is more consistent. When the ball pushes out too long and doesnt come back its usually because I am releasing the ball too far away from my body. Ive found that trying to keep my elbow as close to my body has helped my swing and timing a lot. Throughout my swing plane I try to keep the ball between my chin and shoulder.

1706631,0,t1_cju5dla,Ok. . Correct which aspect? The lack of hook or the lack of speed. It depends which release you want to continue with. Either way practice is the key with a focus on either throwing it faster which should be done more with your legs look at how Osku Palermaa generates ball speed with his two handed approach its the quick feet movement into his release that helps generate his high ball speed as a long backswing is basically impossible without putting your thumb in the ball or release specific drills. I know Joe Slowinski from Bowlingknowledge.com has a release drill that you can work on at the lanes and at home the video demonstrating the drill is here. Definitely get a spare ball. It gives you more life on the cover stock of your main ball. You want the same weight you always throw hook potential to be as low as possible with a plastic cover stock. Basically all of the main companies have hard plastics in their range. Storm Ice Columbia White Dot Ebonite Maxims etc etc. They are all essentially the same.. If you can still focus on what youre practicing then go for it. If you find you get distracted and the practice session becomes worthless then go home. It depends on what youre working on as well. Ball speed shouldnt be an issue in that environment accuracy practice maybe a little harder. Maybe when your shifts dictate you must practice in the dark you can work on the aspects of your game that you are able to efficiently work on in that environment while using the other shift in your work to work on other aspects of your game when you have the lights on and quieter music..

1739654,0,t1_cjye9vk, In Bowling even the top money leagues are rec in my opinion.  Maybe I shouldnt call them rec league but that is how I view them.  Sanctioned sporting bodies where the local joe can join and play on a standardized rule set.  A ruleset that is more or less unchanged as you move up through skill levels.  From house league up to the nationalprofessional level should maintain some kind of continuity.  Sport compliant is the only way I can think to say it.  Not every pro shot is sports compliant but they also arent THS so what to call them?  I am just trying to say that providing a standard more difficult shot at the house league level together with stricter enforcement of the rules already in place would be an alternate solution to the awards and financial problems associated with awards.  I would rather get the award I earned but have it be harder to earn as opposed to having it to easy to earn and not get the award each time I should.Regardless its an interesting conversation however you would personally fix the problem.

2521082,0,t3_2oj60q,Im a relatively new bowler and had the same issues as you without too much background info ill try to provide as much tips as possible. The first thing you want to do is find out the oil condition of your lane the Cyclone is made for mediumdry oil so on fresh heavier patterns you wont have much hook if any. The other things to look for is in your stance and grip. Bowling traditionally you want to put your fingers in and thumb last make sure your hand is BEHIND the ball throughout the swing earlier today I was breaking my wrist close to no hook. As soon as I kept it behind the ball on backswing I produced higher revolutions and more hook. If you are having trouble on consistency make sure you are throwing it the right height by this I mean some bowlers tend to lob balls  up to  down the lane others like to release close to the ground. Depending on the height and angle of release your ball will react differently to the oil it lands on so try to throw it low or lob it but not both. Be consistent in your release. If you are like me with medium reactive balls on heavy oil you may have trouble on consistent aim for example losing shots due to really erratic gutterballs or just completely missing your target then you might find it helpful to stay lower to the ground on your release and keeping your left shoulder in front of your body if youre a right handed bowler. If you have any sort of blisters on your hands from bowling make sure its not cause youre speed bowling take time between shots if it still bothers you try adjusting your finger holes with a pro shop for me my thumb had blisters with no inserts but as soon as I put one in it stopped. Cleaning your ball regularly with a microfiber towel between shots and USBC sanctioned cleaner every game will help you from having oil all over your hands and keeps your ball in good condition. Last piece of advice I could say is to have fun and dont get discouraged from one or two bad games unless you are planning on going pro remember bowling is a sport and social game not a job you will bowl better with a clear mind than one full of stress.

2531528,0,t1_cmouov0,Well.. its tough. You simply need to focus on executing because its hard to forgive yourself if you dont even give the ball a chance  IE throw a rocket down the side throw OB or pull it. What makes it really difficult isnt even really the mental aspect of it its more of the physical aspect you can calm yourself down mentally with relaxed breathing and a calm approach but your body will likely betray you. You start getting butterfliesanxious and the shakes n stuff. It gets worse with every ball . Your performance suffers because you cant control your body very well. Honestly it helps if you dont think about it that much just fool around on your cellphone or something when youre not bowling to keep your mind off it. When you go to bowl just focus on making a pure shotstroke off your hand in the area of your mark that gives you an opportunity to strike.If you get close enough on a regular basis youll most likely succeed eventually. Try bowling anchor on your team or something to help learn how to be clutch. The pressure situations when you NEED to strike once twice or three times in the th in order for your team to win have similar mental and potentially physical feelings. Obviously if the stakes are less like its just bowling for a win week  of a  week league but its a good way to memorize the feeling and how to harnessembraceconquer it.Long story short expect your heart to race stomach to churn and legs to turn to jelly for shots  and  for your first attempts at . Its essentially an inevitable feeling being on the cusp of what youve always worked toward achieving and trying to succeed.

2684067,0,t1_cn8wy14,I dont mean to be harsh or anything but thats probably not gonna fly if you show up at a pro shop and ask to have a ball drilled like that. Before you get too comfortable throwing the ball like that you should start throwing it with your middle and ring fingers in the correct holes.

3531506,0,t1_cpusdts,You have good form as far as your approach goes but you are a little fast and throw a backupstraight ball. Getting an angle on the headpin is paramount to pin carry and makes it so you dont have to hit the same exact spot every time. My advice for you would be to move right slow down and try to get under the ball and  get a more natural hook. Start that by ball with hand directly under it. Keep it there the  whole tlswing until your release when you are going to turn your wrist  degrees to the left. Just picture in your mind the ball coming off with a top roll  degrees from north to south. Of course having the right gear is key. You need something like a reactove resin ball and you need finger tips which help give you lift and rotation. Your local pro can help. You can get a previous year ball for cheap these days.,Bowling,cputdr2,2,t5_2r3ex

They are not down unless they are down in their final position.Check out this video of Bill McNeil where a pin was flipped completely around and bounced back up and what looked like a strike was no longer a strike.,Bowling,cpwk4g2,2,t5_2r3ex

Managing expectations is the most important part of any big change.  Dont expect to see any immediate benefits and dont give up if the results are slow in coming.  I spent the first few months just building enough strength in my left arm and wrist before I could seriously throw a respectable  shot.

Search tiered taping on Youtube. This helped flatten my thumb on release instead of bending it inside the thumb hole on release causing it to stick.

Ill preface it by saying that Im a right hander and I throw straight and hard at my spares especially the corner pins.    So youll want to aim at the inside edge of the  pin hit it super hard for two reasons.  you want to kick this pin out of the pit so its gonna have to be trucking after you hit it and  if the ball is moving fast itll clear out of the way quicker to clear a path for the pin as it shoots out of the pit.    If this miracle happens the pin should pop out of the pit and roll or sometimes bounce across the deck and take the  or  pin.

5385488,0,t1_cw017yb,Think of it like this if you got mud on your car door youd wash the whole car not just the door.    Its not a perfect analogy but you get my point. When you resurface a ball even if its the size of a quarter you are taking some of the cover away I realise it is a tiny amount but it is still some It makes more sense that if you need to remove some from the cover that you remove the same amount all over.    This works from the thinking that if youre blending plugging to the existing surface that you are going to touch the existing surface while blending the plugging in. I personally dont know that it would be possible to cut down and then surface up a piece of plugging without so much as even touching any of the preexisting cover at all i.e. only making contact with the plugging at all times only.    Its also not just about that it doesnt touch the lane most people also like their bowling balls to look good along with having them perform at their best. Its not on your track is no excuse for bad looking plugging work or not repairing damage to a ball and I hear that from bowling center staff all the time.

6423784,0,t1_czjd4u4,No youre not. Your fingers should be below the equator of the ball equator meaning the straight line through center of ball. Fingers being higher or resting on top of the ball at release means you arent getting revs but just spin. Think of a top. Spin wont do much for hooking. Believe me I had this problem when I first started. And even after practicing I thought I had it figured out. Video taped myself again and noticed I still had a broken wrist.

I am averaging around a ish not great I know and am learning how to hook a ball because I was throwing it in this weird way with back spin and super straight. I am at a house where some people when they have quit bowling they just dropped their balls off. Well I recently starting throwing a black beauty there because the finger holes are basically a perfect fit for me. However a lot of times I am hitting Brooklyn. I would like to get my own ball possibly a little lighter so I might be able to get some more speed on it. I am honestly not sure what that one weighs if I had to guess I would say lbs.

On one hand I understand that you should be expected to mark if you have the chance to. On the other hand I understand that its not fair that someone who makes a spare in the tenth frame doesnt get put in the position where they can still leave an open but someone who makes a strike the BETTER result can actually still be punished if they leave a split.

6879113,0,t1_d0vyhr0,Imagine bowling on a really large lane like basketball court sized. Every ball you throw will curve but eventually it will straighten out and travel in a straight line as opposed to rolling in circles forever. When laying out a ball you want this straightening to occur past the pins so you will never see it. This is happening a good  feet before the pins in the video. The result will be higher deflection as you hit the pocket meaning more corner pins. It would be interesting to see how many corner pins that bowler left in an unedited video.,Bowling,d0w286b,2,t5_2r3ex

6889476,0,t1_d0x8366,Well...Ill give it a shot though you clearly get worked up about this beyond reason and find it necessary to insult people instead of having an honest debate.The youngest bowler in history to win a major is a two handed bowler. Coincidence? I dont think so.Why doesnt everyone do it? Well thats up to each person but I would put most of the reasons into the following categories.. The vast majority of bowlers have spent years bowling correctly er I mean in the traditional one handed style. Thinking they would suddenly switch to two handed bowling  and relearn bowling is ridiculous.. Many are of the opinion that two handed bowlers look like dorks when they bowl.. Many actually believe what they say when they assert that two handed bowling should not be allowed so why would you change to a style you campaign against?Higher rev rates are an advantage in bowling. Bowling two handed makes it easy for anyone to achieve extremely high rev rates. Too easy. Two handed fans are fond of knocking down straw men with arguments like Then you would support banning one handers with a  rev rate? Any one handed bowler with those kind of rev rates achieved that through natural physical prowess and tremendous skill. ANY bowler of average physical ability can fling a ball two handed for a  rev rate.I dont really care if anyone bowls two handed or with their feet. I just think its boring to watch and bad for the game.,Bowling,d0x8mop,1,t5_2r3ex
6917173,0,t1_d106dh2,Thanks! And ya I mean I get that but I have tried countless times to throw quicker faster and it never worked. Tried speeding up footwork raising ball position lowering ball position high back swing low back swing different releases etc. anytime Id try to throw it harder Id either lose all my revs because I couldnt get my hand around the ball on the release properly or if feel like i was throwing it faster but Id just be muscling it which was worse.And like i said whatever I did tonight just clicked. Very strange. Started by where I held my ball to start  up in my chest area with my wrist kind of tucked in... And I stood more straight starting out. Then I just brought it back with the ball pointing out and my wrist on the inside of the ball while I usually do the opposite which was bad. I kind of was dramatic about making sure I did this and I seemed to do it well because when i did this it allowed me to throw the ball as hard as I wanted and still get a shit load of reaction out of the ball down the lane. Idk what it looked like from someone elses view but from what I was seeing out of the ball on the lanes it was pretty lol. ,Bowling,d10duyr,1,t5_2r3ex

7048764,0,t1_d1faywl,The Hyroad will be overall weaker than the skyrocket. With the slower speed however the hyroad will start to hook a little earlier on you. The Hyroad is a great ball and Im actually about to buy one but I think a pearl ball will fit what you are looking for better atm. Will the hyroad get deep before hooking? Yes it will but the Skyrocket should get you there straighter and hit the pocket harder on its turn for your style.look at the general shape the Skyrocket would provide in their example. They are listing it on a medium amount of oil and on a pretty short pattern. On your every day house shot for your style youd play the ball at the second arrow and straight down. Youd see the ball go really straight then right as it hit the dry just kind of start moving at the pocket. Will be relatively sudden looking compared to the balls you have now. I say straight down because youll have a longer pattern likely than they show and youll be able to play it straight with your lower rev rate. I also think youll be able to save more of the energy with this pearl ball than you would with a hybrid like the hyroad so the sky rocket would hit the pins harder for you.,Bowling,d1fc2vw,1,t5_2r3ex

7194275,0,t1_d1vl7td,Ok again I apologise for coming over rude or obnoxious  that wasnt my intention  ... Stance ... from behind you are starting with the ball way outside your shoulder I know youre a big guy but the starting position of the ball will make you swing the ball around your body with this you are instantly fighting to get the ball to go straight down the lane by swinging it around you more .... in your stance  do this at home infront of a mirror  have a look at where your ball is then adjust it to be infront of your shoulder you want a swing plane to be straight like a pendulum .... do this at  home film yourself from behind for  minutes a day key word is muscle memory... if you do this in time it will become natural and youll find yourself doing it automatically. ... approach ... if you can switch to a  step.... this will help with your balance and jerky start most people step on the first step of a  step but all you need is a small slide its key to getting into your second step smoothly which is also your ball presentation step the slide need only be half a foot but you need to get the second step going straight away ... again  at home infront of a mirror will help you more than at the bowling alley it needs to feel natural when you do it. Your second step needs to come in font of you st slide step to allow room for the ball to swing by your hip without the ball swinging around you the rest of the steps are just normal walking to delivery....speed ... slow down your feet to get the rhythm right do a practice swing with your ball count how long it takes from starting position through the swing back to starting position ...  dont release the ball and dont walk... just swing  its normally around  seconds ... this should be how long it takes you to go through your approach this will help you to get your timing right from  step your second  ball presentation step all the way through to delivery. Remember... just walk. You dont need to put much into it youre a big guy and you can get plenty of power on the ball without forcing it ....Talking of forcing it .........relax ... youre muscling the ball and thats mainly due to the ball swinging around your body and you fighting to bring it back in line which in turn is just sending the ball down the lane with not much reaction at the end of the lane. To help relax your arm on the approach .. dont be afraid to do a practice swing just one though and also shake off your arm to loosen the muscles itll help.... wrist brace ... I have the same brace as you set yours up so you have no cupping and just have your wrist straight ...  personal experience now .... I used to have it set up like you have believe me I got no more revolutions than I got when I wore the brace set up with the wrist straight if you have the wrist straight your release will be easier you wont have as much tension in your arm and your less like to injure your fingers too. You cant bowl cranker with a wrist brace!... hand position. ... you come over the ball at release you dont need to move your wrist at all for the time being anyway as long as your arm and hand is relaxed the ball will come off your hand at the right angle the weight block will do the work on the lane ... start with your hand on the ball with you thumb at  oclock ... ring finger at  ... index at  ... keep it there throughout your swing to release .... KEEP RELAXED.... make sure you keep your arm straight with your forearm pointing at the pins all the way through to release. ...shoulders....keep your shoulders still really really important for having a consistent shot your bowling shoulder opens quite a lot which is fine if youre bowling across the lane but as youre going down the lane you want your shoulders square to the pins. Dont force the backswing just let your bowling arm go as high as it can without muscling it back muscle the ball and your shoulder will move too.Let us know how you do keep the videos coming. ,Bowling,d1vxhom,2,t5_2r3ex

Now in order for the ball the flare those oil rings you see on your ball after you throw it the core needs to be set in an unstable position think of it similar to an electric motor picture it in your head you see the motor then you see the shaft of the motor coming out in the dead center of the motor housing. Now if we were to add a disc lets say a round one and put a hole in the center of the disc attached that to the shaft of the motor and turned it on the motor will spin nice and stable and the disc will stay in place.    Now imagine mounting that disc with the hole at the edge of the disc. Then we turn the motor on and it wobbles like crazy and more than likely the motor will fall over.    Same basic principle here. The closer the pin marks the top center of the coreweightblock is to your pap the less wobble it will produce. This gets tricky though as the wobble factor increases to a point then begins to decrease again once you pass that butter zone.    So PSOs need to find that point so we know where to position the weighblock in order to get the reaction youre looking for.    For example if I lay out the same ball the same way for two bowlers with different PAPs i.e. pin in the same place relative to the finger holes the ball will react slightly different for each bowler as the core was in a different position when they released it causing it to roll differently.    Sorry if that was a little ELI...,Bowling,d223na7,9,t5_2r3ex

7409524,0,t3_4gsegj,Im also about to work on increasing ball speed so I may have something to add here. Im throwing about . mph but Im almost certainly a larger person than you are Im   lbs so that explains the difference in our baseline speeds.Before I say anything else the number one thing that can improve your average is working on your spares. Until every nonsplit spare is a gimme you can improve your average by improving your spare shooting. Get a spare ball and learn to love it. That doesnt mean you cant work on other things but never forget to be working on your spare game.So ball speed. The first thing you absolutely have to learn is to never try to throw the ball. Your arm has nothing to do with your power. The more that you just let your arm swing free the easier it will be to increase ball speed. Get all of the arm muscles out of your swing with the possible exception of your forearm with any cock or cup that you may be doing. Next youll hear a lot of advice on how to increase ball speed. The two most common that I have heard is to increase the height of your ball swing and to increase your foot speed. Foot speed is the more natural option and is what I plan on working on. But lets address the backswing as well.Yes increased height in the backswing will increase your ball speed. It increases the time that gravity is accelerating your ball through your downswing. But it is very very difficult to maintain control with higher backswings. Higher backswing also increases your bodys natural desire to add muscle in the arm during your swing which is bad. Most bowlers that I see with higher backswings began in youth bowling when their bodies were more able to mold the game around those physical demands around that high swing. I dont know anyone with a high swing that didnt start in their teens at the latest. So yes it works but I dont think it is something that can be added to a game later in life.So that leaves us with foot speed. There are two easy adjustments to increasing foot speed. One is starting farther back on the approach. This is something Im working on because even at my height I start at the forward dots. That said all that does for me is to increase the length of my first two steps. It might be different for you. The second thing that you can easily try to do is to trick your body into moving faster with your feet. To do this begin your balls pushaway sooner. For me I have a fivestep approach and my pushaway doesnt start until half way into my second step. I have become to rely on this in order to make my timing later to increase the pop that I can get on the ball. My last step gets to the line well ahead of my ball which helps me have more hand. So what I plan on working on in the next few weeks is to begin my push away sooner. This will feel very weird at first but that is what it is supposed to feel like. I need to trick my body into thinking that my ball is too far ahead of my natural timing making my feet push my body to the line faster in order to maintain my preferred late timing.This might work. It might not. If it doesnt Im going to pay for a coaching session to get new ideas. I would recommend coaching for you regardless though. ,Bowling,d2kexll,7,t5_2r3ex

GET VERY LOW on release maximize the highth you do have. You dont have to two hand or two finger. work on getting your hand out quicker you dont have to open hand your release ala PDW but the faster your fingers come out relative to how far around the ball they have to move before coming out the higher your rev rate.

9429866,0,t1_d9aexft,gt Not really.gtgt  first number aka drilling angle controls the transition from hook to roll. Lower number  quicker transition.gtgt     second number pintoPAP controls how dynamic the core is going to be. Usually want this to be in the . range but you can do some trick drillings with a  pin or a superlong pin if needed.gt    third number aka VAL angle controls length before the ball transitions from skid to hook. Higher number  less skid.Im pretty sure those are backwards.  The drilling angle is supposed to control how soon the ball starts up i.e. skid to hook where the VAL angle is supposed to control how quickly the ball responds at the break point i.e. hook to roll.Its also worth mentioning that with symmetrical balls the PSA once the ball is drilled will typically be near the middle of the thumb hole so there isnt as much control over the drilling angle there.  You can move the PSA and narrow the drilling angle by putting in a P or P balance hole to get the ball to start up a bit sooner.  I know that the Jackal is an asym ball but just wanted to mention it since some of the other balls mentioned in the thread are symmetricals.Sources,Bowling,d9bata4,1,t5_2r3ex

I dont use it too much at all though it never seems to get a consistent reactionInteresting. Hows that one laid out? Any chance you could post a picture of that too?My guess is that the Snap LockHyRoad gap is just too much of a ball down for you to deal with in most cases tbh.gt Heres the drilling. Dont know the exact terms sorryNot a problem at all on the terms  just wanted to get a feel for how your Snap Lock was set up so that picture was quite helpful Heres my question for you are you looking for something thats going to be earlier and more overall hook than your Snap Lock? Or are you wanting something to help bridge that gap between your Snap Lock and HyRoad? You need to figure out the answer to this question before you start making specific decisions tbh. Ill go ahead and answer for both of those options though Bridge the gap Storm Rocket Ship  few boards less hook than the Snap Lock while also reading the lane a few feet earlier. Looking at ye olde ubowlingballcom Perfect Scale that gives you Snap Lock . Rocket Ship . HyRoad . Plus the sequencing of pearl asym gt sanded solid symmetric gt polished hybrid symmetric will give you different looks that make sense as you go through transition throughout the night.Hook monster Storm Phaze II. Will hook about the same as the Snap Lock in my experience just with an earlier and rounder shape downlane. I personally think the bowlingball.com Perfect Scale is a pinch low on this one as they have it at a . full comparison of ball setup while I had this ball a few boards more than the Snap Lock at a demo day a few weeks ago.I actually had a chance to throw a lot of StormRG gear at a demo day a few weeks ago writeup is here and everything Ive mentioned here aside from the HyRoad is covered in that post.

10253764,0,t3_5mtsc1,Lefties are actually at an advantage usually when you take into account the oils on the lane. After a bunch of right handed bowlers have been using the lane the oils will be dried from the right side. Because there are far less left handed bowlers than right handed the oils on the left side will not dry as fast from use which means you dont have to adjust your throws as often. Also house balls are not weighted so they are not designed to hook. If you buy a ball from a pro shop it will be designed to curve even if its thrown in a straight line. You can throw a house ball so it spins and moves in a hook but that is not what they are designed to do. If you buy a ball you should have more luck if you are working on curves and such.I hope that makes sense. Sounds like you may just be getting into bowling.

10426954,0,t1_dcprl6w,Hmmmm. Id say my answer depends on what youre looking for reactionwise. Are you looking for something with a similar amount of hook and a different shape or something that hooks a bit less than the Rocket Ship to work more as a ball down and to help bridge the gap between your Rocket Ship and Scout?As far as the Code Black compliment the Phaze II would be a FANTASTIC choice. I had a chance to throw both the P and CB at a demo day recently and they worked very well for me as a  punch. While the Snap Lock is good I think that it would be too similar to the Code Black and I do think that having just a Lock  Code Black would be too aggressive. Im leaning Phaze II if he wants more overall hook or if he wants a different shape but similar hook then probably a Storm IQ Tour the blue one or a Roto Grip Dare Devil.Im figuring you guys are both wanting to stay in the StormRG family btw?Also if it helps I had a chance to try a bunch of gear at a StormRG demo day last month ,Bowling,dcpypm6,2,t5_2r3ex

10450995,0,t1_dcsp9nd,Prior to last week I was dealing with about a  week slump I had a ish league average that dropped to  in that time and was getting more and more frustrated each week. Last week I finally felt like I was back and honestly the one thing I did differently was just focus on making sure my mechanics were sound. I think each week I was just looking for more and more what was wrong with what I was doing that I forgot completely about all of the things I was doing RIGHT prior to the one bad week. Just focus on executing your shot and the scores will likely follow.To add to this there is a great post on the sidebar titled Anatomy of a Bowling Slump and if you havent read it there is a lot of good information in there that was applicable to what I was going through.As far as keeping concentration during the three games its important to just try and have fun while remaining competitive if thats your style. The nights that go the best for me tend to be ones where Im just chatting with friends and barely even realize whats going on scorewise. Easier said than done but definitely what works best for me. ,Bowling,dcspwcw,1,t5_2r3ex

10454316,0,t1_dcmmvu2,I should amend that statement slightly. I have a dv thug corrupt hybrid that I have had some success with but it really didnt do what I had hoped it would. I wanted a ball that went longer but looking at the low rg on it that was probably never going to work. I thought a hybrid cover would be enough to get the length but what Ive seen tells me it is not the case. I dont know how to read my layouts but I am posting a couple of pictures of a few of my balls all are laid out pretty similar. I also have a hammer spike which Ive never really felt comfortable throwing but its likely to be a head thing. Btw current avg  high career avg . x   ,Bowling,dct3mk9,1,t5_2r3ex

10533491,0,t1_dd1uib7,Yeah thats kinda what I thought.I do have a few general tipspieces of advice for you Norm Duke PBA pro whos had a long run of success has an excellent series of tutorial videos on YouTube. Definitely watch those. I also noticed from your other comment that youre using a step delivery at the moment... itll feel weird at first but I would definitely recommend doing a step delivery. That will give your arm more time to swing by itself so you wont have to muscle it as much as most step bowlers do. When practicing getting video of yourself bowling is very helpful as a form of instant feedback. I keep a gorillapod in my backpack thats designed to hold my iPhone  if I want to get video of myself and Im practicing solo I just put that on a chair or something and off I go. I would definitely start thinking about getting your own ball amp shoes sooner rather than later  this will give you a lot more consistency versus relying on house balls and also you will always know whos been using your ball amp shoes  I actually wrote a beginners gear guide recently that should be pretty helpful Hope this helps a bit!

10572512,0,t1_dd6g7hv,Its actually an original DV Reckless. The ball is on its third drill. Im not sure I want to change anything about the ball yet. It still rolls great I just shot  with it tonight. I guess I was curious if drilling the cg marker out and plugging it had any measurable effect after drilling the layout. And if so could that be another avenue of controlling ball reaction. Ive been thinking a lot about weight distribution and fine tuning. Some of my best equipment are on their second or third drill and I typically track over the plugs on those balls. Im thinking about getting two of the same balls and putting the same layout on them but one has been drilled not previously. I know theres an article on Bowling This Month that addressed that already but the point of that was to say that any differences are miniscule even if they are measurable. My thinking is if its possible to create a measurable difference can I use the to my advantage. ,Bowling,dd6gzyd,1,t5_2r3ex

11152013,0,t3_5z25db,I saw this post and checked out my league center and see they have the same promotion.  Agree with some other posters that it is unfortunate the selection is only really strong balls.  With my current ability and my understanding of bowling balls it doesnt seem like I would get any use of two of these balls.  Ill be talking to my wife about joining since I would like to join something over the summer and still seems like a good deal.  Maybe she would be interested in a ball...In the meantime any thoughts to adding to my arsenal from this selection is welcomed.I currently have only a single ball in use.

11492667,0,t3_641ctc,Its not your rev rate. Youre hand is reacting the same on each roll. The problem is your hand isnt in the same position. In the first video your fingers are more behind the ball and in the second to the side. This gives the illusion of more revs but in reality its just the angle youre rolling it. More behind translates to more forward roll but not as much hook down the lane. Fingers to the side will mean more side roll and therefore will hook more.Heres a side by side at the moment of release so you can see for yourself ,Bowling,dfyoy4z,5,t5_2r3ex
