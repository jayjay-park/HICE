6766797,0,t3_42p6j3,Let me tell you something. Im young in shape very handsome and ridiculously intelligent. I have many friends whom I know Ive become very good at reading others emotions enjoy interacting with me. I also have not been in a relationship and not by choice. What usually happens is that women arent romantically attracted to me exact words that I have heard from more than one person. Thats some shit that nothing is gonna help.Im a college dropout I work in a kitchen Ive become bitter and misanthropic and Im going to drink myself to an early grave. It doesnt matter if youre attractive or not youll be lonely anyway. I cant offer any solution beyond not thinking about it  Im bad at not thinking so I became a drunk but if you can find anothe way Id recommend that  booze is expensive. Just dont give a fuck and hope something works out dawg.,loneliness,d0jao7p,1,t5_2rlb9

9602133,0,t3_5cft2d,Fuck man thats awful. I think all you can do is pick up the pieces and keep on living. Maybe find some new hobbies to throw yourself into  plus you will meet new people doing that and maybe make some friends.I have had good luck with meetup.com for finding friends to do activities with. Just think of something youd like to do and search for it on there. They have all kinds of groups and people willing to help a noob join in... Dungeons amp Dragons dinner groups disc golf biking book clubs sailing kayaking camping etc,loneliness,d9wnquw,2,t5_2rlb9
11152932,0,t3_5y732l,This is a really good point.  And I think its especially noticeable on social media.  When I see people connecting on facebook or twitter I get even more jealous.  Whats wrong with me?  Why cant I connect with people like that?  In my mind I make their connection into this big grand friendship that I dont have when in reality its just a couple people joking around.This undeserved jealousy is just fuel to my loneliness.  So this is a good way of thinking about it.  Thanks for posting.,loneliness,dew68mq,2,t5_2rlb9
