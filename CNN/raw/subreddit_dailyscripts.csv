9946932,0,t1_db3imv2,Thanks for the reply!Ive tried editing a few numbers here and there and sometimes it removes the event altogether but other things Ive had luck with such as increasing the size of the dungeon by just multiplier the numbers it gave me on the x and y by .Its also called Dungeon of the Endless.Sometimes tweaking the numbers have resulting in certain things not working despite raising the numbers for example there was a  exitmobwaves  event in the samesimilar structure to this piece of code here.I figure I could increase the amount of monster waves on the exit  an event to which you have to run through constant spawning to spawn more mobs within the same time frame but it ended up being the same.Edit This particular code is in regards to a random event which gives the player an increase in resources tempoararily. ,dailyscripts,db43znw,1,t5_2xzmb
