1851835,0,t1_ckbea62,Agreed. This and Outlander are the only two new shows Im currently watching. Extant isnt that bad either. I wonder what the problem is? Too little advertising perhaps?,theknick,ckccars,4,t5_2xc86

2046960,0,t3_2i7j0l,Wow what an episode. Its a little shocking to think that there are only two left. If last weeks episode was Thack and his staff at their moral best than this is a peek into their worst or most extreme. Last weeks episode Ep.  Get the Rope was all about how racist th century mores still existed  this weeks episode is about how the coming th century will clash with all that. As Thack says in the first scene Sex pleasure immodesty us here nowthis is no sin. And in this episode everyone displays vices that might destroy them. Lucy is hooked on both cocaine and Thack. Thack is so wreaked on drugs and his brused ego one can sense the wings that carry him are starting to melt. Cornelia and Edwards relationship while more normal than Thack and Lucys has a sense of danger. Meanwhile poor Bertie seems stuck in s not just with his taste of art the artist he was referring to before he told Thack he was out of cocaine was Paul Gauguin but with his manner of courting Lucy. We are also seeing the opening of the future by way of Thack being overshadowed by Dr. Levi Zinberg a Jew. It will be interesting to see if Thacks dislike of Zinberg is because he is Jewish or because he is deflating Thacks ego. Also we might see a fracture in the BertieThack relationship. Even Berties own father knows the power Thack holds over Bertie. But Berite wants to grow without being held down from his father or overshadowed by Thack. I can only imagine these sense of betrayal he will feel when he finds out.Major props has to be given to Owens performance this week. By acting so messed up we can really see how good Owen is. Soderbergh and Owen did a great job showing how addicted Thack really is with those intense closeups. I just cant wait for the final two.A couple other thoughts Eve Hewson Lucy Maya Kazan Eleanor and Melissa McMeekin Mary Mallon were on their Agame as well. When I first heard that Bonos daughter was going to be on the show I was skeptical. She has really grown on me. As for Kazan we can really feel her pain of course coming from a movie family dynasty helps Her grandfather is the famous movie director Elia Kazan her grandmother is playwright Molly Kazan and her father is screenwriter Nicholas Kazan. McMeekin played smug so well you just wanted to reach across the screen and wash her mouth with soap. It was great to see backstory on Thack and Lucy. Interesting that both came from religious backgrounds and both seem to reject those teachings. Im still on the fence about the Gallinger character. He still seems to be a bit underwritten but we get a lot more this week and Gallingers actor Eric Johnson is doing a great job.   ,theknick,cl00ic7,23,t5_2xc86

5586693,0,t3_3rn58e,I watched some of your Shakuhachi flute videos and was curious if there was any chance of Ping Wu playing the Shakuhachi flute somewhere down the line in The Knick. Has this been discussed or entertained? Or even a collab between yourself and Cliff Martinez?Thanks for doing this AMA and thank you for introducing me to Shakuhachi flutes. They are so peaceful! Im looking forward to Ping Wus story arc in Season !,theknick,cwpkxu1,1,t5_2xc86

5736052,0,t1_cx80sje,Interesting! What do you think would happen when Algy finds out and he goes to the hospital board to complain sue etc? They will be forced to take Algys side or Gallingers side. I dont really know what to expect but if Gallinger is to take the actions you predict he must have thought about the consequences. ,theknick,cx843lz,1,t5_2xc86

5812163,0,t1_cxhag2f,Ahh I see what you mean now. I really fear they wont renew. We would have had a signal by now. I just hope someone else HBO? can pick it up same cast amp crew and keep it going. This show drives me nuts and nothing comes close to it. ,theknick,cxhjxxc,1,t5_2xc86

5985466,0,t1_cy47bmd,Seems like your right honestly Obamas endorsement and our fan interest might give HBO the interest to wrap it out in a two hour movie like Hello Ladies. It makes sense that Owen and Soderbergh didnt want to commit to a long running series but agreed to do two seasons. ,theknick,cy485cn,5,t5_2xc86

6007569,0,t3_3xqkqc,Christ that was a plot reveal of an article. So much good news!Weve all been squabbling over whether or not TK ought to continue without Thack. And I think Soderbergh has now given us all a satisfying answer two year narrative cycles with a different director each turn. I hope the writers carry out his wish of two seasons at once. That would be amazing.,theknick,cy74gem,6,t5_2xc86
6023881,0,t1_cy9837y,I really wanted to believe that Thack was still alive but he was so damn stubborn when he wouldnt let anybody perform the routine surgery. I was so pissed at him! It sucks that his final monolog or final sentences were his fading consciousness. Clive was perfect for Thack and Ill miss him dearly in that character.,theknick,cy994nq,1,t5_2xc86
