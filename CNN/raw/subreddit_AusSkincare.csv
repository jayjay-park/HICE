1164674,0,t3_27g7ek,Neat in concept I can imagine it getting pretty pricey though as seen in their FAQ Bespoque makes it easy and affordable to design your own skin care with prices ranging from . to ..They dont really explain how the formulation customisation works though. From what I see it appears to be premade formulations which you lock in with other ones. Eg. Base cream formulation  fragrance  specific base formulation. I assume its to keep costs down since they can have each premade base ready to go rather than a legitimate DIY where you can swap and insert ingredients as you please.Im also curious about packaging it looks like they intend for jar packaging to be the only one available. Would be a shame especially if you intend to create a dupe of some of the Paulas Choice products since jar packaging isnt stable.,AusSkincare,ci0n8iz,2,t5_310nr
1559961,0,t1_cjbr2vl,it completely dehydrated and irritated my skin or something ended up with massive pustules and closed comedomes for months which im only now seeing the back end with because oh the pigmentation. I ordered the same one you got since. I couldnt find any others in NZ and everyone seems to rave about it. Also because everyone here says its totally noncomedogenic so i wanted to be as pure and clean as I could possibly get. Ended up trying hemp seed oil which apparently is better suited for acne prone skin. Its weird how everyone reacts differently to oils! One of my good friends uses coconut oil every night with no issues. Another uses straight olive oil no issues. So far ive found i can use hemp seed oil rosehip oil tamanu oil neem oil and small amounts of argan oil. But mineral olive coconut and jojoba make my face angry.Im glad its working out for you though  good luck on further progress!,AusSkincare,cjbtbo5,1,t5_310nr

1897866,0,t1_ckhvjrv,According to the AusNZ product guide on the sidebar it has  salicylic acid. Also the rSkincareAddiction beginners guide says that chemical exfoliation doesnt stop the need for spot treatment.

1921377,0,t1_ckkorvb,Just as a heads up. Research how to use the Kinky Curly Custard. I find it is best to apply to saturated hair with a small amount. When it dries it can be a bit crunchy dont be alarmed just tousle your hair and they go soft! ,AusSkincare,ckkpnhp,2,t5_310nr

2150909,0,t3_2jl6rp,Ok so this is going to sound a bit crazy. But have you tried Vaseline? I get terrible acne but once every fortnight I do a Vaseline deep cleanse.  I wash my face in the evening then grab a good amount of Vaseline and slasher it over my face.  I then gently rub my face for about  mins  working the Vaseline over and into my skin. I find that its like a really deep oil cleanse. I get heaps of grits coming out of my skin and once Im done my skin feels really soft.  I use a warm damp wash cloth to wipe the Vaseline gently off once Im done and then use my usual nightly products. The next morning my skin always feels super soft and glowy. I alternate this with a queen Helene mint julep mask every other week and I have seen some improvement in my pores  which is a big thing for me coz my skin has always been awful. Vaseline is so cheap to buy so it would be easy to give it a go without investing too much money  ,AusSkincare,cld89kl,2,t5_310nr

2341478,0,t3_2m5cqh,Ive used the Alpha Hydrox and stridex! I much preferred Alpha hydrox to stridex less drying. I didnt use stridex for long enough to see if there was a difference in effectiveness but I can definitely vouch for the Alpha Hydrox. Its not particularly drying and if Im naughty and dont moisturise before bed I can get away with it. I usually wait thirty minutes before moisturising after it or it doenst work apparently.. forgotten why but if youre interested Ill ask my derm friend again.

4457699,0,t3_3c60fd,I know it seems counterproductive for oily skin but you should try hemp seed oil. Its an antiinflammatory so it works to calm down redness and irritation plus its green which will help balance out some of the redness visually. Its also noncomedogenic and high in linoleic acid which is great for treating acne. Because oil is an occlusive it wont moisturise on its own so I would mix it with a gentle fragrancefree moisturiser to help restore your skins barrier. Good luck!,AusSkincare,csskodl,2,t5_310nr
4577226,0,t3_3dogik,I recommend Hamilton Dry Skin Therapy cream My husband used this when he was on Accutane and Ive been using it in winter ever since. Its cheap and works so well. I am very acne prone and it doesnt make me break out.,AusSkincare,ct7kdv0,1,t5_310nr

7512701,0,t3_4i3lr5,I really recommend Essanos Rosehip Collagen Repair Night Creme. Its ml  from Priceline recommended for maturevery dry skin but I still use it even though I have dehydrated combination skin which is very prone to closed comedones. Its a heavier moisturiser that doesnt break me out! A little goes a long way and I find it lasts for  months with daily use. Essano also does a  rosehip night creme but its meant for combination skin.,AusSkincare,d2w5niv,1,t5_310nr
7678353,0,t1_d3eqrtk,I agree. Witch hazel even without alcohol is a common irritant so Id quit using that.,AusSkincare,d3ezel5,4,t5_310nr
7745544,0,t3_4l9sje,A couple of options for you! First of all the no extra purchase route Use a little extra sukin toner which is a very good costeffective option and easily accessible since Priceline carries the brand and consider using your oil under or mixed in with your moisturiser. Ive seen mentioned below that you put the oil over the moisturiser  which is ok but you might notice some extra hydration if you layer the moisturiser on top so that the penetration enhancers help the oil sink in better and do its job more effectively.If you are certain you are unsatisfied with the sukin toner these two options grabbed my attention after a quick browse on the Priceline site. A note on essano I am using their serum at the moment and its very effective for combating dark marks but the fragrance was much stronger than expected which could be a problem with this toner too. Up to you! iHerb has a boatload of naturalorganic options as well  too many to list in a post that is already silly long.If those two also dont impress you and you are looking for something more sophisticated you will probably be more happy with Paulas Choice toners which are not Australian or naturalorganic only but have some lovely options of chemicalorganic mixes that sound like a nice treat for all skins.On a closing note  a nonacid toner is very unlikely to be a miracle and you will likely be disappointed if you expect it to be the powerhouse of your routine. If hydration is your primary concern plant oils and hyaluronic acid serums will make you much happier but I dont want to make this post even longer by reccomending various oils too... Good luck in your hunt OP ,AusSkincare,d3mm1mk,2,t5_310nr
7843933,0,t1_d3xoton,It is although you may experience some irritationtingling of sensitive skin at first. Id recommend the Neutrogena retinol night cream its cheap enough just to see if you like it first. Another very important point with retinol usage and other actives like vitamin c aha bha is that you should always use sunscreen in the morning since it increases the sensitivity of your skin to the sun so you might be doing more harm to your skin by skipping sunscreen. Id actually start with that first before adding retinol! Check out the skincare addiction subreddit for product recs etc ,AusSkincare,d3xq6wr,2,t5_310nr

9626886,0,t1_d9zlrwc,Dont use the clay mask every night. By removing oils your skin will produce even more to compensate. Try adding rosehip oil in the evening. Sukin is sold at chemist warehouse. Stridex is a BHA available from iherb. The neutrogena moisturiser I recommend has HA in it. Cleanse Stridex Neutrogena Hydro Boost then either Rosehip oil in PM OR Sunscreen in AM. If you strip your skin from moisture and do not replace it your skin will produce more oil. ,AusSkincare,d9zpmu9,1,t5_310nr
