3111005,0,t3_2vrwzp,I honestly feel like both play pretty different in my opinion. I own both with all expansions for reference.E is a dungeon crawl straight through unless you play Road to Legend. Youll sit down for a couple of hours sometimes a few hours for the bigger dungeons and work hard to survive through a dungeon and complete the goal usually killing the boss.E is more of a campaign and a fairly short one at that. The E campaign is absolutely massive. I absolutely love the leveling of class skills and the fact that a cleric role exists no healer in E at all. While you can play some of the maps as a dungeon crawl it just isnt the same. There isnt that sitting down for multiple hours and trying to get to that big baddie at the end.I like both games. Descent E is great if your players cant be consistent and play all the time since its choice for noncampaign is fantastic. Its great if you want to play in a session or two and really feel the difficulty of beating that dungeon. E just cant replicate this. The overlord has A LOT of power in E by the way. Their customization is very good with their deck. They truly are a dungeon commander. in E the OL feels more like an obstacle than a boss.E is great if you have players that can play all the time together. The heroes themselves are much more fun and personalized with classes. There are multiple campaigns with different stories and themes so if you are more into that E is a much better choice.Honestly if they could bring the hero skills and powers to E and consistently release new and exciting dungeons E would be a perfect game for me.Theres a lot more nuances between the two but I think you get the idea. ,JourneysInTheDark,cokgdh7,3,t5_34js8
4978210,0,t3_3j3kwt,I got you. For most..... These were found on Boardgamegeek.com a very useful site. LOTWTrollFensSoNLoRCant find one for Manor of Ravens but there are images available for that somewhere for sure. ,JourneysInTheDark,cum1h80,3,t5_34js8
7573843,0,t1_d32vckm,Eh not bad.  Loving the stats across all the campaigns.The inability to go back and change entries after its been entered is a bit of a hassle.  My players are notorious for changing their minds about skills about a half dozen times before the next game session.,JourneysInTheDark,d333xni,1,t5_34js8
7945291,0,t3_4o0zgd,They are all disconnected. If you want a bit more information on eachLabyrinth of Ruin allows the heroes to recruit and level up one of two allies and the Overlord gets the other as a Lieutenant. It also includes some of my favorite hero classes and my single favorite hero  fair warning once Logan as a Treasure Hunter hits your table he might never leave. If I recall correctly this expansion also includes the Basic II deck for the Overlord  a somewhat less cheeseridden basic Overlord deck. It relies more on skill checks than the first Basic deck but can be more powerful especially against a party lacking in one or two skills.Shadow of Nerekhall includes special campaign rules that arent public knowledge  the Overlord gets to make some choices the players dont see until the adventure tells them to. This often includes more powerful oneoff monsters given to the Overlord as a reward for winning quests. The expansion also includes the Unkindess Overlord class which lets you summon a Raven familiar to really harass players. The hero classes each have a unique mechanic I think is pretty cool but all but one of them failed to really wow my hero players. The awesome one Conjurer can get pretty ridiculous.Depending on when you bought your base set it might have come with Heirs of Blood. If it didnt you can buy it as a separate book. I havent had the chance to play this campaign but from flipping through it it seems to make much more heavy use of Artifacts than the other campaigns.The small box expansions are each intended to be played as sidequests to main campaigns. You can play each as its own minicampaign but nothing really stands out about any of them. My table stopped using them as sidequests  we found the sidequests too clunky to be worth it and more of a chore for the players than a potentially valuable resource. Your tables opinion may vary.,JourneysInTheDark,d494igv,2,t5_34js8

8828887,0,t3_511mbk,Itd be nice  but I really want more Road to Legend content first!,JourneysInTheDark,d793xrg,1,t5_34js8
8963243,0,t1_d7l1ls8,Ive tried both RAOV and RAMV RedJacks Automated Monster Variant and RAMV is actually more streamlined and a bit less finicky to use IMO.  Both are excellent.,JourneysInTheDark,d7p8wbw,1,t5_34js8
9120586,0,t3_557ckg,I dont believe theres a way to have the game drop the third player that Ive seen. Weve had campaigns where players sometimes make it that night and sometimes they dont. We either agree ahead of time to keep playing their character for them in their absence if theyre still interested in playing or the two of us that are playing more regularly just start our own campaign. If you know the rd player wont be back Id lean towards starting over with just the  of you.,JourneysInTheDark,d8859d3,3,t5_34js8
10303763,0,t1_dcbyyf8,Yeah Ive search everywhere to see if they intended to do changes but found nothing..,JourneysInTheDark,dcbzjci,1,t5_34js8
10483612,0,t3_5q1zhe,Use your minions to slow the players down. Bog them down in hallways and corners. Theyll lose their objectives this way most of the time. And dont forget to draw an OL card every time you knock one of them down. ,JourneysInTheDark,dcwfcbp,1,t5_34js8
10592516,0,t1_dd8j7ll,Yeah it sucks as Id love to flip over a treasure chest or secret room but its simply not built into the app. Theres no way to add them. ,JourneysInTheDark,dd8jba1,2,t5_34js8
10750703,0,t1_ddavlw4,I realise this post is almost  weeks old but for posteritys sake please note that while the app allows you to relocate your skills the rules of the game doesnt!,JourneysInTheDark,ddoupdn,1,t5_34js8
11276663,0,t1_df3vnfa,Why do you think the conjuror should be banned? Or rather why the conjuror over say Logan Lashley treasure hunter or elder mok Bard and the like?,JourneysInTheDark,dfa6z0z,1,t5_34js8
11666505,0,t1_dgieffu,There actually is no hero I would personally give  because there is no hero that just wins the campaign by picking it unlike some classes fuck conjurer but yes there are mages that outperform her in certain areas. I just think her versatility is straight up bonkers. . would be my guess for widow.,JourneysInTheDark,dgiewbl,1,t5_34js8
