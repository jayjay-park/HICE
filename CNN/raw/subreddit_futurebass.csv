I used to hate all the people that were taking vowels out of their names PYRMDPLAZA SMLE MSTRKRFT but none of that mattered once I realized they were talented artists that made music I enjoy.He picked something that rhymed with Kill Paris in order to make things less confusing for fans. Who cares what hes called? I still love his stuff. Hes still the same person. ,futurebass,czmol9r,2,t5_2stlp

9975549,0,t3_5id3xp,The last note in the melody might sound better as root or one octave lower if it was root. Resolving the melodic tension at the end or between sections i.e. the end of a drop can sound more pleasing and help the transitionmake the ending sound more finalizing. I heard this info somewhere and think it applies here pretty well.Sounds pretty good too. Reminds me I need to actually produce a song sometime soon instead of messing about in serum all the time.,futurebass,db7uayr,2,t5_2stlp
10291090,0,t1_dcaik5n,Oh lol you can see my laziness I didnt fully read your post.. I mean you also have flume haha which is probably the biggest influence in future bass. Tenis Court remix was posted ages ago and is nothing but pure future bass. All those old Flume classics are the biggest influence in my opinion.Ik flume is not relevant to your question but otherwise thats the purest influence I know of,futurebass,dcajub8,1,t5_2stlp
