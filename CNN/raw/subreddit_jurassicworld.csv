4243320,0,t1_cs3w47u,Yeah this here but also they should have been building fortification after fortification. They were beginning to know how lethal that thing was. Yet the park had no money.,jurassicworld,cs3xgnw,5,t5_2yh08

4288400,0,t3_3a1omw,You know they had to use at lot of CGI. Thats just what Hollywood does. Its hard to write a movie that is able to attract a wide audience so there had to be something in there for everyone. The divorce was probably a throw back to the Jurassic Park novel the love story was for the romantics even though many of us didnt buy it the female leads underlying struggle about whether to have kids or not was eye roll worthy. BUT regardless of these plot holes and the shameless set up for the sequel it made me feel incredible. Like I was a kid and excited to be alive again. I loved it. ,jurassicworld,cs90vg8,2,t5_2yh08

How did we go from Jurassic World and the worst killing machine ever the Indominus Rex Untamable King to how beautiful Iceland is? Rhetorical Question,jurassicworld,ctkoii2,2,t5_2yh08
5101634,0,t3_3knpw3,How exactly was he supposed to know that the IRex could get through the closing door? A sufficientlystrong door would have forced it to back off or be crushed.Anyway if the enclosure and other security measures had been properly designed e.g. having an airlock style door where one is closed at all times and sending a drone with a camera in to search for the missing animal most likely the incident wouldnt have happened at all.,jurassicworld,cv0xqp3,2,t5_2yh08
