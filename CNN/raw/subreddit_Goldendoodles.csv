4473129,0,t3_3cbawe,We got a fancy Andis Pet ProClip Detachable Clipper with Soft Storage Case with ceramic blades...but it didnt come with ceramic blades so I returned it to Amazon.  But I used it first just to try it out and our dog didnt mind the noise.  So after we returned that we just used the OSTER Classic  that my wife uses to cut my hair.  Just make sure the blade you are using is sharp.  A dull blade will not cut a dogs hair very well.,Goldendoodles,csuidnx,3,t5_2updq

5703465,0,t3_3t73t5,Amount of food depends on several factors weight age nuetered status activity level and most importantly quality of food.Cheaper food tends to have fillers and is less calorically dense thus more of it ending up as waste instead of promoting growth.There are calculators you can use that tell you how much food to give based on this data however I tend to go by the old rib pat.They should have a bit of meat on them but you should still be able to feel the ribs.  Another clue would be if you weigh them and they didnt gain weight over a long enough period during a time when they should be growing.Having said all that if you arent sure just ask the vet every time in the first year I had mine at the vet I asked general questions like how is his weight his coat ect,Goldendoodles,cx42js1,1,t5_2updq

10104069,0,t3_5kkgsp,Im feeding my puppy Taste of the Wild puppy formula. Im not sure how it would do on sensitive stomachs but I know it is grain free. I mix it with wet food because I am trying to get him to gain weight. Weve also been feeding him bil jac and zukes treats. They are both grain free! Zukes are wheatcornand soy free so that may be good for his tummy! Good luck I hope you find something that works! Also I have heard good things about Costco food too. It may be worth a try! ,Goldendoodles,dboklxa,1,t5_2updq

10628590,0,t3_5ry6ar,Buttercup is and FB standard and is a year and a half now and is wonderful. Some of these other commenters are correct it can be tough especially if she doesnt want to do something. But weve kept up with training which I think is key with any dog. Usually if she doesnt want to do something the second or third time I say something she comes along. ,Goldendoodles,ddc9b2m,1,t5_2updq
