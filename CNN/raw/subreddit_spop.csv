2013634,0,t3_2htc3g,Maybe not exactly what one would think of when upon hearing Swedish pop but still a very cool song. The production and lyrics especially the chorus is very Kanyeesque and Lorentz tries his hardest to sound like Drake. JaQe on the other hand sounds a bit like Rick Ross and drops one of his best verses ever. Then theres the breakdownbridge with jj and Duvchi which is just pure bliss although the lyrics are mostly nonsense here I think. To close it off Joy shows that she is one of the strongest female rappers on the Swedish scene with lyrics referencing Snoop Dogg I did not expect this verse to be as hardhitting as it is and her delivery is just flawless. All in all I really dont mind that Lorentz isnt that prominent on this track. One of my favorite Swedish tracks to drop this year probably not new to most natives since I think its been playing a bit on P and whatnot. However it should be new for the foreigners in the sub and hopefully this little text makes you appreciate it even more. Happy listening!,spop,ckvu8hn,1,t5_2ueyu

Masta Ace  Thinking of You Official video  The thing is about Professor P that hes a great freestyler to be honest but it doesnt really show during this video.
