2592516,0,t1_cmwz3ed,Ahh thank you good sir! I made him to play around with the friend I got into the series and just because I like the character in general.Its fun to try to make characters in the creator though Im almost tempted to change my first one to match a character when I finally get the chance to change her features.Care to try Link again? gt Id definitely be interested in seeing the hero of Hyrule in Reveria.,fantasylife,cmwz98f,2,t5_2w0ko

2659215,0,t3_2qfo4z,You can change a few thing such as hairstyle early on in the game around Chapter  or so I think. You can completely change your characters appearance everything besides gender when you reach the DLC Content Chapter .The Fantasy Life IRC Chat found in the sidebar to the right is a good place to meet other players!,fantasylife,cn5ortu,2,t5_2w0ko

2694444,0,t1_cna8ndw,Thanks for your answer! I said about the full attack build only because I like to maximize standard attacks as maximum as possible. I only wondered in make an exception in case if there was any imbalanced setting but according to your information its about point of view. If full atk build you get strongest standard attacks with s. skill gauge rate and creator mode time limit both standards. On the other hand you get average attacks with s. skill gauge rate maximized OR creator mode time limit maximized. It might there is a slightly difference between the setting chosen no more than that though. ,fantasylife,cnaa6qi,1,t5_2w0ko

2781416,0,t3_2rxg3k,Im assuming your question is about item quality. Your skill level plays a part. For example the Metal Smithing skill description says The higher your skill level the better your chances of crafting highquality items.Your Life stat e.g. your Smithing stat increases the rate at which the bar fills up to complete the current step during the crafting minigame. The amount of remaining time affects your item quality though its not as simple as saying  is topquality  is not topquality. Other than that I am unsure if the Life stat directly affects item quality.Your number of Great and Nice results with Great being better will also affect your item quality so make sure you do as well as you can.,fantasylife,cnk8ke9,1,t5_2w0ko

Youre only limited by how you distribute your points but later in the game you can change that. I dont even understand why there is a quiz.

3212112,0,t3_2wx6tk,I just finished chapter  and have just unlocked areas with the quests needed to master lifes. So youll likely have to push on with the story a bit. Like someone else said if you want to pace yourself through the story do the next story chapter when you have no more life quests in areas you have access to. ,fantasylife,couxp69,3,t5_2w0ko
3347337,0,t1_cp9mn9i,gt While the combat system is what it is. Id like to see this vamped in a new way. Again to make it a bit more interesting and feel less button mashy. yes I know there are combos but who really uses those  Combos are key if youre a merc in postgamedlc content. Your DPS will suck if you button mash.,fantasylife,cp9tlp2,6,t5_2w0ko
3390332,0,t1_cpeq0p4,Yeah I noticed that.  I was wondering if the story changed or anything like that since you technically never really interact with the NPCs involved with the quests and thus never learn their backstories.,fantasylife,cpeq3jp,1,t5_2w0ko

Maybe pick up a gathering Life?,fantasylife,cpj9qnk,2,t5_2w0ko
3439132,0,t3_2zll7v,The Tortuga Archipelago area in Port Puerto are also really good to mine silver and also raise your other stats.  Because you have to fight some pesky water creatures but nothing too difficult and you can run away if you want.  You can enter and exit from the Beach District as much as you like and there are a lot of points where you can mine around the water.  I did this to raise my overall mining skill level and experience level up as well.  ,fantasylife,cpkac5i,2,t5_2w0ko
3804733,0,t1_cqpywfa,Nope  Youre going to have to wait until hopefully someone with a non DLC game comes along you could also try going into the IRC chat linked on the right side of the page and asking there hope you get help! best of luck,fantasylife,cqpyxol,1,t5_2w0ko

6098114,0,t3_3z2s2w,You still have to change your life at the guild office to craft  its not too troublesome using the map shortcut though.  A fighting class is def recommended  Wizard goes well with Alchemist but any class is okay.Also take the time to get miner and woodcutter activated on your life list this way you can passively raise the skill levels for those as you explore.  Skill levels max at  and  if you buy the DLC.  Try not to worry too much about skilling up  you need access to newer story areas to get ingredients to craft so your max skill levels are determined more by how far youve gotten in the story than how much you grind.Have fun with whatever classes seem cool and interesting and as long as you have the one fighter class to fall back on for bosses etc youll do just fine.  One last recommendation try not to fall into the trap of wanting to max every class stick to around  at most until youre far in the game.,fantasylife,cyiskby,2,t5_2w0ko

Play the game at your own pace. Buy the DLC once you have finished the story. The DLC doesnt affect anything its an extension of story. ,fantasylife,d2yflod,2,t5_2w0ko
