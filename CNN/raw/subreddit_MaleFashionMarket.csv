4959051,0,t3_3isrea,Hey man sorry to be the bearer of bad news but the lwbs are not shell cordovan.The indicated areas show some pretty heavy microcreasing a type of creasing that shell cordovan does not exhibit. These shoes are made from a corrected grain leather that looks a lot like shell cordovan when uncreased and can still look like cordovan when creased so it is an understandable mistake. There are a lot of other clues if you are familiar with vintage shoes and you can pretty much rest assured that there are very very few manufacturers that ever decided to pair a plastic welt on their cordovan footwear. Dexter is a company that I have never seen a shell lwb from. I do have a decent amount of experience with vintage footwear and I used to be a vintage florsheim collector Ive had had everything from deadstock cordovan ptbs to the famed cordovan yumas. Unfortunately there is a lot of misleading information out there regarding what is and what is not actually shell cordovan and even the famed AAAC cordovan serial number hunters guide has some inaccuracies.This is compounded by the fact that some leathers when uncreased are very very convincing and it does fool experts if they are not diligent.  Here is one such example However this shoe is very likely not shell cordovan because of a lot of the characteristics the leather exhibits. Firstly the extremely consistent coloration is highly suspect and characteristic of surfaced altered leathers. Secondly in areas of stress the leather exhibits microcreasing as your shoes do that is a dead giveaway for the leather not being cordovan. Here I have circled the relevant areas. For most uncreased shoes the eyelet area is often the best place to look because the cordovan exhibits pretty specific qualities in those areas.,MaleFashionMarket,cujmm3z,3,t5_2xm6s

8383063,0,t1_d5pbwrl,Hmm. Well for starters if youre asking that question then its probably nothing you would consider practical. Im not saying SS or Ludlow is bad at all theyre a great bang for the buck.That said Ill summarize the big points. Youd really need to dive into suitmaking for all of the nuances. Materials. SS and JCrew use fine wools but at the top level theyre certainly even better. You also get into the other materials  the buttons the thread linings and pockets. All better. Construction. Some construction points like the quality of stitching and the chest piece construction are substantial in terms of durability and drape. Other construction details like hand sewn vs machine sewn might not be as obviously quantifiable but without a doubt if you ask a guy who has been wearing suits professionally for decades hell tell you it makes a difference. Fit. This is obviously subjective but a house that does a ton of bespoke stuff will naturally have a better concept of what makes a great fit for the common body types.Granted a lot of the meaning of better here is contextual. The objective durability breathability etc is only part of it.,MaleFashionMarket,d5pfj6m,2,t5_2xm6s
