Because the long rang attack deals quite a bit to enemys and homes in on target and hovers close to your base  ap i believe or close to it on plat. I dont have mine max out yet but i know trev monkey has very low hp. I dont fight monkeys to much but im sure that will work better than most units and gives a boost to bring out your heavier ap units quikly and can stack and be left to there own devices while your working your way to thier base ,MetalSlugAttack,de1aqrz,2,t5_3ckyk
