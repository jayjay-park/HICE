228868,0,t1_cf4ebff,Maybe I dont understand why the rule is in place the way it is but I think the change that needs to happen is the way a transfer fee right now counts towards the salary cap.  How does that make sense anyway?  The salary cap is there for parity purposes  wouldnt focusing on the salary only do the trick?  Why the need to figure transfer fees into it?  What purpose does it serve?Lets say that we hypothetically signed Laba on a free after his existing contract expired.  In that scenario he would not be a DP player.  But since we signed him before his contract expired he has to be a DP?  It seems like the rule is there to discourage clubs from paying transfer fees for players.  And yeah I can see how that puts clubs who dont have the money to throw around for transfer fees on a more level playing field maybe but our salary cap is incredibly tight.  Just over  million?  Its something like that now right?  Thats nothing.  I guess I can see a bit how it might discourage clubs from gaming the system but..   how often does it happen that you manage to convince a player you paid  mill to sign to play for  a year?  Or even k?  Young players I can see and maybe thats why this rule is in place?  Because teams with money could just sign a bunch of  year olds for a couple mill. each and pay them k a year each?  Seems like a longterm project type scenario that might be potentially risky.Did I just answer my own question there?  Who knows Im just waking up and havent had my coffee yet.  Either way I hope some magic is done and Laba stays,tfc,cf4gxep,3,t5_2ro5q

Were working with the league on that well go from here. We have some time. Since then havent heard much.

The other reason is that They actually were caught doing those things that the tabloids were talking about. There was no proof Defoe was attempting to engineer a move away from the club at the time the fans turned on Defoe. Once fans turned on him its entirely possible he asked to be moved out.

Then follow the crowd under the train tracks to the stadium.The  Bathurst and  Harbourfront streetcars both drop off very close to the stadium.
