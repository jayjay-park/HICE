440838,0,t1_cfpspeu,Won a rift run game today with a VeroreSleeper deck. I barely hung on but I just kept stalling him using creature removal and board wipe and pumping my creatures up. What killed him was morale it just tanked after two Mass Deaths.,infinitywars,cfqghf3,1,t5_2whwf

796486,0,t3_22kyxb,Nice deck. I too run something very similar however I need to update it with the infestation cards.  I decided to use only one hakeem because I found a second one in my deck was just taking up space in my hand when I wanted another small characterability card instead.How is that working for you post infestation?The deck I had played more on wiping the board with tome of the dead coupled with unstabled necro and having more raise deads and awakens to summon creatures that did not meet hakeems casting cost.Finally my commanders were different with the exception of hakeem.  I decided to use lt cc creatures,infinitywars,cgutavt,1,t5_2whwf

913090,0,t3_24j5se,Its been a while but Im pretty sure I changed to the deck I wanted in the Cards tab then went back to the campaign.  Although it wouldnt surprise me if new bugs have arisen since then.Also certain battles mostly early in each factions campaign seemed to require that I use a particular deck. ,infinitywars,ch82olh,1,t5_2whwf

1190807,0,t1_ci3idiy,the first part is preemptive but is the returning to play preemptive? its the part that matters since tome resolves at the end of the turn.,infinitywars,ci3l1y4,1,t5_2whwf

5425070,0,t3_3pa7kp,I agree  I also try to spread the word and have recruited  of my friends into the game and they all fell in love with it. The problem is that lightmare is a small company and cannot afford advertising.. I only found because of new releases under the FP tag... I have had one of my favorite streamers hollywoodscotty look into it and he said he would consider it!,infinitywars,cw53xmb,1,t5_2whwf
5439705,0,t1_cw4pakl,There used to be some streaming of IW. But streaming isnt a silver bullet. Streamers and popular games are codependent they lose viewers if they spend too much time with games people are not interested in. Sorry to soapbox on you I just find it annoying and naive when people think streaming will magically make a game get tons of players. It also doesnt help that back when IW did have some streams they were largely boring to nonplayers and never really had many viewers.,infinitywars,cw6z4pm,1,t5_2whwf
5571636,0,t1_cv01okw, Campaign gives you most of those cards. exile is my favorite faction but they dont have enough exile cards or cards that let you choose what you discard. ,infinitywars,cwnpo93,1,t5_2whwf
