8747674,0,t3_4zvrbs,Im assuming youre brushing on the lacquer. If you are spraying youre most definitely applying it to heavy. In any case youre most likely applying the lacquer to heavy.  I spray lacquer almost every day and when the heat or humidity get to high I make sure to spray a little lighter and allow an hour between coats.  I also try not to apply more than  coats in a day.Lighten up your coats andor thin the lacquer with some lacquer thinner.,finishing,d6z43vr,3,t5_3c9xq
8810176,0,t3_50r41n,So long as it has fully cured gt hours it will be fine.  Depending on how you apply your initial topcoat you may get some bleeding into the topcoat.  A sprayed topcoat to seal it will minimize bleed.  If you are using polyurethene in this application dont start sanding until the nd or rd coat so long as you are also applying coats within the manufacturers recommended nosand time poly needs to key into lower layers.  Either a waterborne or solvent type poly would be fine but you may experience more grain raise with the waterborne stuff.  Dont panic just put down a couple coats and then knock back the fuzzies.,finishing,d76v3al,1,t5_3c9xq
9106987,0,t1_d86i5qj,Since Ive already got the shellac on there is it possible to go over with a dewaxed shellac previously coatings are regular then over that with several coats of poly? ,finishing,d86ihy1,1,t5_3c9xq
9479025,0,t1_d9hhabp,This is correct.  The compressors are rated based on their ability to pump air into the tank not their ability to output air.  If it were the other way around you would be able to apply the ideal gas law.  Clearly you cant however because halving the pressure should should allow a doubling of the CFM and thats not what happens.The reason there is a small difference in CFM between PSI and PSI instead of a x difference comes down to volumetric inefficiencies  higher pressures produce more heat and cause some slight inefficiencies.The only way to figure out with the CFM at a specific pressure is to test it.That being said a  gallon tank is approximately CFM.  When its fully pressurized its CFM at PSI approx youre then going to output it at CFM at PSI.  This will take         . minutes to empty assuming he compressor never turns on.  Assuming the compressor turns on when pressure hits  PSI youll have the compressor turn on after  seconds.  The compressor at that point will have  CFM  PSI of air left youll be consuming it at    PSI and youll be adding air back in at . worst case since thats the PSI number CFM at  ATM of pressure . PSI.  So at         .  . youll be able to operate for an additional . minutes before the tank is completely empty with the compressor running nonstop for those . minutes.  That gives you roughly  minutes of time spraying before the tank is completely empty and youre now spraying with air at PSI instead of  PSI.If I were you Id look for a compressor rated at     .  . CFM at PSI.  That way youll be able to spray indefinitely once the compressor kicks on.  If you plan to do so you probably want one rated for a  duty cycle many compressors are only rated to  duty cycle so that you dont blow the compressor out by using it too long.,finishing,d9hhsda,1,t5_3c9xq

10174656,0,t1_dbxbykm,If you order hot rolled steel it will look like that when you get it. Just wipe it down with acetone to get the dirtgrease off of it. Spray poly would be fine too if you have access to a sprayer. I just assumed you didnt. Also if your uncle has a small planer offer to buy him a set of new blades in exchange for the planing. They are usually around  or less and the work saved is worth it.,finishing,dbxcqh8,1,t5_3c9xq

10419423,0,t1_dcp242f,you are better off trying to remove the oil with a solvent as much as possible prior to any sanding.  worse case scenario is that if you sand too soon you might actually work the oil further into the wood due to the friction caused by the sandpaper.  If you have great ventilation and are willing and able to deal with flammable solvents you could also consider naptha better yet lacquer thinner.  ,finishing,dcp3z3g,2,t5_3c9xq
10453242,0,t1_dcsb5xp,I used to run the worlds largest catonly adoption org and sanctuary. We had  large colony rooms for some long term residents and we built several of these large rolling boxes that would roll over the litter boxes to cover up smells and keep the flying poop at a minimum. Basically they were like about  inches tall about  feet wide and about  inches deep.We did exactly what you suggested. We basically made an impregnable barrier with epoxy resin. Literally nothing could get through it.On the outside we used a highly washable latex paint so they could be easily wiped clean. it would have been a terrible choice on the inside but was great for the outside.,finishing,dcsz6u7,3,t5_3c9xq
