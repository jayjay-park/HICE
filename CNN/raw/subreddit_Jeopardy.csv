My  year old doesnt have a clue who Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is but he certainly knows who Paul Newman is and has answered questions on Jeopardy about him. Yes a lot of the clues on Jeopardy can be answered if youve paid attention through your life can retain it and recall it but the gilded years of Hollywood is a pretty specific generational topic and again I can only see older people film buffs or film students being able to answer that kind of clue.,Jeopardy,df3ekay,1,t5_2s45l
