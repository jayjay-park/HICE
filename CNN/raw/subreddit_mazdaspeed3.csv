I would buy a elm and grab an android device and use Torque to see the pressure on the line is. If you are in the psi you are good. Find mazdaspeedforums and search. They do not suffer noobs. ,mazdaspeed3,dc3le7f,2,t5_2tc2t
11169295,0,t1_dey0iab,Really? Oh geez I thought the OTS would be easier on the fuel pump than a pro tune and be fine on stock. Good heads up. Do you think the eco tune would still be damaging? Might as well save some gas if Im not gonna be running it. I was hoping to get away with a week or two of not having the HPFP so that I could learn more about the installation process and wait till payday.,mazdaspeed3,dey10fb,1,t5_2tc2t
