1786873,0,t3_2ez86w,Where are you going to be? Where are you working? What do you like to do?Its pretty big around here. Give us a general area... Estero Fort Myers Sanibel FM Beach...Personally I love the Promenade at Reflection Lakes but gets pretty expensive if you want a . Its nice having a Costco Target Publix near you and you have quick access to the US and the Beach. Nice gated community I have a friend who lives there and loves it but its ish a month in rent for his  not including utilities.,FortMyers,ck4dz9q,2,t5_2tnir
2472321,0,t1_cmgjiux,No worries I know how vacations can be busy as hell.  Just let me know!That is a pretty good location to be staying fairly close to just about everything.  Running N or S along McGregor will get you into some pretty nice spots. Although some areas are a bit hit and miss.  If youre doing a down and back to the beach youll have this to look forward too at halfway. The bridge,FortMyers,cmha03a,2,t5_2tnir
2622152,0,t3_2pusfv,I noticed your post hasnt received any comments. You might try posting it in the SWFL subreddit. Nobody reads the Fort Myers one. Best of luck to you!,FortMyers,cn0ups9,2,t5_2tnir

3848007,0,t3_34fte2,I wouldnt get turned off by these responses. Regardless of the profession employees who are underpaid and overworked arent going to always have the best state of being but SWFL is a pretty great community. there are definitely some great schools here and having another teacher passionate about hisher work would be greatly appreciated within the district. Out of college my wife was able to find a greatly supportive school to help guide her in her first years of teaching. She has thus moved on and is an important part of a different school. My family in one way or another has been a part of the school district in Lee County for close to  years. It has its ups and downs but as a whole is not much different than any other school district. I would definitely take these twos advice but I would also forge an opinion of your own. Like  of any job its difficult to always agree with your boss your bosss boss and your bosss bosss boss. As an aspiring educator you are well aware that you are not going to be paid for the amount of work you will be doing but you will continue to do it because of your passion for teaching. Find a school help some children make a little money and count the days until summer. But hey.. What do I know? Good luck! ,FortMyers,cquwnkf,5,t5_2tnir

6151057,0,t1_cyonqfl,So Lehigh Acres seems to be a large area but it is off to the east. Pine Manor looks to be a very small region. Is it really that small or are most of the areas surrounding it sketchy as well? And San Carlos park is actually more in the general area where Ive seen some house rentals. Ive spotted a few that are a bit south of there near the Miromar outlets. Is that a good area or no?These areas dont seem all that big given the vast size of Ft Myers. Are the rest of the areas generally fairly nicesafe?,FortMyers,cyot7ii,5,t5_2tnir
6187269,0,t1_cyqxe95,Thats a little much for a first meetup. I feel like starting at a bar or brewery would be a good start. Once people start to come around that would be better for bigger events. ,FortMyers,cysxems,3,t5_2tnir

11393333,0,t3_62fbbg,I think your best solution is to surrender to a rescue if you cant afford the help she needs. They will take excellent care and assure it goes to a good home. It would be great if you can offer to foster as well!Although if shes a stray must be surrendered to Lee or Collier County Domestic Animal Services. They also work with local rescues to help every animal they can but try to get a rescu interested if you can once turned in to help out this fella.,FortMyers,dfnf29y,1,t5_2tnir
