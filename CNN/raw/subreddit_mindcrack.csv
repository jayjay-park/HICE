Charging  for a game that is going to be in Alpha for a long time doesnt really seem worth the risk.

Gens I and II had what was called Stat EXP which was similar except that there was no total Stat EXP cap like the  EV limit. So essentially it was like you could assign  EVs to all  of your core stats rather than the maximum of  that you can do these days.Similarly IVs in their current form have only been around since Gen III. In the first two generations you had what are usually referred to as DVs which ran from  as opposed to the  that IVs have. Therefore a Pokemon with a maxxed out stat highest possible DV and max Stat EXP in Gen II will have its value be one point lower than the same type of Pokemon with the same maxxed out stat in Gen III and beyondThese differences are some of the reasons why Gen II and III are incompatible with each other.,mindcrack,cewl4gx,7,t5_2to85

When Guude looked towards the enchantment table and the cobblestone blockade from where he stood at the end He could see down the cave they came from. When they placed down the anvil it goes just high enough to block the view down into that cave!If Zisteau and Vechs keeps sneaking up on them and do so quickly I think they might be able to place that lava down right on top of Etho which would make for some quite severe panic for Etho and Guude. At that point Z amp V could break the Cobble blockade and move in to attack!  Thats a possible strategy of attack I can see but that took me a minute or two to come up with after seeing how Guude and Etho were stood obviously Z amp V doesnt know that so I doubt that will happen.Either way Its pretty much certain that there will be an encounter very early on in the next episode and I Cant freaking Wait to see what happens. They were so close though! Obviously its impossible to imagine what went through their mind at the time but if Zisteau and Vechs wouldve quickly mined down a couple of blocks whilst Guude and Etho was enchanting and Guude didnt have his armor on I think Z amp V couldve killed them both albeit with possibly loosing some health in the process.Tuesday cant come fast enough!,mindcrack,cfh6le2,6,t5_2to85

478718,0,t1_cfui1cu,Oh I agree that the stalking was amazing. The moments where you could hear your opponents and completely stay hidden were some of my favorite parts! However it does make the actual battles them selfs feel a little watered down in my opinion anyway. Most teams resorted to communicating strategies with nonverbal signals which can be a little hard to follow when watching multiple perspectives.Going back to stalking though even though watching one team stalk another silently was one of the most tense aspects of the season they were usually onesided. It was either you know exactly where your opponent is and a little of what theyre doing or you had no idea where the next arrow would come from. Which that isnt necessarily a bad thing but I personally enjoyed the previous seasons stalking methods. Usually both teams would be on somewhat equal ground as far as knowing where people are. I liked the episodes where the only way youd know if someone is around is by seeing their name tag. ,mindcrack,cfuolv5,1,t5_2to85

509016,0,t3_1zyeqr,Well it was  to  years ago now I was in college for my first year. I wasnt really finding it all that enjoyable. I found that most of the people meet on college tours that were excited and happy to have me at their school had been replaced by professors who could care less and advisors who didnt want me bothering them. I was quickly finding that all the good stuff about college that people told me was going to happen wasnt going to happen.So quickly to find something that I could find fun and take my mind off things I turned to video games. I actually found a video game group though my college. The issue with them was that they focused on competitive games LOL StarCraft fighting games and that wasnt really my thing.Thats around the time I found mindcrack. Season  of mindcrack UHC had all the maps floating around rminecraft and I looked into it. The first episode I watched was beefs episode where he mined a block and a skeleton fell on him and he took quite a bit of damage. I was hooked. That night I watched all the episodes that I could surprised to find a game that I had already played being turned into something I could bring to my competitive friends in college.Turns out they didnt care much. One or two did and we set up a server. That was nice for a while but it didnt really work as I wanted to be on a server like mindcrack! One with people from all over the world and played at all times of the day people that loved the game so much they new how to pull off Redstone stuff that was so impressive that it brought them millions of fans etho doc and played pranks on each other.So I found this subreddit. I found all the cool people here and they had fan art and cool stuff. They also had a server. The server didnt have any openings at the time but they said they would have contests! So I bought my mic the one etho recommended as i liked his voice and fraps with the little money I had. I started making LPS from my apartment and they were shit  I actually just released my first test episode on my channel before I got this damn cold.Then I found something cool. A guy was doing something called the mindcrack digest. He would sum up everything in mindcrack that was going on. All the videos and what they had going on in them. I thought to myself man would it be cool if someone made like a news segment out of this! So I contacted the guy and told him man you should totally do this! Then he said he didnt want to but if I wanted to I should make it happen. So I tried with his help. I created a little disclaimer thing and downloaded a youtube downloader and made the first mindcrack recap.Keeping that up and still trying to get on a server I went to the mindcrack IRC. Somehow uShreeyam actually recognized me. I was floored as shree was one of my favorites on the server. After making the irc my home and still doing the recap my whole life was getting a lot better. Well in school I was still doing rather bad but at least I had something to take my mind off of how much I hated it all.Something interesting happened though. Shred invited me to the mindcrack server. I know what your thinking. Bullshit this is all bullshit. You would be wrong. I also would be wrong. Shree was not inviting me to the mindcrack server. He was inviting me to the wannabe fan server. But how he said it was hey want to join the server? Me being a idiot thought he was talking about the mindcrack server. I responded with Yea sureeeee lol When he gave me the IP I figured it out. Thats how I started with mindcrack. I hope you guys enjoyed my story! I dont think I ever told it in writing before. I could keep going but I doubt anyone cares. Thanks for reading.,mindcrack,cfy4m9g,7,t5_2to85

661400,0,t1_cgfg3qs,As far as a Bukkit implementation of swinging maybe adding the mining fatigue effect to the player when he or she swings would do the trick. Im unsure whether or not it affects the third person model but in first person I know that it actually slows the swinging animation. Another note is that players need to be made solid. This would fix the major problem of being able to block attacks that are not from the front. On Bukkit however I fear that this may be impossible.

If you click start and it doesnt start youre out of luck.  If you friend gives you a burned copy of the latest tripleA game and it doesnt start because there copy protection system believes you dont have a valid license for the game then you are shit out of luck and it doesnt matter in the slightest whether the games website or manual or even some EULA says that or not because you have no right when you didnt actually pay for the software.Bottom line  You literally have no cause of action when the software you didnt actually pay money for doesnt actually run.

688339,0,t3_221thi,One year ago today I started UHC Recapping. Today we begin again. Season  HERE WE COME!Guude Team Gold Current Losing TeamNo Kurt . Holy shit at this music man its pretty epic. Im quite looking forward to this team I think it will work out well. We had enough people for us to divide by three. And no guests! Its almost weird just having Mindcrackers and glad were back in calls. Blame Seth if the map went wrong. Well here we are with Guude Doc and MC. Were playing UHC! Woo! Team Gold rolls out and sees their plains plan was foiled due to the wall. Aw shucks. As its around two years after UHC  its also two years of me being a Crackhead. I became a massive fan of Guude after finding him through UHC  and Kurts the only person that surpasses him. Getting a lot of wood at the start so I dont ever have to touch again MC. Wood is icky. Pakratt is having connection issues and they figure if he gets permanently DCed he wouldve died first anyway. Doc hears a Baby Zombie finds a Zombie Spawner gets lit on fire by a Zombie starts freaking out wondering how that couldve happened and runs away confused where theyre coming from. A spawner. Pyrao says in chat that his housemate is torrenting and he needs to get him to stop. LOL. Sucker damaged me again I cant believe it. I need to get away man. MC finds the Zombie stream as Guude searches for materials and sees a flaming Zombie. Doc is at . health first damage. A great start for Team Gold! Theres a Gold Disk Guude! MC exclaims upon finding the Spawner. An excellent start for Team Gold! Nay says Doc a brilliant start. Well guys this is going real well. Dont worry well rush to the Nether. Night falls and Team Gold starts digging in. This is perfectly safe to block up in and stuff. I wanted to stay calm this UHC Im shaking inside and outside and everywhere Doc says sighing. Theres a creep down there. Doc is stressed MC is really happy and Guude seems pretty calm. Only sane man that would be new for Guude. Doc continues to preach being calm a lesson he learned all the way back in UHC  Guude says. MC has a funny freakout and reveals that he is down to . hearts. The last few seasons Ive had to play for myself as my teammates all die Guude tells MC and Doc. Of course not MC assures him. I found major caveage MC announces. Guude digs into caves as the team does typical st episode stuff. MC gets Emeralds and starts planning on tricking Generik as Guude deals with a Skeleton with the finesse of a UHC veteran. My team...dying.Baj Team YellowCelebrating UHCs Year Anniversary Im going to watch the other of the two players who have never missed a single UHC season Baj. Hes with Pak and Zisteau and I think this is going to be a great combo. Baj has his own rockin music for the intro and we are soon in the game. Dawn begins and Pak immediately announces that he is lagging. Weve decided to call ourselves...PakkerBajZ. Pak goes to restart his client and Baj types that Pak has died already. Baj wanders into a little cave and a Zombie chases him out but he avoids damage. What is going on! What are you doing? Pak is totally okay from Baj and Zisteaus angle. Thats what we call a handicap Zisteau says of Pak. The trials and tribulations of being Pakratt. Productive Baj engage! Pak decides to reset his entire computer and its a two man team of Zisteau and Baj. Team Bajz. Multiple Baj. Pak returns thankfully in the daytime and Baj warns the others of floor holes. Everything is just awful for Pakratt. I think Pakratt is a little frustrated right now. Games not Im fine. Pak cant see anyone move fluidly. Its the opposite of seeing dead people. Is it...getting dark? Suddenly Notch steps in and saves Pakratt. Best first video in UHC history Im saying it now. They head into a cave for night and...Its a Witch! Oh dear. Pak almost wanders into a Creeper and Baj jumps down toward the Creeper just as Zisteau kills it. Jeez man! Another Creeper blows up and Baj is as eight hearts. I will never again do UHC sober Zisteau announces building on FLoBathon discussion points. Zisteau gets shot while talking about intoxication. Three blocks forward and Pak finds more Skellies. Youre sayin but I aint doin. These are classic tunnel rat tactics right here. I have no idea what youre talking about I know nothing about rats. Baj grinds some Spiders out for string and takes a damage hit through a corner. Hes at . No way!Vintage Beef Team AquaBeef we missed you from last season! Glad to see you....back in action. With teammates Nebris and Pyrao Beef looks around the area. Beef takes the food Nebris goes exploring and Pyrao collects. Who wouldve guessed? Beef is nervous and Nebris reports on Seth keeping inventory with Pyrao remembering killing Millbee  seconds into Season  prompting a restart. A cow kills himself on a cactus and Nebris reports it horrified. Pyrao reports getting a bit of lag and Beef says I was deceived my pork. ltBeatgt That pork fell in the hole. I dont see any templesI see a temple! Nebris reports. Nebris always find Pyramids thats his job. His coords are  but whatever. Pyrao relogs to check on lag and briefly logs on PlayMindcrack. Whoops.  gold and tons of iron with some horse armor are the fruit of Nebris Pyramid as Beef digs in. Nebris is coming back and gets a sunflower with lag still popping up for poor Pyrao. I hear a Baby Zombie as Beef scours the plains and Nebris says he does not feel threatened alone. Well he has full iron armor. I think my housemate may be torrenting Pyrao mutters and Nebris virtually shrugs. He has to download his porn. Fucking heliotropes he says as Pyrao logs off to go tell off his tormentor. Pyrao comes back still with bad lag and decides to restart his PC. Sorry about this. Are you...apologizing to us? Going inside at night Beef gets armored and Nebris tunnels as Pyrao returns but with robot voice. An Enderman freaks out and it starts raining and I guess Guude and Nebris had the weather down. Pyrao jumps inside escaping a sword Zombie as Nebris finds another something this time underground. They dig underground as Beef mutters that the cheater has full iron. Should even bother with caves and diamonds? Beef wonders thinking if the Nether will be better than Enchantments. Beef is now at . after Gravel suffocation damage as an Enderman trolls Nebris. I died to an Enderman too one season...and I didnt look at him! Beef announces. Nebris starts crying I just want this Skeleton to go away...Pause Team BlueMost know him as Pause but to UHC fans he is the King. And I must say this team is looking stacked. Theres the King and six time and reigning champion Pause twotime champion and frequent final battle opponent BTC and the Mad Viking Anderz. BTC and Anderz talk about being nervous but Pause is PUMPED. And tha ladies and gentleman is why Pause is the king. They spawn on a Roofed Forest treetop and theres an Acacia and Desert nearby. Bacons good with bacon and eggs Pause says. ...............Penis............... My first interaction with Pause in UHC  was him typing boner in everyones chat. Mobs are everywhere and the team flees the Roofed Forest with a Zombie chasing. Asshole! What did I ever do to you? I didnt light you on fire the sun did! BTC finds a Village and Pause follows him as Anderz gets supplies. Im two haunches down. Pause did you take damage? No food haunches Im not a nb! I love that Nancy Drew are the only people to say haunches. In the first Savanna Village in UHC History the team gets easy supplies as BTC suggests lamb chops just like Baj did. I like all meat Anderz says. He loves that meat. Pause thinks hes black...all new series. Thats like a black guy in a s movie no one talks like that anymore. Getting some wood from Acacia they do not get any apples and Anderz wonders if the team should trawl the desert. Pause finds a Pyramid on a quick Desert excursion and thats the second one this map so far. There was one map that had like  and a bunch of other rare stuff so much so that Guude was even shocked. Three gold and eight iron and of course nine TNT. Digging in underground Anderz complains about no apples. A Creeper surprises Pause in a cave but he kills it. A Skeleton comes after BTC and Anderz join Pause down in a hole. A classic quote by Baj from UHC  E was Pauses video will be  blackness by the looks of it. And yes he is in a pitch black cave but then places a torch. I spy with my little eye something that is green. Anderz sees he sees another nametag as well as a Creeper coming against him. BTC decides on armor instead of a sword first for Pause. I dont think anything has exemplified BTCs strategy better. Anderz announces that it was a shortred name. Arkas or....Etho. Ooooooooooohhhhh guuurrrrrrllll Pause responds. Anderz decides to stop shifting as ArkasEtho has clearly seen him and wants to explore Team Reds cave. Ive got huge manly balls man. Moving on in the cave Pause silences Blue as he hears something but its just a Creeper. A bat tries to save the Creeper and Pause kills it too. This is tanse. You know what else is tenseoh well. I thought you said intense so Id say you know whats intense? Camping? Its in tents. Get it?! Do I need to spell this out for you? BTC delivers with UHC s funniest moment yet.Arkas Team RedRed is just as stacked as blue. Two time UHC champion Etho two time UHC champion Seth and reigning UHC champ Arkas. With these teams primed to take one of each other out Red vs Blue is going to become a reality. The team begins and Seth reveals the trick about not getting the Getting Wood achievement until you get the Inventory achievement and can mask your accomplishment. Im going to eat this apple okay. Etho says. You shouldnttoo late. Dont worry Etho is just trolling. Seth accidentally crafts  wooden buttons and Team Red has lost most of their wood. Its not hard to get wood. They think about naming their team SEA and Seth mentions that he lives in Seattle. TIL. Hope you enjoyed the Seahawks winning . Arkas is being pretty quiet and letting Seth and Etho take reign as Etho laughs at Pyraos housemate torrenting. The team trawls through a forest Etho attempting to find any cows he can. They enter a desert and pass up pigs for whatever reason to find cows. Ooh surface lava pool make note of that. Seeing a Roofed Forest up a head they decide they need to find a cave. Arkas goes ahead of Seth and Etho and finds a Pyramid. Seth sees signs of Team Red and they start shifting approaching the Pyramid at nightfall and Seth is hopeful that the Pyramid has not been looted. Its not looted! Seth says They were not here. Those suckers they missed it hahahahaha Etho says of Team Red. Then Seth sadly reports that it was looted. Theyre not suckers after all... Seth is now at  and the three decide to staircase in opposite directions. I doubt they wandered far Etho says as Arkas video will be  blackness by the looks. The team seems some names and Etho confirms that somebody is near Seth. Seth decides to leave instead of going after Team Red. Getting some iron Red actually is not in a true cave so Blue should not bump into them just yet. Etho is near a slime and Seth gets excited about slime blocks then realizes that its ... This is a big slime of all slimes... Seth observes Team Blues antics and Seth wants to get away. Arkas sees a name coming closer and realizes that its Team Blue. Will we survive? Oh man...Jsano Team Green Current Winning TeamOur final team is Jsano Vechs and GenerikB and they have started RIGHT ON A VILLAGE. Well this is the luckiest spawn in UHC history. I nominate Team Green as a Dark Horse victory and Jsano suggests bailing from the Village as soon as possible. Generik suggests Villager Trading as a Sheep stares Jsano down with Vechs suggesting that Genny flimflammed the code. The team is just in as much unbelief as I am and I cant believe more comments arent about it. Genny jumps into a Blacksmith and he announces  apples and Vechs starts getting wood and bookshelves. Jsano fills Genny in on the branch mining rules as Generik already has iron armor from the blacksmith. This is ridiculous! Beef thought Nebris iron speed was fast but Genny has you beat Nebs. Vechs votes that if they see people they run and Jsano and Genny agreeing saying he wouldnt want to pull an Etho and die first. Ouch. Genny starts killing Villagers and the death noises scare Jsano. This Village is being dismantled by Team Green but theyre deciding to base out of it and stair step down out of a house. Well a Village start quite the experience here. Digging down they hear a Spider spawner and hope that it is a trial Spider Spawner and not a Cave Spider. Vechs asks about the Axe Incident between Zisteau and him but gets cut off. The caving experience begins as Generik and Vechs deal with mobs with Jsano hanging back. Hes here! He came through a hole! Jsano announces. Theres no wood so supposedly the Spider Spawner has to be a normal one. Right? Jsano finds some gold but theres no iron to find. Theres a million of them and theyre so mad at me right now Genny says of the Spiders. Jsano blocks off the stairwell with smooth stone and thats a very good idea and wonder why more Mindcrackers dont use it. Generik finds a normal Spider Spawner and Jsano hopes for a Sobriety Sharpness V. I like the paranoia Jsano says mining the gold. Generik finds a Golden Record and Buckets. This is the best starting position ever Vechs says. Jsano asks Genny if Nether Portal trapping is legal and cuts to outro. WrapUpI have to put Team Green as the current winners as they are looking set. Team Red and Team Blue have very strong teams people wise but are pretty average as far as starts are going. Slightly below them are Teams Aqua and Yellow but not by much at all. Team Gold is in the most trouble for sure with MC and Doc hurting. Still a wideopen match and I expect to see a lot of Nether this season. Shaping up to be a classic!,mindcrack,cgiikou,116,t5_2to85

707080,0,t3_228qiz,I think unsubscribing based on it is a bit dumb considering most of the youtubers who would get sponsorships have been monetising and having ads on their videos for years now. If youre thinking of it in terms of selling out or something like that then you should have unsubscribed years ago when they started turning all the time they spent on youtube into a source of income. If it helps them get a more reliable income then I think sponsorships are absolutely fine.That said I dont like having ads in the actual video itself Id rather have the video be about the content its supposed to have. I wouldnt unsub or stop watching or anything but it does take away from the quality of the videos. For something like Rooster Teeth its alright though still annoying at times since they have built themselves like an alternate TV channel but on a channel for one person it just seems strange and unfitting.One way Ive seen it done that I thought was good was the people being very jokey about it occasionally bringing up the sponsorship and making jokes about being sponsored I think the Creatures tend to be like this but that wouldnt really work for a channel like Seths that is more about showing off things and information on a game than comedy.Putting in the endslate would be fine too its not intrusive and would let the youtuber directly link to the site but I guess its less exposure than being in the normal video since a lot of people leave when it gets to that part.,mindcrack,cgknco5,1,t5_2to85

With regards to your comment below since one splash pot basically functions as well as three regular pots thats  the inventory space needed. Potions can take up a hefty amount of space otherwise.,mindcrack,cgkvimr,1,t5_2to85

This might work very well for more technical questions like How long does it take to produce a regular episode on the mindcrack server? where you then can roll a  minute timelapse video someone produced or something and talk over it.But you have to be very careful with it we all know pretty much about the guys and we dont really want to look at a video we have already seen on youtube.

Guys like Guude have mentioned they dont like the pressure to head for the center.Second Giving people the same amount of time to prep doesnt amount to equal material. In season  Nebris and Pakratt spent almost the same amount of time playing. Nebris had no diamonds Pakratt had . Again time doesnt necessarily confer any advantage.Third Nebris went at Pyro with nothing but potions and unenchanted iron. Pyro had a diamond sword and over  armor points plus enchants in addition to wolves and fire. They killed each other. This took place prepotion buff meaning had the same showdown occurred now Nebris wouldve shot Pyro chugged a health potion and moved right on ahead without batting an eye.However from the Cheaty Hot Beef perspective a weakness has been shown in the potions. Without invisibility its nearly impossible to effectively utilize potions and assault a mountain. Whats more the CHBDr McBoulderfist showdown reiterated that nether rushes can and will lead to conflict. Players headed to the nether have to be prepared for other players not just blazes and ghasts.,mindcrack,cgxz1x0,42,t5_2to85

That leaves like  seasons if that. Pyro and Nebs would have swept if they attacked but they didnt know how much damage they really did and did you see how pyro one hit pak while he was at like  hearts? And Nebris one hit BTC when he was at decent health too. These pots do too much damage and just saying Well it hasnt happened yet is stupid.

840148,0,t3_23qmr8,If we expand our window to the past year we see a similar trend across the other channels.In Table  I compiled some numbers for the MindCrack channels for the last year using cached subscriber data. By cached I mean that a videos views were compared to the number of subscribers when the video was published.Table . Subscriber Activity by Channel  to | Channel | Videos |  |  | Activity  | |  |||||||||| | total | excluded | notable | lowest | mean | highest | | MindCrackNetwork |  |  |  | . | . | . || Minecraft SethBling |  |  |  | . | . | . || EthosLab |  |  |  | . | . | . || Arkas |  |  |  | . | . | . || BdoubleO |  |  |  | . | . | . || nebris |  |  |  | . | . | . || Zisteau |  |  |  | . | . | . || Vechs |  |  |  | . | . | . || Generikb |  |  |  | . | . | . || docm |  |  |  | . | . | . || VintageBeef |  |  |  | . | . | . || ImAnderZEL |  |  |  | . | . | . || kurtjmac |  |  |  | . | . | . || MillBeeful |  |  |  | . | . | . || paulsoaresjr |  |  |  | . | . | . || GuudeBoulderfist |  |  |  | . | . | . || Mhykol |  |  |  | . | . | . || adlingtont |  |  |  | . | . | . || SuperMCGamer |  |  |  | . | . | . || AvidyaZen |  |  |  | . | . | . || PauseUnpause |  |  |  | . | . | . || BlameTheController |  |  |  | . | . | . || JSano |  |  |  | . | . | . || pakratt |  |  |  | . | . | . || WBaj |  |  |  | . | . | . || Pyropuncher |  |  |  | . | . | . |     When compared to the number of subscribers on the day the video was published.     Videos with frozen view counts published recently within three days and without cached subscriber data were excluded.    Data retreived   UTC.Based on the highest column we can see that there are videos out there which engage the subscriber base very well. I say engage because we cant really tell if subscribers are watching or notand other metrics like comments likes and dislikes are excluded from this discussion.Additionally Ive included this notable column. Its presence here is an indication read very loose of videos which stand out. In my analysis I set this threshold rather arbitrarily to . Using docms channel as an example we see that  videos had notable subscriber activity gt .  As before however I wouldnt put too much faith in this value either. After all a video which stands out could be measured based on any combination of interaction views likes dislikes comments and so forth.That said there is an issue as uSDG observed. With a flat view of the channels we cant really appreciate how these figures will often vary by series not to mention the factors which uPyrao mentioned.With Kurts channel in mind I narrowed the window down to the last six months and took a more indepth approach Table .Theres a plot in Table s Views column to help illustrate subscriber activity.

Data retreived   UTC.If we approximate by mean views per video per series we could say that more viewers are watching Kurts nonMinecraft videos as uMrCheeze noted. So though some series do better than others as a whole were given an impression that Kurts channel does not do as well as it could. The same could then be said for the other channels.While an average impression of a channel based on subscriber counts and recent viewership is something to consider I feel as though we are given only a glimpse of a much larger process where subscriber counts encourage us to think potential.

The entries in each row are numbered from the left beginning with k and are usually staggered relative to the numbers in the adjacent rows. A simple construction of the triangle proceeds in the following manner. On row  write only the number. Then to construct the elements of following rows add the number above and to the left with the number above and to the right to find the new value. If either the number to the right or left is not present substitute a zero in its place. For example the first number in the first row is  whereas the numbers  and  in the third row are added to produce the number  in the fourth row.gtThis construction is related to the binomial coefficients by Pascals rule which says that ifgtgtImage from article iInteresting Singmasters conjecture | Pascals Triangle Revisited | Blaise Pascal | Binomial coefficient Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwchafgr oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletechafgr.

The other applications however might need that other  to survive. Your OS is run like a communist government. Applications can only have their fair share of resources. Minecraft should be giving the  back to the OS to redistribute to the other applications think wealth redistribution but its not. So Minecraft is holding on to an entire water bottle when it can survive with only  while other applications possibly die of dehydration,mindcrack,chldlph,6,t5_2to85

Im sorry but theres nothing to be done. Recap  should be up at . Eps  and  I wont even post until . Sorry guysKurt Team GrayHello guys were here. Recapping and stuff. No intro as we come back and Doc finds iron followed by iron from Pyrao. Doc wonders about how Eternal Day will work. We can leave the caves at any time. Pyrao brings up witches again. You know thats one of Kurts triggers. Kurt finds a cave and Gray is feeling Netherready with melons. Pyrao and Doc both rushed last time went well for Pyrao bad for Doc. The guys make boots and hats first I can see the rage from here. Gurt needs to be hooked up Doc says. Gurtjmac indeed. Doc and Kurt head in the caves and Pyrao handles the furnace. Kurt has Pyrao take a peek at the World Border and its off in the distance. Kurt leaves lapis behind! You need that to enchant guy. A dragonfly invades Pyraos room and Kurt axes Doc in the back to .. Derrrrrrrrrrrrrp. Doc mightve gotten that lapis. Kurt mentions the lapis but no one seems to realize. Kurt goes back to the lapis. Good man. Kurt finds iron as he mines flint while Pyrao and Doc fight mobs. Need help? Kurt asks. No response but Pyrao has six gold. Bats fly past Kurt as he tries to find his teammates. Kurt breaks into a ravine and Doc and Pyrao are happy but Kurts rather scared. This new stone takes some getting used to. Vechs gets a Hot Pink Topic and only Millbee responds in chat. Vechs gets Diamonds. Doc is still thinking about the Nether but is down for both ways. BTC is at one heart and Pyrao thinks his playstyle has changed but it really hasnt. Anderz throws out a classic taunt and Pyrao finds his own cave as Kurt heads to ravine gold. Docs nervous. Theres gold everywhere! The materials to repair Doc are in hand. Kurt gets full iron and the guys are just gilded. TeamGilded. Pretty nice man. Kurt heads to the surface and  minutes.BdoubleO Team ParentIts been since S when Ive watched a team Guude was on not from his view so theres a little out of body experience going on here. BdoubleO gets poisoned by a witch and is only down to .. It was a surprisingly calm reaction from BdoubleO and his team. Aureylian comes to help BdoubleO with the Witch cave and BdoubleO falls to . health. I must say I really love the dynamic of this team. Guude finds gold but enough for an apple and BdoubleO grunts in anger. The witch begins to come closer to BdoubleO and Aureylian says that the witch thinks she is so full of herself. I am really enjoying her with Team Parent OOGA no more  and this team is just great. BdoubleO tells Aureylian to never tell them their coords and Guude reveals that he found string for a bow in a Mineshaft. BdoubleO finds Gold but doesnt have the picks. Aureylian talks to BdoubleO then sees a squid and instantly flips over to it. ADHD over here. Dont hate. Eight gold from BdoubleO when Guude returns but then BdoubleO realizes that there are no trees nearby. BdoubleO decides to leave a furnace as a smelting furnace. OOG almost runs into a Skeleton but Guude saves BdoubleO and Aureylian is assured that theyre okay. BdoubleO mines lapis for enchanting and Guude has a doh moment. Aureylian finds a wolf and BdoubleO yells at her to kill it!. Aureylian finds a cow and is super excited and a Skeleton hits Guude down. The cave is starting to get uglier. BdoubleO is hit to  and OOG has found a Skeleton Spawner. A Skeleton jumps in BdoubleOs face shoots right past them and it was a Zombie Spawner. Guude finds in the chest a Golden Record and BdoubleO bursts into laughter. Guude thinks that it might be time to move and BdoubleO has to go in the cave to get four gold from his smelting furnace. Go save her! Aureylian realizes that shes right near Guude and that she was just dumb. Was it us the whole damn time! Just plain. Everyone keeps asking Guude what to do and the mark comes. Thats the mark  minutes in Guude tells Aureylian. Aureylian is awesome.BTC Team The Bob Hoskins Experience Current Losing TeamMillbee said this would be a great episode and I wouldve watched it from his view if BTC hadnt almost died! BTC sees the Spawner that they had tried to get to before the thunderstorm but a Skeleton is guarding the entrance. Millbee announces that he thinks they should be getting all the granite as Brian asks BTC about the spawner. Brian was the first UHC guest that I was already subbed to so for me hes flowing in naturally. Brian comes to help BTC with the Skeleton in a Zombie Spawner and Brain the Dungeonmaster is back. BTC sees a Name Tag and both Records in a chest. Theres some gunpowder and wheat. Suddenly Millbee yells OHMYGODCREEPERDGSFJSGJDGSAF! A Creeper explodes right next to BTC and and hes at .. Millbee starts laughing instantly Brian is sympathetic and BTC is silent. Millbee is laughing so much while BTC is furious. I need to let the rage get away. That was so funny. Brian has just moved on. Millbee asks about how to make a Jukebox and wants to confuse people. BTC brings up Old Man Willakers previous juke boxing. He mind stole my plan. BTCrage of the storm. Briansane man. MillbeeInsane. This is the makeup. And I love it. Everybody have recovered and BTC finds a furnace Brian left deep in a cave. I tend to shift when Im mining due to reflex. Brian is battlehardened. Millbee tries to name a cow Bob Hoskins but they need an anvil first. Its Vechs all over again. Millbee and Brian hang out in the ravine as BTC explores the surface. Theyre near a Mega Taiga and potentially Parents. CREEPERLOOKOUT! Millbee yells. BTC tells him to stop as Millbee sees a smorgasbord of enemies. BTC sees a player on the surface and he starts to run away. Brian gives fastpaced tactical advice and BTC sees the entire Aqua team. Pause is there oh boy! Pause hits BTC twice but gives him the dive into the ravine. God DAMNIT! BTCs at one heart and The Bob Hoskins Experience is in a bad way. Brain is freaking out Millbee is singing BTC is about to lose it. A Creeper goes off right at Brian. Yuck. Aqua pushes a cow on Brians head but it doesnt kill him. Theyre unwilling to head into the ravine but if I was Pause Id just head in. BTC fires up at Aqua and BTC gives Mill Bow Master bee arrows. Mobs are in the ravine Aqua is overhead and theyre heading in. RIP The Bob Hoskins Experience.Pause Team AquaDAT INTRO! Holy crap that was awesome. I AM READY. Aqua is caving and getting armor and fighting Creepers. Pause gets a Creeper to the face and is at five hearts. An Enderman is walking around and Beef is freaking out. Pause hates Eternal Day. Beef suggests going after other teams for gold to heal Pause. The team has enough iron for all go their needs and Beef is taking the lead with Pause quite scared. Beef tries to lead Pause into a cave where more iron is but Pakratt gets it. After a little bit of messing around Beef really wants to go to the surface. The Enderman walks into lava and starts running at Pause for some reason. The Enderman walks into lava and Beef suggests that an Ender Pearl would be good in a fight. No one would see it coming! Beef is being Pauses moral support and recalls way back to when in Episode  of Season  where he recovered from very low health. Pak gets some smooth stone for a trap and Beef hopes that a trap will kill someone at one point. Beef gets on the surface with Pause and gets hyped up to go. Beef sees a Skeleton behind a tree and Pause turns and sees Pak. Vechs gets Hot Topic and Beef sees someone. Hes alone! Beef recognizes that its BTC and Pause charges BTC. Stop running away! Can you blame him? Pause is on the chase and BTC has to eat which gives Pause time to catch up. Pause hits BTC away and BTC dives into the ravine. They have no bow and Millbee is right there. Typical BTC. Pause is feeling good about taking The Bob Hoskins Experience on. Beef can just see Millbee. Pause heads to the first level. Beef shoves a cow down and it lands on Brian. Pause just wants to kill BTC. Millbee starts shooting up at Aqua. Pause is right near BTC and digging down. Arrows go off and theyre shooting at mobs. Episode ends.OldGanon Team DBMC the OGHD seems to be working this go around for OldGanon. As they make armor Dinnerbone confirms that a helmet is the last piece of armor they should take. Ganon follows MCs path into the ravine and MC sees a way to get into the Nether. Dinnerbone tells MC that they need snowballs and a Skeleton hits MC To . Ganon sees a Zombie fall on MC and MC kills it but hes down less now. Ganons pretty quiet compared to MC and Dinnerbone but as a Far Lander I know all about watching the quiet one in UHC. Dinnerbones quite scared of the monsters he coded himself. Ganon breaks into a mineshaft and Dinnerbone gets three gold blocks. Dinnerbone sees Ganons nameplate and thinks its Aqua but its not. Its just classic UHC caving here. I just realized I didnt hit save when I did Aqua so you guys get two in one recapness. An Enderman runs right through Ganon but he handles it with grace. A Skeleton shoots Ganon in the chest but Ganon doesnt take damage. OG. Theres nor much going on to recap really. Dinnerbone looks at the scary tab list and then finds lots of gold. Put that in your UHC montage MC says. This teams solid but uneventful. Suddenly MC sees the WORLD BORDER closing in. Ganon is shocked and the border is starting to cut off DBMC the OG. I have never seen a World Border IRL! MC yells. Ive seen one in real life Dinnerbone says. Weve got fivetwo minutes. Ganon starts navigating MC to their stuff but they get lost.Nebris Team YellowSeth welcomes everyone back to the third episode as he gets some Diamonds. As everybody gets some things together Nebris refreshes his Minecraft app to get game sounds. He returns to Seth and Jsano still hanging around Seth realizing that theyre in a dangerous ravine. Jsano eats a Golden Apple and theyre just heading around and caving. Sometimes in caving theres not much for me to talk about. Nebris finds six gold and theyre one away from crafting a third apple. Not sure why Jsano isnt eating his second I know theres a buff for combat but hell have seven if he just eats it. Nebris warns about Silverfish blocks when he sees an Emerald reminding us that theyre in Extreme Hills. Seth is trying really hard to say Jsano right but Jsano is okay that no one can say it right. Seth gets at least eight gold and everything is looking good. Jsano should really eat a second apple now to get to  then keep the third for combat to get to  in a fight. These go up to eleven. Nebris sees...something under lava and finds more gold. Anderz types the troll about being full of supplies when that happens. The guys get an Enchantment Table up very stealthily. Seth says that they can control their enchants and Yellow starts gearing up. They recovered from the Endermite quite nicely. Nebris looks through at enchanting and the guys spread the lapis around as Nebris tries to get enchants.Baj Team Green Current Winning TeamAnderz gets more gold right when we come in. As I remember Baj and Anderz are with each other and Etho is off on his own. A baby zombie heads after Anderz and Baj goes to Anderz as Anderz clearly needs some help. Anderz hears a Zombie very close by and Etho warns Anderz that he needs to be careful as he gets excited too easily. Baj heads into Anderzs cave and Anderz reads the health taken on the damage list. Etho cant help to gasp at Pause being at half health. Anderz says that Baj and Etho always push his buttons. Anderz and Baj find an intersecting ravine and a lot of gold and Etho starts freaking out and taking damage. These guys are coming through the cracks! Ethos at six hearts but theres plenty of gold for them to bring Etho back. This is quite a large cave but theres really nothing going on as far as mobs go. Etho goes back to the Diamonds he found eight and Green is getting set up. Theres no rush Baj says as Etho suggests getting a Diamond Sword. Etho needs blocks and says that he would so love to strip mine. Baj tells Etho that hes taking it to literally as its to stop people from just grinding. Anderz has to get apples for Etho and Etho says that a Creeper wouldve finished him. Anderz says that he thinks hes looked at an Enderman and wow Baj and Anderz dug into a waterfall. Sneaky. Baj sees that the Border is getting pretty close and Baj gets his Mushroom Stew to head out. Baj sees Etho and Etho heads in to help out. The border is fifteen blocks away and Anderz needs to get out. Anderz taunts a little and Etho takes a Golden Apple. Anderz goes to look at the Border and Etho says that its like an old man chasing you with a cane. Like Baj. Green heads out in the terrain and Baj suggests hiding in a birch forest. Baj bounces around the idea of going to the Nether and talks about a UHC he did with Blue about rushing the Nether and dying. Baj gets some tree cows....three cows? Nyah?Vechs Team Pretty in PinkSee reply,mindcrack,chpl43e,40,t5_2to85

My guys and probably most others would find the most OP thing and then crush the others into despair.As a perfect example I notice none of the mindcrackers are using projectile protection armor.

1355782,0,t1_cim8c87,Basically you are watching a video that is already on YouTube but are joined by other viewers and the creator to all watch it together live at the same time. The thing to remember is the site is supposed to end up something like Patreon. So for those guys that use Patreon they could offer something like If you support me for  a month you get  Watch Rooms with me each month or something like that. So it isnt content that doesnt exist for free on youtube already but if you want that personal experiance with the creator to talk about the video live you get that as a supporter. This is completely up to the creator how they structure it. For instance this test I was doing tonight even though it didnt work at all wasnt something that you had to back me at all.

Its to supplementreplace his ad revenue income. As I understand it patronage is a commitment upon which the creator is depending for funding or supplementing their personal income. I hope that the current figures stay the same for Kurt because that would be awesome for him in addition to any residual income from Googles ads and I hope that todays commitment level isnt just due to hype. Ive committed to a rather smallbutmanageable amount because I want to be in it for the foreseeable future. Income taxes? Rentmortgage? Car paymentsgasinsurancemaintenance? Glutenfree groceries? Savings for future? Disposableincome allowance? All those hookers and blow?These are things that need to be considered if one has been making a living wage from Googles ad revenue for  years and is suddenly going to be reducing that revenue by committing to eliminate ads.,mindcrack,cjcmm8q,10,t5_2to85

Take someone like Guude who you always know is being as honest with you as possible every video. Hes doing it for us. However its his living. Hes entertaining us because he loves it but a strong incentive is that at the end of the day he gets money out of it too. But his main goal is still to entertain us. If he had a video on a server and he really enjoyed it the rest of us would probably go check it out because we know hes saying what he really thinks. Basically I wouldnt have a problem if they were just being paid to play on the server. Whatever they get extra money. The problem I have is when they feel the need to advertise how great it is when we know thats probably not their opinion. It really looses its appeal for me when I know theyre no longer being legitimate with me and theyre just another advertisements. For me advertisements are something to skip to get to the show. If I wanted to be lied to about a crappy product Id just go watch TV. ,mindcrack,cjmgea2,9,t5_2to85

1717974,0,t3_2e103w,Ive been raising hell about this for so long its nice to see that Mojang finally stepped up and did something about it. Even if the EULA was vague it served its purpose. Props to Mog for opening up the debate a bit more in regard to the EULA as well. Only good things can come out of this people stop capitalizing on the gullibility of minors and now they have to think of a new way to not violate the EULA and still make a buck. This increases competition and development between the server hosts so how is any of this bad?Now Mojang needs to do something about the content creators taking money for paid advertisements and not disclosing it to the people watching their videos. On that note how can people even remotely be pissed about the EULA as well as the paid advertisement debacle? They seem to go hand in hand if youre going to be pissed about the one it would stand that you would be pissed about the other eh instead of being upset about one because it affects you and the other because it doesnt.,mindcrack,cjvpp0x,2,t5_2to85

What theyre doing is illegal plain and simple. Put as many words in my mouth as you want but all Im saying is this is illegal. Tell me twice or  times that its really not a big deal and Im overexaggerating it and calling them names but youre dodging the point which is that what they are doing is illegal. Saying that they are hiding their illegal behavior is NOT exaggerated in any way how is that not exactly what theyre doing? Do you not agree that this is against the law? Or do you not agree that theyre refusing to discuss it and dismissing any points?gtDont just refer me to TotalBiscuit thats an authoritative argument.Im not trying to make an authoritative argument Im trying to refer you to an argument that has already been made. I will get that video to you as soon as I find it.gtIf people start to see the behaviour of a single mindcracker as the existential philosophy of the mindcrack community theyre blowing things way out of proportion.Im not saying its logical Im saying its going to happen. If you heard the guys from Rooster Teeth had some big scandal you would probably not regard the group and as a result have a tainted view of the individuals in a fully unbiased light. Its pretty inhuman to hear Someone from this group broke the law and not think about it. Its not logical but its a reputation thing.gtAgain thats exaggerated. A mindcracker could admit that he or she smoked marihuana which is breaking a very simpletofollow rule in the US. That doesnt automatically cast a negative light on the whole community. Its just not relevant.Seth said this actually. And youre right personal drug use is not relevant.

1741111,0,t1_cjylq1y,gt a parent should me smarter than their kid Well..... just because a parent is more intelligent does not mean they are perfect. Like I said and maybe I should add it does not make you an unintelligent parent eithergtJust because your child steals your credit card number or paypal password does not make you a crappy parent who doesnt monitor their kids enough.Like Blue said if a child wants something bad enough they will go to the ends of the earth to get it via manipulation being dishonest etc. Children in general have a lower sense of morality so they are more likely to do these things. If a kid wants a kit bad enough they will either throw a temper tantrum...or....just go into their mothers purse and take their credit card while they are sleeping. I really dont understand why there is some overgeneralization that if a parent is a good parent they will be perfect and never let their child do anything bad or wrong and especially not use their credit card. Theres also the generalization that if a kid spends a ton on it they are just from a rich family and their parents just gave them credit card info to spend hundreds for whatever reason. A child is going to do what a child is going to do. If you tell them not to touch the stove when it is on theres a good chance some of them will still touch the stove. Theres only so much a parent can control within reason. Theres only so much a parent can monitor within reason. I cant think of a single person that I know of who hasnt done over a handful of stupid things when they were young even against their parents best wishes. Parents are put on a higher bar in todays day and age than ever. Years ago parents would just let their kids go out whenever they wanted and they didnt have to tell them when they would be home where they were going etc. Just walked the streets walked into town to the store etc. In  those parents would be called neglectful. The fact that there are so many cases of children making purchases without parents consent not just in Minecraft there was a huge lawsuit against Apples free apps in the app store that had ingame purchases must prove that it is not as easy as just watch your kids and dont let them make purchases. There is no way there are as many bad parents out in the world as there are just kids being kids. Im not trying to make a huge think of the children rant whatsoever. In fact I might be doing the opposite calling children out for going to any means necessary to get their way and their lower sense of morality. Im just trying to defend parents whose children misbehave. They have enough to worry about seeing hundreds of dollars in purchases on their bank account. They already feel bad enough that somehow their child did it without their consent or knowledge. The last thing they need is other people calling them bad parents for it. ,mindcrack,cjymoux,-2,t5_2to85

What you have to remember is that this is for new viewers who dont know him as much so you need something to catch their attention. Also I found it was talking a lot about the different series without much actually showing of them. Id say a  minute video showing small  second funny clips from the different series with talking in between would be a lot more effective than a  minute video with only talking about the series. I think a bit more fastpaced quicker video showing the actual quality of the content with a bit more vibrant music overlaid would do a lot to gain interest from newer viewers and give them a good representation as to what the videos are actually like.,mindcrack,cklwv58,4,t5_2to85

2018791,0,t3_2hubkg,Apart from the fact that I started to lose interest in minecraft as a whole there are a lot of stuff in the later UHCs that make it less enjoyable for me.First and the most important one is the amount of players. Mindcrack has merged with other similar communities like Hermitcraft and ForgeCraft. Dont get me wrong Im not hating on any of those communities but they are all diffrent. People are diffrent and the experience is diffrent. The reason I watch Mindcrack is not the same with the reason I watch other YouTube videos. Having so many players from diffrent communities with diffrent target audiences makes it more of a general event instead of a Mindcrack event which makes it seem not as special.The next problem is the amount of changes they did to the gamemode. The entire point of the mode was that it was vanilla with  little change.

I know they have potential for greatness but Nebris has gone a little past the perfect balance of playfulness and seriousness and Avidya seems to be trying to hold himself back to keep the game fair. Seriously Avidya you should have just enchanted! And when he did enchant he used higher level enchants that wouldnt help anything... I know the real you is in there Avidya!Id also love to see Generik Avidya and Paulsoares. Team Old Man! Paul and Avidya are the oldest members on the server and Generiks skin is an old hermit. I feel that Paul and Avidya could get along well and Generik and Paul have done several collaborations. Plus its a nice combination of comedy and skill.I also liked how JSano and Vechs got along after Genny died in Gecho. Plus both have doing pretty well at UHC. Vechs has a bit too much playfulness though. Maybe if he unleashes his competitive side... A few more that I like but dont want to spend too much time explaining Zisteau and Docm.

2059783,0,t1_cl1n0zv,I didnt really follow the game until beef played it I always thought it was  more of an MMO hybrid made by an FPS developer. But if they arent interested in growing their channel with destiny then thats fine not everyone likes the game. But lots of small channels are getting big views off the game with basic content talking about guns funny moments strats etc. It does take some time to level the vendors but its nothing real obscene. The main thing is the shards to upgrade but you can do the daily for that. which can be a vid or the nightfall which can be several vids especially if you come up with some strat to give bc they can be fairly tough to solo with no matchmaking. There is a lot of room for vid content from this game you just gotta be creative. Its just up to bungie to keep the game allive with new raids.,mindcrack,cl1n6bi,0,t5_2to85

2073353,0,t3_2ijri9,I dont think people who take a break yes I say this rather than quit are ruining the server. Id like to make one point though first by saying its hardly fair to use the word quit here because it implies they arent ever returning. Just a few months ago people were saying GennyB and Bdubs were quitting the Mindcrack server because they werent producing Mindcrack videos and when they were it was infrequently. And look at them now. With the server reset they are both back on the Mindcrack server in full force. So no I dont think its fair to ever use the word quit in instances like this because it implies leaving and not returning. I think taking a break would be a little more appropriate at least until we are told otherwise.And no I dont think the people who are taking a break are ruining the server. What we as a fanbase have to realize and I think many of us forget is that the Mindcrackers are constantly in communication with one another. And even when they arent they still hold monthly meetings to discuss things in the group. If they felt like it was that big of a deal I am sure it would be brought up in that meeting. Spawn being a mess could easily be fixed by talking about it and seeing what can be cleaned up and what can be worked on while certain people are away.As far as why they are away...I think this is a case by case situation. Some may have just lost interest in everything Minecraft related for example in Pauses case. And some may just have lost inspiration for Mindcrack related Minecraft which would be understandable as well. Point being is that as a fan I dont expect the Mindcrackers to produce Mindcrack content all the time. Even I understand sometimes they just dont feel like it. I would rather see them producing content they enjoy rather than see them produce content they are bored with. If theyre bored with it its going to show in the commentary and interaction.And if it absolutely came down to it they could as a group decide if anything needs to be done about the inactive members. But until we here otherwise from anyone Im going to be patient with the people who arent producing Mindcrack content right now. Eventually they will come back or theyll leave the group which would be sad. Things happen for a reason and sometimes people just need a break. Give them a chance let them enjoy their break and eventually they will be back.,mindcrack,cl3da49,2,t5_2to85

2133380,0,t1_clawssk,IMO your multiplayer stuff most of which has been on the Mindcrack servers is among your best.  Your personality and the way you approach video making lend themselves well to multiplayer Minecraft.  Your early Mindcrack episodes were how I got into Mindcrack as a thing at all and I may never have watched a single video from Guude BdoubleO Beef or Pause if not for that or watched so much of Doc.  Never mind everyone else.  To me as a viewer those videos are irreplaceable and as good as your singleplayer stuff is the loss leaves a void I dont see myself filling with other Mindcrack content because its not what Im looking for in the end.Best wishes anyway and I hope it works out.,mindcrack,clazzm2,50,t5_2to85

When etho needs redstone badly for a build there is that knowledge of a chest full of dust back at the old location.Reset is how you force people to begin new.Also as someone who ran a MP server for  years it is funny how no one wants to let go of their builds and cry bloody murder when I forced a reset. Yet before a reset no one was ever on and people always complained to me that no one was on. I do a map reset and everyone gets pissed for  hours at me and then suddenly the server is packed with activity.  I never understood peoples resistance to new maps. I love starting new. And despite all the people yelling rabble rabble rabble they liked it too. Just what they reacted to didnt match their rhetoric.,mindcrack,clccdfn,1,t5_2to85

I suppose the main reason I always enjoy your minecraft vids of any sort is cause you still have the kidlike enthusiasm for even the smallest things. I perceive from the wording that you have already decided to leave tho. I tried a server for awhile myself but when people stop playing you may as well be in single player so I understand your reasons. mindcrack or not it makes no difference to me so do what you need to do man.  the golden age of minecraft youtubing is pretty much over. the ship has already hit the iceberg and now its time to get in the boats... insert sadsong.mp here,mindcrack,clco2rj,6,t5_2to85

Would they not even do that kind of collab anymore? I do not hope to find out. I hope they figure it out and he stays.

2317500,0,t1_clxz16v,I say its a survival server because thats what every single player is doing  theyre playing Minecraft in survival mode. Not calling it survival implies its something else  creative adventure minigame whatever. The world border doesnt take away the aspect of surviving. Now if they had a command block at spawn that executed the command give a diamond  every hour then that would deviate from the survival experience since players are being given items. But having a world border isnt meant to make it any less like survival.I guess what it boils down to is that you see survival as a specific way of playing Minecraft whereas I see it as a gamemode and a certain set of implied rules resource gathering and movement must be restricted to what one can manually achieve without the use of commands or mods.,mindcrack,cly5ovz,2,t5_2to85

If pumpjacks are powered and not pumping its because theres nowhere for the oil to go even if theyre at the minimum . rate they should still be pumping.  Since the crude oil tanks are empty there must not be a path from those pumpjacks to the tanksrefineries.

Download your wanted mods to the Mods folder in the forge profile folder created automatically if forge was installed with the installer.

Test and crash honestly if youre putting together your own pack you probably have a decent chance of crashing. Check the log for info on why it crashed. Fix crash issue. Repeat steps  amp  until stable. Play and possibly do some additional tweaks.As far as getting it on a launcher goes i have no idea it would probably take you being well known to a degree or putting together a thematic map ASCR RR MEamp etc. so that i would be downloaded by a bunch of people...Unless some launchers have the option to add your own privateindividual pack possibly with a code to give to friends etc. so they can download,mindcrack,cnr0knh,5,t5_2to85

2936061,0,t1_co1tol9,That is the main problem with modded series but the reason I like Ethos LP so far is that he seems to be subverting that as much as he can.Like sure he could include some ridiculous mods that are very overpowered and allow him to get indestructable armor and an AE storage system set up firstday but hes not. Hes included a lot of spiceoflife and survival mods so that even though some parts of the game gets easier read less tedious other parts get harder.And also I really like that he seems to have put a lot of thought and planning into the mods hes chosen. Hes got it all planned out that the series will last a long time so instead of trying to rush to the endgame hes taking it slow. Building a village and populating it. Keeping his resources light instead of just digging a hole in the ground and filling it with machinery. And from a tech standpoint hes only a little past the iron age.Even with Thaumcraft he was quick to get the Equivalent Exchange spell only because it makes building so much easier.Basically Id say stick with it a little past the th episode. Ethos still gearing up and getting started so Id wait until he hits some sort of stride before making a judgement that the series will be boring because mods are inherently OP.,mindcrack,co1ucgp,12,t5_2to85

3083823,0,t1_cohltsc,The youtube subscribers are the audience. Go to E and ask  people what Mindcrack is go to Minecon and ask  people what Mindcrack is.The answer will be that hardly anyone at E will even know them whilst at Minecon a lot of people will know them for their Minecraft server content. There is no contesting that.The thing which would define Mindcrack as a true gaming group is a joined focus for starters and secondly joined content between all members. Neither qualifies. Nor will it ever due to the individuality of members in the group unless youd like to stamp that as the focus. Then again if I subscribe to a movie channel Id expect it to show me movies not sport events news casts and gameshows with the odd movie thrown in. A movie channel is focussed on movies. Well ok so they are focussed on games Guude amp Jsano Utopia and Survivor podcast is not games what type of games are they focussed on then? If you watch HBO you know what to expect if you watch TLC you know what to expect what can I expect of the Mindcrack gaming group as a whole from a content clearity perspective?There is channel focus though if I watch GenerikB his videos I know what Im getting same with most if not all of the other channels they all have their own direction and style of content creation exactly what Guude choose them for when building up the Mindcrack Minecraft servers.So maybe the focus is that they offer a very broadband of content creators through their network each with their own distinct styles in the sense of European Television Networks like SBS.The definitions I gave above as in the post above this one are as neutral as I can give them.,mindcrack,cohmxoz,-1,t5_2to85

3249158,0,t3_2xah5e,Bdubs fails to consider the fact that one building may not be enough to please people. Perhaps a basketball court and a swimming pool would help the leisure for the farmers not just one leisure building. I doubt the game made it so complex that they would care whether it was a basketball court or swimming pool anyway though I think the swimming pool is more effective since its higher tier.Same with the school near the elites. You place down a middle school but they still complain about education. That is the only school in the area for quite a while and there are plenty of people living there. One school can only hold so many people. He seems to reject this though seemingly thinking It doesnt matter that there is an education problem the fact that there is a school there is enough I dont care what the factual statistics show me.I acknowledge that he has previously commented about people being mean to him but its hard for me to empathise with him and understand where he is coming from when I myself can make these assumptions without ever having played this game before. Its a strange feeling since I know that its ridiculous to think that everyones minds will work the same way and that they will see the same things I may but its very hard at the same time to understand how he can not see what is so obvious to me. Yet for some reason I am still drawn to this series. I think it is because I am eager to see the city grow and progress. As with his Tropico series though I might eventually get so frustrated with his gameplay that I will get the game for myself and play it my way and better.As you can tell this has been on my mind for a while and therefore this huge rant ensued.,mindcrack,coys80l,1,t5_2to85

Now that theyve gotten everything and dont have to spend time collecting things theyll definitely make it to  next episode. Its unlikely any of the other teams could kill the dragon in one episode even if only one team was near the portal meaning they didnt have to take up time to kill a team. Killing the dragon is a long and tedious task even with four people which will take more than  mins probably. So Im guessing unless the three teams at  completely wipe each other out leaving newcomers as the killfree winners its unlikely that this season will end with a dragon kill before episode nine.At least thats my prediction.  ,mindcrack,cp0wbam,1,t5_2to85

3273476,0,t1_cp1e9kb,What do you mean switch strats in less than a second? More than likely Arkas is going to get knocked back into the water from where Pause will probably realize he has a bigger advantage with the bow. Also Arkas killed the skeleton hence the overkill achievement. Jesus guy Pause isnt an idiot. Besides at the end of Nebris video you can see Arkas taking damage suggesting he gets hit by Pause or the skeleton both of which would interrupt his charge. You can also see his health flash again which supports the fact that it could be a bow shot from Pause the initial damage being the arrow the second damage being the flame. Once again Pause likely survives at least a minute more meaning that he likely doesnt die from the initial sword fight with Arkas. ,mindcrack,cp1ej3v,1,t5_2to85

You could hide the heads but of course if you die more than a minute later its basically like never having them in the first place.gt It will sort of be Oh Nebris has killed  people Kurt just killed Aureylian so now theres only  people left  not enough people left for anyone to beat Nebris. So I guess were done. Then people just say bye and log off. Seems strange.The goal then would be to murder Nebris where he stood and take the heads for yourself. Of course then youve got  heads to hold on to  thats nearly a third of your inventory space.gt Also what if you kill someone and take their player heads? Then the winner will end up being the last one standing... assuming PvE deaths dont take the heads away.Youd probably jump up further in the standings but I imagine people employing Bajlike strategies like I mentioned in order to safeguard themselves. It might be you win with two heads despite dying if you manage to time it right and be sneaky.,mindcrack,cp46ar8,6,t5_2to85

3561287,0,t1_cpknhtu,I personally think both the Stormcloaks and the Imperials have an equally likely chance of defeating the Aldmeri Dominion. Which is to say... practically none. While I dont like Ulfric seriously hes a racist douche the Septim Dynasty is over. This isnt the same Empire that ruled throughout the third era.If we truly wish to see who should have our faith in the war against the Aldmeri we need to look at how they withstood the Oblivion Crisis and have done since then. Cyrodil? Hero of Kvatch. Elsweyr? They freaked out when the moons disappeared When the Thalmor said Hey man it was us! they bent over for them.The Dunmer are at this point  irrelevant. Seriously. Vvardenfell is a crater. The Red Mountain erupted and the Ministry of Truth finally landed. Remember how it was a meteor that Vivec froze in time? Yep.So who is still around? Skyrim Hammerfell High Rock and... the Black Marsh. Skyrim and Hammerfell both won against the Daedra thanks to well being Redguards and Nords. High Rock we dont have much info on for the Oblivion Crisis or since. The Black Marsh though? The Argonians whipped out their scaly dick and bounced it on Dagons head. Seriously. The Daedric God CLOSED HIS OWN PORTALS TO STOP THE ARGONIANS FROM INVADING.So... who can defeat the Aldmeri? A coalition of Argonians Nords and Redguards is the only hope I can see. Now the problem is if the Empire retains control of Skyrim the Nords have their hands tied. Hammerfell is no longer a part of the Empire and by themselves held the Aldmeri at a standoff Skyrim cannot send people to help as they are still a part of the Empire with no High King to lead them either and Black Marsh seceded almost immediately after the Fall of the Septim Empire. To win youd need to convince the Argonians that the Thalmor are a threat and will be until eliminated and have both Hammerfell and Skyrim free from the Empire with the ability to go to war against the Thalmor.Boom. Another war. Shorter than before and a crap ton more dead elves. ,mindcrack,cpy7nnh,1,t5_2to85

3584151,0,t1_cq0kmg1,Mindcrack is now officially a youtube network and those who left didnt want to join that network. Its simple as that.

Thats nothing bad to hide or tiptoe around and clearly purely business.But then all the people whitelisted on the vanilla Minecraft SMP server are also a group of friends. And there nothing changes. Except that they cant call it Mindcrack anymore for the otherwise unrelated business changes mentioned above. Its just Mindcrack and Friends now. All the stuff the guys did before they will still be able to do essentially the same and that is also explicitly mentioned at the end of the blog post. Of course you cant stop anyone holding a grudge over it but thats up to the individuals and at least with Etho Bdubs and Genny I would be surprised if they did could even attempt to judge for the other  because I dont follow them. ,mindcrack,cq0tlb9,8,t5_2to85

3638982,0,t3_321kqg,For me I think the best changes would be weapon variety but not like vech mentioned I want different passives and trade offs keep the sword as kinda basic but a spear has longer reach but does less damage a big hammer that does huge damage but slows your movement and likewise for range a crossbow that takes longer to draw or a blunderbuss with really expensive ammo. weapon crafting this solves the limitations of a x area. Make it like tinkers kinda in that you craft the head and then combine it with a handle. Ive always thought that there should be more multi stage crafting. Also I like the idea of incorporating enchants into the building process . like you enchant an emerald then when you craft the weapon you have the option to add enchants that way. enemy scaling this could be really simple like the lower you go the better equipment the zombies get or a certain biome that you just cant go in if not equipped right. less linear upgrades so instead of diamond is better than iron thats better than gold etc make it so things are better based upon a particular play stylesituation gate more things behind combat. As it stands now if you are careful and patient you can get to top level gear witboughg ever killing an enemy. Make it to where the top level enchants require a wither star or zombie brains instead of lapis or you need a creeper heart to make your blunderbuss finally make farming less efficient. By this I mean make the AI and spawning less friendly to grinders so hey are more of a pain to build but also make drop rates higher on things. So people are more motivated to go fight rather than just afk in a spot for  hours.,mindcrack,cq72kry,1,t5_2to85

Niki Lauda is a very famous world champion F driver from that era known for his rivalry with English driver James Hunt.  During the crash the car burst into flames with Lauda trapped inside.  He sat inside fire for longer than any human should generally.  He spent a few days fighting for his life he suffered very bad burns but eventually made a full recovery and returned to racing.  The story of that season the rivalry and the crash is detailed in Ron Howards film Rush which is very good and you should watch it.After I finished watching I went and looked it up.  Wikipedia says that Lauda lost control just after the left kink before the Bergwerk corner.  You can see this part of the track right at the top of this map I went back and watched Kurts first lap in the RUF found the part of the track where the crash happens and found that Kurt crashes in the exact same spot.   into the video right after he says Give me a break I think Im doing alright.Footage of Laudas crash for those interested not for the faint of heart.

I asked mindcrack.tv if there were any provisions to use the Mindcrack logo and was told that they were not going to make that option available. I do think however that coming up with a new network logo that incorporates the current Mindcrack logo would help to make a stronger connection with the current members of Mindcrack and the new content providing partners of the network.

There is this gif that circulates quite frequently on rcitiesskylines and is by far the best example on how to handle huge amounts of traffic. As you can see traffic lights help. A lot. This is exactly what you need for going out of Experimentalexpansionburgh.There is also a mod called Traffic Manager and its really useful if you want more control over intersections. You can simply remove them from an intersection and assign which roads are main and secondary on an intersection so that cars on secondary roads must yield you can edit timings on intersections you can plop down pedestrian crossings anywhere you want I love this feature its actually the main reason I use this mod and itd be quite helpful if youre planning on making a pedestriancentred city change lanes...And like uDiftor pointed out educational buildings work differently  while other service buildings send cars out people go to educational buildings so their traffic line auras go in the opposite direction.,mindcrack,ct4j4gw,10,t5_2to85

Love Beef Chad Jsano and started out hating the Bteam but ended up loving them too and Im still sad they left. Soon after finding Mindcrack I started making my own Minecraft videos but I dont do just regular Lets Plays. I use the game to teach English to ESL English as a Second Language people.

5033400,0,t3_3jvobj,Wow that was boring Nebris perspective that is.For power Big reactors are soo easy. Take a look at this reactor Ive used a design like this in AG and also in AG and its served me well. Flowing cryotheum is just as good as source blocks so you can achieve this with just  buckets of the stuff easily doable manually.The cost of sand snowballs redstone the simulator gives assume youre producing blizz powder from redstone and snowballs and saltpeter from sandstone. Youve got blizzes to put in your autospawner though. Blizz powder done. You also have nether saltpeter ore. Done.Or make a smaller one that fits your requirements using the simulator height is good for saving on cryotheum though and that setup is very efficient. I was going to make the height version of this in my world... but so far Ive not needed it.Also youre probably wrong about having to do the epic bacon thing with botania. Allium does in fact produce magenta dye according to NEI. Even if it were true  production tables can do the mortarpestling plus also the crafting of the epic bacon itself. The only problem with that approach is if youre producing some of the ingredients faster than others... then the chest the production tables are trying to craft tofrom will overflow and youre screwed.You can solve the overflow problem with  routers set to only output to a specific slot though. Then its also much faster to use one cyclic assembler.,mindcrack,cusps9c,2,t5_2to85

5042542,0,t3_3k0p9l,Man reddit has been absolute shit! But guess what wont be shit? Episode  of UHC !Kurt Team Kelley Blue BookTeam Assistance is the title. The recap goes over mainly the mishaps that were resolved to get KBB an enchanting table. Kurt still has a stack of eggs he said theyd be important in episode . BTC will make two more diamond swords trying to get Sharpness. They both get Smite. What the hell BTC says. Oh well. Kurt throws it back to BTC. Beef gets BTC a Sharpness I Knockback I sword BTC accepts it. Theyre ready to wreck face low health be damned. BACON WAS SLAIN BY WOLF FIRST DEATH! The wolf the wolf! Kurt types in chat and Snarky Yellow Text says. So with no video from Wyld or Pause what happens now? BTC starts staircasing but ends up following F. SHREE KILLS WYLD FOR HIS FIRST UHC KILL! Well maybe it was his wolf that killed Bacon. Shree congratulates Bacon and Wyld for having played hell and Guude asks about what do about Pause. They see the  hill Atlas found last episode. Pause logs in and Shree kills him. Sorry Pause . BTC makes a Game of Thrones reference and they are confused. But their references were fine. BTC wants to cave the night away but Beef doesnt want to do that. BTC gets hit twice by a skeleton and is terrible with the bow. Beef makes fun of him for all the missed shots. BTC is at  hearts and then yells MOTHERFUCKER! Hes at . now. BTC was right predictably. Shouldve stayed underground. Im basically a one hit kill at this point. Oh you are? Awesome! Well BTCs going to need some gold. Beef takes fall damage right in front of Kurt. Halfaheart of damage. Beef finds an Abandoned Mineshaft Kurt says there arent chests but hey theyve been wrong before! Theyre wrong again. Beef finds melon seeds. Lets go to the Nether! Stay tuned for another  episodes of UHC ! Beef is poisoned to halfaheart by Cave Spiders and Vechs basically tells chat his team has brewing. BTC finds some gold but theres no apples. Beef really is trying to get some gold. Its going to be your doom! BEEF WAS SLAIN BY CAVE SPIDER. Wow. BTC plays the sad trombone music. My  and  predictions were correct. Kurt wonders if Beef had any items of value as Kurt digs down. BTC has one gold piece guys he and Kurt will be fine. RIP BEEF. Shree Team OSHAThey are digging through walls to find Bacon and Guude says Pause could ambush them from behind. I was not as offbase as I sounded! Shree realizes that the dogs Guude aggroed are all snarling at Bacon through the wall from when Guude hit Bacon. Guude digs through to them more lava dogs jump through and that kill on Bacon is Guudes. Shree sees Wyld whos on the run and shoots at him. Wyld shoots Shree through lava to burn him to . Theres lava absolutely everywhere. Shree finds Wyld jumps down and slaughters him and begins recovering from the sweat. Holy crap man Im sweating Guude says as Wyld vows next time gadget. Shree asks if Guude wants to message him Pause logs back in and looks at Shree as the life leaves his eyes. Shree gets Pauses Bane of Arthopods II sword over his Bane of Arthopods I sword. Am I going to get a lost of dislikes on my video now? Shree asks. Guude tells him that age has passed. Get ready Hermitcrafters! s. Shree gives a lot of credit to Bacon and Wyld doing all they could. How many dogs are left? We dont know. Guude takes a break to restart CrackCam. Of course Bad Luck Baj got zero kills and lost a lot of dogs. Guude says this is episode . Wyld in skype says he got hit with a flaming arrow as well. Guude says he was too much of a pussy to drop down and melee Wyld like Shree. Baj easily catches on to Vechs potions. Vechs is a Nether lover Baj says then the OOOOOOOOOOO comes as Beef is Cave Spiderd. Sevadus Team AtlasFINALLY! Im watching Sevadus video! Sevadus says that with Pause dead Bacon and Wyld may be in their first ever UHC. Aurey correctly remembers that Bacon overslept the charity UHC. Sevadus cannot believe that Bacon died to a wolf and MC says sorry. Sevadus cannot wrap his head around taming a wolf. Sev says MC and Shree are not on the same time and just dont get how it worked. Pause joins is slain. Sev thinks me might have spotted a player far in the distance. They keep exploring for players during the night until Nebris decides to camp a hill. The teams camping escapades are going well. Aurey somehow takes damage from Nebris to . See I told you Im the fuckup of this group Nebris says. SMH. Nebris takes some Creeper damage. Weve earned the right to go caving Nebris says. Mhykol Team Burnin MinersPyro reads on the materials for Harming II. Mhykol and Pyro are going to be working on brewing and Pakratt is yelling out helpfulness from exploring an Abandoned Mineshaft. Pakratt finds melon seeds and takes some damage before he plans to return to the brew crew. Pakratt has a great moment with a mob but it will be never be seen. The seeds are planted and Pakratt bonemeals them up. When Pakratt breaks a fully grown melon stalk he gets three back. Unbelievable. They cannot believe the explosion of melons that just occurred. However they cannot figure out to make it. Thats...not cool. They have more than nine gold they can make the gold block. FIGURE IT OUT GUYS! You can do it. You can do it Pakratt. Its a block. Use your mental willpower. Mhykols moved on to trying ingots. Move on to blocks please. They seem to give up. Pakratt officially decides that it was broken. Make a block make a block. Burnin Miners admits defeat Mhykol uses the gold for a block to make a golden apple. Pyro thinks Beef tried to get the melons as well. Pakratt says he feels bad not asking about health potions. It wasnt your fault Pakratt. FreePakrattofGuilt.MCGamer Team SurvivorBack to the surface for Survivor and Jsano takes Creeper damage.  As they explore MC sees torches. MC keeps note of wolves and says MC says sorry confusing Atlas forever. Theres bones and experience that MC sees I think this might be KBBs old hangout. MC says that he is experience the mostpeaceful scaredness he has ever. MC falls to . as he fails sprinting. MC falls off jungle vines to . Im getting owned by fall damage. Survivor is right where KBB was a few minutes ago a lot of almost encounters going on. MC drops down a lapis block at  and says they should die now. Jsano needs to go to the bathroom and almost thinks that a sheep was a player nearly shitting himself. No player would make that mistake! Jsano literally then shits himself in the bathroom as MC apologies for derp face. Vechs Team Sechsy ChadEpisode the th. Pause was very close to being the second disconnect death but ended up getting killed more honorably. They get enough gold for potion round two and decide against splash potions. Seth wonders what actually befell Bacon. They actually test out a splash potion and one splash to full health. Vechs and Seth hold on to the other two splash potions. Chad stumbles into five diamonds seconds after wondering how they hadnt found more. How do you make a book? Seth figures it out instantly. Well full health and enchants for this time prophetic Vechs thumbnail Vechs commenting a lot GG everybody. It would be nice if he had more potions. Yeah. They begin to staircase to the surface. They then find more gold for MORE potions. Seth is angry at Vechs saying brew but Vechs says he could be bluffing. Everybody believed Vechs. The question on everybodys minds is if this is the best recovery in UHC history. BdoubleO Season  I think can never be topped. Seth finds Cave Spiders and blocks it off telling everybody to run but Vechs doesnt. I actually wrote this when I recapped that From worst to first in about five minutes. Holy shit. Two splash potions per person but Vechs snags all of them to inflate his FUHC score.BaconDonut Team NrdishAlrighty then here we are. Bacon and Wyld are holed up and Bacon wonders if they should leave the way they came. The wolves are growling and Bacon sees Guude digging. He has lava at the ready. A block breaks and one dog pops through hitting Bacon to . but he places lava. Bacon realizes they were digging holes and sending the dogs through. He yells GG and presses the button making the GG noise on his desk. Alright youre on your own good luck Im out! All we hear is Wyld saying No! No! No! Im on Fire! And Nrdish was never heard from again.Avidya Team DNAMore gold for Anderz. Lepraviking is on point my friend. Thunder finally sounds out after six episodes of waiting upon Bacons death. Theres more lightning when Wyld dies and Anderz moves forward into getting shot in the face. They find some cave that they swear was explored by another team. Avidya wants fanart of Pause crying with disconnect messages on the screen. Doc scares Avidya and they keep caving. If you shake twice you aint playing! They start to talk about the talk from their parents. Anderz says his dad is the strong silent type. Avidya and Anderz agree that used to thought kissing girls would get them pregnant. Anderz says he was scared in sex that he wouldnt know where to stick it. Doc jumps in and says his mom gave him the talk at  and he was the only one of his friends that knew about sex. They are now appled up and are ready to move toward the center. Slowly they begin to leave and Doc says Nebris always goes tryhard. WrapUpKBB and Survivor are at two players and are near death while everybody else looks like possible winners. What will happen next?,mindcrack,cuttfp7,41,t5_2to85

Mostly watched just Etho until the PMC server came online then started watching more and more of the Mindcrackers until I had no spare time burnt myself out on watching the YouTubes then stopped for a while. I am back watching more of the guys now. Currently I watch The Show  Days To Die Terraria . is EZ and am catching up on Agrarian Skies II.Aside from watching too much of the YouTubes I am attempting to make LPs of my own. My channel is tiny  subs I think?. This is sort of a way to do a shameless selfplug but I am not going to link to it here as thats too much of an advertisement for my liking. Outside of that I work full time at a supermarket in the Liquor department. Some days I enjoy my job others I dont. Generally I hate my job for the first half of the week and then enjoy it over the second half. This isnt because I look forward to the weekend but moreso that I have to tidy up after my weekend. Other people just dont seem to be as picky at getting the job done in my department as I am and it frustrates the heck out of me.,mindcrack,cvcdlk0,1,t5_2to85

Obviously this time is different because its guude doing nothing for chad to make that money but the reason they donated that much was to see guudes reaction. You also have to take into account that chad lives in a very expensive city. His rent is probably upwards of  dollars a month not considering utilities and other necessary expenses. He also travels all over the world going to conventions which in his line of work is basically essential. You also dont see the behind the scenes work that chad does to make his channel and twitch work. The amount of effort he puts in to run  channels stream every other day and help out with mindcrack stuff probably puts him at working  hours a week. ,mindcrack,cvx3jz8,2,t5_2to85

You now will have watched about  videos. Now lets go with the old standard of  views   this means you as a single viewer would then be equal to . cent. So in a month time you would make a channel  cents. Based on your statistics you would then make  cents more for a channel than originally. Though basically this is not a system to reward youtubers at all since they already have youtube sponsorship system for that. Where you can pay . to sponsor a channel. from which I think most goes to the content creator.

Since then Bdubs has said that Mindcrack is friends one time in one video just after the split but it seemed like a sore spot very vague about it and he really hasnt talked about Mindcrack or you or really even spoken the word Mindcrack ever since... as far as Generik he has made some odd remarks about getting out of an unfavorableunpleasantbad situation and how it was a personally important decision for himself to split. Something else about how sometimes you dont really know if your friends are impacting you positively or negatively until you step away from them.I know you really dont care to talk about this but... its just weird for the viewers Guude and I feel like well never know what happened to incite this apparent? friction between Mindcrackyou? and Bdubs and Generik. and if thats the way it has to be then so be it I accept. But I can still be sad about that and wonder as a fan. Its been such a long time since stuff has happened between Am I reading too much into it? I understand that people do grow apart but this just doesnt seem like that to me as a long time fan of all of you guys.Really I just want to know if theres ever a chance that you and Bdoubleo will ever do something together again because you guys had such awesome chemistry and you seemed so friendly with Generik at playoncon and stuff like that...

7616816,0,t1_d37skfs,We dont know who voted for who but this would be my guess as to who voted for who.The  sureJustVan Dark. With what we know he could only have voted for Dark But on accident. During the Live Stream Guude said that JustVan had accidentally voted for the person he didnt want to win however it didnt make a difference. The only way that could have worked out and still have Dire win and no ties would be if it would have been  Dark vote and  Dire votes. And then JustVans vote making it  Dark votes and  Dire votes.Deci Dire. He knew what he was doing he wasnt being malicious. Dire was the one who claimed responsibility for being the reason people were voted out along with being the one that people perceived as pulling all the strings. Dark never appeared to do anything that could be perceived as malicious so I think its safe to say that Deci voted for Dire.The maybesHonney Maybe Dire? For me Im just trying to figure out whos going to be the best fit over all. Dire kinda has this bigger than big personality and Dark is an awesome person. Im honestly not sure on this one but based on what she said she was much more descriptive about Dire opposed to simply saying a general statement of Dark is an awesome person.ThreeTwo Dire? Im going to cast my vote based not only how they played the game today but also based on who I think would fit best and who I want to see on the Mindcrack server the most. Im not sure how much time ThreeTwo had to get to know Dark or Dire. But the way ThreeTwo left the game was in a Tie with Dire and with the sudden death spleef challenge. I could see that as an instant gain of respect towards Dire. Although Im just trying to grasp at anything that makes any sense. The Im going to guess but ehhhhh?Brian Pretty much said I like Dark BUT  Just the way it was all phrased sounded like Darks a great guy BUT Im voting for Dire kind of thing. But then again hes very descriptive of all the things he knows about Dark... Rsmalec I had to go with some words that really spoke to me. During the interviews Dark talked a lot about how humble Youtubers were his inspirationqualities he looks up to. Perhaps this is what he meant? But then again Dire really did have a silver tongue in the interviews.Final guessesJustVan DarkBrainDarkThreeTwoDireDeciDireRsmalecDireHonneyDire,mindcrack,d37zqi1,5,t5_2to85

Seths generator is my favourite one because it leaves open space around the cobble so even if it flies off youll catch it because player catching usually overrides burning in lava.All in all maybe  minutes max to get a stack of cobble. If you hammer it drectly instead of breaking it with a pick you have a stack of gravel in two minutes  actually do  and compress to  blocks and run through heavy sieve  bunch of stuff in  minutes.

Anything more than that would just mean having to add tons more options if you try to do by type so ores food ect using the forge database its inevitably going to break for some item or another so that needs to be an additional option not a replacement... and that just means making it more complicated and confusing for a first time user.,mindcrack,d3u0mlh,2,t5_2to85

A reminder for us to be compassionate.You mention feeling more distrust and disconnectedness and for sure I think this translates to reduced happiness.  There is a book called The Art of Happiness that you might find interesting to read because it talks about the importance to our own happiness of trust and connectedness.  Its simplistic but I found it very helpful in a time that I thought very negatively and guarded.  It let me think more generously about people again which felt like a weight being lifted. ,mindcrack,d4ftkfv,1,t5_2to85

8568578,0,t1_d6clxir,How so? Its a valid part of the game and blue team did well raiding the fort so its not like they got completely screwed over. Made for a far more entertaining battle IMO than a generic v out on a field.Its minecraft there are a lot of creative ways you can deal with a fort its actually not a particularily big advantage at all. In fact being stuck in a box can often be a disadvantage for example Seths death where he didnt see the other team breaking through the walls. Unlike say portal trapping which can be hard to circumvent or strength II potions which makes the game far too onesided if a team gets lucky with blazes what Wiki did actually gave us both super exciting footage from both sides building up as well as a great and unique final fight.Anyway context is key. Wiki only needed one extra ended pearl and the only reason they camped out at the portal was so that they didnt miss another team entering which they would have if they had camped elsewhere. Walls to protect against sniper fire built up to become a fortress but its not like they sat down and said lets wait for a team to come and steal their stuff they were only one ender pearl short and spent the entire time searching for one until they were spotted by GK.,mindcrack,d6cnifg,14,t5_2to85

10967743,0,t1_deb8n35,Yes but again only if they havent watched the previous episodes.I guess or if you only watch a single persons perspectives and want to be kept in the dark about who they have left to face.Those people are probably watching via YouTube inbox though not via the thread.Anyway I was just curious. Got some insight and some downvotes as expected.Cheers,mindcrack,deb8u6t,1,t5_2to85
10975217,0,t1_deauvmz,They were only close because Anders did a Kurt and went hiking at the start. If Anders hadnt taken the easy kill and waited hed deserve to be killed in episode  because he stayed near an enemy and took his eye off him.,mindcrack,dec1j8r,5,t5_2to85
11006980,0,t1_deflcb1,You talk as if Mindcrack is a sports team. They arent and they never were. None of them were ever really good at Minecraft UHC it took like  seasons before peole started combining sharpnes  iron swords. Almost noone remembers that the day starts at the start of the episode for a very long time Anderz was the only one that would properly cave some seasons noone even went to the nether.  The Mindcrackers were never actually good at UHC only Nebris when he was practicing every week got close to the level of top players. Mindcrack UHC has never been a sport it is just some friends who come together to play a game where they have fun.,mindcrack,deflze5,3,t5_2to85

As far as I can tell since launch it has always been wildly popular enough that the PC version has never had a discounted price. The console versions have though.  If you cant afford to budget  for a game right now Id suggest you look into getting a part time job to fill some of the time you were planning on playing.
