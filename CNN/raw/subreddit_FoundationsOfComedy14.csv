5164262,0,t3_3kfib1,In The Birdcage there are definitely themes of a dysfunctional father and son relationship like the sketch in the post. It reminds me of the relationship between Robin Williams and his son where they have this strain put on them where the son wants to cover up his dads homosexuality from his girlfriends parents and in the sketch where the son doesnt take the time to call his mom and has to deal with her nagging. Even with these conflicts you can see that they have a close relationship in The Birdcage through how they talk to each other and here in the sketch where she does the baby talk to him and he responds. I think both of these scenes allow us to relate to how often we are annoyed by our parents but at the end of the day truly love them.,FoundationsOfComedy14,cv8hgw1,1,t5_32wtq
