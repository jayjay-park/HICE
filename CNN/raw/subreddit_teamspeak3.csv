10251074,0,t1_dc5l4j3,Ive found a lot more information since I posted this so Ill start over with what Im doing. What Im doingWe have a Teamspeak server that we use for our gaming group and we want it set up so that only specific people can join this server. The way people will gain access to this server is by logging into a web application Ill be hosting through Azure running C on the back end. Once they log in theyll be given a link to open up the Teamspeak server and everything will be handled automatically.What Ive gotNow Like I said I have figured a lot of this out already I googled around a lot more and found this forum post about creating a sort of Whitelist. The server is now setup with a password that no one knows and I have a specific group setup that ignores the virtual server password allowing anyone with the group to join. I have tested creating a privilege key to assign the group and having a link on the website to join the server and requesting the key allowing someone without the password to join and it works.What Im stuck on nowI need to generate the correct privilege key to assign this group when someone logs into the website which is were the C comes into play. In this post which was linked in the original post the OP said to use token add to generate the privilege key. Im now having trouble finding out how to run scripts on the site to run the token add code. The best thing Ive found so far is this github project which seems to allow you to run these scripts in C. There doesnt seem to be much documentation on running TS scripts so Im having trouble on figuring out how to do this part.What I needtldrHow do I run scripts such as token add. Ive seen a few people say you can do it with PHP which would be fine but Id prefer to run it in C.,teamspeak3,dc60kn6,1,t5_2wshq

10912636,0,t1_de5iajl,Hello         I am going off of the instructions given in the download the serverupgrade.txt  this is what it saysActually updating a server is very easy. Just download the latest TeamSpeak  Server release fromour downloads page and overwrite all existing files in your servers installation folder with thenew versions from the download package.Example for Windows Bita Navigate your web browser to b Unzip the download package teamspeakserverwinltVERSIONgt.zip to a directory of yourchoicec Shutdown your running TeamSpeak  Server instanced Select and copy all files from the newly generated directory teamspeakserverwin intoyour existing server installation directorye Start your TeamSpeak  Server instancef Use the TeamSpeak  Client to connect to a virtual server running in your TeamSpeak  Serverinstance and click the server name to verify that your server has been updated successfullyI did all this  when I start the new exe it will start but gains no IP and client cannot connect.  Simply copying and pasting the contents from the new download file is not the answer and I cant figure out how it needs to be done to work and retain my current settings channels etc.,teamspeak3,de5k7dd,1,t5_2wshq
