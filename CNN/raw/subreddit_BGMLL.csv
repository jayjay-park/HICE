10257198,0,t1_dc6o7j4,I have a few ideas for this actually. If we can actually put them into effect without it being too complicated that would be really cool.. Coaches arent hired with the same money thats used for players instead they are hired with a separate pool of money used for coaches only. Each team would be able to hire a head coach assistant coach offensive coordinator and defensive coordinator. There would be a hard limit for money spent on coaches M. Head coaches could generally cost M assistant coaches M and offensive and defensive coordinators could cost M or so each.. Coaches can be fired only during the offseason or before the third quarter export inseason. If you fire a coach before their contract is up then your coach cap gets a small reduction  million or so depending on which type of coach you fired for the rest of their contract.. Coaches would have ratings similar to players. But they would only have one  rating and everything else would be replaced by schemes. Schemes show how good a coach is with working with a specific type of team or player. There could be schemes for working with a young team a team with a good point guard a team that shoots a lot of threes etc. We could have as many of these as we needed. Each coach would be rated  on how well they could work with a scheme. Schemes could also be sorted into categories.. However not every rating for every scheme is known during a coachs first year as a coach. As the coach gains experience their schemes are revealed. For example if a coach works with a yearold superstar center that gets  rebounds a game then their rating for that scheme would be revealed. Experience with a scheme can also increase the scheme rating.If you have any questions about this feel free to ask Im open to suggestions.,BGMLL,dc6pk25,2,t5_3941v
