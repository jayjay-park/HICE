1271045,0,t1_cickocj,one man who had a bit of land expropriated for this LRT project started the coalition thing  of course it usually starts with one person. He took offense started this coalition which from investigation ref appears to be a shell corporation with no taxpayer involvement. Who knows thats just what I read.Im not sure that the project was a worthwhile one as a resident and a taxpayer. However the fact is... its happening.From my recollection the city didnt really provide valid opportunities to the citizens to discuss it voice opinions or otherwise  Insomuch that council meetings and public forums were held where public was invited to come out and speak but at times when people would otherwise be at work or short notice to the forums in order to prepare for time off to go down and in some cases closed the doors when people showed up citing too many people already inside.Theres a lot of political sway seemingly with the groups that won out on this project and were going to see taxes rise further. I dont really think its going to get as much use as they would like and its going to be many years before it starts to make money.Despite my feelings on the project not being worthwhile I have high hopes for it since its a go but high hopes dont equal success nor do they make miracles happen.,waterloo,ciclyec,1,t5_2qpo5

2181274,0,t1_clgza5d,i accept that fact you stated out of curiosity are you an investor of the ION in any way? you seem to be a very large supporter and public speaker on the topic which is great if your supporting! i read some of your other posts and you do spend time to research so that is a good on you. I see a few more posts asking about tax refund and cancelling the project would probably cost more and i do agree with those so we might as well go ahead...... but shouldnt went through in the first place. I can speak for myself on how me personally wouldnt use it my family commutes if we dont commute and want to visit the downtownuptown area it would be neat to take the ION but even then KW isnt large enough to take a static mode of transportation to see enough for a day.Example Saturday morning ION from waterloo to kitchener go to the farmers market and ..... stay there.... and go back to waterloo... as opposed to driving i have more options. if this project took place in toronto id support it you would need a all inclusive vacation to see the sights a large city has to offer and static transportation is feasible and cost effective. i myself i will try it once take  round trip fare from me and thats probably about it from me butttt ill probably help pay it off for the rest of my life. ,waterloo,clh3coh,1,t5_2qpo5

2767613,0,t1_cng8wrm,I have a friend who is a municipal road patroller.   The municipalities are legally required to ensure roads meet standards set by the Government of Ontario.   Roads have different classifications and how they are maintained depends on that classification.   The information is plotted on a tablet.    Work orders are generated for the appropriate departments.    Regional road issues are forwarded to the region for action.   Some issues such as a downed stop sign have to be called into dispatch.   Someone puts out a temporary sign and a work order is generated for a permanent fix.     Potholes have to fit into certain size and depth raised manhole covers have to be a certain depth.   Yep he has to do measurements.  Signs are only allowed to lean a certain amount.      Certain asphalt temperatures have to be recorded.   I believe that is on bridges.   I joke with him that all he does is drive around all day.   In fact he has to follow a set of standards set out by Queens Park.   Governments love to make things complicated.  The city is divided up into salting and plowing zones.   In the winter he is required to do a winter patrol and reports back to the central dispatch anything that does not meet the standards.      ,waterloo,cnio117,1,t5_2qpo5

If your car does end up failing there will be talk of more money so dont be surprised but there are government mandated limits to these costs.

8201976,0,t3_4rkbca,Urban planners actually spend a lot of time looking at these sorts of thing and factoring it into siteneighbourhood design.This can even happen with driving. For example Thunder Bay was created by combining two communities  Fort William and Port Arthur with a fair bit of open land between the two.  When I lived there people would thinking nothing of travelling a long distance by internal city standards within one of these two communities but would balk at even shorter trips from one to the other.  This was such a thing at least in the s that if we offered a program in one of the two former towns next time we had to offer it in the other instead.The craziest example of parking and walking resistance for me was when the St. Catharines Y was located downtown. We had limited onsite parking and when it was full you had to leave your car in a parking garage a block or so over. Many people absolutely hated that even on nice days despite the fact that they were coming to the Y to workout.Two factors in addition to other mentioned in this thread that affect acceptable walking distances for people is the number of places to be visited and the time expected to be spent.  Going to a downtown area like Uptown Waterloo people tend to consider the individual stores they are going to. So if they are only planning on visiting a single restaurant or store they expect to park closer. Going to the mall people often view it as they are going to a multistore destination even if they only need to visit one of them.Finally and someone else touched on this unpredictability reduces positive perceptions of parkingwalking experiences. Using the St. Catharines example if the small onsite parking was always full people would accept the walk more readily than was the case in which you could find a spot about half the time.  Even though there is variability in parking distances when you visit a large mall it feels like a predictable experience. City centre parking tends to feel less predictable to people unless they develop a favourite parking location that is consistently available.Source Past employee for the City of Thunder Bay and the St. Catharines Y.

Theyre looking to see that everything is safe for a tenant to live there. just kidding its a cash grab!ESA  They want to make sure everything is safe and to code. They will give you a list of defects that need to be corrected in order to pass. To give you an idea of some of my defects I had to replace cracked light switch covers add another screw to an electrical box so it was tightly secured and the big one was that the wires coming in to service my house were rubbing against the shingles and fraying. I had to either replace the wire or move it away from the shingles. It could be big or small jobs but youll never pass first try. Once they give you a list of defects you have to hire an electrician or pull an ESA permit to get the work done.HVAC  they looked at all the gas systems in the house. The dryer vent was flexible  they made me replace it with tin. The gas vent has to be two feet away from the house so they had to extend mine by . They also tested the pressure of the furnace to make sure it could blow heat around the house and wasnt leaking. They used some fancy looking tool to spit out a receipt and that was what proved I passed the HVAC inspection. If you dont pass again youll get a list of defects. Youll need to hire a licensed gas person to complete the work. The receipt from that work is what shows you pass the HVAC inspection.Other Items to NoteMake sure you do all of these items within  months. The city dragged my licensing process on so long that my inspections didnt meet their criteria anymore. It has to be  months current so make this one of the last things you do for your application.I dont know if this is what you were looking for.

Ill still be right.The city could expand into some adjacent farmland and the costs would not be as outrageous nor the impact as disastrous as a few people would have you believe. The world would not stop spinning. If anything it would make the cost of living more economically viable for more people. You really have to think we live at the center of the universe and the future of the planet rests on the decisions of the Region of Waterloo to think otherwise. The city needs to grow upwards and the city needs to grow outwards. Families arent going to live in condos. Theyre going to go elsewhere. Unfortunately some folks are all too happy with the gravy train theyre riding to care and why should they?It seems every idiot who heard the words Urban Sprawl in high school was brainwashed into thinking that this means the end of civilization as we know it and we have to put a stop to it right here because everything hinges on our local decisions or the planet will be destroyed. It doesnt matter if these policies result in greater inequality than ever before when the folks who can afford a  down payment earn a leveraged  annual return on their initial investment as prices rise  each year yes the math checks out. Were going to see a major wealth divide between the few who could afford to invest under  and the many who couldnt in the next  years.Our region has tremendous potential but if we continue on the course were on this is only the beginning of a major social crisis at the expense of a minor environmental one.

10914428,0,t1_de5md59,gt Oh its not as big as I would have thought. Its significantly longer than a bus but not by that much.It is .m  long. GRTs buses are .m to .m depending on model. So the LRV almost  times as long as a bus.gt Is it extendable? Like can you add more carssegments to the LRVs to make them longer?Not to a finished vehicle but they can be ordered in   or module versions and they do have couplers so you can double triple or quadrupleup with one driver.,waterloo,de5qux4,5,t5_2qpo5
10993819,0,t3_5wxddi,To Airport Waterloo taxi. From airport shuttleAirwaystransit.Prices are not the same since theres a extra licence or charge for airports. So to go to the airport you may as well take a taxi rather than the shuttle since you dont have to share it with other people more stops along the way and its about the same price about  plus you can reserve the day before. On the way back at the airport its cheaper the shuttle still about  but taxi is like  or  . Limo is just a town car for about  or so more.,waterloo,dee457b,1,t5_2qpo5

11149451,0,t1_devrsdk,The parking lot at Fairview isnt a road the piece by uptown Waterloo square isnt a road.Actually the region did completely stop construction in the winter on Franklin blvd during the winter when they were putting in some roundabouts closer to hwy . They left some pylons behind and left it as a lane road from what I could tell. So its not out of the question.As for expected costs since there is a delay in the arrival of trains the region could have worked with them to reflow activities and saved money and carbon,waterloo,devs11i,4,t5_2qpo5
