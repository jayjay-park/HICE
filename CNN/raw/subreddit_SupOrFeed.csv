3164504,0,t1_col0h3n,I am a Braum main as well.  I played a lot of him in my placements.  I figured out my favorite build on him after your normal starting items was to get sightstone of course then I really like to get Glacial Shroud even if they arent an all ad comp.  The stats it provides for early to early mid game are great mana cdr armor.  I couple that with a Kindle Gem for hp and more cdr in there somewhere i work in mobi boots and then i roam.  I almost always win lane so that makes this build so easy to obtain.  From there I built what my team needs whether it be Locket or whatever you need.  Im happy to see another Braum main btw Braum and Ezreal is the most fun lane ever try it ,SupOrFeed,coq001l,1,t5_364oc

4111235,0,t1_crnp6er,I did all of this to climb. I was bronze at the beginning of the season. I just hit gold  yesterday. The role of support is all about getting your team as Fed as possible. Keeping them all as safe as possible. Protect your carries get vision map control get good initiation tank dmg but dont die and PEEL for your carries.Its a thankless job and its not easy but I think its well worth it.,SupOrFeed,crowmu8,1,t5_364oc
