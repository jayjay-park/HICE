8842249,0,t1_d7apbu9,Oh I see. I actually dont think I have the necessary social intelligence to deal with this situation at all because Im not even able to grasp how printing a quote is more confrontational than saying it. I think if I try to do or say anything I will probably just get nervous and mess it up. Im never very sure of anyone elses motives or intentions but its hard for me to imagine someone doing it with full knowledge that its wrong. Their reactions did make me think they at least understand that some people think its wrong. But even reading peoples reactions Im not very good at. I think I just wont mention it to them at all. I probably will go to the restaurant again because the restaurant seems to be my husbands main motivator for going to the temple with me and I want him to continue going. Ill just be more careful next time.  ,HareKrishna,d7apo8y,1,t5_2vk8i
