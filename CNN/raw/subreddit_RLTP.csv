1878223,0,t1_ckfhvkv,So the draft will happen the weekend after sign ups close to give captains the opportunity to have a game plan for the draft. After which we go right into the season starting on the following Thursday.You should be contacted by your captain after the draft. And there will be multiple posts on the radius and RLTP subreddits of the draft results.,RLTP,ckfip39,2,t5_32s8m

2090920,0,t3_2itwr5,gt make the tiers fluid throughout the seasonHow? I dont like the idea of messing up the tiers in the season. Short seasons would be a better solution if we really need more fluidity between tiers. Current system is pretty good for that anyway only half of the teams in a tier will stay and the other half will move to the other tiers. The tiers should become wellbalanced in a season or two. There is no system that could perfectly balance the tiers in the beginning.Also NIGHTCAPS record should be  as LoweJ mentioned we tied against them.,RLTP,cl5lode,4,t5_32s8m
