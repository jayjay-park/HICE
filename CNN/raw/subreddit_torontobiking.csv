1083405,0,t1_chrdizv,Oh dont worry they spent k on an app to redundantly study where cyclists ride their bikes.Cause we dont already have shelves full of info like that already.,torontobiking,chrfovh,3,t5_2t0mq

1271170,0,t1_cicm68d,This would appear to be accurate I must be crazy.  I live and bike downtown not sure how I could be that slow.  Thanks updating original post.,torontobiking,cicmgor,2,t5_2t0mq
1293460,0,t1_cif4n25,Fair enough perhaps I was being unfair they definitely are generally very competent drivers. I know I just give them a MEGAWIDE berth especially since I know two people who got knocked off by a bus swerving into the bikelane to stop at a bus stop. Fortunately neither were hurt because buses basically have sideguards and they may have been at fault for not giving the bus a megawide berth.,torontobiking,cif4q7j,4,t5_2t0mq
1298357,0,t3_28qktu,Yeah I think its the dig for the replacement  huge watermainsewer. Definitely behind schedule but its not a biggie right now because one cant continue west on that stretch anyway due to the bridge work being done on the Gardiner one has to cross at Cherry Street to pick up Martin Goodman trail on the south side.,torontobiking,cifok5x,1,t5_2t0mq
1375047,0,t3_29u0pu,You dont need a coach for this you should go to a professional bike fitter.There are a couple places  people that I would recommend.Google F Scott Judges he is absolutely fantastic at his job but it will cost you  but it is worth it.Another option is at kindhuman bike shop. The mechanic there is extremely skilled and will spend the time for a professional fit. It is a bit cheaper than Scott if you are more concerned about price.If it was up to me I would go to Scott judges I have referred a number of my athletes to him and everyone has come back with a positive experience.,torontobiking,ciondnd,1,t5_2t0mq
1413606,0,t3_2a8lrv,Yea check it out  Sunnyside Bike Park  My question is who is planning to maintain the park?  A couple of good rains and the dirt tracks will become unrideable no?,torontobiking,cith3fp,4,t5_2t0mq
1681817,0,t1_cjr4mtp,Geez. Thank you so much. A lot of information. Are there any brands I should pay attention to? Or at the very least stay away from?,torontobiking,cjr5mfa,1,t5_2t0mq
1939819,0,t1_ckmudba,I agree. This is very aggressive and not something we need.,torontobiking,ckmxyvp,3,t5_2t0mq
2344702,0,t3_2m6nht,Crappy situation and even crappier comments. Its correct that you can not ride on the sidewalk by law if your wheels are over a certain size. Look into getting a bike with smaller wheels bmx for example if you want to keep riding with no risk of a ticket. Also check your wheel size to make sure ticket is valid.I suggest you contest the ticket and provide the pictures of construction and state it was dangerous biking on the street due to a grooved pavement and construction. Also mention there were no pedestrians nearby if thats the case. This should at the very least reduce the fine.Also with contesting theres always a chance the guy wont show up and ticket will be dismissed. ,torontobiking,cm1im76,2,t5_2t0mq
2422702,0,t3_2n203w,Some get sold in police auctions and most of the nice ones gets redone and donated to charities i think it was EverGreen that has the deal. The really busted ones go directly to the dump.The only ones you can buy are the ones being auctioned off they sell them in batches but unless you see a really specific one you want its better to buy one somewhere else.,torontobiking,cmb5ki9,2,t5_2t0mq

3597154,0,t3_31ix30,I think that the only thing you might have issues with are other cyclists who expect you to be able to hear them.  Sometimes rarely someone will come up behind you and say On your wheel or on your left when then intend to pass.  Again its rare.Personally I dont think mirrors do anything and dont use one.  Having a head on a swivel is enough but you might find otherwise.Most often theres so much wind noise and other noise it can be tricky to hear issues before they happen.Ride defensively and youll be as fine as anyone.  Buy a bike that fits and can carry what you need.  A Hybrid which typically has a front suspension isnt required in the city and just adds weight.  Simpler is better.  Lots of people commute on pure road bikes lots of people commute on single speeds and lots of people commute on mountain bikes.  Whatever works for you.,torontobiking,cq2avxa,3,t5_2t0mq

3772227,0,t3_33l96g,gt They hired a mechanic that admitted to me that she doesnt know how to repair bikes outside of flat tires. Not a joke.Wat.,torontobiking,cqm9f8a,7,t5_2t0mq
3843303,0,t1_cqtr946,Yesterday I almost hit a jogger dressed in all black running in the oncoming lane on Waterfront. Comes with the territory I guess...and when Im biking Im usually too focused to even yell at people. I just swerve and shake my head.At the same time Ive been blinded by cyclists on the same trail...whoever reads this please aim your lights at the ground in front of you not straight ahead.,torontobiking,cqudcde,3,t5_2t0mq

4916054,0,t1_cu2rvru,Just wondering does the W record well enough that you can see peoples license plates? also got yelled at again this weekend! Get off the road  middle finger.

5576070,0,t1_cwntb6m,None at all its very thin but warm and I can pull it down off my face if I get too warm while biking. The ski goggles just make me turn my head slightly more than I usually would.Its actually quite nice biking in the winter fully covered up unlike having to wait for a car to warm up Im warm from the start and I stay warm. I do wear a ski jacket so I can unzip flaps for ventilation as I go so I dont overheat.,torontobiking,cwo9hnb,1,t5_2t0mq

7295655,0,t3_4fab9z,Might want to consider getting a torque wrench anyway especially if you only have pocket tools currently.,torontobiking,d27gsuj,2,t5_2t0mq
7342802,0,t3_4fe3qu,I usually take Bayview to Lawrence and then take Yonge Street down.  The worst section of the ride is passing  on Bayview take the middle lane if you can when going under the bridge so the cars dont squeeze when theyre getting on the .  Make sure your rear lights are on as that part is dark.If you find cars are buzzing too close to you move left a bit more theres a certain point where if you take enough of the lane cars will change lanes to go around you.  Hope this helps!,torontobiking,d2ctr8w,3,t5_2t0mq

9324404,0,t3_584fmv,The fact that you notice blinky front lights only reinforces why I have it on strobe. Any argument that it is too bright or too distracting is undercut by the number of times cars dont see me  including on the Martin Goodman trail this very morning when a guy pulled out of palais royale to get to lakeshore without seeing me on the intervening bike path. If I have to pick between people seeing me and your sensitive eyes that is an easy choice for me to make. ,torontobiking,d8xxqrg,8,t5_2t0mq
