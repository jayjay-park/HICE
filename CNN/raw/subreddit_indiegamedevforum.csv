If you are making something like a free flash game that isnt being monetized you should be alright. Ive seen lots of games do this and havent heard a peep about ensuing law suits.

8621722,0,t3_4xt3y3,Newgrounds actually has a pretty good community and has has helped launch a number of good indie devs.If you want to do a downloadable game then theres the question of where you want to host it and whether or not you want to do a website for it.I think the decision really comes down to how much additional work you want to put into things not directly related to the game and what youre thinking the benefits of that additional work would swing you.Theyre both good options. If the work is what you want then look at something like Super Meat Boy where the flash version was getting all of the mechanics pinned down basically a high quality prototype then the digital release took the existing code base dropped in higher quality art and expanded on everything. In my opinion doing it this way is a big part of why the release copy came out as solid as it did. The development of Castle Crashers took a similar route with similar results.,indiegamedevforum,d6jbekk,2,t5_34dmh
