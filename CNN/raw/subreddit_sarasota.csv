216839,0,t3_1wl3z4,I dont personally know of their coverage in LWR but I can tell you this. I have known two people in the Sarasota and Venice area to switch from Verizon to TMobile. Both immensely regretted the decision within a week. Phone and Data simply wasnt there. Customer service was awesome but that cant solve the fact that they do not have the towers to provide the coverage people want. With Verizon I never have to think about coverage it is simply there no matter where I go.Your mileage may vary but I cannot recommend the move.,sarasota,cf3553p,1,t5_2rpyx
256547,0,t1_cf71lgw,To me the bad driving in Florida is really driven by two major factors. So many people are down here on vacation.  They dont know where theyre going or theyre trying to remember where to go and theyve got that vacation mentality  the one that has them driving  miles an hour under the speed limit in the left lane because theyre going to have to turn left in  miles so they might as well just get over now.. Its such a mix of different driving populations  not only agewise but because its such a mix of people from across the US.  See this and the related census data for more info   When you have so many people coming to one area and driving like they do back home youre bound to have issues.  People from the NYNJ area dont drive like people from the upper Midwest who dont drive like people from DC etc...  That mixing of driving normalcy ends up causing problems because not everyone on the road is reacting in a way that is expected to the others around them.  So while you complain about Florida drivers  how many of them are actually from here?  Ive been living in Florida for the past  years  and while traffic obviously gets worse when there are more people on the roads the number of bizarre things I see  miles an hour under the speed limit in the left lane uturns on red left turn lights uturns from the middle or right lanes dead stops on the road etc. gets far far worse from November  April then would normally be accounted for by just a x increase in the population.,sarasota,cf7chzt,7,t5_2rpyx

My dad owned amp operated a watersports business for just under a decade amp boat rentals were part of the offeringswith or without a captain my uncle. I can say for sure that those who opted for the captain always had an awesome time. Theres just something wonderful about being able to really kick back. Plus theyll probably let you drive some if you wanted to.  My uncle loved being able to say want to see some dolphins? Here you go! In the mood for grouper fishing? Snapper? Heres the best spot! Theres a storm rolling in lets go do such amp such until it blows overwe need to get off the water its too dangerous etc. He just knows everything there is to know about every circumstance waterway activity etc. It gives people serious piece of mind. ,sarasota,cur5m6w,1,t5_2rpyx

Also towards the south end of Sarasota there are a lot of good places to live and not too expensive. As for social life theres a healthy athletic community. Your typical bar scene. Music is mostly cover bands at said bars. Traffic is a pain if you ha e to use the highway so depending on where your commute is youll have to factor that in.
