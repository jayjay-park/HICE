Thought about Dragonslayer Spear but I hear it requires heavy investment and is still mediocre to boot. Meh. Unsure what Im planning now. Good to know grass is cheap tho.

1378537,0,t3_29n8wj,From my experience on the PS lately everybody play a mixture of the two styles. Everyone minmaxes their build everyone goes for BSes when possible but most people keep fishing to a minimum.

If someone spawnkills a red phantom that the host summons for PvP he needs to learn how to get good and not cheese. People like that deserve to be invaded by people who have infinite healthmods.Ive been PvPing in DS for the past few days and I stopped PvPing in the forest because all people do is gank and cheese. I moved to Undead Burg and I have only had one or two times where invaderssummons were shitheads.Dark Souls  I was always ganked as an invader but honestly if youre an invader you really have to endure it.,darksoulspvp,cjtpqmr,1,t5_2w65b

2433731,0,t3_2nadme,my first experience being invaded in dark souls was pretty funny i was making my way up from firelink shrine to the taurus demon right by the area where the black knight is suddenly i get invaded by some guy wearing the gold hemmed set and wielding a fire infused great scythe being a newb i just about shat myself because i was being invaded by the goddamn grim reaper but thats not all he didnt attack me he followed me throughout whole area continuously disguising himself  then reappearing randomly. he let me kill pretty much every single enemy in the area then right before i walked into the taurus demon boss fight he used firestorm followed by a backstab to kill me. kinda clued in to the whole invading idea after that.,darksoulspvp,cmcik61,5,t5_2w65b

3500529,0,t1_cpj3ezi,So...because it was like this for a small group of players coming from demons souls then its ok that everyone plays like this? At what point was I complaining? I was genuinely curious about what happened to the variety of builds in DaS PvP and you got all but hurt and anal about how your way of PvP is the only true way. No thanks.,darksoulspvp,cpraa16,-2,t5_2w65b
3659149,0,t3_32a6qm,PvP and PvE are very different. When fighting the NPCs the Just dont get hit mentality can actually work but with things like lag phantom range and general player sneakiness you cant avoid getting hit. High vigor is a must in PvP and thats been a constant across all Souls games.The other extremely important stat is endurance as a lot of attacks ans especially fist weapons use tons of stamina. Endurance is a little more flexible but for caestus you really want higher than base stamina.Thirdly I dont know if youve played Dark Souls or Demons Souls but buffs work differently in DSII. Instead of adding flat damage SLB adds a flat  elemental damage and increases lighting damage by . Buffs work best on already enchanted weapons. Also  attunment isnt high enough for any slots.I dont know if youve noticed but strength scale much better than Dex on most weapons. And since theres for whatever reason a deadzone between  and  dex where increases are pitiful Id recommend going higher in STR and lower in DEX.For adaptability its for your benefit since you arent using a shield at all to get to at least  agility as that will give you the most Iframes for your rolls. Technically you could go to  but itd be a waste. Lastly get Flynns ring as its an amazing boost to your damage if you stay light. While youre at it the Vanquishers Seal will increase your bare fist damage by a ton while slowing your punches but only if you power stance bare fists having a caestus in your right hand lets you keep the speed. And as I remember the Ring of Steel Protection doesnt do anything in PvP anymore.Id go something like thisVigor Endurance Vitality Attunement Strength Dexterity Adaptability Intelligence Faith RH CaestusLH Bare FistRing  Stone RingRing  Vanquishers SealRing  Ring of BladesRing  Flynns RingNow I started as a bandit but I see you started as deprived so youll have to rearrange youre stats a bit if you want to stay at SL. Some people would prefer to go to  DEX so they can use most dex weapons as well but in a pure caestus build I dont think its worth it. Also I got rid of SLB because I just dont have any faith in buffs but if you want the lightning pine resin will give you the exact same effect. Finally I have one thing to say Soul level in DSII is totally meaningless!. Because of how soul memory works any level can match up to anyone else provided they have similar SM and in the arenas even SM doesnt come into play. You can stay at SL if you want but there are a lot of people who will shoot right past that and go to SL.,darksoulspvp,cq9d9vi,1,t5_2w65b
3665074,0,t1_cqa1497,CoC only bars summoning when you are actually in the covenant and there are no consequences for changing covenants in DSII. Flynns ring will give you  damage on weapons if your maximum equip load is less than  so the Drangleic set is pretty heavy. But if you think the Drangleic set and Iron Helm look good now then Im sure youll soon find lots of armor that youll like even more. DSII has always had the best Fashion Souls ,darksoulspvp,cqa1kde,1,t5_2w65b

8251816,0,t3_4sg945,To counter hyper armor you need a fast weapon of a long weapon. Obviously the washing pole is best at this. Wait for them to whiff an attack and then hit them. If you have a weapon that is fast like the Carthus curved sword you play aggressive and in their face but also conserve stamina. Then wait for them to blow all their stamina as you roll through their attacks. After that you just walk at them and R or running R. If you have a long weapon like a spear or the washing pole you just keep your distance and poke them when they whiff with a running R. If you have neither of these things you need to get gud at spacing and understanding latency. Here is a good video about it.,darksoulspvp,d5916w9,5,t5_2w65b

10486971,0,t3_5q09dt,So if you are simply spamming one attack over and over then you become an easy target for parrying. Try to mix up your attacks. Also watch how they parry do they just spam that cestus or do they time thier parries to specific attacks. Leap attacks cannot be parried. Basically the best way to fight it is to make your moves as unpredictable as possible. Use an r charge out of a roll to catch them off guard. ,darksoulspvp,dcwt2wn,1,t5_2w65b
