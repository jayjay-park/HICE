8373097,0,t1_d5o4gvt,I hope it lives up to everyones expectations. Until then I might try looking into some of those books to tide me over. I was pretty young when the first movie was released so I remember it being advertised in the theater but I didnt get the chance to see it until it was on TV. I actually believed it was real and it terrified me until I saw the disclaimer at the end of the credits lol. I wish the new film could have that same effect on me years later.,BlairWitch,d5o6qsq,2,t5_31p2r
8816134,0,t1_d77dd8w,Thanks! It does look like Heather and it definitely seems like this is the footage that James finds online at the beginning of the new film. Judging by the the post on darknet the blog that originally foundposted the clip it looks like James got in contact with them..,BlairWitch,d77kvea,2,t5_31p2r
8892719,0,t3_4unoe1,Fun fact Heather Donahue lives in my town and I have hung out with her on multiple occasions.TLDR I have gotten drunk with Heather and she is definitely still alive.,BlairWitch,d7gs189,2,t5_31p2r
8979576,0,t3_5391zf,actually if you look carefully at the basement scene Im pretty confident I remember seeing bones and other human remains on the floor I would say that is likely heather and her companions,BlairWitch,d7r7i3r,12,t5_31p2r
8984361,0,t3_53aina,Theres a picture of one of the crew members halfways in costume. The takeaway is it probably would have been awful had it made it into the film.,BlairWitch,d7rs678,4,t5_31p2r
10831398,0,t1_dd8pgkm,I would ONLY like it if we learn that somehow it relates back to Mary Brown on some level. And delves deeper in to the family tree it would explain why Mary Brown is the one to see Joshs apparition and maybe she isnt aware of the fact she has something in her that can be connected to causing the things in the forest. ,BlairWitch,ddx6kuu,2,t5_31p2r
