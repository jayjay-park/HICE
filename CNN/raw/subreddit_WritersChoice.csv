3299293,0,t1_cp4c27y,My processAccept all the basic shit. I suck at punctuation while writing so if theres something about punctuation adding or deleting a space breaking off a new paragraph etc... I just hit accept on all of that right away. Less clutter.If someone has given a try this instead option and theirs is better fit it in as is right away.Then walk away for a day.Come back. Read through the suggestions and fix all the ones you automatically instinctively agree with.Less clutter.Take the other stuff a little at a time. Change or reject one thing take a break and so on.Should you do the hardasses first or later? Depends.If youre just going to give up on it  dont go for the harsh critique at all. But then youll never know if you could have taken it or made it better PIf youre going to blow off the harsh critique if people are nicer later  save the assholes till the end.ExampleI say This whole paragraph is gibberish this writing is shit start over and then your buddy says its not bad just add a rosebudIf youre going to completely ignore what I say because not everyone agrees do the harsh critique at the endIf youre going to reread it and seriously consider all points and make your own decision thats different PThen it boils down to Are you going to get frustrated if everyone is telling you its perfect and then someone points out a ton of other shit? If so you need to deal with those issues first in which case you need RDR PNot everyone does.Hang on Im switching to PM P,WritersChoice,cp4cgmp,1,t5_3737x
