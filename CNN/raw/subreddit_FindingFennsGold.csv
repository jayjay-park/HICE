4637627,0,t1_cpip2ad,You could interpret the poem as a unilateral contract offer. It ends If you are brave and in the wood I give you title to the gold. Acceptance of the contract comes through performance that is by braving the elements following the steps and reaching the treasure. By reaching the treasure Fenn then passes title of his chest to you.Fenn hasnt abandoned his property at all  the poem indicates that Fenn believes he possessed title to the chest even after leaving it. Without that intent to abandon the chest cant be abandoned.,FindingFennsGold,ctf533h,1,t5_2xpsj

9181563,0,t3_560wbq,I search from afar speculating about the area of the hidden chest. Im going to Yellowstone next June and Im hoping to search a couple times then. No one else I know is interested in the Chase. Ive coerced my wife and our two friends who will be on the trip in June to join me as long as it doesnt detract from the trip more broadly. Moreover Ive purchased TTOTC and another book to help me with research. I study maps and books about an hour or two a week and stay active on this subreddit. ,FindingFennsGold,d8ftwzu,2,t5_2xpsj

9417689,0,t1_d936rrx,Yeah I think Ive read his blog. But how much of it is actually confirmed? If its the same guy Im thinking of his start point was far south of Santa Fe so its not within the limits of the search.,FindingFennsGold,d99r9xk,1,t5_2xpsj
10063664,0,t3_5juge5,umisskaybear congrats on your efforts It just might be where the chest is located! Here are some considerations . Go only when its warmish and safe. Getting caught in shifting freezing weather is deadly. . Go only if you can actually afford it. There are plenty of stories of people wasting lotsall of their savings to come up empty handed. Otherwise save up its more fun and satisfying that way. . Have the right gear. More than a flashlight and a sandwich have true hiking shoesboots proper protection from animals sun weather etc. and a way to transport  lbs of treasure chest back to your vehicle. . Forrest said that you can only figure out the first two clues from the map   Aside Some point out this contradicts his comment that the person who will most likely find the treasure will move through the clues with confidence...how if you can only glean the first two clues from a map? Just keep all that in mind. . If you can make a trip out of it. If it turns out your guess wasnt right at least youll have some other fun stuff to do. Remember the box is the size of a take out container and area where the treasure could be is  million times bigger. Always good to have a backup plan. Good luck and best wishes! Bring home the gold!,FindingFennsGold,dbjbi6r,3,t5_2xpsj

There is one particular rock that tells exactly where it is. Thats the blaze and for some unknown reason to me yet Tarry Scant.I still need some more clues to pinpoint the exact location.

The story of covering up Philadelphia with his thumb stood out to me a bit more than the others.Every story seems to have a lesson and then there is an overall lesson for his life that he seems to convey.

I too have not seen my solve posted here or on Dals site.  I lurk there simply to see if anyone else has found the same spot I have.  Several have started in the same place but they all go the wrong direction! And thats good for me!

11735887,0,t3_67gww3,I think you could downsize rope to paracord. I would also strongly recommend a firestarter beyond matches. The best is tissues  cotton balls or tp mixed with regular ol Vaseline.  It burns clean and long enough to get your tinder going. Put a bunch in a ziploc bag.  Id also bring a Bic lighter. Matches are a great backup but  of the time I start my fires with a lighter and the Vaseline mix. Study up a bit on how to process wood with your knife. Firestarters are worthless if you dont know how to get at dry wood. Also work on making fires before you need them if youre inexperienced. Its not always easy to start one at elevation nevermind when youre cold  tired  and possibly facing bad weather. ,FindingFennsGold,dgqajei,3,t5_2xpsj
