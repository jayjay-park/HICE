1154507,0,t3_27cl93,I need some help breaking down the linked centerpiece.  My sisterinlaw is getting married and I managed to get put in charge of the centerpieces for her enchanted forest themed wedding.  I like to consider myself pretty crafty and a pretty good novice florist as is my motherinlaw.  I am pretty sure we can make this I could use some help identifying what types of branches were used in this and maybe any other materials that may have been used that will make our lives easier.  Thanks in advance!!!,Florist,chzhxp3,1,t5_2rrmy
