1787901,0,t1_ck4f9w6,In my experience its important to take it easy for the first  hours youre incountry any country.  Eat bananas and more bananas and sleep.  Let your gut acclimate to the local bacteria.  After a day of downtime you can run around and eat all variety of potentially problematic street food with no worries.I think a common problem is that lots of people fly in and start boozing it up. That kills the local bacteria while it tries to make a beachhead in their colon.  Then they eat some weird catrat street pad thai late at night and they have no internal defense.  So they get a  hour evacuation  hangover.,streeteats,ck4imij,4,t5_304v1

10641804,0,t1_dddm3fz,I was watching The Graham Norton show yesterday and an American was in The Big Red Chair and told a story where he was in London teaching a group how to use a new software. One group of young guys finished the particular task in record time. His response to that was Hey guys I love your spunk. In the US spunk is doing something with gusto. In other English parts of the world not so much. I can imagine their faces.,streeteats,dddmcs9,3,t5_304v1
