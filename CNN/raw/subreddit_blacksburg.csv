I know that SC was turned down after they tried to move in to the dead mall area in Christiansburg....worst decision EVER for that. Wouldve helped out both areas big time.,blacksburg,cgcg2dg,3,t5_2r9q4

4463985,0,t1_cstcqf6,I know a lot of undergrads live in maple ridge but I know they have security guards there at night and dont allow any blatant parties. Berryfield might work or maybe the area around The Mill. Like I said Im not very familiar with the quieter communities. I have to say there really isnt a bad part of town youre never on the wrong side of the tracks like I could describe anywhere else Ive lived its an amazing town. Weve also got some great public schools too! I know were a little lacking on daycare providers and for grad students living on a stipend its really hard to handle financially. But if youre making a real salary its an adorable town and I dont think daycare would be an issue. ,blacksburg,cstd3ci,1,t5_2r9q4
