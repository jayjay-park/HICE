I have to agree with OP here just because you didnt think a certain plot point didnt add anything to the plot does not mean you are homophobic.  It is not a criticism of homosexuality it is a criticism of the writers.Now if they can find a way to make this actually relevant to the plot then I might think it a good twist.  But as of right now it did nothing but tell us the reason behind Flints scheme.  Funnily enough he already had a motivation.  This just expanded on that.

Finish the entire fucking paragraph you newb.gtGiven the importance in Greek society of cultivating the masculinity of the adult male and the perceived feminizing effect of being the passive partner relations between adult men of comparable social status were considered highly problematic and usually associated with social stigma.and now the rest of the same paragraph. This stigma however was reserved for only the passive partner in the relationship. According to contemporary opinion Greek males who engaged in passive homosexuality after reaching the age of manhood  at which point they were the expected to take the reverse role in pederastic relationships and become the active and dominant member  thereby were feminized or made a woman of themselves. There is ample evidence in the theater of Aristophanes that derides these passive homosexuals and gives a glimpse of the type of biting social opprobrium and shame atimia heaped upon them by their society.One example of your strict laws please..... any....?????

Its not top tier television but it doesnt need to be because its entertaining without skimping on the quality. Its like Game of Thrones it may not be as well written as The Wire or The Sopranos but the quality is high enough that you look forward to the quiet moments just as much as the action sequences. Both shows have an emphasis on entertainment without skimping on depth writing or characters. They have maturity and complexity but arent afraid to let their hair down once in a while with a massive action sequence.

10809629,0,t3_5ujztg,The only thing that felt rushed to me was the attack on Nassau in XXXI. Flints plan was essentially to walk into Nassau with no contingencies for ambushes along the way and hope that the people rose up to fight the English alongside them. That was the full extent of his plan. Walk in and hope for the best.The English had plenty of time to shoot Silver and Flint before the mob arrived. Their firing line managed to completely miss Silver and Flint despite the fact that they were at the front and clearly the leaders. Then the only reason Flint and Silver werent killed is because Billy turned up at the exact right moment. I have no problem with lastminute rescues but the only reason Flints plan succeeded is dumb luck that he couldnt possibly have counted on. Characters and especially Flint have been lucky before. However normally theyve earned that luck. Vane rescuing Flint in Charlestown Vane rescuing Flint during his duel with Teach Anne rescuing Jack from Eleanors assassins the crew rescuing Silver from being tortured by Vanes crew these victories felt earned. The pirates beating the English because Billy happened to turn up at the right moment didnt feel earned.Im enjoying the season overall and have no real issues with Jack surrendering to Rogers but the fight to take Nassau did seem really rushed to me.,BlackSails,dduxqi7,12,t5_2x1k9

10883436,0,t3_5vh8ho,When Woodes Rogers made his landing Nassau was barely even a town. There were two buildings. One was the house of the British tax collector whom the pirates had left alone and who was a colourful ornery old man and the other was the tavernbrothel. The rest of the town was made up of shacks canvas tents etc. It was basically a shanty town. The population was more or less scattered across New Providence island.So to answer your question it actually wasnt anywhere near as big or as well laid out or organised as it appears in the show. Rogers began to rectify much of this and had the governors residence built.As was shown to Rackhams frustration the problem was that pirates were generally more interested in drinking and whoring than they were in building things something that would also frustrate Rogers.,BlackSails,de2jrxp,6,t5_2x1k9

11157817,0,t3_5zb3pw,I think I disagree. Hands is just a bit character introduced lately. Hes not that important as to deserve being a part of that fight.    Not to mention the deeper we get into the season the more I lose hope that there will be any serious rift between Silver and Flint. After all we know about it only from hearsay. Its possible they fake it maybe as a pretence for not continuing with the revolution.,BlackSails,dewq65q,5,t5_2x1k9

11196392,0,t3_5zq1lm,The season started out brilliant as usual but I dont like the direction the writers seem to be taking for some of the character arcs. Whatever happens Im not mad. The show was absolutely gripping for  and a half seasons straight and I cant judge the ending too much considering the show was supposed to run  seasons not . Having to cut a whole seasons worth of material from the overall arc probably led to some rash decisions to consolidate the a story. It really showed in episode  it all seems rather forced. A shame but at least we get a proper ending.But yes what they did to Billy doesnt really make a whole lot of sense considering the amount of time they built up the relationship between him and Silver.,BlackSails,df13it9,4,t5_2x1k9

11448474,0,t1_dftlydf,It makes Silver the main focus here while to me that was always Flint. And you dont really need a  season show to say that life is life and people are manipulative.

11485460,0,t3_63xcjk,I think they wanted to honor the book but not explicitly lead into it.

11517609,0,t1_dg174ew,Its also worth bearing in mind that the writers several times said about earlier apparent deaths that if a main character doesnt die on screen theyre not dead. Which was a bit of foreshadowing in itself. ,BlackSails,dg1itjj,2,t5_2x1k9
11579229,0,t1_dg4n3y9,Agree . You see every time Hands fights he swings wildly which looks like it leaves him open for a counter and then gets you with the short weapon when you close in for the apparent kill.I dont think flint could have beaten Joji if they hadnt fallen down the hill. Even when he backed into the trees he was still barely holding his own.,BlackSails,dg8ig1y,4,t5_2x1k9
