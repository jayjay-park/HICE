4086897,0,t3_37ewrf,We are not going to do a progression like CSGO as that doesnt really play to the strengths of our game. We will definitely try to add custom weapon skins and as development continues we are open to the idea of adding classes. In addition to all of this we will open the game up to the modding community soon after release for even more unique models.Edit I just saw I didnt answer your question about secondaries. We made the active decision to give all players unlimited ammo and no secondary to really make each class good at specific playstyles. This way a sniper is really going to struggle at close quarters rather than switch to his secondary and thrive.,boxmanbegins,crm4quw,2,t5_33cz1
