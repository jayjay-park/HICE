5920869,0,t3_3vbq4x,shipping time on the skins is pretty disappointing.  I ordered my skin on Nov. th and have yet to receive a shipping notification.  I contacted dbrand last thursday  week after ordering and they responded  days later saying my skin had been shipped and I should receive another email shortly.  Well now its another week later and I still have no skin and no email.  Ive tried contacting them multiple times this week with no luck.They really need to advertise that shipping takes a really long time.  It is misleading to consumers.Im on the east coast US so its not like I live super far away either.,dbrand,cxvr9u5,1,t5_2wf1u
8339153,0,t3_4tshqw,Go matte Ive ordered both and was underwhelmed by the leather because the texture is really very shallow and not as clear as shown in the online images. It also feels more slippery than the matte imo.,dbrand,d5jy5gs,3,t5_2wf1u
