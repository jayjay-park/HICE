But most people pass it by idk if they sit there for a moment waiting for a greeting or they just dont care.,TalesFromFastFood,dcawrpm,3,t5_2ug4l
10347474,0,t1_dcfrj5u,Is there an available management position for which youre qualified? Do the people in charge of filling that position know youre interested and qualified? Do you have an updated resume?Attitude is huge. Someone with a positive attitude is always going to be looked upon more favorably.Performance aboveandbeyond ones current role makes a candidate shine.Nobody likes a kissass but it doesnt hurt if the people making these decisions like you. Make sure you have a positive relationship with the people above you in the chain of command.Something like this can be approached with questions. Im assuming you work in food service so youre probably familiar with the stores current manning situation. If theres an available position ask the GM if hed consider you for it and if not why not?If there isnt an available position at your current store consider asking the GM if there are available positions at nearby stores and if hed be willing to recommend you for the job. Being able to email or hand deliver my recommendation a resume and a letter of recommendation would really put you at the forefront of any good GMs mind. Hand delivering would also give you the chance to shake his or her hand and give them a chance to ask a few quick questions.If there arent any positions available in the area consider asking your GM for a letter of recommendation anyway. Tell him you want to move up and youd like to drop off resumes and letters of recommendation with the GMs in the area. This will put you in the back of their minds as a potential candidate should any positions open up.You might also consider reaching out to someone higher in the chain they might know more about the areas manning situation than your stores GM and they might be willing to help an ambitious person move up.,TalesFromFastFood,dcgy265,1,t5_2ug4l

10885967,0,t1_de0m1m5,I hate that I portrayed my store manager as spineless because he really isnt. He tells customers no majority of the time if they want free stuff lol.
