676021,0,t1_cgh1fp8,Nope.. like I said DIN and XLR are not compatible.  Forget the DIN shit.  I updated my original DIY thread and added the XLR stuff.  I regret ever using the DIN connector. It has caused more confusion than anything for people building these.   XLR is a far better option.   Order the XLR i linked to and you will thank me in the long run.    ,enail,cgh43zb,1,t5_30zpt

1732677,0,t1_cjxj54n,I guess im gonna have to go over the wiring. Theyre va bulb type. I guess the wiring HAS to be fuzzed up. The wiring schematic on your DIY enail sticky has the extra coil switch in it right? I was hoping id only have to wire it one time haha.,enail,cjxkh46,1,t5_30zpt

4086116,0,t1_crm15ok,ive used one a little.  My buddie rocks one on his full melt setup. haha. He has a rig enail that is used only for full melts.  He prefers the Hive nail for that setup.   It seems fine.  You can crank you enail to about  for an hour or so and it will self clean.  Kinda cool but I personally prefer ti still.  And considering the Hive nail is the same price as the HE ti nail i think the HE is a better buy.  ,enail,crm1jj2,1,t5_30zpt

4249518,0,t3_39juag,It works but as uFiiVeSeVeN pointed out youre going to want the upgraded dish. You can use the mm barrel coil with a stock infiniti nail on a male ground glass joint. Like thisThats the male end that I have the barrel coil wrapped around. We dont use a barrel heater on our enail preferring the flat spiral coils.,enail,cs4muh8,2,t5_30zpt

9539522,0,t3_5bimvq,Not exactly quite what your taking about the carbon buildup? Carbon buildup will always happen with an enail since you wont always vape off all the oil and carbon all be left behind from the slow burning I typically remove a few pinches of carbon from my quartz enail every  months if youre getting lots of carbon depositing quickly it probably has to do with your oil.Oil made from flowers that arent flushed properly will deposit large amounts of carbon after an enail or lowtemp dab it can also mushroom up when reheated and leave a large carbon puff that should be removed before taking another dab.,enail,d9oy0iv,5,t5_30zpt

10058419,0,t3_5j4sbr,Sounds like there is a short in there. If it is getting heat all the time then the two wires supplying power to the coil are constantly connected instead of being connected in a controlled manner by the electronics.,enail,dbimx34,1,t5_30zpt

10465710,0,t3_5puaya,You cannot go wrong by choosing high  Both units will work well just depends what color you wanted to be and what you want your LCD to look like. I have the most basic box and have had it for over six months now use it daily and it rocks stays on  hours have never had a problem. Other people have them years and still working well. Quartz dome less is a good place to start and has OK performance stay away from the bangers they do not heat up correctlyI switched to a ti quartz nail about a month after getting my domeless and never looked back Lower temps  tastier hits ,enail,dcue7yv,1,t5_30zpt

11334463,0,t1_dfgqk82,gt  citreon c.It appears from this post scroll down that your car has A but that is also shared with the clock interior lighting vanity mirror  So mostly stuff you dont need and clock barely uses any power with those lights off you should be getting basically A. Assuming  efficiency that should mean you should be able to get w output from your inverter before it uses more than A but thats only if it can really do A. Even so w is far above the w needed for an enail so you should be perfectly good to go.,enail,dfgqpiw,4,t5_30zpt
