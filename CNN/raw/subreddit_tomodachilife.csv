1207023,0,t3_27xhpl,I had this same problem but I think I found a possible solution since I just tried it and the baby immediately calmed down. At first I tried like shaking the DS up and down but that didnt work so then I kind of turned the DS like a book I grabbed the bottom screen in my left hand and the top in my right and rocked it from side to side tipping one screen down and then up again which I guess is sort of like rocking the DS back and forth? Its really hard to explain especially since it would be easier to understand if I could visually show how I did it but see if that works? I was looking for an answer to this but then tried my own ways of doing it and then found that to work.,tomodachilife,ci5epsv,16,t5_31ar0

They MIGHT be able to do more than  Miis at a time but Ive never seen it so Im not sure. But they really do like playing with the Wii U if that helps.

2691712,0,t3_2qvdyv,There really isnt much of anything to do once theyre asleep for the night.  You cant wake them although if theyre dreaming you can watch the dream.  The game is all about interacting with your Miis.  Its unfortunate for night owls or those who cant play during the day.If you have money you can shop in the stores if youve unlocked them.  You could also use this time to create new Miis if you like.You might be tempted to set the system clock on your DS forward to make it morning but the game does detect this and the penalty is that the shops wont stock anything new for several days.  Ordinarily the stock rotates every day.,tomodachilife,cn9xcw8,7,t5_31ar0
