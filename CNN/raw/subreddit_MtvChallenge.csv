3464755,0,t1_cpn3nx6,But Johnny has said in every season he has been in since The Island that keeping your word is NOT a virtue with value in The Challenge. If you are playing right your greed is supposed to trump your integrity your pride your friends. Greed trumps everything because that is the reality of The Challenge. That is the  Johnny Bananas mantra until this past after show.For years he has talked people out of judging his game play by any real world moral standard. He talked people out of evaluating him as a human being because his Challenge morals were supposedly not a part of him as a person. But now that he is the victim of Sarahs Challenge morals the creation of which Johnny most definitely influenced he has no problem assassinating her character?It just wreaks of a lack of self awareness on his part.

If they have a member on their team that they think suck theyll say it.Why is bullying ok? No one said its okay but theyre grown adults they should expect everything in these shows and they do.

6380818,0,t3_430at3,Can we just say that Cara Maria is the only girl to beat Johnny B. in an elimination? Is that safe to say? Think about it. Let it sink in.Im so not over this episode. My heart was pounding so much during the elimination and I thought I was gonna die. To be honest I totally forgot about the whole Aneesa v. Cara thing while watching the elimination so I wasnt even thinking about it.To me I felt like everything came into full circle in this episode with the whole Johnny B. v. Cara Maria saga. I really do. Having watch them in challenges together its always been a love and hate relationship between these two.I watched J on his season of The Real World and he was my favorite growing up and watching these shows. It was disheartening to see him lose in the first elimination of the first challenge he competed in. But guess what... He came back and won four of these things.Cara also lost her first challenge in the first elimination too. But with every challenge she got better and better just like Johnny. Both are great competitors. I dont know how the animosity started between the two but being a fan of both it was hard.There were some things Johnny did on these challenges that I wasnt okay with and the same with Cara. But it never made me hate them. Just very sad how much the game has changed them as competitors. But then again it made me love them more for how determined they were to win these things.I know some of yall think this was a whack season but I feel like if you havent followed both Cara and Johnny on these shows theres not so much investment in it which means it can be bland not having people you like competing anymore. I zoned out on Free Agents at the end tbh.They both worked so hard and Johnny is right. She deserves this. After everything shes been through she deserved this win with how much shes worked her butt off and he sees that.Tbh... I felt like they should have just banged one out. Maybe thats why they hated each other. So much sexual tension between the two. BananaMaria But hey... Im just basing this on Johnnys interview of Marry Eff and Kill on Rivals I and he only talked about Cara in that segment... shrugsIt was super bittersweet being a fan of both and damn. This was one hell of an episode in my opinion and it shows how important you have to be invested in these peoples journey.,MtvChallenge,czexilt,19,t5_32dph

Maybe theres footage we didnt see of Abe being an ass but at worst he was just raised and taught to think one way and was sheltered. And he never seemed to aggressively defend his beliefs either. Donnell and Cara treated him like he was subhuman. Like trash they could pick on and the worst part is no one ever thought about stepping in. Even in the episode where they fight Dave knew those two treated Abe like crap but never said shit. Then again he did end up dating Cara so maybe he was just trying to stay on her good side. And what do you know Donnell turned out to be a piece of crap who physically abused his teenage gf and quickly turned on Cara to save his own ass.

8049527,0,t1_d4kora5,The challenge has fluctuated greatly on its physical altercation policy over the years. Very early on there was a zerotolerance policy. There is no video of what happened Or they decided not to show it but on Season  Ayanna went after Christian on the bus presumably for making a drunk racist joke. Its never clear if there were punches or shoving or what exactly happened and you can tell Christian feels extremely guilty and responsible over the situation and does not want her to go home but ultimately Ayanna gets sent home by the producers.  Then we see some slight easing in how things are taken overall and pushing gets a little more acceptable and it doesnt really matter until we are throwing punches see Daryn punching Brad CT punching Adam etc.  Now it seems we are in a weird spot. Apparently this season they actually hired security guards to follow specific cast members around to watch them. They dont want punches thrown at all obviously but I think the new showrunner is trying to figure out where to draw her own line especially with security. Lets face it altercations as long as they dont become too violent make for good TV.  Seeing Vince and Thomas go at each other is also something we are more willing to accept as a society as two macho guys airing it out than we are willing to watch Tony corner Camila and get in her face. We as an audience not only have seen Tony get into physical and violent altercations with his own brother on Bloodlines but we also have a complicated view on how he treats women by having children with two different women essentially at the same time while being here and unabashedly flirting with and trying to hook up with another woman. Lets also not fail to mention how he is inebriated often and stole a bottle of alcohol in a restaurantclub during his season of the Real World.  ,MtvChallenge,d4kubzr,6,t5_32dph

9511204,0,t3_5b2bjq,The format isnt nearly as important as the cast in my opinion. That said I dont think Rivals  coming too early was the issue. It was the competitors on the show that caused the problems that and the fact that half the cast got kicked off or left early and then that fucking retarded twist at the end that was just so pathetic and antientertainment. Bloodlines would have been fine if they had kept it as same sex or opposite sex partners for every team by starting them out as some girlgirl some guyguy and some guygirl it really fucked up the format causing them to HAVE to do the big teams for the majority of the season to make it fair and then that brought the issue of being tied to your bloodline and the issues that involved. They screwed up big time they could have done big teams and dissolved the bloodline tie completely that would have make the season entirely better. Bad decisions brought it down.Ive always that that The Challenge Love Triangles would be a great format. The only problem is that when you put restrictive themes on the season you get a restricted cast. Take for instance Exes  Half the cast fucking sucked because they had sex with people who didnt suck. So then you HAVE to have Jonna there you HAVE to have Brittany there you HAVE to have Jessica there you HAVE to have Jay there so forth and so on. So then with Love Triangles youd have to have bad players there to fill the format properly and then the entertainment factor is hurt by that. I think the perfect formats are ones that have nothing to do with special themes that restrict the cast. This is the real reason why Duel amp Free Agents are seen as some of the best seasons of all time. Its not because individual seasons are so much better from a competitor or drama standpoint its because they dont rely on preforged connections to put the cast together thus allow the best competitors to fill the slots rather than crappy ones. Yes there are still crappy competitors but youll have less than on a Rivals or Exes.,MtvChallenge,d9lghqi,1,t5_32dph

Wasnt until ruins where everyone saw some solid gains but wasnt he gone for like more than a year or so?Usually when people get off roids we see the difference right away Alistair overeem and Vitor Belfort for instance saw a dramatic drop in less than  monthsI always thought there was a chance he was just for the hell of it but when I seen a picture floating around he posted after rivals  I think showing little Wes yet still had a carved looking  pack that right there screamed out natural to me.

11343229,0,t1_dfho8z6,Wes was on Sarah and Susies podcast shortly after the Bill Simmons interview with Johnny and made a lot of really interesting remarks.. His defense of Johnnys decision was based on the precedence set by Sarah. If youre the person that put a price on your friendship with a person you cant be upset when they do the same. Susie also supported this argument too.. In more recent seasons Wes and Johnny hang out quite a bit during their downtime on the show. He feels Johnnys animosity towards him was fabricated for exposure as they never had a real reason to fall out like he did with Kenny. . Even though they can joke around together he doesnt consider Johnny to be a friend or even someone he could be friends with due to Johnnys selfcentered nature. He explains it further with some anecdotes and Sarah and Susie also share similar experiences.I think Wes and Johnny realized recently that they get along and their history is just that history similar to what happened between CT and Johnny around the time of the first Exes.

She may not be the female version of Bananas but at least on Invasion she seems to be the most hated of all the girls. Johnny was a total dick on The Island but hes turned into that guy we love to hate. Hes the master of pranks and deceit he performs consistently well he can dish it but cant take it and we all saw what he did to Sarah. But at the same time his jokes and interview clips are funny he has a strong presence wherever he is and the ratings were down the one season he most recently was on Seasons .
