3230054,0,t1_cov7ecp,the ironic part is we probably both listen to Bubba just as much.,TheRealBubba,cowstom,1,t5_340e0
3343724,0,t1_cp9e2cy,The exfamily is a great analogy.  Bubba is on the radio to HIS current fans telling them to not listen to Calta and Calta is doing the same....have neither of them heard of preaching to the choir?  ,TheRealBubba,cp9eqvu,0,t5_340e0
3497178,0,t1_cpqlmzv,The monthly PPMs are what matters. Especially if its true about the watch winder and the shed then its all a fraud anyway.,TheRealBubba,cpqwjgl,1,t5_340e0
3525398,0,t1_cprzx0d,here you go They seem to pick up on it after the call. Its funny though ,TheRealBubba,cpu4ch1,2,t5_340e0
3819141,0,t1_cqrldjs,From what I can tell Anti Bubba subscribers have been fairly friendly to you and the other BA as well as to eachother it seems like you guys are the ones that bring out the insults.But since I am a mod here I think its time that you move along. I gave you a fair friendly warning and you want to continue to to act like a dick.Enjoy your ban dude. PS Nerd boy really? Thats the best insult you could come up with. Calling someone a Nerd is hardly an insult any more.,TheRealBubba,cqrm2uw,2,t5_340e0
3891137,0,t1_cqzs6ck,Slow down there hispeed. Im not talking about Bubbs getting indicted Im saying there IS an FBI investigation of the attorneys activities there IS a record of a phone call to Bubba from Diaco right after the arrest. If the FBI goes forward with a case against Diaco Bubba may have to answer some uncomfortable questions and his true colors will be revealed under oath. Hes far enough removed from the incident to not face any charges but the public disgrace will be delicious. You can go ahead and put your little list of capers or whatever back in your pocket because soon it wont matter. The man who has tried to ruin so many lives will get his. Im sure this has got you and the rest of the army scared but calm down. Its out of your hands.Also Bubba twitter meltdown in effect because Gloria Gomez doesnt live in Bubbas fantasy world.,TheRealBubba,cqztnso,2,t5_340e0
4429010,0,t1_csou6fo,No camp here. Just waiting to see Bubba get whats been coming to him for a loooong time now. And that has nothing to do with radio.,TheRealBubba,csoytdr,1,t5_340e0
4942856,0,t1_cue07qg,This also could be referencing a third party. Bubba has  reason to return to The Bone especially after everything thats happened.,TheRealBubba,cuhl4di,1,t5_340e0
5247727,0,t3_3mvnnp,Who cares Bubba is getting fired by Beasley and . will change format Monday. Enjoy his shitty podcasts before he quits doing those because they arent profitable.,TheRealBubba,cvijg5g,2,t5_340e0

9350195,0,t3_58jk39,I listen to podcasts all day everyday at work and ive always enjoyed Shannons voice and delivery. Now hes dipping into the political arena. Losing the commercials is great.For me i think Joe Rogan is unremarkable in every way but he is podcast royalty. He gets great guests but he does nothing for me otherwise. Luckily......theres a  casts to choose from. ,TheRealBubba,d917e2b,1,t5_340e0
10223865,0,t1_dbys6s0,Its not all about ratings. Its about revenue. Bubba is a hard sell to advertisers and the type of audience his show attracts is not exactly  the demo most want to reach in its present form.,TheRealBubba,dc2xkr2,1,t5_340e0
