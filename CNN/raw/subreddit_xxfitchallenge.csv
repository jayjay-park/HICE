9239573,0,t1_d8lvwp2,You should try Strong Curves. I just finished it. It can be a full body workout with emphasis on your buttocks. You workout your butt a lot and more muscles  more firmness. I definitely got some good results from it!I also got my DEXA scan recently and I am around  which I was sad about until people told me DEXA adds  more fat than the calipers calculation. I would love to lose more on my DEXA scan but I am afraid of loosing my boobs! No exercise can save that i think. So for my part I just focus on adding more muscle and not actively trying to lose fat.,xxfitchallenge,d8n6lqi,2,t5_3gnhw

9408289,0,t3_5919le,Fitness accomplishment did all my pushups and pullups as planned and went to crossfit x. I also snuck in an outdoors workout because the weather was amazing p I also PRd my squat and my shoulder press!  Diet I meal prepped all my lunches my bfast is usually oatmeal and strawberries or  eggs and toast depending on my mood that morning and avoided fried food for dinner until the weekend I had wings and chick fil a sue me gtD . I managed only one and a half glasses of wine during the week it was my moms birthday and we were at a steak house so I couldnt say no and I only drank on one day this weekend! It was definitely a better diet week than Week  so Im proud of that.  Goals Had a VERY bad start to this week so Im hoping to catch up on all my missed workouts without injuring myself this week...prayme. Ive decided Im backing up some of my pushups to focus more on form since that was the most important thing for me in the beginning not just being able to bang out  sloppy pushups. Also looking to PR my hang clean or deadlift this week....,xxfitchallenge,d98keo4,1,t5_3gnhw
9472362,0,t3_5abuhp,Last week....yeah. I slacked off considerably with my strength training goal I think I managed  workout out of . I also totally fell off the wagon with tracking calories because my SOs parents were in town for a few days and obviously Im not going to bother trying to track all the meals we had out. Also...Halloween candy. But Im still here so hopefully I can steer myself back on track soon! Im not counting calories again yet but trying to forget all the junk foodalcohol thats still lurking in the house. ,xxfitchallenge,d9go94w,1,t5_3gnhw
9621342,0,t3_5cm47y,Somehow my week  stuff never got logged in and now its past the deadline so I guess Im just gonna pull up one week faster and be up to date with rest of the people.I finally bought a food scale! Its coming in mail along with ON Gold Standard protein powder  I hope the french vanilla cream flavor tastes good. I went to the gym today only to realize I left my workout shorts at home so instead of giving up and going home which I briefly considered I worked out in my jeggings instead  Im doing laundry tonight anyway haha.,xxfitchallenge,d9z116w,1,t5_3gnhw
10086890,0,t3_5k5o6r,I set a goal of TRACKING!  Ideally I want to be tracking calories in MFPout fitness tracker sleep and steps.  If I just track calories inout that would be great.  Im aiming for  days a week.  I printed out a little calendar for January so I can give myself some gold stars.  ,xxfitchallenge,dbmc8f7,3,t5_3gnhw
