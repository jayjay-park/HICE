8142704,0,t1_d4vdou3,Im not particularly concerned with what the internet thinks Im more concerned with my safety.The one guy who got multiple stickers is this one particular asshole who parked in a bike lane got a ticket for it and then rather than moving his truck he just taped the ticket to the INSIDE of his window so that he wouldnt get a second one.he might have gotten more than a couple stickers,BikeCammers,d4vdtdn,2,t5_3emm5
8194959,0,t1_d51n89s,gtAFAIK no action is taken with them.Try using a real vehicle instead of a toy and maybe the cops will give a shit.s just in case,BikeCammers,d51x75k,1,t5_3emm5

8797352,0,t1_d74tapd,Totally. Pedestrians had the right of way when he had the light and you had the right of way when you went. There is no excuse to honk at road users who are following the rules just for taking the right of way that belongs to them.Turning cars are always inconvenienced. Deal with it.,BikeCammers,d75bl9b,2,t5_3emm5
8981183,0,t1_d7p94yg,They are indeed marked as bike lanes. But youre right theyre not at all good places for bike traffic. Though as bad as these lanes are there are many in the Columbia SC area that are far worse.,BikeCammers,d7reg3d,1,t5_3emm5
9209232,0,t3_56hpw3,EDIT  I forgot to add USOC to the titleThis happened on the stretch of Old Chapel Hill Road that I use to commute.   The speed limit is  mph and I use it to avoid a  lane road where the speeds are much faster.  Some folks resist my videos that include dangerous passes that dont actually put me in danger.  This is an example of how each of those passes is actually very dangerous for cyclists.   When a driver misjudges a pass their natural reaction will be to avoid the headon collision with the oncoming vehicle by swerving into the cyclist.  You might get lucky  of the time but that does not make it any less dangerous.  When drivers pass me on a blind curve or hill they will continue to get their videos posted here and I will lecture them if I catch them at a light or in traffic.   If the pass is dangerous enough I wont be so nice about it.,BikeCammers,d8jc78g,7,t5_3emm5
9360658,0,t1_d92ia14,Eh using the crosswalk there seems safe. Being chased by a psychopath not so much. ,BikeCammers,d92j4lf,7,t5_3emm5
9944877,0,t3_5hbnfm,I really appreciate that you included a trigger warning for drivers so they could know to skip over that part and maintain their safe space.,BikeCammers,db3ubpa,3,t5_3emm5
10138503,0,t3_5l4qqv,Do they actually give tickets or warnings?  Here in Denver it happens sometimes but they often just warn you  especially of you go on a pedestrian signal. Honestly in downtown Ill often go on the pedestrian signal to get ahead of the traffic or especially when making left turns.  I try to be WAY more polite than most cyclists who bomb through though.  I just go walking speed until Im clear of the intersection. ,BikeCammers,dbt1uwq,2,t5_3emm5

11656075,0,t1_dgh7plb,Adults generally look at me like Im crazy which isnt really inappropriate under the circumstances. The mirroring is nice for watching peoples reactions without them knowing.On the other hand kids fucking flatout love me and I definitely play it up anytime I see them gawking. I wish it wouldnt be creepy as fuck for me to carry those little LED bike lights or some other cheap bikerelated treats to give out to them. Such is the way with the modern age I suppose.,BikeCammers,dgh8bag,1,t5_3emm5
