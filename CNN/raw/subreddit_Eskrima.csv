Also the PTK group in Makati  is a good source.  Pretty much all the guys in the Philippines are very open to training foreigners these days.,Eskrima,chtatix,1,t5_2s3q9

3851952,0,t1_cquylc1,We used rattan sticks mostly. There was one with aluminum macheteish during most of these fights it was just a stick is a stick is a stick.Edit doing Reddit on the phone. Didnt see blindsides response.,Eskrima,cqvcw3c,2,t5_2s3q9

4889396,0,t1_cuatzpf,Yeah... Gaje has that effect on people. Though Im not sure how much of it was Gajes influence and just how much of it is how Mr. Waid is wired.To be fair Ive never met Waid  so most of my exposure to him is via online materials and other peoples direct encounters with him.,Eskrima,cuauicz,1,t5_2s3q9
4915406,0,t3_3i0pkc,Within the community of fma I dispute the fact that its all interchangeable. I think stick training gives you attributes that will enhance your short blade and empty hand skills but I think that interchangeability is played up in the U.S. and overemphasized. I think originally it was a way to promote and sell FMA. I agree that to some degree its true but I think that in some cases FMA guys are really reaching and unwilling to admit that their arts have weaknesses. There are fundamental differences between empty hands and a blade and a stick and you cant approach it all the same way and expect a good result. what is effective with a knife is not the best way to approach empty hand and obviously vise versa. Each area requires special consideration and attention.,Eskrima,cue4hrp,3,t5_2s3q9

6628522,0,t1_d04v0yt,Dude its a drill even in boxing when we start new guys well don some drills where the arm is left out. Everyone knows that shit isnt gonna fly in a fight but you gotta start somewhere. If these guys only showed this kind of stuff youre bitching would be more justified but these guys put out plenty of sparring video your criticism are misplaced. ,Eskrima,d04y2ni,2,t5_2s3q9
6973356,0,t3_4b246d,So why do flashy crap of its not part of the art and being about to fight on a tournament is not the point of a martial art.  The its very existence is for continuing for real. ,Eskrima,d16rmpk,1,t5_2s3q9
7816635,0,t3_4m448p,Anybody have any good video of some FMA empty hand sparring? My critique of it is that its often overly compliant and flowy if thats a word ,Eskrima,d3unkf7,3,t5_2s3q9
7910979,0,t3_4nn5sl,gt  How the hell are you ever going to be in a situation where you have a stick or ft blade whatever you want to say the stick represents and be in close range to a guy with a gun?Completely off topic and off your very good pointThe only case of this Ive ever heard comes from Filipino Marine Force recon. And it was a marine using his ginunting to cut through brush. He hacks away some brush and surprises a rebel with a rifle thats down.Hes been trained to cut brush on a s and s. So he just goes forward and through the guys with the pattern at headneck level. The results were NOT pretty. But the rebel never got his gun up.At no point did the marine ever attempt anything more than the basics. And there were no disarms. But he went home safe.,Eskrima,d459oom,1,t5_2s3q9

10559102,0,t1_dd4tuwa,I think that would be a great approach thats what I did and I teach my students basic boxing before getting into FMA empty hand. But I havent found that to be a common approach in fact FMA guys are quick point out that boxing is a sport and they are super deadly street fighters its a crap excuse for lazy training imo. ,Eskrima,dd4zs0j,1,t5_2s3q9
