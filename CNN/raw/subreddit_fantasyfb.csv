1763779,0,t3_2eoi9p,Yep  I would take it.  You have a wr that you dont need that will end up getting hurt  games in and a split time rb for a rb with much more upside.,fantasyfb,ck1hbij,3,t5_2t1b0
1894348,0,t3_2g9jbd,It should show up on your team page above your roster as an announcement and when you registered you have the option to have them send you an email for every time there is a trade. Try to see if you can switch to that option. Another thing could be that the commish has taken away the grace period for accepted trades and they go through immediately. If thats the case its even more important to have them email you when trades happen.,fantasyfb,ckhgjlu,1,t5_2t1b0
1934369,0,t1_ckm6tnj,Thats exactly what I was thinking. Its a PPR but still a tough decision. ,fantasyfb,ckma0oz,2,t5_2t1b0
1976325,0,t3_2hcddn,GB has a history of starting off . and improving from there.Cant comment on trade value but GB should bounce back.,fantasyfb,ckrci73,0,t5_2t1b0
1986008,0,t3_2hcd43,Snag Donnell TE NYG if hes an available FA in case Camerons injury status fails to resolve and dont even look at that trade offer again unless its to refuse it. Just curious whos your other TE?,fantasyfb,cksij2v,1,t5_2t1b0
2028994,0,t1_ckxjgmz,uhhhh.... how?,fantasyfb,ckxq9bv,1,t5_2t1b0
2049523,0,t1_cl0a36w,No Knile Davis Cj and blunt is what i was thinking but what about after this week should I play MJD.,fantasyfb,cl0c83q,1,t5_2t1b0
2065688,0,t3_2ih0hg,Whats your record and place in the league? How many WRs do you start?,fantasyfb,cl2e7pv,1,t5_2t1b0
2098582,0,t1_cl6dis1,Not quite sure what I could add to that other than I like Beckhams wild card status. Could he steak red zone targets from Donnel?,fantasyfb,cl6kr3x,1,t5_2t1b0
2126601,0,t3_2jbjjm,Im definitely starting Cam Arian Foster Demaryius Thomas Julius Thomas Bal D Novak. Im thinking Andre Williams gets more points than Shane Vereen the NE situation is wonky or Crowell. Not sure about my WRFlex though. The tier chart posted in rfantasyfootball says to start DeSean and Fitz but Im skeptical that Fitz wont do well and think that OBJ will come out on top. DeSean is projected lower than Holmes. Need some help guys. Thanks for any tips you can give me!,fantasyfb,cla4ygz,1,t5_2t1b0
2198871,0,t3_2k8zi2,Steve Smith is a reception machine even if it was a standard league I would start Steve Smith. Williams is entirely dependant on touchdowns and is behind Dez on the depth chart. Smith is the clear number  right now in Baltimore. Smith is a stud right and you should start him regardless of matchup. That being said you can safely start Williams as your WR or flex spot. Who are you other WRs?,fantasyfb,cljbwyu,5,t5_2t1b0
5138796,0,t1_cv5ezis,So you have  flex after removing the TE? Or still only ?,fantasyfb,cv5f15b,1,t5_2t1b0
5370928,0,t1_cvy45pf,Its up to you. How many WR do you start? If only  I dont think you really need Hilton but if anything you need a good WR more than an inconsistent RB.,fantasyfb,cvy72zj,1,t5_2t1b0
5545412,0,t1_cwj7f8q,Dont want to create a new post. So if you dont mind ill ask you. Brandin cooks or gio bernard in standard  team league. Playing Jonathan stewart matt forte antonio brown and Jarvis landry. ,fantasyfb,cwkgjv5,1,t5_2t1b0
8754325,0,t3_4zyokq,Id take it. I  have a feeling Dallas  will run it often  but  using all their RBs. Morris is very capable and much more experienced. McFadden proved last year hes still a threat. So i dont see Zeke getting that many carries over the other.  Teams will stack the box to make Prescott throw.  Plus if Zeke always runs as hard as he did vs Seahawks.. he might get hurt soon.Other than injury... which nobody knows... i think  Gurley  is a safer bet. This is coming from a Cowboys fan.,fantasyfb,d6zy5cm,2,t5_2t1b0
9124557,0,t3_5554eh,I also own TBen and Tyrell Williams and Im probably going to end end slotting Williams in as my Flex this week. Not only has Williams been leading the team in targets but hes also leading TBen in snaps. The one downside with Williams is that he hasnt been terribly efficient whereas TBen is catching the majority of passes thrown his way. So maybe its a bit closer in PPR leagues but I think Williams has the higher upside. I dont think either guy is a bad Flex play this week. I do believe that by seasons end Tyrell Williams will hve emerged as Rivers goto guy and No.  WR. ,fantasyfb,d88mfqy,3,t5_2t1b0
