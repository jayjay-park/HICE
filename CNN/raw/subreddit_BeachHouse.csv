But listening to him in interviews and podcasts then seeing what he put in his show I have come around that he must have very good taste in music.,BeachHouse,cwydr47,1,t5_2ul68

6827838,0,t3_48iuas,It was originally a single released in  form and recorded later. Alex talks about why the rerecorded in this interview We liked it and we thought it made sense with the album but the arrangement that we had we both felt was cheesy. It was written and recorded very quicklywe were home for three weeks between tours and we had this little song and said Lets go record it because its funand it just felt to us like an incomplete song and it didnt feel like it was part of what we are doing now. So we kind of went back to the basic piano part that the whole song started from and built it up again in the mindset of this record. And I think it became less dry and dusty and became more colorful and blossoming and more emotional and less repetitive. It became more of a flowery song and I think the ending is way better. It says a lot more. We didnt want to forget about the song but we wanted to update it.,BeachHouse,d0q8hcs,2,t5_2ul68

8114591,0,t3_4qbpfj,Surprising that no ones mentioned Cocteau Twins. Theyre fantastic and I think beach house owes a lot to them. Bridging into shoegaze My Bloody Valentine Slowdive Ride Catherine Wheel Galaxie  Low codeine LSD and the Search for God duster Chapterhouse and others are all great listens,BeachHouse,d4s5jdk,1,t5_2ul68
8114767,0,t3_4q3xj1,I mostly get the chance to listen to BH when Im driving. I just have their songs on shuffle and I listen to whatever feels right. Lately its been a mix of Bloom and TD. Ive just been wanting something big and loud to lose myself to. I just keep wanting energy from them if that makes sense. I really need to sit down and listen to the earlier albums again but I guess I needed a break. I had Devotion playing nonstop for at least  months awhile back. But yeah anyway I need to start listening to the albums fully again. It just seems emotionally exhausting though because I might be crazy. ,BeachHouse,d4s690x,1,t5_2ul68
8127607,0,t3_4qjfdu,I wonder if what Victorias language actually is essentialist? It seems more uh strategic essentialist? Though to be honest Ive never been quite sure what gender essentialism means just based on the words or if I do why it has to always be bad. Obviously if it entails a feminism what is structured around or privileges any one aspect of femininity as The Aspect then that would be bad. But the fact that Victoria uses conflicting oppositions in her definition if we could even call it a definition such as metaphoricalactual and motherdaughter make me think that for her the She is more of a multifaceted logicallycontradictory mysterious jewellike thing like how she talks about Jewels in the Pitchfork interview. Heck because shes talking about the feminine energy its not even necessarily something thats limited to the experiences of women. So I am a man who prefers women but Ive often felt that a big part of what connects me to Beach House is that I have always been helplessly androgynous. I sometimes think that my resonance with Beach House has to do with aspects of myself which tend to present as feminine to others. ,BeachHouse,d4tm7gs,4,t5_2ul68

8670803,0,t3_4ym8ik,Zebra. I was in graduate school in Maryland and I had heard a lot of hype about Beach House but stupidly ignored it. Some music blog posted Zebra when it was first released and I fell in love with BH. Im still kicking myself though for not listening to them sooner.,BeachHouse,d6pgz1d,1,t5_2ul68

9582629,0,t3_5c45dk,Had terrible sickness but left my room for the first time in  days to go to the concert. I vaguely remember myself sweating terribly and stumbling around during Skye Skjelset opening act but some kind people took me back to the ticket stand and gave me some water. The lady was going to give me a refund but with a determined face I said I wont be needing a refund. I had to enjoy the rest of the show from the back of the audience but it was still alright. That being said i got a chip on my shoulder to go to another concert one where I am at  health.,BeachHouse,d9u96bc,4,t5_2ul68

10028479,0,t3_5azsfv,So we did get New Year at Sound on Sound Fest. It was amazing but sad too since they played it specifically in relation to the election that didnt turn out how it was expected. Regardless beautiful song that give us much needed hope. I still havent heard Used To Be or Lover of Mine live. | id love to make that happen. Im lucky that Ive been to an installation show so Ive been able to see some songs resurrected that wouldnt fit well into their traditional performance routine. ,BeachHouse,dbeqli6,2,t5_2ul68
