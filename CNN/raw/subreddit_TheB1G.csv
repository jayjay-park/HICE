2006475,0,t3_2hp3yg,How I see it in the very early stages of conference play. Michigan State  top dogs in the conference until theres a game that changes my mind. Ohio State a little bit of a homer pick but theyve had the upper hand on the teams below in recent years and have looked about as good thus far. Nebraska  undefeated yet inconsistent. move up with a to  with a win over MSU this week. Wisconsin  looked solid for the most part and if they hold on against LSU theyre  right now . Maryland  new guys look to compete well in the big ten. contender status will be tested this week. Minnesota  great game for a team that competed well in the big ten last year. Iowa  yeah the record looks good right now but weve yet to see an impressive showing from them yet. Penn State  what do you make of them. look pretty good then they take that bad of a loss. not dropping them too far yet but Im also not optimistic for the future of this season. Rutgers  doing ok but the PSU loss puts them here. Indiana  the Mizzou game is looking like an anomaly. Nothwestern  some bad games but had a good showing this week. Illinois  Done nothing impressive to date. Michigan   blowouts in  games with a little struggle against Miami OH...ouch. Purdue  last because they have the least hope of turning it aroundlets see how conference play pans out,TheB1G,ckuz81c,4,t5_2vmjf

If Michigan really played down to their opponents then they wouldnt have beaten Oregon State  or UNLV  or Maryland  or Northwestern  or Rutgers . Minnesota and Indiana are much better teams than their records would indicate and I would argue that Minnesota played up for our game with their emotional week before with Jerry Kill retiring and Indiana was doing what Indiana has been doing all year playing teams close and ultimately losing in heartbreaking fashion.,TheB1G,cx2xxav,4,t5_2vmjf
