Its not hard to do  nights in Maui Kauai is somewhat more limited I dont count hiking while on vacation as a plus. I would spend all  days on Maui or  Maui and  Kauai remember you waste a day in transit Mauis always good Kauai is rainier in general very much so in the winter time. But youre fine either way that time of the year Oahu is great ONLY if you go outside the citystay close to the water. Its mind boggling why people come here and spend any time at all in the very ugly parts of town and uglier suburbs. Better yet skip it altogether and visit a more pristine neighbor islandThe better question you should ask is Where am I going to stay? A toptier hotel makes a big difference. The Maui RitzCarlton Four Seasons are very nice to stay at and on Kauai you have the St. Regis with SPG.,HawaiiVisitors,d2w8m0z,1,t5_3cj4q
7581525,0,t3_4ei4zi,So we are military and I have been checking out hale KOA If you were to compare Hale KOA to Ahia Alana to big kahuna for show  food and price  which is more authentic and interesting? We are family if   well traveled school age kids. Unlimited drinks is not a deal breaker when we have our kids on vacation with us  but we do like a drink for the show and dinner.   ,HawaiiVisitors,d33zdgm,2,t5_3cj4q
7627611,0,t3_4j8nvj,When I went I rented a car for a few days and just looked up places online and drove... the scenery while driving was fantastic. Then the other days without the car I just stayed local and did beach things and found shops  restaurants. You can sign up for activities in your hotel most likely  which is how I ended up doing a boatsnorkling tour. Itll be a great vacation but it wont feel like you have enough time! ,HawaiiVisitors,d397vfy,1,t5_3cj4q
7732859,0,t1_d3ira8y,Yea this is why people eat rice. Meat is actually pretty cheap but youll eat a different cut. Basically you dont eat the same food at all.,HawaiiVisitors,d3l66eg,1,t5_3cj4q
7857545,0,t1_d3z7vjz,Thank you!Thats definitely on the to do list.  Are there any hikes within a short drive?,HawaiiVisitors,d3z9byl,1,t5_3cj4q
7858074,0,t1_d3z9byl,You could walk up to Manoa Falls thatd be a good day out.Diamond Head leave early and take breathable clothes.  Its very exposed and a dry heat.  The hike and terrain itself is not remotely difficult probably about half to two thirds what youd do up the thousand steps.,HawaiiVisitors,d3zbgwu,2,t5_3cj4q

10752365,0,t3_5ttnlv,Depends on where youre hiking.  Be cognizant of local weather conditions as flash floods are very much a thing on Kauai.,HawaiiVisitors,ddp0vmr,4,t5_3cj4q

11281841,0,t3_60ngc8,First choose an island. Here is a superficial summaryBig Island Mostly famous for its active volcano. Also has beaches and green areas with waterfalls. Its a big island after all. What it does best though is volcanoes.Oahu Not my cup of tea. Too crowded and touristy. Maybe someone else can tell you more. Most interesting if you want big cities and all the perks that come with that I guess.Maui Famous for its beaches and snorkeling. Also has a volcano google Haleakala. Probably best for a relaxing vacation.Kauai Wet and rains a lot but most beautiful landscapes and tons of green. Also called the garden island. If you love nature and hikes this is the place to go. Also has beaches and snorkeling of course but Maui would still be best for that.,HawaiiVisitors,dfas3ax,2,t5_3cj4q
11484242,0,t3_63tnq3,Its a condo on a very quiet beach with tremendous views good cheap food nearby and we paid  per night. My wife and I stayed there for  days in September  and absolutely loved it. Its on the windward side of Oahu good swimming on a beach protected by a reef never saw more than  people on that beach and the condo is equipped with everything you might want beach chairs amp umbrellas snorkel gear a boogie board and a fully equipped kitchen,HawaiiVisitors,dfxqjj5,3,t5_3cj4q
11809298,0,t3_68i2sr,waikiki isnt an island. you can use the bus to get around downtown oahu. its pretty cheap however if you are trying to go out of town it is going to be a big time waste think  hours to get to the north shore  hours back. big island without a car is a really bad idea. everything i have ever heard about the bus system sucks. there arent many. they are never on time. they break down all the time. you can rent cars for like  a day... id suck it up and rent one for the BI. ,HawaiiVisitors,dgymiav,3,t5_3cj4q
