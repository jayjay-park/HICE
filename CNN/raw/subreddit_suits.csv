1252926,0,t1_ciak89t,Im sorry but even if business and law have been traditionally dominated by men women who are in those professions do not suddenly center their entire lives on men with whom theyre in a romantic relationship. Additionally roughly  of JD students are women  are first and secondyear associates and though the amount of female partners has been lagging its increased from  to  from  to  so its not strange at all to think that women might be players in the same field.I wont presume to speak for the OP but as a woman myself I am totally aware that certain racesgenderssexualities get the short shrift more often than not in media. At this point I expect it which should not have to be the case ever but this is the state of entertainment and I already know that I have to deal otherwise I wont be able to enjoy anything.

1735441,0,t1_cjxwmrf,The whole show is fantastical. The idea that this many people care about Mike enough to keep his secret and face jail time themselves is ludicrous. The idea that he could be impressive enough to Sidwell and Forstman that they were offering him millions or several hundred thousand as I suspect was the case with Sidwell without either of them having him checked out is laughable. Maybe not Sidwell but Forstman wanted him to come work for him and he clearly has no problem into blackmailing people into working for him. There are all sorts of people who should have found out about his secret by now and havent and thats because there is no way for that to play out with any sort of resolved ending in the show. Either you just cut the storyline off at the knees or you play it out long enough to resolve things and tank the ratings because who really wants to watch the all characters youve grown to love get shit on for half a season and then just end. ,suits,cjxx08c,2,t5_2s5j7

Those three we just fought off? They wouldnt be able to touch us. Plus after the dissolution which didnt really hurt them either they pretty much matched Scotty point for point theres been a time skip of at least  months to a year.But more importantly All those problems you listed were more shortterm financial issues comparatively speaking. In terms of raw talentetc I doubt PH ever left the top   remember theres a whole bunch of partners we dont see and there was never a mention of theyre all leaving us the worst it got to was some associates and almost Louis.We never saw them struggle because of lack of talentpeople it was lack of funds.

4435214,0,t1_cspfco3,This is the most moronic thing that constantly gets parroted in the Suits fandom. Shes Managing Partner shes not going to put in the same hours as an Associates. Managing Partner is running the firm mostly not actually handling cases. We have seen her work on several cases with Harvey. Ava Hessington case she assisted Harvey. Last season we see her in court against Cahill. Season  when Harveys old boss cant remember the characters name tried to blame his misconduct on Harvey Jessica acted as his attorney.

5003392,0,t3_3jgn10,gtThe motive for Soloff going along with it was that Hardman told Jack about the fraud therefore making Soloff an accomplice. Hardman tells Soloff something along the lines of either help me carry out this plan to take down PSL and get your name on the door or you face fraud charges right along with MikeCouldnt Soloff then turn it right back around and incriminate Hardman? Couldnt Jack then testify to the fact that Hardman was the one who told him about the fraud and that Hardman was planning on using it for his own personal gain rather than doing the right thing and alerting the authorities?I think that whatever leverage Hardman had it would have been more to do with his family than to do with Mike.

6381546,0,t1_czexfy4,It is kinda and he cant probably. Rachel probably told him something to get him down there and he knew the charges before  meeting with Mike. They kept them apart for so long Robert probably spent the time mentally reviewing every interaction he ever had with Mike and every story Rachel ever told him and connected the dots. Even if they never had a privileged conversation he knew the truth before walking in that room.If he ever did bring it back up hed be putting his license at risk on the bet he could convince everyone he learned in a nonprivileged way from his daughter. Its the word of well respected Robert Zane v. accused fraudster Mike Ross. More likely the concern of driving his daughter away and into Mikes arms even more would probably keep his mouth shut.

Keyword ON ITS WAY UP. the show could have continued for a very long time just examining the rise of this mega law firm as jessica starts to get tougher now starting to go on the hunt for people rather than being passive. the show could have shown new complex cases involving an issue society is focused on. The show could have continued work relationships at this elite level giving people a glimpse into the life of an elite society. The show ccould also have continued a central plot of coming up with ever increasingly genius plans to keep mikes secret hidden. and also it could have continued the forstmanharvey relationship showing how harvey needs to outsmart forstman into being able to practice and beat forstman and hardman....its a cheap way to end such an amazing central theme. the writers seem to have forgotten the niche they created in the drama realm. now they shattered that concept. the show can never be the same. The central plot the major reason for the shows success has been destroyed for the sake of teaching people good morales?? on bravo??? while teaching people how to lie and cheat.if anything the morale is to keep your mouth shut so you dont go down ruining your life and the lives of those closest to you. i dont understand why they did it but i guess they wanted to spend the rest of their lives sippin martinis and tanning their pasty white asses.,suits,d0o4h7l,1,t5_2s5j7

7301330,0,t3_4ewcep,So we can certainly see Mikes moral compass getting skewed this season.Frank Gallo Paul Schultz is top dog shows Mike the ranks and potentially plays Mike. Kevin Miller Erik Pallindino is going to be Mikes bunkmate whom Mike is uncertain whether to trust or not but theyll end up relying on each other.and lastly? Malcolm JamalWarner is going to be Danbury Prisons Counselor who is tasked with helping inmates survive their time in prison.So the first night? Frank Gallo is shorter than Mike. Everything is going to go okay until Mike opens his mouth saying he can take in on his own and hell suffer his first beatdown.Then hell be thrown into the cage with Kevin Miller who will tell him that there are people to be friends with and there are people that if you look at them wrong youll be enemies. But as long as you follow the rules you wont get hurt. It looks like you already gave someone a wrong glance. Theyll chitchat etc. And Kevin will find out that Mike was Harvey Spectors right hand man. And thatll be the moment in which the trust game will be uncertain since Harvey probably put him away with bad evidence and wasnt guilty back when he was in the DAs office.Maybe Frank Gallo is in the same boat but hes actually guilty. Regardless the association to Harvey is going to be what brings Mike his first few enemies.A few things I think are almost certain this season? Mike will have a visit or two from Cameron Dennis. Maybe a visit from a third party in regards to Charles Forstman. And I almost guarantee hell see a face to face with Daniel Hardman.I dont think that Malcolm JamalWarner will be a friend. He might appear as such but as time goes on hes going to view Mike as an enemy not a friend. Same with guards. If Mike starts defending inmates that the guards are CERTAIN are guilty. Well we can expect some damage to be done to Mike but more so to Kevin Miller especially when they finally become friends. And Im curious if Harvey is able to get Mike some protection on the inside. Id assume so but I also see Malcolm JamalWarner recommending Mike be put in solitary etc.Just a few thoughts.,suits,d28414a,1,t5_2s5j7

The similarity of those two scenarios is quite obvious and i my case im not from or live in the US the Cosby show is the last ive seen Malcolm Jamal Warner in so there was still a bit Theo is saw in him and that has nothing to do with immaturity but familiarity. At least thats what i think OP means.On a side note and i already mentioned it a few episodes back hes really grown up and i think hes fantastic here in Suits and i wouldnt be surprised to see him in big movies or at least i hope so.
