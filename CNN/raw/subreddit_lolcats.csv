704242,0,t1_cgk3afp,Poor kitty!  I once had a cat when I was little that just despised our new puppy and terrorized him as well.  The puppy ended up growing to be  pounds yet still was scared to death of a little lb cat!  He also wouldnt climb any stairs in the house unless he had an escort to protect him from that cat.,lolcats,cgkbps7,1,t5_2qh10

10176609,0,t3_5lkes5,Sure it looks outmatched.  But its staring almost certain doom right in the eyes.  The tail is up  that implies the kitten is relaxed and friendly.  Its either attempting a charm spell or is so confident in its combat powers that it has no fear of this encounter.Id bet on the cat.,lolcats,dbxkpa1,6,t5_2qh10
