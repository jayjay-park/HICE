88208,0,t1_ceoalg3,Shirley didnt fail at running a sandwich shop at the Greendale cafeteria she failed at taking her business elsewhere to the mall?. There is virtually no competition at the college so people are going to buy whatever she sells. I agree on the Pierce bit it could have waited another episode for me. Its not like anybody elses story has really been dealt with much so far so Im not entirely sure why they chose to bring up Pierce so quickly.,studyroomf,ceogzbn,1,t5_2uru4

558112,0,t3_1w4zgt,Those celebrityrhyme puns are gone as well! Well at least I dont recall any... Also I dont remember hearing any brittad.I think its good. Running gags are funny until theyre not. The thing that makes them funny is that we remember the times they happened before. But if there are too many to recall them all theyre through. Im glad they realized that. Im looking forward to new running gags but please dont force any.,studyroomf,cg3ppt1,3,t5_2uru4

772792,0,t1_cgrzstb,I think theyll have to acknowledge it. My guess is itll take up one scene this Thursday but it could also be a bstory for the whole episode.,studyroomf,cgs4d5o,6,t5_2uru4

812628,0,t3_23elkb,As much as a lot of season  failed to delver I still consider it all to be cannon.  Most of the episodes Ill probably never watch again except HErstory of Dance Basic Human Anatomy Intro to Knots and maybe Heroic Origins but I still count it all as the show.  The lows of season  were lower than the lows of he other seasons but the highs were just as good as the highs of the rest.  And the other seasons had their share of lows too.So overall I rate the seasons as follows .   . .,studyroomf,cgwnenm,5,t5_2uru4

3622191,0,t1_cq50r0u,For one thing I dont think Willy tried to murder him just because of the way he teaches. I think Willys intentions were partly due to Jeffs rather phony the only thing that separates us is an orange jumpsuit speech. Jeff was trying to manipulate Willy into thinking he was cool and thereby trying to look cool to his students. Because thats what he does. Look cool. With his words. Even though they are shallow. And while many people have called Jeff out for it in the past Willy really wanted to put an end to it forcing Jeff to realize that sincerity sometimes is the better wayWhile we know that Jeff cares about the Dean even though he manipulates him the Dean cant be so sure about it. Jeff realized that if you dont treat your friend like a  friend you cant expect him to be loyal to you.Regarding BrittaTrying to therapize someone and trying to have a party are two very  different things though. What I liked about the plot is the Shes just having a party what can possibly go wrong? theme. It turns out for the audience and for Britta that even manipulating Abed into approving a party can have severe consequences. Its not exactly a profound revelation but I still liked seeing the plot evolve. I liked all interactions between AnnieBrittaAbed it was fun to see their characters clash in this way.,studyroomf,cq55mzw,6,t5_2uru4
