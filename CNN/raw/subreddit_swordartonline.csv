Might want to look into that.Also what recording equipment are you using? If possible buy a good microphone Blue Snowball is good for starters and inexpensive and a pop filter to eliminate the booming sounds that we hear when you guys make the p b and s sounds. This one is good and also inexpensiveYour intro music could also be quieter and it would help to just remove the voice speaking as its kind of annoying. ,swordartonline,ck5ykaz,8,t5_2uikt

1958219,0,t3_2h3jyg,I would not claim to be any kind of authority but I have seen a SAO and a few other anime series so Ill post my thoughts. I should mention that I have not read the light novels. Whether something is close to the source material or not I am not sure but I will comment on it regardless because I definitely feel that the anime series should be able to stand on its own. Kirito Asuna and YuiI could see what they were trying to do here but it fell flat. I think that Asuna and Kirito might feel protective of Yui over a very short period of time seeing her as a little sister or even a daughter eventually but the whole happy family scenario felt very forced. There was no time for these relationships to develop both in terms of the showing the audience and the proposed timeline a few weeks tops. It is a shame because I really liked the Yui concept. An emerging child like AI that sought out the protagonists both as part of its original core programming preserving healthy mental states and as a child seeking comfort after being forced to witness much tragedy. Kirito and SuguhaOthers in this thread have pointed out that cousins are acceptable in Japan something that I didnt know. I guess there are culture differences but I did find this a little uncomfortable. Especially as they had been brought up as brother and sister. I would have been happy to see her being crazy jealouspossessive but in the context of a sister that craved her brother after losing him for  years it was just the romantic attachment that seemed off. This also wasnt helped by the fact that every girl that Kirito meets is all over him so this plot point was already tired before it began.  Rapey scenesAgain I can see what they intended with this. They wanted to show the viewer how despicable the villain was how utterly twisted someone can be under the surface when he had the escape of a virtual world contrasted against his relatively unassuming composure in the real world. However this and its associated factors are possibly the core of most of what irked me in SAO and there are a few reasons for this  Relegating Asuna to Damsel in Distress plot point Taking away Asunas active role where she could continue growing as a character was a travesty. Kirito continued to develop we got to know him better and this opportunity was removed from Asuna. On top of this they utterly changed her personality from a self reliant and capable character to that of a victim. The Asuna we got to know in the first half of season  would not have sat passively in discomfort she would have had a lot more fight in her it may not have done her any good but she wouldnt have just sat there and taken it.  Lazy villain writing His motivations were very poorly outlined and came out of nowhere. He wanted Asuna and wanted to develop mind control tech for profit. This is something which was not alluded to prior to this point and never visited again either. Despite being an interesting concept that warranted investigation it was relegated to being a justification for the viewer to acknowledge the antagonist as evil.  Poor writing I disliked the second arc because of what it did to the first arc. It crowded it. With the sudden change to second arc mid season the sense of purpose was completely changed. Although the pacing had been odd at times there was a sense of progressing through Aincrad with Kirito and co. The audience wanted to uncover what Kayaba Akihiko was up to maybe get to know him better as an antagonist. Certainly to see the protagonists develop in their relationships and friendships and explore the world of Aincrad. And finally to defeat Kayaba in an epic showdown. All of this was cut out from under the viewer in a single episode. This was very unsatisfying because it lacked proper lead up to clarify the idea and plot surrounding that unexpected final battle was fine it was the execution and the feeling that you had missed half the story arc that was the issue. On top of this they jumped in with a new antagonist and a new secondary protagonist Suguha. What I think SAO neededI think that the whole first season needed to focus on the Aincrad story arc. This way there would have been time to further develop characters and do away with the odd pacing like the one off episodes where Kirito would meet a girl and have them all over him before the plot more or less dumped them they could have been integrated properly into a cohesive narrative and something a lot less episodic in its storytelling. It needed to have more interaction between the characters for Kirito to come to rely on his friends or at least show the viewer enough interactions to justify the friendship these characters supposedly had. For Asuna and Kirito to grow together in a more subtle way for Yui to be properly integrated into the plot and have her relationship with Asuna and Kirito develop in an believable fashion. Are other anime like thisCertain things seem to happen more frequently in anime than other media cringe worthy moments like boob grabs the in your face sexualisation of female characters or at least the way they go about displaying this verses other media deus ex machina plot devices that only apply to the protagonist. This can become irritating or grating at times but no more than other tropes and cliches are in other media. More western media movies and TV series have their own set of equivalent tropes I guess the difference to most people is that they are used to them while they are not used to those seen in anime. To more specifically answer your question yes there are anime that are a lot like SAO in this regard but there are many which are not. I should close by saying that I really did enjoy SAO for its concepts its art direction the characters and the music SWORDLAND THEME!. This probably comes off as a rant but I guess it is just because I quickly became quite invested in SAO and I feel that it did not live up to its potential through a combination of poor writing and a lack of time to properly develop the concepts and characters as well as the relationships between them. ,swordartonline,ckp61ur,4,t5_2uikt
1961576,0,t3_2h4zcb,I went through the same response when I was finished with the first season. My thought is that it was related to the concept was wanting to live in a virtual world like that something you dream of as a little kid if youre an avid gamer. The desire of wanting to live in that world the fact that it did a good job emotionally connecting you with the characters and with Kirito and Asunas relationship leaves that depressing hole feeling when youre done. I had the same response of looking for more SAO related things to make me feel better and eventually started reading the light novels. As time passed I read slower and felt less like I was depressed following it and now Im fine. You just have to focus on something else to pass the time and the feeling moves on.,swordartonline,ckpkl8z,3,t5_2uikt

2128472,0,t3_2jccs7,gt PedophiliaFirst Im going to correct you here. Pedophilia is a sexual attraction to prepubescent children or people who havent hit puberty yet younger than . What youre referring to is Ephebophilia. sexual attraction to lateradolescents  yearoldsgt  year old girlNow that I have the semantics out of the way...  is a matured age in most parts of the world. In the US the age of consent varies from  to . In my state Texas  is the age where were legally allowed to consent and thus meaning that  is acceptable.In Japan in particular the age of consent is  but can be as low as  in certain regions depending on some laws and one can get married at about  with a parents consent.Most of this hardly really matters in terms of this discussion considering there was no consenting. But it does illustrate that it was within the bounds of acceptability.gt grown manAnd my final point. Sugou was no older than . Kayaba was  when SAO was cleared and Sugou was clearly said to be younger than him. Sugous age is never clearly stated and could have ranged from  to . Mature yes but he wasnt old or very grown. Most even still call that young.,swordartonline,cladj36,5,t5_2uikt

Divine Blade bypasses this and lets the user have an omnipresent defense with the ability to attack at a moments notice.

Basically any object in the world can be used to kill with blunt force trauma so pretty much everything on the shelf can kill people. Its about removing or warning about other possibilities that can cause harm. For example the microwave wont run with the door open cigarettes warning labels and guns having safetys.  A Nervegear would be subject to these same trials and if it was discovered that it could fry peoples brains it wouldnt make it to the shelf. However the way you look at it is narrow minded because lets say the Nervegear was released but didnt have the ability to fry a brain it could still be used to beat someone to death.

We are usually a conservative type group so being on the front lines would be rare but we also wouldnt be chilling on the first floor either. That said we would probably be a economical businesstype guild buying selling and networking with other traders across all the floors to gain wealth and property. We would try to own a lot of various houses or lots so we could occasionally go on vacation or spend adventuring in different places.  Of course we would all be geared up with weapons and what not for protection but I think being a trader would be a nice way to spend  years instead of fighting all the time. Eventually we would accumulate enough wealth to live on the nicer floors. As for teaming up with Kirito it might be possible the only way I see it happening is if we do contracting work with him same for Agil and Liz. tldr i would make a trading guild with my friends to acquire vast wealth so I could go adventuring and live in nice houses on various floors.edit wording,swordartonline,cmn8ndx,5,t5_2uikt

Where the fan translations lack in grammar and syntax in some instances they make up for it by doing a better job at translating names from Katakana to English than the official.

3129997,0,t3_2w03bv,Alicization is according to the Web Novels the last Arc of the entire series. It is said that there will be around  Volumes of the Light Novel  which is slightly changed from the Web Novels by the author I dont know what this wiki count as volume but  is way too much.About the number of seasons... It depends on the Anime Studio. They can cut things out like they did in Season  and  to finish the Alicization Arc in one season and then  which I think is more likely  itll be a very long season. The reason is that the Alicization Arc covers more than a half of the Volumes and so the entire series. About the release Schedule...you cant tell The author and the Anime studio could not know that SAO would be that popular. They were kinda unprepared and thats why i took them so much time. But after  seasons of success they know that they have a huge fanbase which is waiting for new content. By the way. Season  was already announced on February st together with their rd Game Lost Song. And they said they will continue on the Anime after finishing the game  which is released at the end of march  So my guess is Season  will be End of   Beginning . And yeah it gonna be a big big season. ,swordartonline,comf798,1,t5_2uikt

3217385,0,t1_cov65jq,I pretty much agree with all of your opinions on SAO. That said I read over LNSAO and LNSide stories of SAO which are pretty much first arc of Season . They explain so much details it is not even funny. Things about how the gameplay itself works. Why sword skills are important and how they work. Also they explain how Kirito is able to be so overpowered.  They went a bit into the politics of The Army and just give you a bit of better picture about why and what is going on in SAO.  As I didnt like the fairyarc gungamearc and excaliberarc that much I went straight for Mothers Rosario LN and again it explains so much. Im not done with it yet but there were already some answers to your questions. About why Yuuki is so important to Asuna.  There is much greater emphasis on how powerful Sleeping Knights actually are. Each one of them is very close to Yuuki. And Yuuki is more powerful than most of the main cast if not all of them.  There is explanation about the OSS Original Sword Skills how they work and why they are so rare and precious. Also why only some of the players are able to create and use them.  Overall rewatching some episodes of Anime after reading through some of the LNs they make much more sense.,swordartonline,covhf6j,1,t5_2uikt

3359700,0,t3_2y4avc,With how beautiful Aincrad is I have to admit I wouldnt mind spending time there away from my life for a bit. Clearly its completely amp absolutely dangerous but you can also live a happy life and thats appealing. Ive had some rough years truth be told and a peaceful life would be blissful.I was a Corporal and Platoon Sergeant in the Marines and so I imagine Id have worked the front lines in SAO aswell. In the beginning of the game I would have worked as a solo adventurer or in very small temporary groups Ive already dealt with the stress of not letting the people around me die in real life and that was one thing I really appreciated about SAO how a lot of the stress Kirito struggles with is pretty damn accurate when youre in the position of trying to protect everyone.As the game went on Id maybe start a small guild. A guild the size of the Knights of the Blood Oath to me is sickening. Its just too much to keep up with even with more players and more resources there is way too much internal conflict to have to worry about. Id run a small guild no more then seven or eight with people free to come and go and free to work on whatever quests they desire. I wouldnt restrict members from participating in Boss fights but I would offer my advice on if they should sometimes Id offer that advice even if they didnt ask. As a leader thats your job to protect them. Id only be interested in letting some of the strongest players join though and out of the strongest players only the ones with a proper attitude aswell. Id do my best to direct the guild towards work that keeps us going keeps us fighting and keeps us free from the other guilds. Id try and keep our skills varied and form useful alliances with blacksmiths merchants and the like. If I did start a guild wed be there on the frontlines and wed be there for the boss fights as much as possible. I think everyone wants to envision themselves as a solo player because its easier to not have to worry about the people around you but I also dont think people think about just how hard it would be to solo. Or how hard it would be to keep your guild from joining up with another larger guild. SAO is a very dangerous place and guilds like the Holy Dragon Alliance Laughing Coffin and KoB all have real amounts of pull. I couldnt do it though fly under someone elses banner. Too much Captain Reynolds in me. Like I said Id solo or try and fight with the right people by my side..Because Id play most of the early game solo only starting a guild if I felt I had the right crew my build would reflect my independent nature. Onehanded straight sword light armor search and detect night vision battle healing...I think I would actually end up buying a house solo player or not because working the frontlines comes with risks but it also comes with rewards. Id probably buy a modest place somewhere I could use to destress when I needed too. Lots of books. I actually would try and work my cooking skill up assuming it really did make my stay in Aincrad more enjoyable. Id also probably fish too.If I ended up falling more and more into line with living permanently within Aincrad then Id maybe even have a relationship. Thats the thing one of the most appealing factors about it is just how happy you can be. I think how comfortable I felt in Aincrad would depend more on whoif I met someone and then that person would determine how much I wanted to stay in Aincrad and what type of lifestyle I would be wanting to lead. Although hopefully Id meet a floorclearing badass and the decision to keep fighting would be simple.,swordartonline,cpb8bav,4,t5_2uikt

3425358,0,t3_2ze23p,I dont watch a whole lot of anime so Im not sure if Im the right person to give my thoughts on it since I cant compare it to a lot.But Im going to do it anyway. I feel like they blew a lot in the first  episodes of the series. Which in my opinion are by far the best of the entire  episodes up till now. I see a general mindset that the first  episodes were pretty good which I fully agree with. Sure there are some iffy scenes and writing every now and then but thats what every anime has.The problem is with those  episodes if you give people something pretty solid but after that its not as good as the start than people will board the hate train. Humans are unfair that way youll spoil them with something decent and they expect the next to trump the first. SAO couldnt deliver this I struggled through the whole Fairy Dance and GGO arc myself.So combine the vibe that becomes less intense with not always top notch writing and youll end up with something like this. However that doesnt mean it sucks. Its about how nitpicky you want to be as a viewer. Since I didnt watch a whole lot of anime to compare I guess Im not too picky about stuff.Ive only watched Hellsing OVA series Attack on Titan SAO Akame ga kill!In that order so I dont think I have a lot to compare but all those  animes have some poor writing every now and then. Yet I enjoyed them except Akame ga kill but I can see why people dont like things. If you watch more anime Im sure that there are better stories out there. But that depends on the reason why you watch.Want somewhat simple entertainment this is fine want a deeper story with deeper motivations get another one. Its fine you dont have to follow others to be happy. ,swordartonline,cpipsa0,1,t5_2uikt

This past week went by so fast and I had vol. downloaded on my computerphonetablet so I simply kept on reading them non stop as if I had one huge book with me so I cant really recall what part of the story belonged to what book. I wont be able to give you my opinion on each of them individually.One thing I noticed though is how long the Alicization Arc is but I barely even notice it as I was too invested in the story. By the end of vol.  or   I cant remember which  I havent even realized that I read about x the contents of the SAO Arc. I will admit that at some parts I felt like the story was getting a bit slow and long but a quick break from reading to get some refreshments quickly dismissed that feeling. Anyways if you got any questions Im all ears!,swordartonline,cpk2626,1,t5_2uikt

3450966,0,t3_2zrim8,According to the opinion of the majority the light novels will take precedence over all in terms of content and readability. If you just want to read what you already know reading Volume  to Volume  will be fine. Volume  and onward begins the new arc.

3700368,0,t3_32pzig,Considering you liked SAO if you want something similar try Log Horizon! It is really good!JoJos Bizarre Adventure is amazing if you would like epic fights hilarious antics and to see just over the top show. Just try not to get turned off too much by Part  because even though I like it a lot of people dont. If you want classic go Cowboy Bebop. It is so iconic for a reason it never hurts to check it out.If you want something a lot more laid back anything by Kyoto Animation is pretty well suited And I do mean everything from Free! to Clannad.If you want a great longrunning shounen One Piece is the way to go. It really is my personal favorite out of everything to hit the market.One last thing is to not let your taste and opinion be affected by others. A lot of losers will bash your favorite show if it doesnt meet their Perfect Criteria but dont let it phase you. All that is important is that you enjoy something. Dont limit your enjoyment of a show to their standard.,swordartonline,cqe2ezq,1,t5_2uikt

4087990,0,t1_crkytio,Then youve wasted your time. I work as a freelance software dev for startup companies not because I want too but because I literally have to work to survive. No matter how much I reduce my need to work there will always be something else. The advantage of my line of work however is that for all the long long months I get to take a good six months to a year off every two years or so. And thats while comfortably pursuing financial independence again I live VERY cheaply.Yes I have to keep looking for work during that time off but what do I do? I work out I write. I work out some more. I watch a movie almost every day. I go visit friends or have them over for activities I train Judo and Brazilian Jiujitsu at my dojo. I take spontaneous beach trips where I crash in the car or a dirt cheap hotel for the weekend I help paint friends houses or do maintenance on my own home. I volunteer and I coach little league soccer. My times unemployed are literally the best times of my life even when I dont have any income at all coming into my household.

They hit on a lot of details and though I wish they could have done more Im fairly impressed with their work.Have you seen season  yet? Theres quite a few cliffhangers much more so than in season .

To be honest on quite a few songs especially with modern music mastered specifically for mp you wouldnt be able to tell the difference but there are definitely songs where it is noticeable.  Wellmastered albums it can make a significant difference on.  Mp compression generally cuts off any super low or  high frequencies entirely for the sake of saving space.But then it also depends on what mp player youre using what headphonesspeakersearbuds how good your hearing still is etc.  It all makes a difference in the end to how it sounds.Im a bit of an audiophile so when Im downloading whole albums I will usually do so in FLAC.

5398107,0,t3_3oy1z7,Ill be honest here.I think she is the single worst thing about the entire show.I hate Yui. Every single time she appears on screen i instantly cringe. And there are so many times when i feel my hate is justified with her.Firstly I dont like how she interacts in the story. Her first two episodes are really kinda creepy  Kirito and Asuna have just gotten hitched like literally a week before and out of literally nowhere a girl appears and starts calling them Mummy and Daddy. These people have been together for a sum total of about a month and bam. Heres a small child. And everyone just accepts this.If it was me id be freaking the fuck out. Its insanely unnatural its completely just shoved into an Arc for what seems to be no reason other than so the married couple can have a child without having to do all the childrearing things that normal people do.So i hate the reason shes in the plot.But then she gets more interesting! She is revealed to be an AI she is revealed to be quite interesting and she has a proper reason to be around  oh shes dead.Then Fairy Dance.She comes back and its all great everyones happy and why is she now Navi? She looks stupid. She sounds stupid. She has entirely too much dialogue for saying what amounts to literally nothing of import for episode after episode after episode asking bullshit questions about sexuality and love which as a computer connected to the internet who was designed to understand emotions should already know about just drag the dialogue down.Then she gets more interesting again! They get to the world tree and she leads the way to Asuna and its all heartwarming and she feels like a character  oh shes dead again.Then shes just a background character that does even less than she does beforehand for the rest of the show.Secondly i dont like her voice acting. Its terrible. The dub actor is so bad. Its like the voice casting agency said Okay when you do this character there will be helium in the room when you read these lines to make the voice high pitch. But when the actor showed up to do the voice acting they said The helium truck floated away just pretend you are really squeaky. It hurts my ears. Thirdly what dialogue she does have after Fairy Dance is stupid. Its almost completely relegated to stating the blatantly obvious.For example That scene in Calibre where she explains elemental weaknesses. What is the point of that scene?! It has ZERO bearing on the entire plot it has ZERO affect on following dialogue its BLAZINGLY obvious to ANYONE whos even HEARD of pokemon before and its all COMPLETELY DONE IN THAT VOICE.And the rest of the dialogue consists almost entirely of Look out DADDEEE its going to attack!Finally how she seems to be something of a figure girl for the series. Too much of the art and promotional material shows Yui in a prominent position as if to say This character is important. No she isnt. She is not important.She is weird she is poorly voiced she has little to no bearing on the plot dialogue or world and frankly i think her entire integration with the two lead characters is plain creepy.,swordartonline,cw1o1o6,4,t5_2uikt

Nothing she asked of Asuna was unreasonable her plans and reasoning were well researched and her motives were pure. She just didnt do a good job of selling her plan to Asuna. If my  year old daughter Asuna is  right? was  years behind her peers attending a remedial school had no plans for her future and spent most of her free time playing games with her friends Id intervene too and take steps to ensure a comfortable and respectable future for her. If later on she decides that she doesnt want a comfortable and respectable future thats fine but in order for her to make that choice she has to put herself in a position where it actually is a choice rather than a lack of options.Edit SGPFC,swordartonline,cw4kvfj,2,t5_2uikt

5708443,0,t1_cx4o8kk,gt why people view Asuna as a weak character because of Fairy DanceYou mentioned ranime so you should know that they dont look much deeper than surfacelevel when it comes to SAO. They see that Asuna is held in a cage and sexually assaulted with no way to fight him physically and its over they wont bother to notice that she constantly fought against Sugou who had complete and absolute control over the world in which she was held captive mentally and emotionally even though she didnt have physical power or that she tried to escape on her own and almost succeeded or that she was instrumental in her own rescue to the point that without her help it would have been completely impossible.Its sad really because then you get a Harvardquality thesis paper that goes indepth about every scene ever if you say anything bad about shows like NGE.

If anything they may be at odds with each other for a while that was impression in episode  at the strategy meeting.Its gonna be interesting to see just how that goes down do they split up naturally and just go back to being solo players again only teaming up fro major fights? Do they get into a fight? Does Kirito push her into joining a guild or does she get invited at some point while they are still partnered? At this point they say that they will split up again at some point though they have no real reason to as far as practicality is concerned. LN Volume Spoilerln Kirito is actively trying to not get her ostracized from the front line players like he is so she can find a guild when they do split up.

In v p it says that it was a monster drop but in v p both of these are for the official translations just FYI it says that it came from a purchase made by Asuna.We assumed that the latter was simply a mistranslation by YP and were hoping that you knew how Asuna really got her Wind Fleuret and if its consistent throughout the Japanese LNs.

6082227,0,t1_cygrhb5,gtGiving Dual Blades to the player earlier than the others was likely to give said player time to max out the skill thus making the fight more interesting.Just a thought here but what if Kayaba knew about Kiritos power levelling after the Black Cats and gave it to him during that time to make his fight more interesting.  Because Kirito was a Clearer it was likely that Kayba had some sort of monitor on him and his absence from the Front Lines or even from day levelling during the guild would not have gone unnoticed.  Perhaps that change in pattern is what caused Kayaba to give it even earlier.  We know that he has a sense of fairness so would he want to give Kirito that skill so that he could win against Nick the Renegade?  If Kirito is the one who is destined to have DW and the person who has DW has to fight the final boss that person would have to be protected.  While this is the topic of the thread if we go on the assumption that Cardinal picks the recepient of each skill it might not be changeable.  So the only way to make sure that Kirito made it to the end of the game would be to give him this skill so that he could solo the boss and win.  It is pretty clear that Kirito wasnt going to ask for help nor would he give up on the boss and if Kayaba knew this from monitoring maybe a Yui style thing he could have used a failsafe to keep his hero alive.,swordartonline,cygv18j,4,t5_2uikt

Its said that the two main reasons PKers existed were  they fail to totally understand that PKing is equal to actual murder as the message As the system does not prohibit this doing so is okay was spread among them harassment such as rape on the other hand is directly prevented in the form of the ethics code and  Kayaba the creator of the NerveGear was the man responsible for the killings as the NerveGear is what actually killed players. Rosalia also makes note of the fact that not every player believed that death ingame caused death IRL in episode . Murders in SAO were far more grayarea to the PKers whereas anyone with half a brain would realize that rape is definitely not in any sort of gray area. Murder requires manipulation of the grayarea that is PKing rape doesnt have that luxury.,swordartonline,czapw32,1,t5_2uikt

While Kayaba killed a bunch of people he also influenced the Medicuboid which could help a lot of people. I see him as a humanitarian in a lot of ways not all and giving data that was collected by the system to science could help the greater good. There is a lot in here that is really sketchy ground as Kayaba did a lot of bad things but the information could help people.

6617230,0,t3_469rab,Allow me to ask a question here in regards to your first point how many of these girls does Kirito andor Asuna know are in love with him?Lisbeth? I believe so but if this is the case then he also is aware that she very much wants him to be with Asuna. Lisbeth even says so herself albeit in only so many words when the two are talking at the end of Warmth of the Heart in Aincrad. Either way not really anything to worry about especially given that Lisbeth and Asuna had been friends before she and Kirito met so Asuna knows how she is.Sugu? Yeah but even Kirito himself shut that down right away. Besides cant really get rid of your teenage sister now can you? Youre kinda stuck with her until one of you moves out. Plus Sugu is friends with the rest of the gang too making exiling her so to speak a bit more difficult.Silica? Sinon? Nah neither one is really in love with him.Theres one other thing you mentioned that I think is a very important pointgt back off and move on alreadyIs this not exactly what theyve done? None of them makes any move on Kirito the closest they do is to stop the pair from being affectionate in public but thats also a cultural thing. PDA is frowned upon in Japan the gang is simply pointing out that they are being somewhat rude by showing their love in public like that. Not to mention that moving on isnt as simple as snapping your fingers or flipping a switch theyre doing what they can to move on by not making any moves.As for your second point uYerno has already answered that rather wholly. Kawahara has directly stated that he doesnt intend for Alice to be romantically interested in Kirito. We should probably wait and see how the LN plays out theres always room for changes so take the WN with a small grain of salt.,swordartonline,d03s0yd,1,t5_2uikt

6886583,0,t3_4a2ov8,I dont see why people say Kirito is a perfect hero. He literally has the same character tropes as  of every other anime. Hes a loner shows cowardice by not helping Klein at the beginning and is regularly shown being torn between trying to make sure he survives and helping others especially when its dangerous.As far as Asuna goes she does pretty much everything she can to help herself. Sometimes it just doesnt workout. I dont think that because he has to save her in one arc means shes automatically a damsel in distress. Thats definitely a small part of her disposition throughout the entire series.The anime definitely has a few flaws but in general I think the vast majority of the criticism it gets especially Kirito his personality and his plot armor is mostly just an anticirclejerk to the hype it got. In reality the vast majority of the tropes people site making it bad exist in most anime and for most characters.,swordartonline,d0wwt88,4,t5_2uikt

He doesnt have to cater to anyone but himself and Id argue that doing so makes for a better story than giving in and pleasing fans because theyre crybabies because wah my favorite part was too short.gt the only plausible connection at that point would be alternate realitiesDebatable especially considering the current debates about Kiritos connection to Accel Worlds Brain Burst game debates that have become even more common after the events of AW v. For all we know we could all be missing some big connection between the two.gt so he would want to but is not sure if its possible?I think his uncertainty is due to his schedule hes got a lot on his plate asis and continuing SAO would only add more to it.gt that still doesnt mean the only way he could continue is by connecting it to AWOh no of course not. I meant this in reference to another point you made about Alicization being the end of the series.gt the WN ending itself was heading in a completely different directionEh I dont know about that. I dont think theres anything about the WN that would directly invalidate a connection to AW.gt assuming its upheld by the LN which is more likely then notGuess well just have to wait and see. Remember though Phantom Bullet not sure if just v was heavily altered or if v was as well and Alicization Rising v were heavily altered from the WN. Theres always the possibility that v follows the same path given that nothing from the volumes prior to those heavily edited really implied that there would be major edits the ones prior followed the WN fairly closely as well. Not to mention that from what Ive heard v is beginning to deviate from the WN more than v and v did. Obviously I cant confirm this but my source is fairly reliable Id say.,swordartonline,d2rrq8t,1,t5_2uikt

7520891,0,t1_d2x2nx7,There are something like  billion people on earth right now and billions more from the past.  Is it really possible that each person has one thing that makes them totally and perfectly unique?  While you can technically look at DNA and fingerprints I believe humanity has a lot more in common than it has in differences.  Im assuming that everyone wants to be happy and be somewhat normalfit in here but I would venture to say that most peoples goals in life are pretty similar.  So when looking at unique traits its rather hard to find them with such common goals.In a story that has a writer yes it should be expected that people have things that make them different.  And that comes in HOW they go about making their lives normal.  Kirito approaches it in a very different way from Asuna.   One tries to merely distance himself and create a sense of normalcy through isolation while the other create an emotional isolation among her comrades while projecting another facade for them.,swordartonline,d2x372k,2,t5_2uikt
7522312,0,t1_d2x8x56,I think this could very well be how Reki breaks Kirisuna in Progressive.

7669663,0,t3_4kczkm,First off the anime is fucking fantastic. They kind of butcher some of the explanations from Fairy Dance but overall I think the anime is incredible. The music is really engaging and really enhances every scene imo. The animation is also some of the best Ive ever seen. Like if you think Sword Skills are badass in the books wait till you actually see them! Theres also Extra Edition a side story that takes place between Fairy Dance and Phantom Bullet. As far as I know it doesnt exist in book form so your only option if you want to see that is the anime.It also sounds like you may not have read SAO Progressive? If you havent heard of Progressive its essentially a long form retelling of the Aincrad arc. Its up to  volumes in English right now which covers Kirito and Asunas adventures through Floors . And yeah thats as absurd as it sounds. Reki Kawahara said at a convention kind of half jokingly that he expects it will take him about  years to finish writing Progressive but depending on how things work out it may be a project that takes him the rest of his life to finish.I havent checked out the manga for the main series but Ive heard its basically just an adaptation of the novels. The manga for Progressive is worth getting imo because its told from Asunas pov instead of Kiritos but theres a lot of minor changes so you could consider the Progressive manga to be noncanon. On the manga side of things theres also Girls Ops which is only up to  volumes in English. Its a fairly lighthearted story that follows Lisbeth Silica Leafa and a new character on an adventure of their own. It starts off pretty lighthearted but well its SAO things always get serious.As for the games theyre a lot of fun imo. Hollow Fragment is an alternate universe story that shows what may have happened if SAO wasnt cleared on Floor . This results in a cascade of changes that causes it to be quite different from the main series but at its core its still the SAO you know and love. Lost Song directly follows the events of Hollow Fragment and it looks like the third game Hollow Realization will directly follow the events of Lost Song. Concerning gameplay Id look up some videos before you buy. I mean I love the fuck out of these games but Hollow Fragment is an RPG thats pretty much Witcher  levels of longer than fuck and that alone is a huge turn off for a lot of people.Heres a couple of  spoiler free reviews Ive written for Hollow Fragment.  If you have any questions feel free to ask me! ,swordartonline,d3dzw0t,3,t5_2uikt

8283742,0,t1_d5d00fi,When I wrote that I looked at it funny thought something was wrong.  Ignored it.  Kirito did go down to the magic pixel of video games twice.  And he did lose friends.  Sachi comes to mind and Asuna did die to Heathcliff even though she survived for various reasons.  Asuna did exist though.  She wasnt in the spotlight for a few arcs but she was there and was helpful.  Same logic as Kirito was for MR arc.  He didnt complete the story but he was there and helped where required.  I cant prove or disprove this either way.  Ill cede the point.  Yui binds the Kirisuna together though.  Kazuto has nerve gear and Im sure Asuna has a keepsake or relic but Yui is something that they shared together during the time.  Same logic as when they bought the house the second time in new Aincrad.  Yeah its just a house.  But its their house.  Thats why they were excited  rushed to get it.   Fear of death  I mightve missed something but how does she end death?  She did shot a boss but beyond that she provides information.  Yeah I know.  Just habit.

And in fact if you saw fit to watch all the way to the end he actually does something concrete to help the situation himself by AW spoilersln challenging Noumi to a duel.The Haruyuki at the start of the series wouldnt be able to do that.As for Kirito?

It was originally volume  with the very start then skipping the the very end of aincrad then later volumes interspersing it with side stories. The anime animated it chronologically.. He was kinda crazy but eh. We dont know.. Again they very much wrote him as The Bad Guy. They were written in each of their own side stories after the main aincrad arc was done..

9335666,0,t1_d8zcraw,Turned people off?  How many people on this sub are like I dont care if I knew SAO would be a death game Id still sign up? PActually I think there are more mundane concerns regarding full dive technology that need to be hashed out... like what happens if theres a fire while youre in full dive?  Would the machine need to be hooked up to a fire alarm?  Should there be other safety monitors like detecting pain to the actual body and disconnecting the full dive?  Also presumably any actual full dive technology would have an operating system on the machine which couldnt be overridden by the software allowing a user to bring up a system menudisconnect at any time.Regarding SciFi writers and trapped in VR type stories... I think its because good SciFi is really a parable for or asks questions about modern or philosophical questions in an entertaining package.  Full VR is good for asking a lot of existentialist type questions like what is the self and what is reality?  Its part of what I do really like Kawaharas work.  He mightve flubbed a small detail about how the technology works but he handles the larger questions about how it affects the psyche and society very well.

10675511,0,t1_ddgywrh,Divisiveness comes with politics but Trump has brought it to a new level. His incessant tweeting and complaining about anyone who makes fun of him. You cant tell me that Trump has acted with even an iota of the dignity demanded by the office of President the position considered to be THE most powerful in the world. I mean God forbid SNL and Baldwin make fun of him. A comedy show that makes fun of a president? Who knew?He went after Clinton for her connections to Wall Street. He then appoints several current or former Goldman Sachs executives to his cabinet. He rode his Build the Wall slogan to the WH on the promise hed make Mexico pay for it. But Mexico has repeatedly denied any intention to do so which means the American taxpayer will foot the bill.  billion dollars was the last estimate I saw. Hes managed to get Betsy DeVos appointed to Education Secretary a woman with absolutely no experience either personally or professionally. She literally got the job because shes donated THAT much money to the GOP. It took the Vice President casting a tie breaking vote. I mean we can go on and on about it but what Trump promised and what hes done so far are almost polar opposites. Ill admit that at times I was in favor of Trump over Clinton. He spoke his mind. He wasnt just another career politician like Clinton. With Clinton all we were gonna get was  years of more deadlock and partisan bickering. With Trump he was such a wild card that maybe he couldve swung it. And even now Im trying to remain patient and see how this goes. I live in Texas. A state thats been dominated by the Republican Party for years. But this was probably the most divided Ive seen Texas. And it centers on Trump. What he says what he does how hes conducted himself have been called into question by all manner of people. On both sides. The GOP couldnt stand that he was actually winning the Primaries until it looked like he could actually win the Presidency. And then all of sudden they were on board with him. ,swordartonline,ddh3jvr,3,t5_2uikt

Not sure how spread out it is but I do know it goes into a lot more detail and is considered canon so I suggest you give that a shot.

I hate that they fell into this anime trap but its not nearly as major a part of the story nor as gratuitous as in some other anime. I tried watching this neat looking anime about a cooking school once. Really neat story. But out came the tentacles every other scene  basically anytime anyone ate food. It ruined it for me and as you can tell Im still a little bitter. So while SAO is not perfect its an entertaining story that doesnt often get too bogged down in the worst anime stereotypes. ,swordartonline,de800hk,1,t5_2uikt

He was there by himself as far as I know as well so literally just talking outloud to anyone within ear shot. There were a couple times while we were watching that I ended up missing some subtitles because he was so distracting.Laugh at the funny parts cheer at the epic ones clap after something amazing gasp at something shocking but please we dont need to hear your inner monologue for two hours.

11143643,0,t3_5ylts4,From an upordown critical assessment Ordinal Scale was not a good movie. The villains are really underdeveloped there are plot holes the size of trucks that arent adequately explained away the fanservice was poorly done and IMO the romance was pretty badly executed.As a continuation of the anime and a product for SAOs fans it succeeds spectacularly. Callbacks clever cameos nods and winks over common criticisms and giving everyones favorite characters time to shine were a pretty big factor in degrading other elements of the movie that would have made it more critically palpable. I enjoyed my time with the movie and would watch it again given the chance but Im also not going to be offended when this doesnt qualify for an Oscar.,swordartonline,dev4c9m,1,t5_2uikt

For instance the entire dialogue between Asuna and Liz in the beginning of ep. .  But then It may be I just like that type of humour.To parody doesnt mean that the source material is bad.

11688381,0,t1_dgkvqnm,Again though this is not what I meant. Make no mistake Canon SAO isnt a Harem Series and I know and accept this despite a small part of me wishing it could be otherwise. The main difference between SAO and others like that is that despite their feelings existing the girls ARENT actively trying to do anything to try and fight for them Like it would be in an actual Harem series or express them but they DO come to light every now and then because they cant help it. I and everyone that knows enough knows that KiriSuna is the only true pairing of the series and that Reki would never break them up but again my point is that this doesnt make the feelings of the girls any less real And to be honest most of the things I mentioned pointing out their feelings are extra material not directly shown in the published novels but that is still canon. The only exception to this rule with them all is Alice because...well I will leave that to your judgment later but believe me when I say that everything else I said its truth.Sidenote if you wanna give the Drama CD a good look its here someone was kind enough to put the audio with subtitles as a Youtube video And finally this may be one of the small aspects of the Gameverse I do like more than Canon. After all in that Universe you would need to be blinder than Kirito to not notice the girls obvious feelings XD,swordartonline,dgkw9bw,2,t5_2uikt
