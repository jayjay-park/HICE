7505475,0,t1_d2uc56g,Id advise against using cat  for the power transmission of the heaters. Assuming a V setup and a W cartridge which I believe is what the volcano comes with will draw between  and  amps. The power transmission rating for  AWG is about rd of an amp as per this admittingly conservative table When running multiple wires far power in a bundle like cat  does it gets even worse.While it may never cause any issues Id say better safe than sorry. ,voroncorexy,d2vc13o,1,t5_3e8gi
7536221,0,t1_d2ym73b,Not relying on layer adhesion for strength was the biggest gotcha moment for me. Just think of it as the grain direction in wood.  The position of the holder has been working out ok for me just because of the diameter of the spool. Plus its pretty slippery so its not causing kinks.

8428765,0,t1_d5v2j4a,I dont make the law I just follow it.If you only raise the voltage on your heatbed without changing anything else then yes it goes faster. However you are also raising the current quite a bit by doing so to levels that normally exceed what a RAMPS board andor its wires andor its connectors are capable of. If you simply put V into a V heatbed and call it a day your printer is a serious fire hazard if it works at all.Usually a V heatbed will have a higher resistance than a V heatbed to get the same heating power watts at that voltage. V heatbeds CAN be run over their rating but you need to make sure they can do so safely big enough wires connectors SSR if the heating current exceeds what the board can supply.,voroncorexy,d5v4xmx,1,t5_3e8gi
8460194,0,t1_d5thec1,It wasnt so bad. Printing parts now. Z motor mounts are done since they didnt change working on the Z rail mounts now that Ive finished wrestling my current printer. Silly thing didnt want to give in and make parts for its replacement I guess. Changes to go to  shafts unnecessary and against advice obviously were all of the shaft mounts and all of the bearing mounts. I had to move the screws that hold the X carriage ends onto the X carriage halves apart by I think a millimeter or so. Im also cheating and using Bronze bushings instead of real roller bearings.  diameter shafts from Mcmaster arent available in  steel just the regular stuff.Im keeping the metric hardware and the mm lead screws though.

8487354,0,t3_4vxsup,I think the leadscrews should be supported at the top with a ZZ bearing possibly using a similar bracket as the one for the Z rods if you are going to use any kind of flexible coupler...As ufuelter said this kind of mount is normally a hack for bent leadscrews or threaded rods that shows up as Z banding in the prints the better fix is to get straight leadscrews ,voroncorexy,d62gs4i,1,t5_3e8gi

8869020,0,t1_d7d88b2,Too late to fix your clog now but Heres my theory on why the retract happened im using the Gcode pastebin you posted further down to explain and how to fix itYou said you extruded a lot of filament to ensure your extrusions were right.Then you started your print.      Gswitches your machine to absolute mode. At this point your extruder position is at a very high value. e.g. you did  tests of mm extrusion leaving your extruder position at mm Now your print starts the first GCode that has extruder values in it     G F X. Y. E.requests the Extruder to move to position . which at this point means the Extruder has to retract about mm to reach that position.How to fix itInclude a     G E at the end of your start code. This manually sets the extruder position to  avoiding any retractsextrudes due to nonzero extruder positions due to moves that were done prior to starting the print.,voroncorexy,d7dxjpv,3,t5_3e8gi

9604901,0,t1_d9wh1wd,gt Stay away from the cheap MKS boards  they are known to have problems due to poor circuit layouts.The latest version of the Sbase . hasnt any faults in layout.The real problem with Sbase is that they are selling a closed source design based on an opensource one.By not publishing their design files they are essentially not giving back.Apart from that its currently the board with the best featurescost ratio. Speaking about quality it is totally different from  RAMPS boards as the solders are perfect and this is one of the few board that handles heat dissipation mostly correctly holes on the bottom and heatsink attached with screws and not with just thermal paste.tldr its actually pretty good but dont buy it if you believe in opensource or you need a proper customer service that can understand you language or at least English.,voroncorexy,d9x0152,3,t5_3e8gi

10055865,0,t1_dbi8rb3,Nice idea stall one side while the other moves... My method has been to put something between the bed support and the top Z brace and turning the rod by hand to ensure both sides are at the same distance from the top. Faster than dropping Z mm then back up That is really my only criticism of the VORON the bed will tilt if you put any pressure on the buildplate because each side can move on its own when unpowered. On a DBot this cannot happen by design and in fact autoleveling is largely unneeded there only auto z offset is useful.Other than that I love the VORON design and think I will love it even more once V. is installed. ,voroncorexy,dbiaxu9,1,t5_3e8gi

11577070,0,t1_dg867as,That is a very good point. But if you only drop it  then you can still achieve velocities of mms while increasing your accuracies. But if you are going for resolution there is no real way that you are going to get speeds of mms. And if you are going for that speed you are probably going to use a volcano end something like a .mm nozzle or larger. Yes there are times when speed is important but if you increase the resolution like on the z axis which doesnt move very quickly you can increase the speed that you are printing at. The speeds that I have been able to print at with my printers is somewhere around mms without sacrificing too much in terms of quality. it really depends on what you are looking for but if you can get the resolution closer to that of an SLA that would be awesome.,voroncorexy,dg89mhe,1,t5_3e8gi
