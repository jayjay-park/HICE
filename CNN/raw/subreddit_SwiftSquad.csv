1535286,0,t3_2be50p,Heyyyoooooo...  year old police officer from the US. Didnt realize how diverse this group was let alone rNoFap itself until this war. Started Nofap due to PIED and have been working at it for about six months now... Longest streak being somewhere around  days.Im currently on my th day of this streak and must say that being part of this war makes a huge difference. Checking in every day or two and seeing that Im closer to moving up in rank or adding some flair definitely gives me something to look forward to. Most of all being the competitive guy that I am seeing that Aquamarines remain at the top really makes me feel like relapse is impossible. I hate to say it but it might be the opposite if we were at the bottom.What do I hope to get out of this war? The satisfaction of knowing that at the end I will be fully involved in my longest streak and Ill be able to look back and say how quick the time went and how easy it was to be in control of myself. ,SwiftSquad,cj8q2ks,2,t5_32ooy
