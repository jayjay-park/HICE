122704,0,t3_1vhuge,Our doe had been getting huge and in the last week I noticed her udder starting to fill out so I knew birth was near. Of course anyone who owns goats knows that these things happen always at the least convenient moment so I assumed it would be this Saturday when we had an occasion . hours away. Today I drove into town to run errands when I get a message from my husband HOLY CRAP!!! Feta just had a baby!Evidently he had given the goats their morning hay she had started eating like normal. He stepped out of the barn for a few minutes came back and there was Feta nosing a justborn baby. Its her second birth and this was much quicker than the first one! My husband got her into the birthing stall with the baby where she proceeded to pop out another one. I came home just in time for her to finish cleaning them off so I could cuddle them.Mom and babies are doing fine and down for the night. They look just like their dad ,goats,cesejs4,7,t5_2qlyf

715838,0,t1_cglmn4i,They stick their heads down between their front legs and look through their back legs they have flexible necks and then their retractable penis pops out kinda like a cat penis and since its kinda angled forward its close to parallel with their bodies which makes mating easier they can spray themselves in the face. Its used for bolstering their buck stink which lady goats dig.Or they do it kinda like this,goats,cgln7a8,6,t5_2qlyf

When we all came out of the tent in the morning yup they slept in the tent they walked straight back out there and looked at the cold pit like we had taken their favorite toy away.

4355463,0,t1_csgelqx,You can give him some b in either injectable or liquid oral form which should help perk him up. Also vit ad injectable  you can inject or give it orally. cc of that. The B follow the dose on the bottle weight to pounds. Otherwise just keep on what youre doing and the advice youve gotten and I bet youll get him turned around in no time and growing like a weed. ,goats,csgldng,2,t5_2qlyf

7606709,0,t1_d36h061,Oh ok. I mentioned those breeds since you said that goats werent pets. Keeping a goat in an apartment would be a pretty stupid idea let alone raising one as an inside pet at all. Goats are relatively smart but I dont even know if you can train them to tell you they need to go out to pee like you can with a dog and as youve stated you certainly cant control them from crapping due to the way their digestive systems work as ruminants  the pellets just suddenly come out whenever they do. Ive also seen pictures and videos of young goats wearing nappies while they are inside but rest assured theres no way even those guys would spend most of their day indoors.From what Ive read about keeping goats as pets every article Ive seen on the matter places so much emphasis on the fact that you need two goats should you decide that you want pet goats because of the whole herd mentality thing causing them severe stress when they are the only one of their kind around and deciding not to get a pet buckling wethered is putting it bluntly a godawful idea with the scent glands and when in rut peeing on themselves and being extremely noisy since they want to get it on.,goats,d36ud4e,1,t5_2qlyf

Youll want a loose mineral  if you cant find a goat specific one then look for one made for buck deer. Ive had success with those. Youll also want to copper bolus routinely as Ive yet to find any mineral that will give you the copper levels you need. ,goats,d5jk0e7,2,t5_2qlyf

In the past I just put them in the cab of the farm truck because I didnt want to go through the process of putting the canopy on the back and its usually not that bad.  I showed up to pick him up and was confronted with this lb monster Saanen buck in full rut who just BARELY fit in the cab with me.  Even with all the windows down it was still a lungsearingeyewatering trip.  It also ensured that my wife would never ride in that vehicle again.,goats,dfmao06,4,t5_2qlyf
