1560407,0,t1_cjbbfdb,Opening up isnt really an issue with traditional lapstrake because as soon as its back in the water it seals itself back up again.  Thats why its traditionally been used in small boats and others that get pulled out of the water and put back in on a regular basis.,boatbuilding,cjbvbwu,4,t5_2vs20

2044569,0,t1_ckzp603,Yeah I like my job.  The view from the office cant be beat.. literally a million dollar view.  Boatyard pay in my area runs from about  to  an hour.  Your good attitude will go far.  For the best all around chance to learn Id pick a boatyard that builds boats as well as maintains them.Just working for a boatbuilder can be rather dull.,boatbuilding,ckzpke5,2,t5_2vs20
3776125,0,t3_33l6m7,I make wooden skiffs for myself and my sons five so far   Spira Tillamook Dory in final stages in the boathouse right now and I think you should make the kayak from luan.  I am confident that any tiny issues you might have using mm thicker ply can be easily dealt with on the fly and as long as the whole thing is being glassed or even just epoxied it does not matter of the luan is waterproof.  I kind of consider my boats quasidisposable  I can always make another and Ill probably get bored with them before they sustain existential wear and tear anyway.  Anyway there is always someone around who will take it off your hands maybe a young girl or boy who would be absolutely stoked to have their own boat. My next build is a  self designed crabbing skiff that I pull around the Chesapeake flats in front of my house to empty the crab traps.  It will be make of luan sides with a  bottom and I expect it to last  years the last one lasted seven and was outside the whole time then Ill make another.  If you have fun building it it will not be your last one.    ,boatbuilding,cqmpfkm,3,t5_2vs20

This is just a novel way to be entertained using the boat.It is a good example of how rugged glass reinforced wood and epoxy really is.It is also a testament to how hard it is to make money hand building wooden boats.,boatbuilding,d3ko3wt,3,t5_2vs20

8777404,0,t1_d72hrve,It will be about the same process as finding marine plywood but cedar might be a little more difficult to get locally. Surely someone would have it or maybe Cyprus is easier to get in your area. You would more likely buy the cedar as boards and cut it into strips yourself depending how big you need them. ,boatbuilding,d72ue5c,1,t5_2vs20

9485129,0,t3_5ap47b,It could be. Stainless corrodes happly without oxygen. Ive seen this damage on my rudder hinges but that was after  years. Im assuming they are not that old. Maybe contact the builder of your boat and ask if it is a common problem.Can you insulate the bolts with plastic bushings?If no current can flow there will be no electrolyses If not then put in new bolts  using isolating grease. Its not the best solution but its better than this. It is commonly used for stainless bolts in aluminium in outboards or aluminium boats. ,boatbuilding,d9i8utw,1,t5_2vs20
9872477,0,t3_5gq2ai,highly suggest you buy a set of plans from GlenL or another design house instead of using free plans on the internet.  GlenL has a forum and a community of builders and a lot of resources available including hardware and fittings steering gear prop shafts rudders etc.  A small investment in a set of proven plans should be well worth the money.  Look at stitch and glue designs including the Ken Hankinson collection.  FYI for a  boat capable of coastal cruising plan on spending at least K assuming you can find a good used outboard motor and decent trailer.,boatbuilding,daueo6i,5,t5_2vs20

10873462,0,t1_de1ezhf,Page  meaning the dagger board and rudder? To be honest I didnt follow the instructions there. I went ahead and created my own custom dagger board box and rudder.

11155125,0,t3_5z6ing,Dont get too wrapped up in type of fabric or folded vs. rolled.  Fiberglass is very flexible and it wont make a significant difference in the end result.  It only causes problems with very thick cloth or sometimes mat. You likely wont use mat with epoxy.The weight of cloth youre suggesting is fairly light and it should wet out quite easily with the right type of epoxy  what you want is a boatbuilders fiberglass laminating epoxy.  The thinnest commonly available stuff is the West Marine system but its rather expensive.I like using these guys  www.uscomposites.com.  Good prices and high quality resin.  Id also recommend you buy your fiberglass from a boat building supplier to avoid issues with coatings or resin compatibility.  Most of the time these arent a problem but for your first project youll want to eliminate potential sources of questions.Dont thin epoxy ever.  It can be done with acetone but it very much affects the strength of the final result and it isnt necessary... people having trouble wetting out the cloth are usually using the wrong resin or have it at the wrong temperature.Stitched cloth can be stronger if used properly than woven but for a small project like yours compared to say a racing sailboat it doesnt matter and very likely your plans are designed to use standard woven cloth.Get some extra resin and cloth and practice before you start glassing your project itll pay off.Check out tutorials here its a great resource ,boatbuilding,dewf6x6,1,t5_2vs20
11200934,0,t1_df0iqtr,As with marine ply I think that just relates to how structurally reliable the wood should be.If its exterior they will have used a waterproof glue. You can check by boiling an offcut for a few minutes in a pan of water.,boatbuilding,df1m1bq,1,t5_2vs20

11697237,0,t3_66wns5,Yes you can sand the deck and repaintgel coat. If I remember correctly the deck has a thin layer of gel coat over pressboard. I would recommend only going as deep as needed or filling the spider cracks with resin and painting over everything. Good luck!,boatbuilding,dglwf6h,2,t5_2vs20
