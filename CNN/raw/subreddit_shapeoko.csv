2896857,0,t3_2t8o9w,Rock maple was a traditional wood choice for wood type and fruit woods esp. apple and nut trees were used for woodblocks  the best were endgrain boxwood though these days Resingrave is used even  especially for highend projects. See if you can find an endgrain cutting board to cut up?You could try linoleum blocks and for small scale projects plastic erasers work well.,shapeoko,cnxdlcj,2,t5_30bgz
2924443,0,t3_2tmyy6,Thats the shapeoko . Although Ive heard its still good I think the shapeoko  is a huge improvement over the  and worth the couple extra hundred bucks.  The description is a little vague but it looks like you need some sort of controller a wasteboard and a router.  All of which would add up to the point where Id just order the shapeoko .  As for what you would need more specificallyController grbl shield and arduino uno Power supply v eBay ? Maybe? I dont remember?Router depends on what your machining... Id do a dewalt  as an all around router Waste board Ive been told that you can bolt it to almost any flat surface and it will work as a waste board. Edit fixed waste board comment. ,shapeoko,co0io85,2,t5_30bgz
