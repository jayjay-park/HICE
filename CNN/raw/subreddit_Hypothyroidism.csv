215226,0,t1_cf2y5p9,Well estrogen issues are more frequent in middleaged men AFAIK The problem with these symptoms is that they are so vague its almost impossible to pinpoint the cause.... I think I would test for every condition with similar symptoms anemia iron deficiency sleep issues maybe food allergies hypoadrenalism and since you mention dark circles under your eyes I would look into kidney problems and various electrolytes like sodium potassium and calcium levels.A small piece of advice I would give concerning weight gain since youre checking your calories intake is to make sure youre not taking a highcarbs and lowfat diet. Ive heard of many hypothyroid people who managed to lose weight once they cut their carb intake and replaced it with fat and protein. I believe this was because insulin is an anabolic hormone so taking carbs tells your body to start building and stockpiling. Far from a magic bullet but worth mentioning.,Hypothyroidism,cf2yivt,1,t5_2s0tv

581540,0,t1_cg5syz5,So even with the hassle of multidosing people still preferred it.    gt In any case in the new research Danish researchers conducted a doubleblind randomized crossover study  which is considered the gold standard format for research  of  patients. In the patient group  micrograms of the usual T dose was replaced with either  mcg of T or  mcg of T for  weeks.      So even though it was only  weeks fairly shortterm in terms of hypothyroidism treatment people found they still preferred it even though they most likely didnt even get fully optimised. Bear in mind it was a doubleblind randomized crossover study.     Ive just started adding T on top of my T three weeks ago and its miles better than before. I woudl suggest that if patients on just T feel below par they should trial TT. Its not for everyone but I would strongly recommend it to anyone.,Hypothyroidism,cg6diyp,2,t5_2s0tv

701597,0,t1_cgjkb6z,gt The normal FT range is about . to . ngdL. Yours is high. This would indicate hyperthyroidism. Per the lab report normal is between . and . which is far removed from your range of . to .. Ill have to read up on it. I was reading the result wrong my Free T is . which seems inside the range.This could be Hashis in the early stage. Hashis can initially make you go hyper but over the long term you can go hypo. Its not a given that you will go hypo but that is the tendency.I had high tsh  years back which is when I was started on levothyroxine and I assume I had Hashimotos from then or even before. Isnt it too late now to be early stage Hashis? also does the high T and borderline T mean that I should stop taking levo? Im not saying Id stop on my own but I want to know if it is urgent enough to expedite the referral to a specialist. I dont want to be taking wrong medicine.It looks like my Free T is normal.

Tell doc that you will immediately report any hyperthyroid symptoms that you notice. See if she is willing to work with you on dosage and testing to see how close to optimum you can get.

1557726,0,t1_cjbbn5i,Forgot to make one important point.  Because of the TSH feedback loop you can end up with LESS thyroid hormone while on medication than your own body was producing.  But you would never know this was happening unless you compared Free T and Free T before and after starting the medication.  This explains some of the other posts where people are saying they feel no different after starting medication.  Thats because for all they know their thyroid hormone levels T and T did not really change.  All they did by taking medication was lower their TSH.  TSH does not provide energy to the cells only T and T do.,Hypothyroidism,cjbj8zf,1,t5_2s0tv
1637534,0,t1_cjli10l,Yes I did look at the references. Key phrases in that article . athyreotic patients  referring to patients with no thyroid. The results do not necessarily translate for patients with thyroid tissue that is underfunctioning. . subset of patients  the fact is the majority of patients do fine on monotherapy. It is true that there is a subpopulation of patients who dont but this is no proof that T only treatments do not work. And none of this in any way establishes a mechanism by which elevated TSH interferes with T to T conversion. Conversion is dependent on deiodinases not TSH. The current thinking is that this subset of patients has a genetic polymorphism ThrAla causing abnormal conversion.,Hypothyroidism,cjlkqn5,2,t5_2s0tv

1872035,0,t3_2g171l,Those periods of sadness do sound hormonal. Is the onset sudden? I always thought I was just run of the mill depressed. But looking back I should have known or rather doctors should have known that laughing with your friends one minute and feeling like total crap the next isnt normal. But nobody bothered to ask. It was like Oh you are depressed here have some antidepressents.None of the antidepressents I tried worked for me. I suspect because it was a hormonal thing and drugs aimed at neuro transmitters cant fix your hormone levels.You can ofcourse try antidepressents if a doctor thinks that would be wise but dont be too disappointed if they dont work.It might not be other hormonal issues. The amount or kind of medication might just not be enough for you even if you were in the more strict range of fT and fT. Some people have to go over these ranges especially us since our bodies cant produce these hormones on demand when its needed. These normal ranges are for healthy people.Also I often made the mistake not to get tested when I felt bad but waited till I was feeling better since I just didnt have the energy to go to the doctor when I was depressed. Well problem is if you only do tests when you feel okay the tests will show that everything is okay. I hope you didnt make that same mistake.Also get your Vitamin B and D checked. I eat a lot of meat eggs milk products etc. and went into the sun reasonably often this summer yet my levels were abismal. Seems thats somewhat related to thyroid problems since many people here report these problems but I dont exactly know how. Low Vitam B and D can both make you severely depressed on their own. If they are low both at once it will be bad times.I have these bouts of depression very rarely now. Im pretty sure they are not worse. But they feel a lot worse. Its the contrast. Before I only knew depression now I know... well maybe not happyness but normal and man it suuuuuuuuuuucks to go back there again even if its usually just a day for me.,Hypothyroidism,ckeruuy,1,t5_2s0tv

That trip to a new doc found me hyperthyroid so he sent me to an endo. Endo looks over my history and says that doc  years ago did he test your thyroid? I said no. He said you didnt have panic disorder it was your thyroid  that doctor should have given himself the Xanax! Now when do you ever hear one doctor talk against another?

2031722,0,t1_ckx84at,gt Coffee?? haha For real.. I told him myself its like living in two different dimensions with him and I never know which one were in from one day to the next.If ever you find yourself in Albuquerque you can send me a pm and well drive the baristas up the wall with all the chatter.   And yes its like you start to feel crazy too theres so much cognitive dissonance. I remember that at one point I literally felt as if I followed him into hell. I think thats why the disorder is often misdiagnosed as bipolar it really seems that way until things stabilize. And for you unfortunately its like you have a window into his personal hell.  So its like you are now perpetually split between  worlds and one of them really really sucks.  And yet you remember this awesome person whos still in there somewhere.  You can almost build a beauty and the beast or jekyllhyde narrative out of it. His medical issues are certainly daunting.  In a way all bets are off till you know whats going on in his stomach because that seems so much like a time bomb... and hes apparently put up major blockades where thats concerned. What is it about medical folk that they never want to just go with their doctors instincts and follow up on things?!  I guess they know too much about conditions that looking possible truths in the eye is too scary? So are you saying that in a way hes using the hypo as almost an excuse to get around appropriate emotional behavior and slack with regard to certain things?  That does sound familiar too actually.  In a way you can almost chalk it up to again feeling like its such an energy expense getting through the day that the prospect of trying to work on the things that are awry because of the hypo seems like too much work.  But thats only how it feels in the beginning.  How old is he?  Because if he really adapts into a hypo lifestyle it is going to start permanently affecting his life.  The deeper he gets himself in the hole with it the harder it is to get out if that makes any sense again this relates back to conditioned reactions. Lupus is really nothing to mess around with especially if hes showing the rash.  Im about  criteria away from a diagnosis.  Pretty sure thats where Im going to stay but its always a concern because autoimmune conditions just creep.  I have a friend with full blown lupus and its pretty much changed her life. The big thing happened when she got sick and as a result of the lupus mechanism it turned into sepsis and damaged her heart.  At the age of  she had to have her aortic valve replaced.  Fortunately shes doing fine and is even a spokeswoman for a lupus organization now but as a result of the surgery she can never have kids and I originally met her on a trying to conceive website.  Anyway its a nasty disease and if theres a possibility that hes even close to qualifying for it then its better to know sooner rather than later. Its funny because I see it from both sides.  I understand the pain of having to try and push forward while in the hypo zone but I also know now that I have reached a spritely  yrs old that putting off dealing with the issues of it is really only going to make it more painful when he wants to take an interest in his life again. Another goofy anecdote.  Around the time my husband turned  still before I was diagnosed he convinced himself that he no longer needed his thyroid meds.  He had been told multiple times the mechanism of the disease and the reality that his thyroid was permanently damaged but he still insisted that he was feeling great and he didnt need to take his pills... as if they were merely some psychiatric drug that he had been using as a crutch.  By that point I was welleducated and tried to lecture him but he insisted and I didnt fight too much.  Well within a year he started getting achey nipples lol.  He finally asked his mom a pediatrician and quite insane in her own right and she said that it was a hormonal thing that normally happens to teen boys.  So using that I convinced him to see an endocrinologist.  Finally the endo starts lecturing him that he will need his meds likely in increasing doses for the rest of his life.  The look on my husbands face was priceless when the endo explained after checking his bloodwork that his prolactin was really high from having untreated Hashimotos and as a result he had started to develop mammary tissue.  If he had continued much longer based on his numbers he wouldve started lactating and wouldve needed surgery if he didnt want to have breasts for the rest of his life.  Husband hasnt questioned his need for thyroid meds since lol.  I guess that was a huge part of his wake up call.   Because you know being nasty grumpy and irrational  confusing arent too bad but god forbid youre a guy who develops boobs.,Hypothyroidism,cky2rl2,3,t5_2s0tv

Definitely go on yearly checkups with the endo even if your GP says your bloodwork is okay  they dont always know what to look for since Hashimotos can be sneaky and cause seemingly random things.Oh and at the GP definitely ask for full bloodworks every time youre starting to feel more off than normal. Might be that something in your blood test is off and you should be eating some extra vitamins or whatever.

I suppose she was already stubborn and suffering something like this seems to have just compounded it... shes the furthest from her normal self that Ive ever seen anyone and yet shes adamant that its fine. Maybe the thing that I can do is to try and show her the ways in which shes not fine remind her what she used to be like what she used to say etc. Not sure if itll be any more effective but I think its the next step she has to take whether she does it alone or whether I can help nudge her in that direction.Is something like hypothyroidism alright to leave alone until she accepts that it needs treating do you think? Is there a risk of more lasting damage if its left untreated for too long? And similarly is there a chance she might emerge a little from her current funk even while remaining hypo? Thats to say is she likely to snap back even if temporarily into a person I could more easily convince or will her current personality remain the same so long as shes hypo?I appreciate what youre saying about the damage to myself and the past few months have truly been hell for me but leaving her is not an option for me. I dont feel trapped in the relationship at all Im not staying in it because of any guilt for her Im staying in it because when shes herself she is the most amazing person in the entire world and even if I have to suffer alongside her for months or years Im prepared to so long as theres a chance the girl I once knew will return.,Hypothyroidism,cok7ryf,1,t5_2s0tv

3470380,0,t3_2zyat7,I would address my diet first.  Chris Kressor and Rob Wolf have a lot of information on disease and diet.  A lot of times we are eating healthy but not eating what we need.  A lot of Hashis people dont eat any grains at all.  Most of us believe that the protein in grain is attacked by our immune systems and the thyroid has similar proteins in it.  The immune system freaks out and attacks the thyroid too.  I also only eat Himalayan sea salt because I read a study that said excess salt that we eat makes the immune system more aggressive.  I also take Fish Oil Tumeric with Triple strength Curcumin Choline  Vitamin D a Probiotic and a Vit B  supplement.  I cut out as much sugar as possible.  I drink a lot of water.  I do yoga which I love although its somewhat painful.  I lift free weights when I am up to it I try for  days a week.  Head over to Facebook and check out some of the pages there for thyroid patients Hashimotos  Hypothyroid Mom For Thyroid Patients Only etc.  Lots of information shared over there.  Do you know if you have Hashimotos disease?  A lot of Doctors dont bother to test for it.Some good books to try reading The Root Cause by Izabella Wentz.  Mary Shomon books.  Look into Autoimmune Paleo.  A lot of people think we are eating foods that we are actually allergic to and that Autoimmune Paleo diet helps you through eliminating things that are making you sick.Some of this will work for some people but not for others.  At this point in the game you are where so many of us have been or still are desperate to try anything to feel better.  Dont let people discourage you from trying new things to feel better.  Many people say Gluten Free also Paleo and other diet changes are just a fad.  Thats fine they can believe what they want.  My boss told me people go gluten free because they want to punish themselves.  I dont want to punish myself but I am willing to do what I can to just feel like I have energy again.Hope you are feeling better soon!

5292688,0,t3_3ng1vq,If you dont you need a set of recent thyroid labs. Youll want TSH and most importantly! free t and free t levels. If you have no youll have both thyroid antibody tests done. On thyroid medication especially NDT your optimal TSH should be almost  t mid range and t in the upper  of the lab range. A positive antibody test doesnt really change how your treated but it can provide a lot of insight into why you feel so horrible. Sometimes if the issue is autoimmune then you need to make changes beyond taking replacement thyroid hormone to really feel your best. Your symptoms suggest you are very hypo even on NDT. Id say most patients feel better on NDT than levo or a t medication alone because NDT also has t in it. T is what your body needs to function. Some people have trouble converting from t to t. Discuss your symptoms in a way thats concrete for your doc. For example I have these symptoms and my goal is not always have panic attacks and mood swings or my goal is to have enough energy be able to enjoy cooking dinner again.,Hypothyroidism,cvo7au6,2,t5_2s0tv

Primary polycythemia aka polycythemia vera is caused by a bone marrow disorder where your body makes more red blood cells than it actually needs. Secondary polycythemia can be caused by smoking living in high altitudes lung disease like emphysemaCOPD sleep apnea and testosterone use.

7802132,0,t1_d3stnma,The LDN definitely makes me feel better.  My antibodies dropped from the s to the s but in the same time period I switched from synthroid to NDT and I was put on TRT so I cant say if it was definitely the NDT or some combination of everything else for my antibodies.I can say that NDT definitely helps suppress the hives.  Im on  different antihistamines and they make the hives tolerable but the breakouts did not stop until I got on LDN.  Ive had my refills run out a couple of times and when Im off it for more than  days the hives come back without fail.I have one major side effect from LDN it can be either good or bad it greatly reduces my tolerance for alcohol.  Sometimes it is nice instead of needing  drinks to get a buzz it takes .  Saved me a lot of money.  The downside is that the alcohol gets cleared out of my system really fast so keeping a light buzz is challenging.  And for some reason if I have more than  drinks I get an almost hungover feeling the next day whereas when I am not on LDN I can drink as much as I want and not have a hangover as long as I remember to hydrate.,Hypothyroidism,d3t0qq4,2,t5_2s0tv

Because if you do have hashimotos anyone please correct me if Im wrong I dont think it is curable just treatable and improvable lowering anti bodies and medicating. I think it can be common to become out of range in those vitamins and minerals as a result of hypothyroidism rather than becoming hypo as a result of deficiencies.On Stop the thyroid Madness it says to test for IRON because High Ferritin can point to inflammation but high Ferritin serum iron and saturation all three can point to Hemochromatosis a genetic mutation. High serum iron and low reffitin can point to MTHFR.It also says  MTHFR Mutation This tests your risk for having heavy metals which can stress thyroid and adrenals.Then on the website it also has a page for people who are LOW in IronBecause being hypothyroid can result in a lowered production of stomach acid which in turn leads to the malabsorption of iron. Additionally being hypo can result in heavier periods for women which causes more iron loss. Additionally chronic inflammation can lower our serum iron levels because it pushes iron into storage i.e into ferritin.Deficient Adrenal Support can point to Addisons Disease which is another autoimmune disease auto immune diseases are more common in people who have another autoimmune disease like Hashimotos. Adrenal Fatigue less severe Ive read can be a result of suffering from hypothyroidism underuntreated for a long period of time.Vitamin D same source says  Important for immune health can go too low with hypothyroidism like other nutrients.Thats my two pence sorry if it isnt very helpful,Hypothyroidism,d591he0,2,t5_2s0tv

This sounds like my life story before I went on naturethroid.THIS IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT FOR ANYONE WHO IS HYPOTHYROID TO READ.T is an anti depressant and since it needs to be converted by your body from T to exist it is genuinely possible that you are not converting enough t to t. I reccomend you go to your doctor and ask for either a prescription for  mcg of cytomel or  grains of naturethroid.I am also very similar to you diagnosed at  with hypothyroidism. Never felt right on levothyroxine had a low metabolism brain fog erectile dysfunction was cold all the time had no drive or motivation and was apathetic about life.I could lie and tell you things are  percent better now.

9101811,0,t1_d85uuy1,I dont understand them super well either. There are wikipedia links in the sidebar if you want to slog through some biology articles but I will give you my incomplete understanding.TSH is a hormone released by the pituitary gland that basically tells your thyroid how to do its job. If the pituitary increases TSH in your body it is telling your thyroid to kick it up a notch. If the pituitary decreases TSH it is telling the thyroid to take it easy for a while.In theory if you have hypothyroidism your pituitary gland realizes something is wrong and starts producing more and more TSH in an attempt to kick your underperforming thyroid into action. So high TSH iswas considered the big sign you had hypothyroidism.But high TSH isnt actually the problem. It is just a sign of the problem. The actual problem is that your thyroid isnt working hard enough for whatever reason so you dont have enough T and T in your system. Those are the hormones that originate from the thyroid and are actually related to the symptoms of hypothyroidism. If you dont have enough of them your whole body starts to slow down and feel sluggish and not work properly.So the problem with testing for only TSH is that you are just testing for a sign of the problem not for the actual problem. And in some people like me the pituitary drops the ball. Even though my thyroid was not working very well my pituitary didnt do anything. It didnt increase TSH in my system. So when my doctor tested my TSH everything looked normal. But when I went to a different doctor she tested T and T  to see if my thyroid was really truly doing its job. And it wasnt! My T and T were way too low and my antibodies were high which means my immune system was attacking my thyroid but that is another can of worms.So yeah testing TSH is usefulimportant but it only tells part of the story. Thats why testing for T and T and maybe some other things is also important.Like I said my understanding is kind sketchy so someone else here may have a better explanation for you.,Hypothyroidism,d85w45f,3,t5_2s0tv

I hang onto it and read as needed when grieving. I hope it helps. Alright here goes. Im old. What that means is that Ive survived so far and a lot of people Ive known and loved did not. Ive lost friends best friends acquaintances coworkers grandparents mom relatives teachers mentors students neighbors and a host of other folks. I have no children and I cant imagine the pain it must be to lose a child. But heres my two cents.I wish I could say you get used to people dying. I never did. I dont want to. It tears a hole through me whenever somebody I love dies no matter the circumstances. But I dont want it to not matter. I dont want it to be something that just passes. My scars are a testament to the love and the relationship that I had for and with that person. And if the scar is deep so was the love. So be it. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are a testament that I can love deeply and live deeply and be cut or even gorged and that I can heal and continue to live and continue to love. And the scar tissue is stronger than the original flesh ever was. Scars are a testament to life. Scars are only ugly to people who cant see.As for grief youll find it comes in waves. When the ship is first wrecked youre drowning with wreckage all around you. Everything floating around you reminds you of the beauty and the magnificence of the ship that was and is no more. And all you can do is float. You find some piece of the wreckage and you hang on for a while. Maybe its some physical thing. Maybe its a happy memory or a photograph. Maybe its a person who is also floating. For a while all you can do is float. Stay alive.In the beginning the waves are  feet tall and crash over you without mercy. They come  seconds apart and dont even give you time to catch your breath. All you can do is hang on and float. After a while maybe weeks maybe months youll find the waves are still  feet tall but they come further apart. When they come they still crash all over you and wipe you out. But in between you can breathe you can function. You never know whats going to trigger the grief. It might be a song a picture a street intersection the smell of a cup of coffee. It can be just about anythingand the wave comes crashing. But in between waves there is life.Somewhere down the line and its different for everybody you find that the waves are only  feet tall. Or  feet tall. And while they still come they come further apart. You can see them coming. An anniversary a birthday or Christmas or landing at OHare. You can see it coming for the most part and prepare yourself. And when it washes over you you know that somehow you will again come out the other side. Soaking wet sputtering still hanging on to some tiny piece of the wreckage but youll come out.Take it from an old guy. The waves never stop coming and somehow you dont really want them to. But you learn that youll survive them. And other waves will come. And youll survive them too. If youre lucky youll have lots of scars from lots of loves. And lots of shipwrecks.,Hypothyroidism,deuvwg5,10,t5_2s0tv
11166193,0,t3_5ze0tp,Dizziness is associated with the autoimmune response rather than your thyroid hormone levels and reducing your thyroid antibodies can help alleviate symptoms. Even if you T and T look good your antibodies may be very high.  Get your TPOAb measured and make sure you dont have an associated autoimmune disease like Menieres ,Hypothyroidism,dexocs6,2,t5_2s0tv
11237495,0,t3_60by5r,Personally I would call the doctor tomorrow morning amp see if they go ahead with her test Monday morning. You do need to see what her levels are off the meds. After that i would probably have her start the  or half for a wk then move up. Because of her reaction id be careful with it. Then I would find her a new doctor amp get an appt. asap.. I hope you grandma feels better soon! ,Hypothyroidism,df5r5si,1,t5_2s0tv
11257597,0,t1_df7vot6,Now your telling my story.  I was diagnosed bipolar at  now  and fibro last year at the same time as hashis.  Since Ive gotten on the right meds and the right doses for me I no longer have to medicate the bipolar or fibro. I dont even think I have fibro at all.  I think it was all hashi symptoms.   I found I didnt convert because on T meds even at mcg my T never raised and it actually made me feel worse.  I was bedridden for  months while my TSH was perfect because the doctor I had was an idiot.  Now Im on mcg of straight T and I feel like a teenager again.  My labs are perfect TSH fully suppressed and T in top quarter of range.  I also changed my diet No gluten grains dairy or anything inflammatory.  Ive lost lbs and am really healthier than Ive ever been.  Read around that page I linked above I truly believe finding that website and group changed my life.  Not everything there worked for me nor will it all work for you but its a starting point.,Hypothyroidism,df815cw,1,t5_2s0tv
11272281,0,t1_df9mjpv,g is a good goal. I think I will try for something like that. Now that Im back to feeling shitty when I eat too much of it itll probably be easier to skip the donut or whatever the temptation is. Any idea why diet soda makes you feel that way? I cant stand the taste of sugarfree sweeteners so I dont know how theyd make me feel. But Im intrigued by the different studies that come out about the dangers of diet sodas. ,Hypothyroidism,df9p36h,1,t5_2s0tv

11511512,0,t1_dg0sxhj,I havent taken LDN  I wish I could help more in that respect. But your other options are extremely drastic. I would definitely try LDN before surgery RAI or antithyroid meds.LDN is very safe but not without side effects. Ive heard some people not have an issues though. The main ones Ive heard are trouble sleeping and irritability. Conversely some have said their sleep improved.This is a good article if you want more info on LDN.There are tons of lifestyle changes you can make along the way that help lessen the imbalance in your immune system. Most practitioners suggest you start working on those as you add in the LDN.,Hypothyroidism,dg0ty6m,2,t5_2s0tv
11604916,0,t3_65dhr5,I take a low dose of Zoloft it helps make the mental health symptoms of having tsh levels off more bare able. I still am able to figure out when my levels are not right but the medicine helps me from getting too low in mood. I did take a break from Zoloft when my tsh levels were great but the balance didnt last long. I ended up getting in a deep depression for . months. Ever since that depressive episode I have decided its better to be safe than sorry. I dont plan on going off Zoloft anytime soon. Remember along with medicine proper sleep nutrition exercise and other forms of self care help to reduce depression and anxiety symptoms. Good luck. Hope this helps.  ,Hypothyroidism,dgbfdkt,1,t5_2s0tv

11737426,0,t1_dgqb17h,Yea I take regular t three times a day at around the same time within the hour. Its not an issue to be an hour late or even occasionally skip a dose But you will probably feel it. I would dose  times a day if you are taking regular t. It would be  times a day if it was time release t which is unnecessary and expensive. But Since it sounds like you have regular t then you should take  three times a day and then slowly increase the dose every couple of days by increments of mcg at the most and ideally lower like . mcg. So your doses would look like this day   day ... day  etc....The higher the increase the more days you should wait to up the dose.To get these smaller Doses you will probably have to break the pills. But  time release twice a day is like taking  regular  times a day.  but your proper dose might end up being lower. Everybody is different and the size of the person doesnt really matter,Hypothyroidism,dgqgtqq,1,t5_2s0tv
