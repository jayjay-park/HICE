6844392,0,t1_d0s3dqq,You know whats funny? I just realized how Flanderized Felicity has become and I never really thought about it until you mentioned it. But the writers really have exaggerated her hacking to the point where she can and will hack anything despite her being leery of doing it earlier in the show. And theyve made Oliver a tech moron instead of a guy who was capable of holding his own but wasnt as skilled as Felicity and deferred to her. A PTSD storyline would probably benefit her character I agree. She needs to be in over her head in a big way because shes with the likes of Oliver whos been trained by Shado and Slade Thea who was trained by Malcolm and Laurel who has at least had some training with Ted Grant. Not to mention she should not be doing nearly as well as she does with trauma. Compared to Oliver Thea Diggle and Laurel her life has pretty much been a cakewalk. ,CWArrow,d0s4955,5,t5_3d0ht

7185431,0,t3_4dnigl,Gotta say that was one of the best episode of the season and it was mostly handled pretty well but I still feel like killing Laurel off is a bad move especially since we already had Sara being killed last season. The stabbing with the arrow scene was also pretty weak considering we saw Andy shrug off being shot with an arrow earlier in the episode and it didnt even look like it went into anything that would kill her. If Oliver can survive a sword through the chest and falling from a mountain with penicillin tea and willpower it seems odd that that wound would kill her.

7636280,0,t3_4j456t,She got on my nerves as a oneoff last season but as a recurring character I cannot stand her. Its bad enough when shes used as bad comic relief but when they try to use her as a forced source of drama shes beyond infuriating to watch. The fact that she basically bullied Lance into probably losing his job and saying something along the lines of its what Laurel would have wanted when I cant even recall her even meeting Laurel was just horrible. Add to that the fact that she was mad at Lance for lying even when it had no affect on their relationship after shed just gone snooping through his things. Downright horrible character. As for being the normal one of the show Moira and Walter are great examples of how to make that sort of character work by giving them a certain level of maturity and making us feel sympathy for them due to being well written characters not simply because they arent in on the secret.,CWArrow,d3a7ami,2,t5_3d0ht

8175353,0,t3_4r9q3a,Overall I like the Huntress which seems to be the unpopular opinion! But I thought she brought an interesting dynamic as someone who has suffered through a traumatic life style as well as a very horrifying and traumatic experience. While she is nowhere near the degree that Oliver is it was nice to see Oliver be able to connect with someone that had a taste of what he went through no matter how small.There were parts where she was talking and it was slightly annoying but there have definitely been worse things! I wish she wouldnt have gone so far off the deep end though and she was able to be redeemed and brought back later as an ally to Team Arrow.Aside from the Huntress introduction episode was great. Humor is still spot on! Loved the interaction between Moira and Thea. It was refreshing to see Thea slightly growing up and not being such a whiny brat.Malcolm cutting Tommy off then just openly getting in his face about it and not giving him a way to earn it back helped show what kind of person Malcolm was.Overall great episode! One thing I noticed that I didnt pay attention to in the first few times I watched was the absence of the flashback scenes. It gave us a break and when they get back we dont feel so forced into watching them. Maybe using this type of style will be good to see in the future. But Im not sure how the Russia flashbacks will be!,CWArrow,d4zgvz9,5,t5_3d0ht
8190862,0,t3_4ri6vb,Flash vs. Arrow Directed by Glen Winter Story by Greg Berlanti amp Andrew Kreisberg Teleplay by Ben Sokolowski amp Brooke EikmeierIf there is one thing the DCWverse gets its the earnest joy of comic books. OK maybe thats a lil hard to find in the first half or so of Arrow season  with its best Mike Grell by way of Schumacher in terms of costuming impression. But as things lightened up and the weird was allowed to come in there is a joy to the adaptive process this story world runs DC through. Its one of the things that made Arrow so interesting for me at first was how they updatedchanged but kept things spiritually true. Thats entirely on display in Flash vs Arrow another entry in the eternal hero v hereo when they first meet trope. Now this was made before Cap Civil War which is probably the best cinematic rendition of this because they understood that the fight is juvenile and silly so they stripped Cap an Iron Man down emotionally to the point where you understood why they fought even as they as well as audience recognized the manipulation going on. But it didnt matter. Flash an Arrows battle is more akin to Thor an Iron Man going at it in the The Avengers. Havent mentioned BvS yet mainly because I think that movie is an utter pile of trash that thanks to the ultimate cut is saved from being a technical and storytelling failure. Now its just a storytelling one. Why do they fight? Yes Luthor plot powered machanations make it so and Bruce hates Superman but where is any of it earned? Where is the ideological discourse between the two poles of the heroic spectrum? There isnt any because their both murdering douer assholes one of which is made slightly more enjoyable because Scar is just snapping one liners.That thing the heroic spectrum something DCWverse built theirs in a single scene during The Flash Pilot. And they mark it further here and in the follow up The Brave and The Bold making sure everyone who wasnt watching Arrow understood that he is a herowho just goes about things differently. Not that Flash wasnt just as fascistic if not more so with the whole prison pipeline bit. Which is worse getting shot by an arrow or having your legal rights stripped from you? In constructing this both hereoes shows the universe is made better by eachother reflecting on one another. These episodes get what makes crossovers fun seeing characters who cant normally interact mingling. Diggle the resident straight man reaction to Barry is just perfect. I cant wait for him to see Supergirl fly in!On the titular fight man season  Flash set pieces were so good. Its the thing that really gave me pause along with a muddled operational naturenurture theme in season . It still had its moments but man season  they just had so many smartly cinematic setpieces. Side Note I actually liked the Batman  Superman fight because it was very clear an honest about how hollow and stupid the whole endeavour was. Which is an oddly self aware moment for a film series so far built on the hollow replication of comic book iconography.,CWArrow,d51eqpx,5,t5_3d0ht
8203621,0,t1_d52uwx7,Ive enjoyed all seasons of Arrow. My issues with Felicity is that in the back half of season  she came off very hypocritical. The whole Oliver has a love child story wasnt done well IMO. I think if she had been more understanding of Ollies position Id have been more OK with it. Add that to the fact that the wheelchair arc was basically used just to get her to dramatically and literally walk out on Oliver and it all just felt wrong. As with Felicitys family vs Tommys story in S heres how I see it Tommys story had to do with his relationship with his dad and with Laurel. And all of that could be tied back to Oliver and the overarching story of S around Merlin. In season  there isnt anything connecting Donna and Calculator to Oliver. Hes the titular character yet we have a bunch of family drama that in no way even comes close to him. And that makes me not want to cars about it. Not saying everything has to revolve around Ollie but make it at least somewhat interconnected. Also Donna is just annoying. Cant stand her. Oh just realized why is everyone so quick to forgive Calculator? He straight up ruined Roys life. I understand working with him out of necessity but cmon hes still evil. ,CWArrow,d530998,3,t5_3d0ht
8255673,0,t3_4s2zcg,When I finished watching season  and saw that he was with Waller off the island I thought they were going with Oliver being an Argus agent you could say they went with that but... first being put through training by Waller honing of his fighting skills linguistics field tech the stuff we saw him use as the Hood.Thatd be more or less S flashbacks while in the present hes making bigger strides to becoming a lighter hero on the flashbacks were seeing him being molded from the guy that went on the boat into the antihero he used to be. No need to link it to the current plot.S after a full year of heavy training and regular missions Waller impressed by his results places him in a protoTask Force X and assigned to track some conspiracy that would eventually lead to a deep cover assignment with the Bratva becoming a captain and all by the end of this flashback year hes pretty much his Hood persona.S After or during his time with the Bratva he finally figures out the meaning behind his fathers notebook while being utterly disgusted with the things Waller has made him do this flashback would have been him trying to get out from Wallers claws and settings things up to be rescued from Lian Yu bringing us full circle.,CWArrow,d59ikrl,1,t5_3d0ht

8566671,0,t1_d6b5k7d,I actually felt the opposite. Diggle is a man that strongly values loyalty and Oliver betrayed him and put his family in danger without even trying to convey that it was an actcover. I thought this was actually a sound character decision in real life a man like Diggle wouldnt let a friend an honorary brother off easy for such a betrayal. Oliver doesnt just pretend to destroy their friendship assault Diggles wife and endanger his daughter he then proceeds to abandon the team completely. Otherwise I agree hes great but sometimes the writers use him like a wet blanket.,CWArrow,d6cew7i,3,t5_3d0ht
8643174,0,t1_d6lwcp2,Meh. They didnt do too much with the resurrected Girder which is a shame because there was potential but it did tie thematically with Iris. Since Barry and Tony were both infatuated with Iris and when Tony came back to life he was trying to find her. Just like when Barry came back from the Speed Force and in general he would always come back to her. Plus throughout the episode we had Barry having to accept and develop that bad things were going to happen and he had to move forward. What better way to illustrate that then by bringing back Barrys old bully whom Barry seems to have forgiven judging by his final line to Zombie Girder by helping him find peace. Plus I think we can all agree that all the villains or freaks of the week really more of a Smallville term IMO are better developed than Enchantress from the Suicide Squad movie which I enjoyed but was far from perfect.

10056979,0,t3_5jn1v8,People here are complaining that Barry is trying to change the future and how he should have learned his lesson on time travel. I think theyre forgetting a few things. First it doesnt look like Barry is using time travel to alter the future. He is using what he saw with Vibes help to predict the events he saw and prevent them. So this is different. Second everyone seems to be applying armchair logic to an emotional situation. Barry accidently learned that the person who he loves more than anyone could die. There is almost no one who would stand idly by and do nothing to prevent that. Its like Olivers speech to Barry during Invasion about how trying to save his parents was a completely understandable mistake that anyone would make. Barry loves those around him almost too much and would do anything for them. This is a constant character aspect of Barry that will never go away. Third remember SavitarsAlchemys prediction that someone would die. Barry has recieved confirmation from another time traveler that someone he loves will die and he then witnessed Iris death in the future by the same person who predicted a death. Given his love for her and the available evidence hed have to be completely heartless to take no action to save her even if it wont change anything. Even Oliver Queen hardened as he is would take action here. ,CWArrow,dbig63s,1,t5_3d0ht

As long as they write it well and provide ample stories so we see development I will be happy. I also understand that people really want Dinah Laurel LanceDinah Drake to be the only BC because that is how it is in the comics and to that I would say just wait and see what they have planned. Titles and mantles are thrown around the DC Universe so much I mean like  different people have been Batman weve had a different GA so it is within the realm of possibility to give it to another who knows maybe well see the other in a future comic story.Onto your evidence! The first link didnt work it said the profile or post didnt exist so I wasnt able to follow that up. But from what you said I think rumors were a big calling to how all of this gets started for sure and then speculations run!The leaked script like you said provided more for just rumors. Now I dont understand a whole lot about show business or what these producers have to do to keep the real show from leaking out but this point does make me wonder. Im sure they wouldnt let something as scandalous and as big as this simply leak.The next one that was a part of the comment chain from November I think got mixed up in the whole thing. It seems that he didnt believe KC was filming for  which we know for a fact shes in. Could just be that it was from November and he had not heard anything yet but could not be.The one compelling thing though is the actual blog post with the pictures. That one has pieces that I can certainly believe because it sounds like he was there on set and trying to get a big scoop. However that could prove to be unreliable too but that one is the one that makes me question the most.The other interviews and QampA from SA do sound cryptic and for good reason. Either bringing in a new BC or making Black Siren the new BC is something that needs to be hidden so saying a BC is much better than saying the BC.If any of that sounded like a downer I apologize! I certainly didnt mean it that way and was just interested in finally hearing why someone thought that Tina would be the new BC! You brought up some great evidence and I think itll be interesting to move forward. I like this kind of speculation because whether youre right or wrong it was a fun thought and its what these breaks and rumors are for! So looking forward to seeing it!,CWArrow,dccju8e,0,t5_3d0ht

10514514,0,t1_dcz6j4n,This rift will be interesting to see and I wonder how far well see her try to go to get Prometheus. But I also think this is where a lot of Oliver standing up to Felicity which is something people desperately want even though it happened in this episode will happen.I think the use of LaurelBlack Siren is going to be a long play. Well see her get a bigger redemption towards the end of the season. Or maybe next season when something bad happens. But I definitely think we have to be patient for this so it doesnt seem like Black Siren throws out  years of being a bad guy just randomly,CWArrow,dczxl24,1,t5_3d0ht

10687202,0,t1_ddhdnge,Fair enough but hardly is still some! Plus he says the Arrow suit so does he mean the old one or the GA suit? Or is it considered the same?,CWArrow,ddiazw1,1,t5_3d0ht
10705521,0,t1_ddjv6am,yep I think it be great to see a different way to fight crime that require his other identity. ,CWArrow,ddk70rl,1,t5_3d0ht
10731548,0,t1_ddmv37h,If you look at a picture of the two next to each other it doesnt seem so unlikely. Prometheus isnt as big as people say and Talia isnt as skinny as people say. I think she would be able to fit the suit and I think that we are going to see her in present day very soon. ,CWArrow,ddmvnic,1,t5_3d0ht
10748478,0,t3_5tfb50,Prometheus didnt know it was Oliver until that drug lord guy at the start found out and Prometheus killed him ,CWArrow,ddomg9s,1,t5_3d0ht
10991667,0,t1_decnjv9,I think the opposite.   The show has so much depth and diversity it cant fit it all in an episode.   And thats great.Thats what made later seasons of st tng so great.  They would have an episode focusing on one or two of the many characters instead of trying to cram them all in.,CWArrow,dedvcp8,1,t5_3d0ht
11098293,0,t3_5yatuj,I thought this was one of Flash season s better episodes. Im interested in Savitar for once.Legends was great too. It was hilarious how Nate and Amaya were trying to bang the whole episode. Sad there wasnt Arrow easily the show Im most hyped for besides Shield. Next week tho!,CWArrow,depzcwn,1,t5_3d0ht

11425737,0,t1_dfqvvc0,I watch it half heartedly. It has a lot of funny actors but Alan Tudyks character is written as a real try hard. Super  annoying. And Vanessa H is just sort of cloying.  Bums me out because I love the premise and want to like the show. Its just not that funny. ,CWArrow,dfr3ggv,2,t5_3d0ht

Manu jumped on that and accused them of using old ADR recordings. If this isnt a PR stunt its pretty much screwed him over for any possible return after this point in my eyes.,CWArrow,dg8jcz0,1,t5_3d0ht
