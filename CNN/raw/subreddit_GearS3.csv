10030947,0,t3_5jchy9,This is not an affiliated link Im not getting money from it. It is out of stock but you can still order for that price and get the watch when available.,GearS3,dbf25k3,1,t5_3hp1l
10101500,0,t3_5kap7d,I had the same issue a few weeks ago. It does not have samsung pay on the phone shipped international version. You MUST buy it in a country that supports it. I returned my watch and im on back order for a US version that will have Samsung pay.I did everything trying to get the app on the watch GPS spoofing flashing new ROMS etc. nothing worked. ,GearS3,dbo8lfd,1,t5_3hp1l

10803167,0,t3_5udw78,I believe that TMobile will let you buy the watch with payments. Motorola has done this for a few years now as I was able to buy the st gen Moto  with nothing down and some low payment a month. I believe I also had about  year to pay it off for interest free financing. I dont know of any place doing tradein offers but those are normally nowhere close to be in favor of the customer anyway. Better off just selling it on Ebay. ,GearS3,ddu9qxh,1,t5_3hp1l
10970056,0,t1_debh671,I put in my current altitude and the next day after going to work and back its way off again.,GearS3,debhfb8,1,t5_3hp1l
11001641,0,t1_deewrcg,Unfortunately I dont think you have many options when buying a smart watch they are basically all a little bulky compared to regular analogs.. ,GearS3,def059d,1,t5_3hp1l
11012736,0,t1_deg9akh,Right but I think they tried to improve upon that by making it so that the pin was only needed if the watch had been taken off rather than for every payment. I think the Apple Watch does something similar due to Apple Pay.,GearS3,deg9gxt,1,t5_3hp1l

11391906,0,t1_dfn8zgn,Good. I found it an odd method of updating but since theyre doing both the apk on the phone and the watch update it has to be two step. The message at the halfway point about relaunching the app on the phone after it is updated should have been more clear that manual checks for the next part were required to finish the process.,GearS3,dfn97te,1,t5_3hp1l
11456395,0,t1_dfol84g,You cant turn that buzz off when it disconnects from the phone but if your watch and phone are disconnecting that often just set mobile networks to always on turn Bluetooth off and use a remote connection. Battery life will take a hit but youll still get notifications and no connectdisconnect alert. ,GearS3,dfukomn,1,t5_3hp1l
11539997,0,t3_64pk2u,The barometer cannot be calibrated  you only get the raw readings. It may be a bit off mine is  hPa off from the nearest weather station reading a city over but where does your experience come from?If the altitude is correct then the barometer should be as well. The altitude is after all just the barometer reading with a localish weather data factor applied to it.Your device could theoretically have a defective barometer but if the pressure is over  hPa off then the altitude reading should be putting you somewhere under the tectonic plates when calibrated.,GearS3,dg426zf,2,t5_3hp1l
11551204,0,t3_64u4rm,You must not get a lot of notifications. Ive been off the charger since AM... currently  PM...and notifications have used  of my battery. Hmmm... ,GearS3,dg5bywl,2,t5_3hp1l
11635159,0,t3_65ztjk,The sensors are extremely simple so its unlikely that its crappy tech. Some users have difficulty getting readings but the readings themselves are extremely accurate. Are you sure its tight enough?Also when did you measure ? Were you very relaxed at the time? Thats a low resting pulse and it might as well be the fitbit that is missing beats while reading.The Gear shows you the readout curve if you manually ask for a HR reading  you can see if it appears noisy. If so it might have difficulties getting a clear readout. Try repositioning it or tightening the strap.,GearS3,dgeuwfw,2,t5_3hp1l
