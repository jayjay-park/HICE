5887726,0,t3_3v8imz,Boy that TV was an interesting creature.   Pity the customer who bought them.  Most projection sets use three specialpurpose extrabright Black amp White CRTs and a lensing system with color filters to make the final picture.  GE took a normal CRT from a portable  color set drove it extra hard to get more brightness and a single lensing system mounted in the space below the VCR to make it cheap to produce.  Brightness when new was subpar and went downhill from there but hey big screen! But they cost as much as the other normal projection sets making for a huge profit margin.  They all burned out their CRTs rather quickly.  Yes the VCR was an Optional Extra Accessory and cost as much as the TV.,vintagetelevision,cxrexp3,2,t5_3b3im
