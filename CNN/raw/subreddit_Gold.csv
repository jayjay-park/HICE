371341,0,t3_1y258u,the first element to be extinct? this doesnt even make sense. all of the silver mined on our planet is still on our planet. its not like it was put in a rocket and sent into deep space it is just scrap in a garbage heap somewhere. Helium on the other hand actually does leak into space and actually might be one of the first elements to go extinct on our planet. hydrogen also would leak but it bonds with other elements to make heavier compounds,Gold,cfj96od,1,t5_2qmqp

4189715,0,t1_crxkyno,What does retail gold mean? Are countries going to stop selling bullion?Edit finished the article. Sounds like marketing hype. They talk about gold repatriation but offer nothing solid about gold not being available. I bought a gold Philharmonic within the past  days and theres plenty of gold available if you have the money. ,Gold,crxtssr,7,t5_2qmqp
4455123,0,t3_3c0mwr,I am not sure what to make of this. The coin is ugly. It could be a way to make a quick buck out of the gold they looted from Mosul. And I would hate to see if these assclowns manage to get bullion dealers higher up on the watch list for terroristfinancing. Halfbaked stuff like this may provide a perfect excuse ,Gold,css91sw,1,t5_2qmqp
