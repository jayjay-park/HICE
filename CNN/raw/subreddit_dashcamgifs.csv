It was kind of a squirrely thing to handle at speed and one time on the highway I unexpectedly lost control just like this guy except I managed not to spin out. I was incredibly lucky that there were no other cars around even though there was moderate traffic on the road in general. The car pulled badly out of nowhere from a gust of wind I think and veered across two lanes before I could recover.

11643890,0,t1_dgfnjif,Struggling to figure out your scenario here remember in my situation we drive on the left so overtaking by default is on the right.Firstly  travelling less than the speed limit doesnt make you a jerk straight away if youre in the slow lane NZ left US right on a multilane road.Next  in NZ its legal and quite acceptable to pass in either lane if youre in a marked lane of your own. As I said earlier. So its quite legal to undertake if youre in your own lane slower vehicle in the fast lane  NZ right US left.  OP Video shows a motorcycle attempting to undertake without a marked lane and I expect the motorist didnt see the bike nor did it expect to find another vehicle in a space that was not configured for it by way of lane markings. So the maneuver wouldve been illegal in NZ but also I think the motorcyclist was morally wrong regardless assuming malice on the part of the motorist is pretty harsh.,dashcamgifs,dgfuk5b,3,t5_2yoxz
11709325,0,t1_dgn9rb9,Elementary my dear ugellis.The vehicle was moving along. That is not in itself proof that the vehicle was in drive it could have been coasting in neutral. However the video appears to show the vehicle cresting a hill without slowing. That is how I deduce that the vehicle was in drive.Further the door the child fell out of did in fact open whilst the vehicle was in motion. I suppose its possible a malevolent driver may have seen the child he despised playing with the door and shifted the bus into neutral with perfect timing to eject her but that seems like an extraordinary series of events to me.No Occams razor tells us that the simplest solution is probably the most likely. Given that the vehicle was in drive for at least most of the video and the door was opened during that time one must assume that the vehicle lacked a functional safety mechanism to prevent the rear door from being opened while it was in drive.Well more likely preschool I suppose. She is only .,dashcamgifs,dgna5g2,19,t5_2yoxz
