10393600,0,t1_dcm61ov,Yeah GeorgeLee has never been as common as I would have liked. I think maplemahogany wrote some longer fics but I lost track of them when The Quidditch Pitch site got taken down a few years ago.For RonDean the only one I can think of off the top of my head is Potters Law by vanseedee who now that I think of it might have also written some GeorgeLee. It was part of an LJ fest a few years ago  hereOther than that I wrote this long beast back in the day lol,HPSlashFic,dcm6ity,1,t5_3imc1

10849763,0,t1_ddxihn4,Text Talk is one of the more unique AUs out there the writing is so incredible and funny. I go back to it every now and again because its very easy to reread. Ive added Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda to my goodreads and amazon wishlist! It definitely sounds like a good I would be interested in thank you!,HPSlashFic,ddz2raq,1,t5_3imc1
11251419,0,t3_60dsu5,Okay I just browsed my bookmarks and there are only three mpreg fics that made it onto my yes list and one of those is an abandoned WiP that probably would have used the mpreg idea in a more plotty complex fashion further down the line but well never know.All three selections are SnapeHarry.Negative Irrational Multiplication by florahartThe mpreg takes place offstage except for a coda at the very end and the fic is mostly an excuse for banter and sweary Harry and SnapeHarry misunderstandings and Hermione being ridiculously knowledgeable. Its very dialogueheavy and mildly cracky and highly entertaining.A Bittersweet Potion series by alchemia and buglandNow mpreg doesnt even make it onto the list of the first  reasons why you should read this massive fic. Its a tiny plot element among a multitude of them and the pregnancy results in a miscarriage. But everything around this part of the story is inventive hilarious dark and addictive. This is the unfinished WiP I mentioned which is something like five books long funny harsh disturbing and incredible. Also very AU.Epilogue for Lilys Eyes by persepolis the sequel to Reconciling Lilys Eyes a brilliant fic full of deadpan humor OOC Harry and very fuckedup Snape. The sequel has mpreg in it and the effect can only be truly appreciated once youve read the original story. Both fics have some of the most hilarious and grotesque sex scenes Ive ever encountered in fandom. This is definitely not Snape the Slytherin Sex God. But it is Snape with a bun in the oven.,HPSlashFic,df7bydr,1,t5_3imc1
11718122,0,t1_dgo769y,gt and focus on transforming the narrative from a diversity standpoint though one could argue that straight women writing slash is not progressive whatsoeverIm sorry but I wish people would stop trying to score points off each other by raising up progressiveness and social justice as the standard by which fanfiction matters. Some straight women write slash only because they find those characters hot and more power to them. Some actually care about representation. Neither of those things makes their fic necessarily better or worse and the expectation that slash written by straight women somehow deserves a dismissive parenthetical sideswipe bothers me.Since fandom demands credentials these days Im queer but I write slash because particular characters get their hooks into me and compel me to write stories about them. Its an emotional and creative interest Ive never focused on transforming the narrative from a diversity standpoint as a reason to write. If other people do thats great but it doesnt mean their fic will be something I want to read and it doesnt equate to quality or legitimacy.As for the tropes mentioned EWE bonds Aurorfic and slavefic all cross ship lines in my experience. I havent read widely in SnapeLupin but I dont recall running across a noticeable amount of slavefic there. That may have been the writers I gravitated to though. And Severitus is a specific form of Raising Harry that used to be fairly popular although I think that impulse has faded now that Harrys grown up. Veelafic does seem to crop up in HarryDraco a lot mostly I suspect because fans romanticize Dracos blondness as a sign of Veela heritage. Creaturefic of all kinds makes the rounds but Veelafic is a special case.Im definitely here for the characterdriven narratives although Id amend romance to relationship because my favorite pairings fall along the lines of SnapeHarry and SnapeDumbledore and the emotions between them are generally fraught and dysfunctional. Plotty fics are fantastic if the characters are nuanced and thoroughly explored but yeah I dont see those as often and Im not so good at writing plots myself.,HPSlashFic,dgoa0u9,1,t5_3imc1
