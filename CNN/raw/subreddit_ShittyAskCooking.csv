6050521,0,t3_3ye5oo,Serious answer to a shitty question I worked at a cafe in college. I had a shaved head I mean like shiny Bicbald and a short beard.The uniform included a hat or hairnet. One day I forgot my hat and despite not having any hair for it to cover I was made to wear the hairnet. Nobody ever asked me to wear a beard net though.,ShittyAskCooking,cycq56x,2,t5_2tccd
