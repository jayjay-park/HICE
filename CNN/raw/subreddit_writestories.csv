1255248,0,t1_ciatom6,Thank you for the help the wording is a bit raw.  However it felt as if my story line was coming out better I wanted to put a but there.  Seemed a reasonable time to throw one out for a good critique.I caught the color thing as well its just awkward.  This may sound weird but it was left in so I had to keep rereading it.  Could you elaborate on why is it just the word flow.  It feels as if the mind while drawing an internal pic of the helicopter has to go back a step and gets annoyed...Also the buts yes it may be a genetic defect I feel compelled to it.edit I counted  sentences that start with but.,writestories,ciatwns,1,t5_32877
