3970703,0,t1_cr88i0u,FYI they make one designed for bowfishing its only got the really stiff bristles in it.  I know several people that have one and like it just fine. ,Bowfishing,cr8w61l,1,t5_2shqz

9008524,0,t1_d7unr6d,AWESOME Thanks for the info. I kinda figured it was all about temperature like it is in the Spring. Just wanted to make sure. I dont know any experienced bowfishermen so Ive just been trying to figure this sport out by reading online which there isnt much material honestly. ,Bowfishing,d7uom9d,1,t5_2shqz
11302283,0,t3_5sm8bm,Yes currently have  removable light rails on my Ranger RP  one on port side one on starboard. I used to  square tubing. wanted something i could lean on or put a foot on or if im pulling up a big fish over the top dont have to worry about it collapsing. plus it looks cleaner than pvc. im a piss poor welder so i had it commissioned by a local shop for about  which frankly i thought was decent considering the work and the angles. ,Bowfishing,dfd3i6s,1,t5_2shqz
