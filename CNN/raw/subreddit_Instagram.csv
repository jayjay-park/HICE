2498768,0,t3_2o7fy5,Joining instagram really beefed up my ability to take in and appreciate the beauty around me.  Things Id seen every day of my life suddenly became special when I could capture them enhance their loveliness and then share them with other people.  Maybe you could channel that as well.  Live your life but really take in the details.  I totally get the But my life is so meh sentiment.  Ill admit I feel that way more often than I dont but I think for most of us if we look hard enough theres at least one tiny moment of magic or at least contentment within a single day.  Does anything strike you as particularly pretty or interesting?  Whats lifting your spirits a little today?  It could be as simple as a cup of coffee.  Take a picture of it and post.  Also I believe it was you that expressed some admiration for the look of my feed so heres an extra tip  I edit almost all of my photos with an excellent app called VSCO.  I can take some really boring pictures sometimes but if I run them through VSCO.. the difference is huge. ,Instagram,cmkq6xx,3,t5_2seh9

6285336,0,t1_cz41l9o,Ive noticed that sometimes some hashtags get....overrun by porn and Instagram tries to clean it up. When I noticed it...I could only view the toppopular pictures in the feed but not the rest. So if one or more of the hashtags you are using is being blocked people wouldnt see your picture. If you notice the above check them again in a few days. Sometimes Instagram will reopen them once clean. Unless its a specific pornsex one that is fully banned and not temp blocked. Other than that Im really not sure. I guess...it is a bit time consuming but...check ie. look it up and have a look at the feed the hashtags you are using. If they are blocked cant see any pictures or only the top handful make a note of it and dont use them. Also especially with generic hashtags some are just overrun by spamadvertising. I know if that happens I dont look at that hashtag any more to give out likes so...maybe there are just less people looking. Try experimentingvarying hashtags and see if that helps you get more likes? ,Instagram,cz42ll2,1,t5_2seh9

6355288,0,t3_42nqn1,Im not sure. It sounds cool and it could be done but unless someone made this their pet project or instagram pushed them it just wouldnt happen. Theres bigger ways to pull this off.Valve in particular had a huge online scavenger hunt puzzle campaign thing coming up to their portal two release but they didnt need Instagram to necessarily do that. Lots of loose domains and hidden pictures. Valve are so good at that shit fans have their own rabbit holes for Half Life and Black Mesa it gets to a point where you kind of cant tell what is and isnt official.I reckon keeping it all contained to an app would run the risk of the event feeling like an advertisement and knocking out the shrouded enigmatic mystery of it all with busy work for the consumer. I feel like Im overturning rocks when I find a link to an obscure site that has a background of feint text I have to extract and contrast boost showing a password for elsewhere that unlocks a part of a picture of a companion cube on the moon. On the other hand if that was a bunch of images on instagram accounts Id feel like Im on some premade campaign and theyre also kind of limited by the platform.The flaw in my argument is average Instagram users are nowhere near as tech savvy as Steam usersgamers.,Instagram,czc0ymv,2,t5_2seh9

The main account was the one everyone new about. It was tied to all my other accounts Facebook specifically and then the second account was not. Until I mentioned the second account on the first account nobody knew about it.

9534269,0,t1_d9nu8jd,Thank you so much it means a lot! Warning this will be a long comment. It was a lot of work lol.ampnbspThe first and most important step in this whole shot was definitely being on the th floor of an apartment building balcony at midnight near a large river  the strong wind kept the storm sufficiently far away that I didnt get rained on at all and that I could see most of the bolts as well as the whole cloud structure pretty clearly.ampnbspIts a composite with  frames each at mm on a crop sensor with ISO f at  seconds on a tripod with remote shutter release. I was basically taking a bunch of frames to see exactly which anglescene would cover the largest part of the storm which gradually moved toward the right of the frame and when I found a good spot I just sat there clicking away repeatedly pressing the shutter. Maybe half of the shots I took had any visible part of the clouds lighting up about a third of them had good streaks visible.ampnbspProcessing first I found a good setting for one frame I wanted to use in Lightroom that gave me what I wanted in terms of shadows highlights temperature dehaze etc. Copied those settings and applied to each relevant frame. Made slight adjustments to each one to bring the temperature of the bolts roughly equal  you can tell I didnt do a great job of this because the color of some boltsclouds is slightly different than the larger ones thats something Id like to fix later.ampnbspThen I imported each frame into Ps as a layer and adjusted each layers brightness so that they were roughly equivalent across the board. For all frames above the base frame I used the Lighten Blending mode. Apply layer masks to each of those frames and paint the mask entirely black so that none of the top layers interfere with the base layer. Use brush tool to paint sections of the layer mask white allowing that section of the layer to lighten the base layer  and only color the portion of that layer which contains the lightning and cloud illumination from that shot. Then youll start seeing different lightning strikes filling in your base frame gradually as you reveal more and more.ampnbspThe hardest part lies here  because between frames the clouds are moving pretty quickly and if lightning strikes in the same region of the frame in two different shots it will be illuminating different clouds so you have to be careful to not overlay conflicting cloud structures this makes it look more artificial. You can see evidence of my failing to be extremely careful with this if you look closely enough some clouds just look weird. Adjust brightness of layers to keep conflicts to a minimum and try to keep adjusting lower layers as you go to maximize uniformity throughout the overall image. ampnbspThen after all the lightning layers are in place where I want them and with their custom adjustments I do one more curve adjustment layer above the whole stack to help make them more uniform and another brightnesscontrast layer. I tossed in a photo filter that didnt end up making a huge difference.ampnbspHope that answers your curiosity! There are tutorials online that help but I found them to only be useful for up to a few bolts that didnt have major conflicts  this was a slightly different beast lol. Let me know if you have any questions.,Instagram,d9oaqgg,1,t5_2seh9

I believe to save on data use or similar instagram downloads the image of your following list when you open it. When you change it it would update until you manually refresh it.

10980667,0,t1_decc3ug,The scary thing is that I DID create a separate email AND a separate facebook account for my more offbeat IG account.  What appears to have happened is that they went through my cell phone number contact list.  I feel this was the case because many most of those IG accounts that IG offered for me to follow are NOT my fb friends.  They might have looked through my Gmail address list as well or instead of my cell phone contacts.  Im on Android and I had my real Gmail account signed in.  But either way is WAY TOO INTRUSIVE and could lead to bad things happening for those who have shall we say kinky interests.  My interests arent kinky but its an area of photography that has its detractors.  And for some people this situation could result in a loss of business.  ,Instagram,decmh6l,1,t5_2seh9

11234757,0,t3_60c68j,Yes Ive been getting this from a few people as well.What I would recommend is Change your password ASAP Enable two factor authentication if that is an option on your account Then visit  on a desktop and remove all apps that are there just to be safeWould also suggest changing the passwords on any other website that you use the same password on. Likely either an app that has been compromised or you reuse the same usernamepassword on another site that was compromised. ,Instagram,df5g051,4,t5_2seh9

11555340,0,t1_dg5sm5s,I wish I knew the exact answer that caused my ban to be lifted but I can say that ceasing all activity had no effect for my account.I believe that changing the way I used hashtags stopped the Instagram spam filters from seeing my account as a bot. Now that I look back I have  posts that all have the exact same hashtags in the exact same order certainly makes it look like a bot!If over the next few days we see other account having their bans lifted then perhaps Instagram have finally listened and stopped using this technique but if you have a shadowban then I would recommend trying the hashtag approach that worked for me ,Instagram,dg5svc5,4,t5_2seh9
