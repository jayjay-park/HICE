2024804,0,t1_ckx2jsr,Whats the difference between the multistream card and the single stream then? Is it just that I only need  card to record  channels? I was hoping for on demand my parents have access via their tivopluscablebox...I dont really want the cable box but if thats the only way to get on demand Ill have to ponder which feature is more important,Tivo,ckx71uz,2,t5_2s84p

5589801,0,t3_3rc3qv,I use a powerline adapter which goes right into your electrical wiring rather than your coax cabling.  I live in an old house that requires cabling to be done on the exterior of the house which I wasnt interested in doing.  A pair of powerline adapters runs about  you can find them at any big box electronics store or Amazon and the setup is nearly foolproof.  Powerline adapters are a wired solution so it should be a more reliable solution than anything wireless.,Tivo,cwpytvt,1,t5_2s84p

8539954,0,t3_4wofzh,If youre buying it used then chances are its already been activated and is tied to the TiVo account of the seller.  What you and the seller will need to do is contact TiVo support and request that the unit be transferred from their account to your account.You should take a look at this document from TiVo about transferring a TiVo to a new owner. ,Tivo,d6928yl,3,t5_2s84p

9800026,0,t3_5fkppc,I think its a bad error message. I see that come up when Tivo doesnt have the rights for out of home streaming such as with HBO... you have to use HBO Go instead.,Tivo,dal2c33,4,t5_2s84p
9804096,0,t1_dabtjfb,My dad has a directv tivo since hes in his s and has used a tivo since the first series s.Its based on older HR hardware so its a bit slow compared to a Genie.  It lacks ALL of the tivo extras you mentioned.Basically a good product for people who have an old tivo and cable want directvs channelsprices but dont want to learn a new UI.,Tivo,dalkdmu,1,t5_2s84p
10148527,0,t1_dbu6n93,I believe there is a way to browse recorded content on other boxes although youd need to copy the content first with an internet connection. Streaming apps should work fine provided youve got an internet connection. ,Tivo,dbucta0,1,t5_2s84p

10567576,0,t1_dd57rlm,Im pretty sure your problem isnt that the TiVo has its tuners turned off its that your cablecard is only provisioned for two tuners  and thats assuming its an M card. If you had an S card you never had more than one so I doubt you have that type. You just didnt notice until you tried to record something on tuner  and it didnt have any signal to record. You would use the technique above to turn OFF the two extra tuners in the TiVo so that it doesnt try to make recordings on tuners not served by the cablecard.The only way to fix this is to get your cablecard reprovisioned for four tuners.,Tivo,dd5yd38,2,t5_2s84p

11390266,0,t1_dfmu44z,gt does this mean they are prepping to shut down support on these older models like they did with series I really think so. It includes any active unit. You had to access the service on two particular days recently they apparently sent out an earlier batch of offers a couple of weeks ago too. It only applies to units before the Series  Premiers. If youve got an HD or HDXL word to the wise jump on it.,Tivo,dfn2g8u,2,t5_2s84p
11510873,0,t3_649esa,Buy the GB and replace with a TB internal drive when you get it.Here is a how to videoI know there are some issues with drives over a certain size but any  or  TB . in drive will work.  Starting with the Roamios the HDDs dont have to have any special formatting when you put them in the drive will be formatted by the Tivo on first boot supposedly.So buy the GB and upgrade the drive to whatever you want when you first get it.  You should be able to transfer any of the records on you current unit that you want to keep before it times out and deactivates.,Tivo,dg0rc6u,3,t5_2s84p
