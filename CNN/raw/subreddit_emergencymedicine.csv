1087899,0,t3_26iaf7,Thank you to everyone I appreciate the responses. I am hoping to start medical school soon and found it really interesting that countries other than the US have much more prehospital physician care. Ive been an EMTB for a while and love the idea of finishing an EM residency and not only working in the hospital but also out in the field. In the States this is obviously rare to come by but I am open to relocating to other countries UK Australia as well. ,emergencymedicine,chry3i0,1,t5_2u002

1999313,0,t3_2hmrjl,I was in the military before medical school and am currently a Navy undersea medical officer.  I love the navy but will tell you very openly dont do it unless you really want to serve.  Its not worth the money in the long run and despite being perfectly satisfactory no military EM program can offer the pathology that civilian ones do.  I am proud off the awesome primary care our service members get but it makes for very few actual emergencies.  Military EM programs have to have lots of outside rotation to get acuity.  Anyone who claims that being an outside rotator at high acuity places is the same as having your whole residency at such a place is delusional.  The best part of military medicine is deployed.  This stay a civilian and become a reservist after residency.  Then you minimize a lot of the negative while still getting the really awesome parts.  ,emergencymedicine,cku47xt,4,t5_2u002
2073108,0,t1_cl39v9h,Yeah sick kids babies especially are on the frightmare list.  Did you guys have a OB emergency rotation where the pregnant ladies would go if there was an emergency?  The ER at my home institution has a couple deliveries in the ED every month near a low socioeco location many pregnancies wout prenatal care.As for fellowship heck I dont even know.  It seems that many programs like to brag that they have US training and fellowship.  Is this a new area of ERM?  It doesnt seem like an area that many people talk about i.e. Ooh man I really want to get good at ultrasound during residency . . . !  Gunner MS but would be vital for trauma and other acute emergencies. ,emergencymedicine,cl3c5p3,1,t5_2u002

3641146,0,t3_322o4o,I work on an ambo. Did you go in with seizures or chest painanxiety. The lorazepam treats anxiety but also I used to treat bad seizures. The  lead makes me think it was more chest pain related. That basically take a picture of your heart from  different angles to see if anything is CURRENTLY happening. It wont tell you anything from the past. If you heart a heart attack there are markers in your blood and that is why they took your blood. Looks like they also set up and iv for fluids which is normal for chest pain. I dont know what youre really looking to find out about this bill tho. Why they did certain things? ,emergencymedicine,cq7bgoi,2,t5_2u002

Take manual blood pressures dont rely on the machines in the ER. If you can interview the patients take SOAP notes and write them down. The big thing you can learn from this is recognizing and differentiating between the normal and abnormal. And above all ask questions! If you dont understand something ask someone! Most nurses are fantastic at helping students especially if you help them changing linens cleaning etc. ,emergencymedicine,ct7q4ba,20,t5_2u002

I have used it for a little relief before antiemetics can be given with success a few times before a couple times on myself. Its really hit or miss and even if it works doesnt last long.

7017130,0,t3_4bqyoo,Our triage is staffed with a midlevel during the day. They enter all the orders they feel appropriate for every patient who passes through. Our triage is also staffed with a tech the majority of the time who completes all orders such as EKGslabs. Imaging techs will grab patients from the waiting room for XRs or noncontrast CTs. A lot of the time all of a patients diagnostic studies are complete before they hit an ED bed. Tech staffing is critical for running triage this way. Its not possible for a triage RN to manage everything they need to as well as grabbing labs on  of patients. When midlevels arent available in triage our nurses still have protocols they can run such as chest painabd pain order sets. They are allowed to independently order any plain film series they feel appropriate as well as most labs on their own. They cant order a CTMRIUS without a providers order. We are always happy to help the triage nurse by running up to triage to see someone or just give a verbal order.,emergencymedicine,d1bqn7n,2,t5_2u002

8536043,0,t3_4wnhdd,Not a doc but an ED tech. Thinking of the docs in my ER Id say a little more than  are female. The lady docs I work with are badasses from my perspective I see very little difference in care or staff ineractions between genders. What it really comes down to is quality of provider. If you are incompetent and slow youre gonna have a bad time. If you have poor bedside manner youre going to have a bad time. If you treat your nursing staff like crap youre gonna have a bad time. My favorite doc to work with is a female because she happens to be the best doc that works my shift. Ive never seen her get a hard time for being female. But I have seen her get crap from some of our less than admirable patients because shes also black. But that comes with the territory working an inner city ER.As far as burnout I cant help from a provider sense. But Ive done prehospital EMS and ER for a while now and have experienced burnout in my own way. For me its about taking time to take care of yourself have friends and hobbies outside of the ER. Take advantage of time off if you feel the burn work less. I exercise like crazy cut back on my alcohol intake and take advantage of my friends who are willing to let me vent. I imagine that once Im a doctor Ill stay in EM. Best job Ive ever had wouldnt do anything else.,emergencymedicine,d68klhf,9,t5_2u002

What I hate to the point that a lot of days I wish I could retrain in another discipline is the constant stream of drug addicts drunks vague complaints fights with lazy consultants trying to convince them to take of my patient with legit issues. Metrics that mean nothing PressGaney  is only done for people that werent sick enough to be admitted for crying out loud. These are the crazy makers. If I dont get it right  of the time I can be sued yet I have no context with these patients and am required to see all comers any time age or complaint. That is very stressful. So stressful in fact that I recently volunteered for a tour in a combat zone so I can focus on the pure nature of my work. Emergency medical care.
