He was never a sworn vassal to your House so there was no treason in the first place.    My lord my point is that this attack on Saltpans is unlawful and undeserved.

1128295,0,t3_271e3x,WaterthornAs the battle line swayed and swung and the sound of metal clanging pervaded the air like the rolling of thunder the grass on the other side of the river danced merrily in the breeze oblivious to the dying and fighting men on the other side. Rossen Arena on the less desirable of the two sides of the Blueburn River was glad that he was on a horse. His senses were so dulled by the sound of hooves and shouting and the smell of blood and sweat that nothing which was happening around him registered in his mind and his trusty destrier Windstorm was more capable of making decisions at that moment than he was. He was still remembering the moment just before the battle had started when his father had given him one of the swords that which he had only recently taken from the family vault. His father had said he was waiting for the right time which apparently was now.  He had noticed that the craftsmanship was incredible like nothing he had ever seen before. The blade was folded over many times and was much too light for a longsword of the size it was the metal was much much lighter in color than normal steel as well and even seemed to have a faint blue tinge to it. He knew how much the weapon meant and did not want to let his father down. He turned his head to the right and barely even noticed the soldier bearing the red and blue standard of Arena screaming as a mace pulverized every bone in his left leg.An arrow flashed through the air and made a dull thud as it hit the shield of the knight next to him. The glare of the bright afternoon sun reflecting off of the metal and the river momentarily blinded Rossen as he turned his head to see where the arrow had gone and observed the knight dig his spurs into the side of the horse to start galloping to help reinforce a weak point in their battle formation.He was quickly brought out of his musings though as at that moment a glaring mounted and armored behemoth burst through the Arena battle line bearing the green and yellow sigil of the Florent house and swinging a great morningstar with the ease of a farmer swinging a scythe. An Arena spearman tried to turn and stab his horse and force the knight to dismount but he was quickly and bloodily disemboweled by another enemy swordsman who rushed through the breach after the knight. The spearman didnt even have time to shout.Looking left and right again Rossen was finally brought to attention as a flying rock hit his helmet hard enough to make his ears ring. Shaking his head and lowering his visor he knew what he had to do.He turned and shouted On me! to the handful of mounted knights and spearmen behind him and rallied them for a charge to defend their soldiers. No knight was going to break through his men like that. Kicking his horse quickly into action he charged forward to engage the knight who threatened their entire left vanguard. His task of defending the left side of the village and pushing the enemy back towards the Blueburn could not succeed if the knights and swordsmen of House Florent were able to successfully create a hole in his line.Windstorms hoofs kicked up mud and dust behind his as he galloped and the clashing of shields and swords became even louder as he got closer to the main section of the fray. Rossen drew his sword which almost seemed to radiate a faint whiteblue light and shouted reassurances to the men of the Arena line to stand firm and hold their ground. He could tell that the men were starting to lose heart though as more and more Florent men began to push their way through the line. The scent of mud filled his nostrils as a charged down the riverbank wielding his sword and suddenly then he was upon the knight who had threatened his entire battle formation.He swung his sword catching the knights arm at the shoulder and Rossens entire arm instantly went numb from the force of the blow. Almost dropping his sword he clutched it in his grip even more tightly and spun around. He nimbly ducked as the morningstar flew straight above his head and slashed again at the mounted knight. The sword seemed to cut through the chainmail like grasssomething Rossen had never seen before. The weapon bit through the other mans mail and cleanly removed his arm from the bicep down. Screaming the man fell off of his horse but the gods were merciful and the fall killed him instantly and snapped his neck.Only just starting to regain feeling in his sword arm Rossen signaled to his cohort of knights behind him and rode swinging into the midst of the battle line to try and restore the Arena formation. Hacking and slashing the world was a blur of silver and brown and red. Blood covered the already trampled grass and the bodies were starting to pile up. He slashed at a foolish peasant who was brave enough to charge him removing the front half of his face. Twitching the man fell onto another of his comrades who Rossen also managed to swing his sword into. The blade was like a razor cutting through bone and muscle alike as Rossen knew it was something special. The second man fell near his friend Ser John the Blackheart who laughed maniacally as he swung his battleaxe from atop his horse severing men from their limbs with each swing. Rossen parried the blow of another mounted knight and turned to engage him fully. He their swords crashed together back and forth until Rossen managed to nick the other knights gauntlet tearing through the soft flesh of his hand. Rossen knew he had won and slashed again at the startled man before he could regain his wits. The sword again bit through the chainmail near his neck and the other knight toppled from his horse nearly five seconds after his head did. Rossen grimaced and turned to find another opponent to engage.  Before he realized what was happening however a stray quarrel hit Windstorm in the chest. Rearing and kicking Windstorm threw Rossen from the saddle and he hit the ground with a resounding clank. Time seemed to slow down as the world spun and he saw stars and the putrid smell of the battlefield made nothing better. Shouting and yelling became indistinguishable and he could barely get his bearings to sit up. Something caught his eye near the bank of the river however and he groggily turned his head to observe it. A beautiful gleaming blade sat half covered in dirt half submerged in the river he had lost his sword in the fall! He managed to crawl his way over to it and picked it up again. The point still glimmering from the water which was slowly running off of it.A shout broke him from his stupor and he turned just in time to see a footman come charging at him with Florent colors mace held high. Grasping the longsword in his hand and bracing himself against the muddy grass in his other he stabbed the stillwet tip at the charging man impaling his abdomen and causing him to stop in his tracks. Removing the blade and along with it the mans entrails he pushed himself up and finished the man with a quick slash to the throat. He looked to the battle line where his other knights and friends were still valiantly slashing away from atop their horses. Blood spurting in every direction and Florent men were starting to fall back. Rossen started towards the fray picking up the shield from a fallen Arena axeman. He swung the swordregaining the feeling. Curiously water droplets still seemed to be flying off of it even though it shouldve already been dry in the bright sun. He stalked again towards the battle ready to once again use his remarkable weapon against any Florent soldier stupid enough to get in his way.TLDR Dudes dad gives him a sword uses the shit out of it to kill some baddies in battle.,westerospowers,chwjjgu,1,t5_31la9

1261907,0,t3_28j07c,Economic system would be great. its going to be really hard to put into effect but heres my ideaAll regions Westerlands the North the IIs Braavos etc. are granted by the mods a certain number of gold dragons loosely based on canon but enough to keep things fair. That gold is then split up accordingly amongst the Lords of that region much like was done with troops. Now that everyone has some what can be done with gold? Hire sellswords Build defensesreinforce castles Build ships Train more troops takes longer than just hiring sellswords but maybe less expensive? Upkeep a rallied army for every month that a lord has their army marchingfightingrallied they lose a bit of gold. Giftlend gold to support an allys war effortObviously all the above things will need to be given standard prices and length of time needed to keep things fair.Gold should also be able to be earned from Winning Battles Capturing casltes  Raiding this system needs work too. Loans players should be able to giftlend gold as they see fit Being at peace and not spending it if a Lord is at peace and does not have their army rallied then they will begin to slowly earn some gold. The amount should be based on their region and how much fighting has taken place nearby recently. This is a tough one but might be doable? Taxes? Major lords should be able to ask his bannermen for gold sort of like regular gifts? idkThis also opens up the issue should we have a player be allowed to become the Iron Bank of Braavos. It makes sense that they would be able to choose who they want to lend their money to but it would also be nice to have a moderator do it to keep things fair.There are so many issues with this its crazy. but I have faith in the mods. Those are my cents. Good luck!,westerospowers,cibkwc3,1,t5_31la9

1263193,0,t3_28jo4u,meta I definitely agree with these surprise attacks and all this just seams a little much. In any port city ships dock outside the walls. Coming in under the guise of trading ships is smart but on once docked you would not be able to just walk up to the walls. Customs usually searches ships before they dock and even if you kill them an alert would have been raised once they did not return before you.Second of all the walls of sus pear are not made out of ice that can be claimed with an axe. The walls are well over  ft high at the least so while the wall I the north may be easy for wildly gs this seams a little to height to climb without siege towers. Im all for wild kings invading dorne it will give my troops something to do but your attack on sun spear seams completely rediculous.,westerospowers,cibq405,2,t5_31la9

Whilst mourning for his brothers loss and attempting to find a new castellan to manage the castle in his own absence Hallyne received news that another Lord had taken Snakewood and disposed of his brother by one mean or another. Enraged Hallyne gathered a few men and confronted Lord Gnygell with the aim of removing him from his lands without shedding more blood.
