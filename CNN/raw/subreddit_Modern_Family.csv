901316,0,t3_24fjax,I couldnt agree more with you. Its all discombobulated and  hastily thrown together into one melting pot of a  min episode especially for this season. No continuity whatsoever and you were dead on about character development. But I did go back and watch the first couple of episodes of the season and idk if it was hind sight bias or watching it a second time through but it made a lot more sense and was even funnier the second time through. The first time you watch an episode it feels like a tornado but the second time through you get it. Maybe this is a ploy of the writers to get viewers to buy the episodes? Like what they did with Lost. All discombobulated but upon rewatching there is a flow. Another theory is that maybe they got new writers or producers? idk but ur voicing things I have been thinking myself so thanks ,Modern_Family,ch6qgf9,27,t5_2ta16

Id assume she was only going to a reunion for her specific school of marketingjournalismcommunication. Thats why I assume she only had one of her old professors there instead of more also they lack of people to be at that party.Also dont forget Claire didnt really seem to care much about Phil at first. They discuss it in several episodes how cool she was a how nerdy he was. She only continued to date him because she was pregnant. It is likely she never really showed off around her friends. She was probably embarrassed by him at first.Just an opinion ,Modern_Family,cki8cwi,9,t5_2ta16
