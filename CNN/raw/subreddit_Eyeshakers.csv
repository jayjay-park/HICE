7280552,0,t3_4f48z7,I dont remember exactly when I figured it out but I think I was around six or seven. I think I knew how to blur my eyes already because I had bad eyesight and didnt have glasses yet so it was just like the opposite of squinting to make my vision temporarily clearer something I did all the time. Anyway I was just messing around with my face like kids do and I discovered how to cross my eyes by focusing on my nose and then right after I realized that my eyes would shake if I tried to do something sort of like blur them and slightly cross them at the same time. I remember messing around with it a little as a kid and freaking out some adults but I totally forgot about it until I came across the AskReddit post a couple days ago that spawned this subreddit and I realized I could still do it! Not only that but apparently I have a lot of control over it and I dont remember having so much control when I was a kid so its like this ability has been brewing inside me all these years.,Eyeshakers,d25r0ok,4,t5_3e789
7281866,0,t1_d25w12d,Ha! Well she was probably trying to look out for your best interests. We have some anecdotal evidence here that says that it doesnt seem to be bad to do it every once in a while longterm but nobody really knows for sure.Have you ever videotaped it to see what it looks like when you do it? I assumed my eyes shake really wildly based on how things look to me when I do it but when I taped it I found out that its actually hard to notice unless I purposely shake them really hard.,Eyeshakers,d25weiw,2,t5_3e789

7302472,0,t1_d281yny,Ha! People can say my eyes are neon purple if they want to as far as Im concerned its no skin off my back if they have weird color perception or something. I think mine generally only change in settings with tinted lighting which obviously makes a lot of sense. They come across as pale green in fluorescent lighting and tend to look more like a greentinted light brown in sunlight or incandescent lighting I think because the warmer colors bring out the yellowishbrown parts in the middle more. Everyone Ive talked to about it seems to agree that hazel or hazel green is the best general descriptor for it.edit Do you find that your eyes are more sensitive to light than most peoples? Its a pretty minor thing for me but its definitely noticeable. Ive read that since darker irises absorb more light theres less that makes its way into the retina overall so us lighteyed people have slightly better night vision and slightly worse bright light vision on average. Though of course as with all of this stuff those are just generalizations made from imperfect data sets and probably dont apply to every single light eyed person out there.,Eyeshakers,d288pnw,1,t5_3e789

8277975,0,t1_d5cau90,Oh cool I can also change the frequency by focusing harder or softer! It seems like thats a relatively advanced eyequaking skill. Would you say youve put a lot of time into eyebrating? Im curious how much practice vs. genetics affects the different tricks each of us can do.,Eyeshakers,d5cb09w,2,t5_3e789
