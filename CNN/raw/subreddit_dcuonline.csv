Dont get me wrong this is a step in the right direction but get real. You guys need to get your shit together and stop making stupid decisions such as the Rage nerf. Im not even a Rage DPS and you just completely annihilated the melee DPS aspect of the power. It was something unique and different for once and you just killed it. Stop ruining powers and fix shit like the aggro bugs. Its starting to irritate me that you guys keep putting out new things when whats currently out is broken. In no other MMO have I seen so many bugs go for so long without being fixed or hell even addressed. How about the mics on PS? Thats been there since launch and remember the hand blasters bug?

702333,0,t1_cgk3lu0,If the game utilized the fair freetoplay model that you described nobody would have any incentive to spend any money and it would shut down.  Like it or not the sustainability and further development of this game is dependent on legendary subscribers.  The entire reason people can play for free or a nonsubscribed cost at all is to try to get more subscribers through letting them try the game out.  The only way around that would be to introduce tons of advertisements of which thankfully SOE has not implemented.  I know youre going to disagree with this and thats fine but I dont see how what you suggested wouldnt shut the game down.

859661,0,t3_23yzc3,From our stickied postgtWhat DLCs Should I Get?gtThis question totally depends on the level of your character and what youre looking for. That said Ill try to break them down into categories.gtT and below  If you play PVE and want content for T and below you most likely want Battle for Earth and Lighting Strikes. BFE will give you access to T armor and Lightning Strikes will give you access to T. armor. With T armor recently being halved in cost I would suggest if you only buy one to get Battle for Earth. Other DLCs that cover this content are Hand of Fate and Fight for the Light.gtPVP  If you PVP the two DLCs most interesting to you would be Home Turf and The Last Laugh. The Last Laugh has largely become irrelevant but youll need it if you want to use the shield weapon.gtT and above  Youll need T armor to even begin these quests so dont purchase any of these DLCs first. These DLCs are Origin Crisis Sons of Trigon and War of the Light Part . Origin Crisis focuses on larger group content and has two raids whilst Sons of Trigon has solo content  duos and an alert.

4094106,0,t3_37h932,Theres a lot of variables in play none of which youve provided any information on so its difficult to tell you what the specific issue is. So some generalities...Your CR your gear your equipment mods your base generator mods your skill points and how theyre applied and even your weapon type and usage will all contribute to how effective a healer you are. Without knowing all of this about your character and the other characters youre comparing yourself to no answer is possible. And are you comparing your healing ability to that of other healers in the same raid at the same time with the same group? Or is this across different groups and different raids?Electricity is a great burst healing power which means you need to be careful about when you time your casts. Cast too early and youre wasting power on unnecessary heals cast too late and you risk losing a teammate. Its not uncommon to have your teams health bars yoyo throughout the mission when relying on a good electric healer.dcuobloguide.com has good guides on all the power and role types.

Defeat bossesgt . Loot geargt . Salvage unwanted gear breaking it down into new componentsgt . Convert those new components into the rare gear you do want using new RampD Plansgt . gt The new RampD Gear System expands the existing RampD and salvage systems to offer a new complementary progression path to the same rare gear found in large group content. The system does not replace playing content for drops  playing content for dropped gear remains the primary means to progress beyond vendor gear  but it does add an alternative slower and guaranteed path to rare gear for those losing the battle with randomness.gt . gt Now with the RampD Gear System every drop matters  every drop is progress  and you are no longer fully at the mercy of random luck.

11658235,0,t3_66ckcd,If were talking about DPS role which I recommend you start out with assuming youre playing on your own theres really only one build for each powerset. Every powerset has something called advanced mechanics which is a euphemism for fixed loadout you have to use in a fixed order.  So whatever powerset you choose look up the corresponding guide on the official forums to learn how your AM works.That said until you hit at least level  just forget about all I just said and experiment with the combat mechanics to get a feeling for the game. The level  content is quite forgiving and you should be able to complete it with any setup you like. As for which powerset to choose except for Nature and Electricity DPS all powersets are viable for both of their roles. Out of the FP powers Ice is probably the easiest to play but none of them are rocket science so go with what looks good for you. If you go for Gadgets send me a pm if you want and Ill give you a crash course.The only powers I wouldnt recommend to new players are Rage and Celestial since they are quite difficult to learn.,dcuonline,dghh4o4,3,t5_2s8ml
