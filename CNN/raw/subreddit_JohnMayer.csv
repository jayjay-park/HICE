Years ago I liked his older albums during high school and college and as of late born and raised has really resonated with me as I grow up and start looking back at my mistakes and try to grow as a person. If Im on a blues kick TRY! Is great. If I want the whole John Mayer experience where the light is gets me everytime. Dealing with a breakup battle studies. Chilling under the stars with a beer and a Bon fire paradise valley. Each album has a theme and each one has been a puzzle piece to my situation at times. ,JohnMayer,d6syadj,2,t5_2s156

10342371,0,t3_5o2b6c,Recovered ego addict is my favorite. When I started to really get into Johns music and guitar playing in general I was so inspired by Continuum Where The Light Is and so many others. When I found out how awful a person John was or at least what an awful person the media made John seem its up for debate I was really disheartened because I was disappointed that such a pure musician was not pure at heart. But my hope has been restored with Johns behavior now that hes back in the spotlight as well as how his followers can see he cares so much more about being a human being then getting people to like his music. edit word,JohnMayer,dcgd7fq,5,t5_2s156

11652977,0,t3_669dqs,This is funny to me. Was the writer looking to sound smart with his crazy writing style or was he looking to appease the masses? Well he failed at both! I guess I am just another jaded JM fan.....funny thing is that I was a John hater about  years ago then Battle Studies changed my mind. Wonder how many more albums he will have to write to change peoples minds? Esp critiques....like John says who gets more fans and followers after  years in the business? Not many and I am one of them and proud as hell of it! ,JohnMayer,dggvo2u,7,t5_2s156
11656409,0,t1_dgh8zy1,yeah he hasnt come close to touching continuum which was both a commercial and critical success. sometimes i dont understand whats going through his head...that said im going to LA tomorrow to see him!,JohnMayer,dgh9odg,-1,t5_2s156

11731151,0,t3_67e8kc,They turned out pretty good! I wish I had only made them a higher resolution because some posters look a little grainy.,JohnMayer,dgpr8pp,1,t5_2s156
11753952,0,t3_67q5tm,I recommend checking out his recordings on archive.org. I think hes been playing it relatively safe on TSFE tour so you may want to check out his older recordings. Otherwise you have to listen to his WTLI album if you havent already. Its his best work.,JohnMayer,dgsc8y6,8,t5_2s156
11760828,0,t3_67sgja,I could see the release going VOL. spring release obviously maybe zero in the summer and vol. in the fall or winter months to round out  with  albums in  year. Also being that if this is Zero he is working on it probably wouldnt take as long to put out since it is material he has done previously or has stored up over the years like he may have most of the song recorded but add in vocals over tracks he had made before. Im ready but Im not ready faints from excitement ,JohnMayer,dgt4b9c,13,t5_2s156
