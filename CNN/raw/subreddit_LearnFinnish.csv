1099330,0,t1_cht3vyz,Yes if you have vhn  a noun the noun takes the partitive case. In a sentence like that vhn is acting as a quantifier not an intensifier.Haluan vhnpaljonenemmnlis... jtel.Haluan vhnpaljonenemmnlis... omenoita.Note that vhn doesnt actually cause the noun to take the partitive as it would be in the partitive even without a quantifier. Haluan jtel.,LearnFinnish,cht8yy3,2,t5_2xe7f

Tuossa oli tmn pivn sata.Notes huono is an appropriate translation for most meanings of the English word bad but it doesnt mean evil or naughty which I think is what you meant. So I replaced your huono with tuhma naughty. Its as childish as the English word so dont use it in a serious context.kirjoittaa  to write kirjoittaa yls  to write down Theres some pretty intense disagreement on metaphorical directions right here!The distinction between ett  that and jotta  so that is an artificial creation by the people who formed the standard written language. Originally every dialect only had either ett or jotta and used it for both meanings. For example I always say ett. I only use jotta when I intentionally choose to adhere to the standard language when Im writing something.jokapivinen is an adjective not an adverb. It means everyday or daily as in Anna meille tn pivn meidn jokapivinen leipmme. Give us this day our daily bread. You tried to use it as daily the adverb.Edit corrected typo see below,LearnFinnish,ci3b06t,2,t5_2xe7f
1254909,0,t1_ci9v5y1,Yeah thats what I was referring to. P Learning words by themselves isnt really a problem but conjugations well...technically one could just learn them as new words but I pressume there to be at least some system to simplify it furthermore flashcards as I use for other words are pretty bad for conjugations.trua pretty much outlined exactly what I was looking for though so thatll probably help a lot with learning them. I was thinking about example sentences as well but the problem I see with that is basically that pronouns are such basic components of language and I think you already need a bit of knowledge about the language in order to make proper use of flashcard sentences. Its not a bad idea though but I think its better for internalising them than for learning them if you know what I mean. ,LearnFinnish,ciasj7r,1,t5_2xe7f
1291949,0,t1_ciehf0k,My advice with FAEG is to just read it once through to pick up on what you can and just kinda wrap your mind around how the language works.Beyond that step  is to practice noun declensions and verb conjugations so that you can quickly and easily recognize them when you see sample sentences. Step  is to understand how it all fits together. Its VERY frustrating to read an example in a book or online and not know WTF theyre talking about because you missed that the key word was in the abessive and not the partitive.,LearnFinnish,cieylq2,2,t5_2xe7f

1944731,0,t3_2gveco,Im not a great fan of Duolingo. It requires a lot of support both from the community and the staff. The discussion sections need to be useful and kept clean and mistakes need to be updated by the staff and moderators. I stopped using Duolingo because the support for niche languages was just not that great error reports were just not taken into consideration and the comment sections was overran with useless comments. As Finnish is not a language that many people in US want to learn Im not sure how the project would end.
