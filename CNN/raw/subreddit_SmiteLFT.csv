5896890,0,t3_3vuunh,I might be interested. I used to main adc but lately my mood towards smite has been changing with the way balance but I think playing with a team would help my mood. Whenever I dont play adc I like to play support. Im not saying Im the best at the role but I have fun with it and if you need a support I may be interested. I work part time so my schedule is kinda crazy but could probably be at most practices. My ign is Wally if you want to add meh and we can play together a bit to see how it goes. Just let me know! ,SmiteLFT,cxsm74b,1,t5_2wh8w
