11741560,0,t1_dgqwvpq,Finding other native speakers to record with is pretty tricky. I dont know a whole lot of people in general due to being a social recluse. I mostly hear it nowadays from older men around the village every now and then such as at the bus stop ur passing by on the street not sure how openly it is spoken in the other villages with native speakers. I dont know how to go about approaching strangers for recordings as Ive never done anything like it plus theres still a negative stigma around the language. From what Ive read about elicitation people tend to speak how they think they should speak i.e in the standard language or prestige language. Im worried that when being asked for a recording the person will keep switching to English. Im inexperienced with getting recordings from strangers and it seems nerve wracking even with how important it is. ,Focurc,dgqxp27,1,t5_3icws
