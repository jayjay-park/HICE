We moved from chicago just under  years ago and love it here in the springs. It truly is a big Sq mileage wise small town. Heres a map that I made for a few of my friends that moved into town itll hopefully give you some guidance. take a look at my map but basically Id look at and we did look at the westsidedowntown anything east of union is sketchy and further than that its becoming the suburbs. The great thing we found with renting is that you get a good feel of where you want to live and arent locked into where youre staying at the moment.EDIT notesfinding a rental  Craigslist is worthless in this town at least for finding rentals. what we did to find ours was use Zillow and Trulia but the best bet would be to drive around looking for for Rent signs in front yards.Realtor  Inspector   Both are awesome and have gone above and beyond,ColoradoSprings,ci626pj,2,t5_2rde7

1360086,0,t3_29lpvm,Having sold cars when I first got out of the Marines I can tell you this. Every car sales lot is going to try and get as much money from you as possible. They will devalue your tradein and inflate the value of their vehicle. The only thing you need is knowledge. Dont go in blind. Do research. Know exactly what you are looking for and exactly what you want in terms of finance. Go through several lots on Sunday afternoons and stroll through their inventory. Take notes on the vehicles you like to include makemodelyear condition the inventory number should be listed on used cars option packages and so on. When you research dont just stop at KBB. That really doesnt mean anything to a good car salesman. Compare similar vehicles around town. Look on used car websites. The more information you have on the purchase the more you will disarm them. Also try and be preapproved for a loan through a bank you know and trust first. Know what you can afford. Ive seen companies do things like lower cost of the vehicle but jack the interest rate. They will say something along the lines of Well we met your requirement of X dollars a month so the interest rate doesnt matter right? Dont fall for that. Just remember knowing is half the battle.,ColoradoSprings,cimryyd,1,t5_2rde7

Mona Lisa is another nice spot its a fondue restaurant in Manitou. The Golden Bee at the Broadmoor is a fun drink spot its a sing along piano bar and can be very entertaining. For breakfast you could drive west to woodland park and eat at the hungry bear. If youve not been to woodland its a nice little town in the mountains lots of little shops with less tourists than manitou.

6541004,0,t3_456tq3,Im guessing you support this protest. I live downtown and I fully support the ordinance. Heres a few reasons why The guy who was smoking meth on my front walk who I had to threaten with the cops to get to leave.  The homeless dude who made a pass at my wife at work telling her hed meet her in the alley after work for some fun. He was waiting for her there as promised and was only deterred by the  cook standing next to her.  The numerous times Ive had one of our local homeless folks try to break in to my truck while I was down by Springs Rescue Mission. These folks arent harmless. These essentially ruined Acacia and Monument Valley Parks. If youre good with that cool Im sure youd do well in Portland San Francisco or Denver. Im not. Heres the other thing. This law gives CSPD a means of intervention that precedes violent crime. Right now if a homeless person is clearly in need of help but wont take it voluntarily until a crime happens theres no way to get them help. This creates a means to get then off the streets and into some form of treatment. Its not going to help everyone but its a hell of a lot better than waiting for the next rape assault etc. ,ColoradoSprings,czvw5gz,20,t5_2rde7
