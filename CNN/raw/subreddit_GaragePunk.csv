43090,0,t1_cejbuo9,Yeah it never got old. And even just as a solo act I go to see three different band lineups. Most memorable show would probably be the first time I saw him not long after Blood Visions came out which was him opening for PonysDeerhunter. At this point the band still had  members with that other guy playing lead guitar. After the show Jay played an afterparty in a tiny skate park to a crowd of about  people. They tried to play different songs than from the standard set list so we got the ones from Night of Broken Glass and a few others. I was standing beside Jared from the Ponys. Awesome experience.,GaragePunk,cejc57g,3,t5_2slc5

4501197,0,t1_csy0sqn,Well were all at uni together and the demo was a one off sort of thing so chances are any new stuff will be around October time. Unfortunately were in a city with hardly any music scene of any kind so online responses like this really make a difference for us. ,GaragePunk,csy126a,2,t5_2slc5
