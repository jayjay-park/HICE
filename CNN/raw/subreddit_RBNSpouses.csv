Its possible that they are a narcissist and they are gaslighting the crap out of you  the tone feels that way to me.  But again we dont know the situation and theres not much to go on here from an outsiders perspective.,RBNSpouses,cihmzv0,2,t5_2zx5z

3234245,0,t1_cox757e,All busted up im afraid lol. Fortunately my husband is on board with me and our children being NC and him being LC in their lives with the exception of important family moments hospitalization death.... apologies HA! Just kidding lol He is the only one being bitten for now. I just stress about it because...well Im only holding my tongue and maintaining NC because the ramifications of my interactions with them would be very uncomfortable for him. For now he keeps allowing them to bite him. He needs to hit rock bottom and exhaust every option for reconciliation before cutting them off.Being at dinner with them is exactly like looking at a bed of vipers. All writhing and crawling over each other searching for a better advantage when really theres no way out of the box. The realization came to me one family dinner when I was literally biting my tongue to keep out of the conversation. All centered around who was the more deserving child to inherit which parent was a worse parent and which child was the bigger screw up. All the while my MIL and SIL were sitting there stoaking the flame sorry new analogy whenever there was a danger of an argument not breaking out. I dont mean to toot my horn but I am marvelous in debate. They are masters at misdirection which has no place in conversation with me particularly because their vocabulary is quite limited by both education and lies. Both problems I dont have fortunately. Just once Id love to let loose on them and were it not for the very real physical danger I would.,RBNSpouses,cox8hnv,3,t5_2zx5z
3980274,0,t3_3614zw,It could just be your use of language but the way youre describing things doesnt make you a good wife  it makes you a good maid.  If I was in his shoes I wouldnt want someone who is constantly emotionally repressing themselves to the point of tears or selfharming that speaks to significantly larger problems in the relationship as a whole.  As someone else mentioned you may want to seek couples counseling to improve the communication between youyour spouse and perhaps some private counseling to get at the root of why you feel the need to selfharm.  Just cleaning the house and bringing him coffee is not a marriage.  ,RBNSpouses,cr9zg28,6,t5_2zx5z

6220718,0,t1_cynpdh0,If you want to try to make real progress from this I recommend that you go to counseling but while youre working on getting that going check out some of John Gottmans books on the  horsemen of communication issues that can destroy a marriage.The example you gave about the conversation about you not wanting him to keep slapping you shows extreme defensiveness. When you say I need you to donot do X and instead of addressing your feelings they respond with a hostile Well YOU do Y! it makes progress impossible.  My brothers ex was constantly like this even in counseling  she just could NOT bear sitting and listening to things that she perceived as criticism and it is definitely a marriage killer.That plus the namecalling and belittling contempt and criticism and then ignoring you after your argument stonewalling suggests that youre working with all  horsemen.I went to marriage counseling and one thing I thought was very helpful was developing a communications contract. There was a lot of value in coming to an agreement about how we should communicate with each other and how we shouldnt. It was not a panacea and its a lot easier in theory than in practice. Its hard to stick to the contract when emotions start running high. But even when we werent able to stick to it  we were able to identify where we went wrong when things settle down and acknowledge where we needed to work to improve things. The frontend agreement on how things are supposed to go ended up being helpful to us even when they didnt go exactly how they were supposed to.  ,RBNSpouses,cywq8ci,4,t5_2zx5z

8133700,0,t1_d4txql4,Glad Im not the only one! Im the same way I really dont care about winning conversations. Its just hard to be shit on and have my knowledge on things invalidated. I dont miss my NFIL for many reasons but his need to win at all costs is something Im so glad Im away from. Husband is very tame in comparison but its still present.I just ended up leaving him alone for a bit and afterwards he came up to me and was acting all cutesy. ..which is his annoying way of being like OK youre right in this case. Id still prefer if he stopped with that flea all together but I guess thatll take time. He is aware of it which is a change from a few years ago.Its interesting that you bring up insecurity. That could have been the basis of last nights hooplah. Both he and I are working towards career changes and are both in and out of school. Im currently not working and we have a young son so tensions have been running high. And I know having to start at the bottom of the ladder with regards to his new career is hard for him.For sure stepping back is key. I used to fuel the fire and make it worse but Ive kind of realized that walking away and not engaging. Or even calmly stating my stance without working myself up. Weve been to counselling and it has helped sooo much with these types of issues but with me out of work we dont have coverage. Thank you for the advice!!,RBNSpouses,d4uauyb,1,t5_2zx5z

10101328,0,t3_5kfw8m,I am in the same spot with my NWife she had an episode during Christmas and another one yesterday. I am now in the punished zone where she ignores me and acts out all angry and controlling. Heres an article not the best that describes whats going on. I know leaving and is not the option it is usually more complicated than that. Whatever he says to you remember is not your fault. You owe him nothing and are not responsible for what he claims you are. Sucks that they ruin holidays I now hate that I have time off and cant go back to wok where I am busy and dont have to deal with her constant navging and moodiness. Happy new year!,RBNSpouses,dbo7sig,1,t5_2zx5z
10181655,0,t3_5lrv9f,I suspect this will be a minority opinion but Make his first appointment. For people who are reluctant to try therapy making that first contact is the hardest step and the one they need the most. They have already shown theyre not capable of solving their own problems. Be a bud and walk them in the door for a while if thats what it takes. My husband has serious helplessness issues as a result of being raised the way he was. I hate being his secretary and I hate feeling like hed just curl up into a ball and die without me to prod himnag himdo shit for him. But thats something we cant work at all when hes severely depressed and thus a nogo if hes not in therapy. Even if you resent making him go it will still be better than him not going at all. A while back two friends of mine were in a total marriage crisis and they kept saying they wanted to try counseling. I finally asked Do you want me to call around and find someone for you? And my friend actually cried because it was just this huge weight and the idea of calling and discussing a bunch of logistics with different people really overwhelmed them both. So I did. I called a bunch of therapists in their area and interviewed them as to their style insurance and pay structure. Two of the therapists said they thought it was great that I was willing to do that for a friend so I felt all glowy inside. I didnt make the appointment because I dont know their schedules but I would for my spouse. ,RBNSpouses,dby5ax2,2,t5_2zx5z
11073806,0,t3_5y46fq,Personally as far as this sub goes I only found it because I looked for it while on RBN.  While people on this sub are generally supportive there isnt always a strong response from members as there is on RBN.As far as the codependency goes its not necessarily true that ACONs wont wake up.  Your DH may be conditioned to be a certain way but that doesnt mean that hes unable to learn how to be more self aware.  It takes time and a lot of selfreflectiontherapy to undo it though.  Plus learning how to communicate properly and knowing your own issues too.My DH is an ACON but my mom is borderline and my dad at the very least had a lot of FLEAS.  I have many issues to deal with and a lot of behavior that would trigger my DH before we knew or understood what was going on.  Were both in individual therapy right now to deal with our own problems with the understanding that we will be going into couples therapy in the future.  Things can turn around if youre both willing to work on it and give it the time it deserves.,RBNSpouses,den7f62,6,t5_2zx5z
