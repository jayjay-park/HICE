2200621,0,t3_2ka490,I still consider them punk. Sure their recent albums havent been as hard as their older albums but that doesnt mean they arent punk. To me punk wasnt only about how fast the music was or how many screams it had. Punk rock was about making a point making the corruption known to the world. Rise Against hasnt changed in their meaning at all. They still have the same opinions they did  years ago. And thats more important than the sound of their music. If were going to criticize their newer sound though bands have to change. Just look at the recent Pennywise album. Sure its good but it sounds the same as every other album they have. Ive always felt that each RA album has its own distinct sound. A song from SSOTC doesnt sound like anything from RPM and vice versa. Id get bored if they made RPM like songs for every album. What matters most to me though is that RA is happy with the type of music they are making.  ,riseagainst,cljjx2x,3,t5_2s2tr

2510480,0,t1_cmls88d,I echo this. The people right in front of the stage are usually just standing but will get pushed into by the pretty awesome craziness behind them. So if you dont mind that and possibly having a crowdsurfer get dragged over the fence by security Id say aim for the front row. Out towards the sides of the stage can be pretty calm too. When they first start there will be a mad push of people towards the stage. First couple songs everyone will be crazy and burn much of their energy. Then itll slow down for a song or two and then pick up again. Then the acoustic songs will play and barely anyone will move. Then Savior or a simliar song or songs will be last and everyone is bonkers again. This is also probably when youll find the most crowdsurfers.If you find yourself dragged into a pit mosh or circle and dont want to be if you have a terrified look on your face you will get dragged out.

11667949,0,t3_66hv81,For those of you who didnt like it too much Tim just said this on the radio interview Um I dont know if this song is indicative of the whole record... referring to its stylesound. He then went on to say that it was more the themesfeelings that direct raw inyourface punch of the lyrics behind this song that were representative of the record. He also said each song kind of has its own flavor although not sure if he means in terms of style or theme. I dont expect them to go back to their harder roots and I dont really want them to. I just want them to continue with the little experimentation they did on TBM to give us something new and different. I love that theyre frustrated and angry again but I hope that doesnt make them simply forget TBM  some of us really liked that introspective focus. ,riseagainst,dgiksvp,67,t5_2s2tr
