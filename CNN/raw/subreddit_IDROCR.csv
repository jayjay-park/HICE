That is why I did as I did... Oh well it doesnt matter anymore. Its just... I worked so hard to cheer her up after Kabanes death and she did that. Even though I understand why she did it and appreciate it its hard to not feel slightly used. The philosopher answered not glancing at the barber flipping to another page and sipping from his tea.Or you could learn how to think for once and act independently like Yumiko has been doing ever since we arrived.

And she wasnt making it any better... We... We both wanted the same thingout. I got tired... She finally moved back a little and looked up to Ludger her eyes filled with tears.

He pushed me to the back of the bathroom...threatened me...to be locked in there again... I... I thought he was going to... I was so scared of that... But he used the opportunity to tie me up...so I... She couldnt fight... She said unconsciously rubbing the spot on her arm where she was tied. He did...carry me back to my bed at least...

Im sorry for my incompetence. Please forgive me... Ayame died and we are going to die now. I failed you... I apologise. Ludger lightly bowed looking down. So... Thank you. Thank you for helping me all this time... For putting up with my issues for trusting me even for being there. I hope that... Despite everything the reason why you became a matchmaker can be achieved. Maybe in a Romeo amp Juliet fashion despite your hate for it... But I hope we dont die for nothing.The philosopher slowly took off his coat letting it fall to the floor.
