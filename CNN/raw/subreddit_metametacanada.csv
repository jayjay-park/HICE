9311886,0,t1_d8wanlu,gt Trump or Hillary are both the same in terms of their presidency.Thats retardedgtThey are both corrupt in their own special ways. Not even close to an equal level there. Did you read the wikileaks?gtthe only people inspired by Trump are noncollegeeducated white men.Not true look at his rallies sometime.gtIt isnt remotely enough. Well see. Dems are always ahead with minorities. Polls are overpolling democrats bigly. Still more huge leaks to come and another debate.gt Do you continue to go whitenationalist screaming into the night at the evils of refugees and immigrationTalk like this the democrats screaming racism and bigotry over every little thing is what is driving people to Trump. It doesnt work anymore how long will it take you retards to realize that? You cant guilt me into supporting your completely stupid political ideas by accusing me of being something Im not. gthed be winningThe mainstream media is completely colluding with Hillary and controlling all the information that gets to voters who dont frequent more obscure places on the internet. Donald is losing because the democrats CONTROL everything. Did you see the leaks about Hillary rigging the primaries? Did you read the leaks about them spread false rumours about Trump groping people? Did you see the leaks where theyre colluding with the media? And organizing protesters to bait Trump supporters and then cover how bad the Trump supporters are  on the media they own?Trump would be decimating her if the system was fair. As it is according to the polls that massively oversample democrats its a close race right now. You can keep pretending that all of the hard factual evidence in Wikileaks are farright conspiracy theories if that helps you support the most corrupt candidate who ever ran for President. Its embarrassing watching you completely give up what little personal integrity you have left while you continue to aggressively support Hillary after all thats been released so far. But keep in mind the current Wikileaks were just from Podesta and her personal emails are still to come. ,metametacanada,d8wcly5,3,t5_2ssar
9319927,1,t1_d8x9nnj,Okay. I went to the very first wikileaks link. Its an email saying take a look at this Washington Examiner news article with link.What am I supposed to take away from that? Im skimming through the information it seems pretty normal. She says she isnt middle class because she isnt. Whoa. Shocking. Just blew my mind.Im literally skimming through reading paragraphs. It all seems pretty reasonable. Okay maybe that first one is a dud. Ill go to the second.Oh my. A staffer is brainstorming ideas on how to market their boss. Whoa! Devil. No politician would ever do such a thing.Maybe just pure curiosity go onto the third link.Oh look the third link just goes back to the first link again  only highlighting a section. What shes referring to is appropriate rhetoric for your audience. Im not saying it is necessarily good... though Ill admit in this political environment its a cost of getting things done. Special interest groups get pissy if you say something that they dont like the wording of. Id put this under the category of logical before I would put it under immoral. Okay one last link number . Oh it links back to number one again with highlights.Whoa. She actually believes in the liberalization of markets. Shes almost a libertarian  aside from the next sentence on green energy. Its just another confirmation that Hillary is less of a socialist than Trump.I would go through more but I suspect itll all be very underwhelming.,metametacanada,d8xdaiv,1,t5_2ssar
9331569,0,t1_d8yu7su,Youll notice in the discussion itself in the wikileaks they address that screening ! mandatory drug testing. Hell screening for addictions not someone going out and partying once.You really need to learn to read.  Fuck youre dumb.,metametacanada,d8yuetp,2,t5_2ssar

9349876,0,t1_d914lda,gt by just adding points to Hillary for no reasonHe really isnt.I have not watched the videos because they were made by a man who makes faked videos.Not with CGI but with deceptive edits that is what he was taken to court a few times over and thats what the courts found each and every time. It is absolutely bizarre that you think that not significant towards the value of the videos.I have read some of the Wikileaks it turns out that Clinton is a greedy ambitious corrupt liar who says different things in different situations in a most dishonest if not hypocritical way. She is genuinely unlikable all the charm of a broken VCR. She really doesnt deserve to be President and the only reason she is going to be is because Trump.See even if your silly ass videos and your already exploded bombshells of Wikileaks were  true? It still wouldnt move the needle towards Trump.I know you dont get this because you dont understand a lot of stuff but Trump is exactly the sort of person you dont let near power. With each revelation by his own words and actions from calling Mexicans rapist drug dealers to the pussy grabbing to the crying about a fixed election the vast majority of sensible people have run away from Trump.His own party included.How you think all that makes him a winner is just well there is mental gymnastics but you? Youre a goddamned Cirque Du Soleil in zero gravity performed entirely by boneless fish.But its just so fascinating. ,metametacanada,d915xp9,1,t5_2ssar

9618606,0,t1_d9yo9jj,I wasnt convinced of anything I simply correctly knew that nothing was anywhere near certain. I thought FiveThirtyEights odds were in the ballpark of correct  Trump but were being widely misinterpretedmisrepresented including by Nate Silver himself in his editorials. The other election forecasters numbers werent even close to correct.When theres a  chance of showers its a good idea to think about what youre going to do if it rains.Now there was reason to include fee fees in prognostication like Brosa did. It was clearly a large movement as evidenced by Trumps very wellattended rallies and the fact that rTheDonald was and continues to be competitive for the position of most active subreddit. I think the true odds were probably closer to  but I have no way of determining that. ,metametacanada,d9yovyy,1,t5_2ssar
