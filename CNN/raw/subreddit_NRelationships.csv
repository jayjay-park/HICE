4855962,0,t3_3hd6y3,If he truly is an N he doesnt love you. People are replaceable to them they are honestly just in love with their reflection in your eyes. Read the behaviors. Does he manipulate idealize triangulate devalue and discard and then when he is done start a smear campaign? If not maybe he is merely an asshole. Either way you dont deserve an asshole or a N. No loving caring person does. Guard your heart and your wallet from this guy.,NRelationships,cu6mpm5,4,t5_38fvg

8356600,0,t3_4r6ruy,You said he overreacted and yelled at you so does it matter exactly what his diagnosis is? The sooner you move on the sooner you can do better. People raised by Ns can be attracted to people with those traits because its intensly familiar and it reminds you of the first person you desperately wanted to love you.,NRelationships,d5m4lhj,2,t5_38fvg

9927713,0,t1_db1kfe1,Standby for more dramatic change as you come to understand just how messed up he is  how he never loved you and everything he ever did was manipulation! Expect hoovering where he makes contact just to get an egostroke when other sources of supply fail him.You seem very clearheaded and off to a good start. I congratulate you it took me  years and many partings and returns before I stumbled across narcissism as an explanation and was able to get my power back.Best of luck on your journey.,NRelationships,db1ltyr,6,t5_38fvg
11550308,0,t3_63dlmp,This has helped a lot for me. For the past two years I felt like everything that was happening was my fault even when they would tell me that it wasnt their actions were always accusatory and words passive aggressive. I always thought it was just some form of emotional manipulation  but it seemed to not be quite right as I associated manipulation as an action that is more conscious intentional but they seemed completely oblivious to the effect of their own actions. Now that there seems to be a reason condition for their behaviour I feel like the knot in my chest can slowly be eased. ,NRelationships,dg58b69,2,t5_38fvg
