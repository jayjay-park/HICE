1117188,0,t3_26sn1w,Saw him live in Seattle in August  after Blunderbuss. It was in a little place called the WaMu theatre. Fantastic energy fantastic crowd fantastic set list fantastic show.Shitty shitty sound. That theatre is known for bad acoustics. It was really frustrating to be at such a fantastic performance by one of my favorite artists and to not be able to make out any of the instruments.Im excited for the Paramount usually much better. My hope is since last time he came here it was with the female band that this time hell bring out the males. But knowing Jack White not even he will know which band hes gonna use until that morning at breakfast...EDIT I just want to clarify that even though the sound was bad that concert was one of the best I had ever gotten the chance to see.,jackwhite,chva8s0,2,t5_2ty5l

4032588,0,t3_36nxn6,gt Well I used to buy three records a month at  bucks a piece when I was a teenager bussing tables. I also went to the movies three times a month. What did that cost? Same as today with inflation? hmmm...This part really rubbed me the wrong way. If he wants to encourage people to spend their money on his service he should try to tell them why to buy it. Instead hes saying Well I had the money back when I was a kid to do it... why cant anyone else? In case you havent noticed Jack the country is still in a recession. Theres a rise in people pirating media because they wouldnt otherwise pay for it  they dont have as much spare money to spend. Especially not in the post  America.Young adults cant even afford to start families these days. They have student loans to pay in a poor job market. If you want to convince your fans to try this out you need to make it affordable. And you definitely shouldnt be passive aggressive by insinuating theyre being cheapskates.Im not a Vault member. I wish I could be. If I were spending  a month directly to my favorite musician ever I would be pretty pissed off if I had to spend more money.,jackwhite,crfy2fi,8,t5_2ty5l
