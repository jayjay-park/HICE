They were surrendered from a couple people who train dogs to sniff things out. They put the rats in a box and the dogs had to find them.So while they werent physically harmed they are definitely timid and not well socialized. I had them put a sign so that people dont stick their fingers in their pen as the one freezes up when you touch him. ,RATS,cekajhw,2,t5_2qnh3

My girls are all still pretty young lt  mos. and Ive read that if youre going to opt for the spay the younger the better as the estrogens effect is cumulative. The older they are the more likely it is that they will get tumors especially if theyve already had one. On one hand I can afford the surgeries there is a specialist nearby and I know this is the best time in regard to effectiveness and the distress it will put on the rats. But on the other I am so so scared for them as it is a majorly invasive surgery.,RATS,cenvubt,2,t5_2qnh3

827560,0,t3_23loha,Just take it slow and steady. If you rush things even if things look like theyre going super awesome it can backfire quickly and you can wind up with a severely injured rat.I like to do the first few neutral territory meeting sin the bathtub. Keeps everyone in one place and you can break up a fight if you need to. To break up a fight keep a dust pan and a pair of good leather gloves handy. Just slide the dust pan between the rats and pick up whomever is closest to you with the gloves. I also like to put a medium sized plate dessert sized in the tub with some baby oatmeal or something soft. It makes them get near each other while still giving them all elbow room and is moderately distracting. Hard treats can be snatched away and a fight can happen.Dont try water in the tub. Its a last resort for very difficult intros and the general idea is that theyll bond just enough in absolute terror.,RATS,cgycfsy,2,t5_2qnh3

The last visit that required xrays and a plethora of medications only cost  total. That was the worst one. Most of the time the bill was under . Past experiences with dogs and cats it was tough to get out of the office for less than  even for a routine visit. Heartworm and fleatick meds were expensive as well. Overall I think rats are much more affordable.Full disclosure though even though I was a convert I used to be a dog person and rats really are just more intelligent dogs with bare tails no one seems to like.

I dont know if they would be able to help but I know some offer vaccine and spayneuter clinics for pet owners who may not be able to afford full vet costs. They might be able to either recommend a vet or help you directly. Something Id want to do first is ask your original vet about your pets lack of improvement. Maybe they can prescribe something else if the current meds arent working. Dont give up yet. One of our girls was so sick she couldnt move her front legs barely moved at all refused to eat. The right meds and hand feedingwatering brought her back from the brink but it took a month. It didnt look like the meds were working until day five. She didnt want any hard foods and really couldnt chew at all. Will your guy take anything? If you place a cut half grape under his nose will he lick it? That was the only way for us to get sugar and water into Ted for the touch and go first few days. Im convinced grapes saved her life. She had antibiotics kids ibuprofen a bit of water and grapes four times a day. Then we were able to get her to take  yogurtbaby food cucumber and so on. After a week her weakness improved.

2700644,0,t1_cn8mqec,Sounds like myco  Baytril and Doxy are used in combination to combat really agressivebad flareups of myco. Doxy is the weaker of the two can cause boneloss on younger rats that are still growing. Usually I start with doxy and if no improvement within a few days I start treating with both doxy and baytril. The treatment will continue with improvement. The only rats Ive had that didnt improve had tumors in their lungs and heart failure then death not myco  which can have similar symptoms with clicking hooting or wheezing. Make sure you dose correctly check rat med numbersdosage via google search through the rat and mouse club of america website and use syringes. You will likely be dosing them twice a day for    days. Using both Doxy and Baytril usually knocks out the myco within a few days  but the full dosage of the    days is necessary to make sure theyre good to go. Ive had rats that needed lifelong treatment every few months and in old age they needed bayril and doxy daily until death. I weigh my rats on a postalfood scale at home for correct dosing.Make sure to give them daily either benebac or yogurt to keep them from getting diarrhea as the medication kills off their helpful gut flora. Theyll dehydrate from bad poos and then get sicker. I also give my rats Ferretvite from almost any pet store  its a stinky molasses based vitamin supplement that you can give in small amounts. Watch out for your fingers as they will likely try to kill you and bite to get more  female rats love it and males will still probably like it. Its super high calorie  but helps when you have sick rats and they need the calories and pick me up. Do not consider it part of their daily food.... its a snack and vitamins not food.Goodluck!,RATS,cnb1x0x,1,t5_2qnh3

2755801,0,t3_2rmt73,Maybe you could take the entire cage into a closed off rat proof room like your bathroom. Collect boxes and interesting objects and litter them around the room maybe hide some treats around like cereal pieces fresh fruit and yogurt drops. Open the cage and retreat to a corner maybe grab a book or something to keep you entertained and then allow them to come out and explore on their own! This would give them some entertainment start weening them out of their comfort zone and also give them the opportunity to slowly start interacting with you.I used to do this with my girls and they LOVED being able to get out and explore. Make sure that theres a couple of areas or boxes they can hide in around the room close by to the cage so they dont feel totally exposed. If you dont mind sacrificing some towels to nibbles you could even build them an enclosed and secure pillow fort around and covering the cage.,RATS,cnhbmwx,2,t5_2qnh3

Other than that they just slept in their hammock. That said if your rats are that nervous it will probably pay to make sure they are in a smaller cage with less height so they are less likely to fall and have somewhere warm dark and familiar to retreat to like a cube hammock or something. pop it in their cage a few days before the trip so that they have time to decide it is theirs and a nice safe place.

If its only partially blocked i.e. they can breathe albeit uncomfortable you need to keep an eye on them and let them sort it out themselves.From Debbie DucommumBecause of the arrangement of the rats throat true choking is rare.  If your rat appears to be choking the most likely cause is a piece of food or other substance stuck in her throat.  This can cause gagging and drooling.  A rat who is gagging will open her mouth wide and pull her ears back. As long as the rat can breathe dont do anything accept try to comfort her.  Anything you try to do to stop the gagging may make the situation worse.  The offending food will eventually pass down in most cases.,RATS,cq549sn,2,t5_2qnh3

4538463,0,t3_3d896i,Tally was one of the first rats I owned along with her sister and two boys. On the day we brought her home she bit me so hard I bled and pretty much every day after that too. She was vehemently antisnuggles and didnt give a shit about me preferring to roam around the house destroying everything her little paws came across. She beat the hell out of her cagemates and managed to chew through the cage base within a week of coming home. Two weeks ago she started acting strange. She was being really affectionate and wanted cuddles all the time  so we knew something was wrong. At first we thought it was an ear infection then last week we found out it was a pituitary tumour. She went downhill pretty fast and by Friday she could only drag herself around in circles  still bright eyed and determined that nothing would stop her. Saturday she was even worse and we made the decision to have her put to sleep. The vet said that the injection took way longer than usual to take hold. She was a fighter right til the very end. We were half expecting her to suddenly come back to life on the journey home out of sheer stubbornness. I miss her so much already.Happier times,RATS,ct2pc5t,3,t5_2qnh3

4671424,0,t3_3exq69,It sounds like she is very insecure. has she been alone since you lost sweetpea? Thay could contribute to her behavioral problems especially as she is not super comfortable with people either. So from all you have said I gather that at  years old she may be nearing the end of her life she may not do well with attempts to get her a friend and she has developed behavioural problems which especially long term ones are difficult to remedy. My first step would be to make it more difficult for her to get her food. Start by putting it inside a closed cardboard box rather than just in her food dish so that she has to go to the effort of getting into the box to get the food. Id put something with a decent odor in the box to start with like dried banana as well so that she knows where to look. From there try other things get creative. Make her work for it. This will provide behavioural enrichment encourage her to get a little exercise and control her food intake. At this stage you also need to be watching and monitoring her quality of life. Rats are good at hiding discomfort so she may not let on how much the bed sores hurt and if you cant find a way to keep them away long term you may want to consider talking to your vet about whether euthanasia might be the kindest option. Its a hard decision to make but its better to start thinking about it before you have to make the decision.,RATS,ctjdusi,2,t5_2qnh3

4699707,0,t3_3f8ygt,Im going to be a voice of dissent here.I would say that this behaviour is indicative of aggression within the context of the situation.  Junipers cage is her home even if only for a few days  right now it is everything she has in the world.  Her place of safety and security.  And you put a strange rat an intruder on her doorstep.Let introductions take time.  Quarantine is a process that usually lasts  weeks and entails keeping your rats separate from each other in separate parts of your home hopefully such that airflow is not shared.  It entails washing your hands and changing your clothes between handling.Neutral scent eg vanilla essence and territory introductions can be limited to five minutes before separating and waiting until tomorrow to try again.  They dont have to be best friends on the first second or fifth try.  A bathtub is not neutral territory if its in the same bathroom as you roam your rats.You can at this stage place cages about a foot apart or more and walk away.  This allows your rats to get upset about the proximity of the interloper and then calm down because nothing is changing and no one is getting attacked or hurt.  It can acclimatize your rats to each others presence without the stimulus of fighting and make your next bathtub introduction hopefully a little smoother.,RATS,ctmxr1g,2,t5_2qnh3

There isnt really a pattern per se more of a nosew experience full of cutting fleece and making knots no other tools needed except maybe a ruler and chalk if you want to be sure of the measurements and cuts.I got the general directions from this website and pretty much eyeballed it other than to make sure I was cutting  squares and keeping the depth of the cuts relatively consistent which is why its less an actual cube and more a fleecey and contained nest. The website I used was talking about making a  cube but I knew my boys needed a larger size so I cut out six  squares. For the door I just cut an X into one of the panels but you can cut out a circle or other shape or even just a slit. The hammock I made in one of the other pictures is a similar idea in terms of the nosew method but simpler and faster! to accomplish because it takes only two pieces of fleece versus the six for the cube.,RATS,cumno0e,3,t5_2qnh3

If your rats arent big on reciprocating it really exacerbates the inconvenience of cleaning. Maybe you feel like its not worth the trouble. Looking back on my time as a rat owner I should have had a pep talk on the frequent cage cleaning. I thought I could do it less frequently since I was able to train my rats to defecate in a litter box. But they still tracked urine around and that smell prevailed.

Additionally in my undergrad study I saw the multitude of very high flaming hoops that you have to jump through at least in my country in order to get ethics approval to use animals in any kind of research. It is a good system that allows for good scientific progress while limiting the numbers of animals used the suffering they are subjected to and ensuring that they are well cared for. In this day and age animals in research labs in first world countries have to be well looked after also health deteriorationvariations can skew the results which the researchers want to avoid!There is a lot more to this issue than the gut reaction of animal testing  bad. That attitude is what leads to vandalism such as research animals being released into the wild to either die or wreak havoc with the native ecosystem as well as the aggressive targeting and abuse of researchers  including those who simply do behavioural research monitoring well cared for animals from a distance. This is so bad that research institutions that study things that positively affect the animals they use in their research such as nutrition and health have to keep the locations of their institutions secret and avoid signage.,RATS,cwsaa0e,3,t5_2qnh3

5708392,0,t3_3tb9bp,Sounds tricky! I dont think it cant be done because I did it but it depends on their temperaments and how much time youre willing to put into it. Its better to introduce young males to adult males and  months is right around social maturity for a rat theyre like  and  respectively. It will definitely be a daunting task. I personally would see how they react to each other first and DEFINITELY get them snipped! That would reduce any aggression and the young rat is right at the age where that starts up. Also its not too late to get the older one snipped at all.I I got one of mine snipped at   and the change was so dramatic. He went from being a little demon to a sweet laprat. I similarly adopted a  month old and a . year old and introduced them after being neutered. The younger one was scared of the older one for a while but the older one didnt care at all.

I will agree that if hes only around a year old OP should definitely look into getting him a friend as thats still relatively young in the scheme of things.That said OP isnt keeping him locked in a cage constantly and they are making an effort. There are times where an owner can provide enough attention for the rat but its definitely a case by case basis. It is much easier to say all rats need a friend but there are also many owners who have a single older rat and dont wish to repeat the cycle with younger ones. If their older rat becomes miserable with only human attention then they obviously need to make other arrangements. There are cases of learned aggression where a rat cannot be introduced to other rats but does well with human attention. Instead of constantly stressing everyone out with forced intros that will always go bloody its better for everyone if the rat receives as much human attention as they want.,RATS,d03u3na,5,t5_2qnh3

6735719,0,t3_47owg7,Depending on where it is located and how dark it is are you sure its not porphyrin staining that got wiped onto her coat from her nose while she was grooming? One of my girls has pretty much perpetual sleepytime porphyrin production so most days shell have noticeable lines of orangepink running down her sides from it. Otherwise I would have no idea. Buck grease is produced due to excess testosterone although I know excess protein exacerbates it and causes flakinessother skin concerns in both males and females. I would evaluate her diet and go from there. Are you  certain she is a female? How old is she? I would recommend giving her a bath adjusting her diet and seeing if it continues to be producedaccumulate. If it doesnt stop it might not be a bad idea to take a trip to the vet just incase. It could be possible this is an indication of a bigger problem hormonally or nutrition wise. ,RATS,d0g15p4,1,t5_2qnh3
6790293,0,t1_d0lvcpa,Its also worth noting that porphyrin staining would also explain the small amounts blood that OP also found on their fur especially since no injuries or source of the blood was mentioned and thus presumably no cuts or injuries have been found. Granted rats heal fast but they also clean frequently. I would doubt that if a cut did actually leave marks of blood in their coat that it would heal fast enough for you to not be able to locate it without them cleaning themselves up first.However with porphyrin the staining happens while they are grooming cause it rubs off from their nose. I have a girl who pretty much perpetually makes some form porphyrin in her sleep and as a result usually has some slight amount of red staining on her sides just before her hind legs. OP if this is where you found the blood I would literally bet money that its porphyrin and not blood.Additionally the lack of fur that you noticed around his eye could also have been due to either clumping from porphyrin that you didnt quite notice if he has darker fur near his eyes or from a nice thorough cleaning to get rid of porphyrin build up. ,RATS,d0lyv1t,3,t5_2qnh3

7614490,0,t3_4jm7xz,Seed mix in general is not recommended for rats since they tend to pick and choose what they want to eat and they dont get a balanced diet. Rats wont ever starve themselves. For my girls when I got them I had to wean them off the seed mix they were fed before I got them. Just start by each week adding a little more of the lab blocks and less of the seed mix. Lab blocks should be the staple of their diet. If you want to get a little more variety you can try making the Sue Bees Rat Diet which can be found via a quick google search. But I would definitely avoid the seed mix.

Meaning you know how your heart constantly races when you go to get a shot but once the shot is over you go ah that wasnt that bad Thats what it is typically like with MOST rat introductions Not all They will tend to size each other up more and be more aggressive through bars rather than in person. I actually introduced mine before they were even friendly with me. My logic for this is that if they see Jinx My one year old coming to me for treats or to cuddle in bed they as well will understand this is okay and follow her. Rats are followers and also dare devils so if they are in a pack one will push the other to do something and eventually theyll both start doing it. So if one sees the other doing something theyll know its okay to do it as well! Though Jinx has been sleeping in the closet all day and not being a very good big sister to the other two!When you do introduce them just watch.

8292740,0,t1_d5e3d92,Often it is more important for them to get to know their environment when you get new rodents usually they are changing cage bedding or at the very least external environment. The lighting routine lighting type temperature and noise levels are things that can easily spook rodents and so they need to get used to that. Breeders will often sell young rodents filled with curiosity and ready to leave home. In that case then yes sure follow the breeders instructions however OP has used the words adopted skittish and new environment leading me to believe the circumstances are different from what you have mentioned. I did a quick google search to see if my thought train was agreed upon and well here are some quotes from the top three resultsgt After a day or three to become accustomed to their new home you can start getting to know them. Your rat may be a little shy or frightened at first but be patientResult no.gt Let the new rat get accustomed to you at his own speed. Dont take him out of his cageResult no. Result no just talks about prep. If the breeders you are talking to handle their babies often send them in comfortable carriers send beddingtoysetc from the main cage with them and they will be placed in a low traffic low light environment and the babies love strangers then sure in reality though this is not the case in most rat acquisitions particularly not in rat adoptions. A breeders opinion is not fact usually it is specific advice related to the rats they know and helped raise as well as the information you have given them about the home they will go to and therefore cant really be extrapolated to all situations. ,RATS,d5e5gyg,1,t5_2qnh3

8858685,0,t3_51krwm,All genetic variations between so called breeds are generally nonspecific and coincidental.  They are nothing like the breeds in dogs and even there its generally just the size of the breed thats the deciding factor.  So very little can be said about them with certainty as it stands now with the current over all state of rat breeding. Every rat is kind of a mixed bag and a ticket to the lottery its impossible to reliably predict their longevity also because theres such a huge amount of factors in play. Its more useful to look at the health of their parents but even that is not a guarantee of anything. Only furless rats double Rex and tailless rats have their own special kind of problems.  Just make sure to do all the standard things proper diet environment bedding! exposure ventilation to ensure their health and hope for the best. And youll be fine. Know that rats generally dont live very long anyway.  And be prepared to give that all important talk about the nature of life to your kids.     ,RATS,d7coswe,3,t5_2qnh3

9118717,0,t3_5558uu,It seems like a slightly odd position higher on the side where they seem to crop up and the skin on it looks taunt. Maybe its the picture it also seems like the lump is dark ... which I havent seen in mammary tumours. Is the lump very hard or squishy? How long did it take to come on? While mammary tumours are very common rats can also grow big sebaceous cysts. Tumours tend to be squishy at first and can come on very quickly. Also if you feel around it they will seem to be under the skin. Whereas cysts tend to be hard grow over a long period of time and feel like they are inside the skin. If you suspect it is a cyst it can be removed fairly easily. Cysts only need to be removed if they cause problem for the rat. If it is a tumour the only way to buy time is removal. As Wunderbutt said it will continue to grow and the diverted blood supply will also weaken the rat and almost inevitably get infected through it rubbing on things or just breaking open. You could always try to have the lump aspirated but unless its an abscess another possibility not much is likely going to be found. ,RATS,d87x768,0,t5_2qnh3

All those have a protein that causes cancer in male rats.   Treats should be a couple times a week. This can be yogis plain Cheerios baby food etc. Stuff like chocolate is okay as well very rarely.  Protein like eggs and lean chicken should be given to younger rats once every couple of weeks otherwise very rarely for older rats.  They dont need a lot of grain but you can put organic uncooked pasta and organic grain cereal in their daily food like I do. Its  bags of oxbow per bag of cereal and noodles.

10504664,0,t1_dcyp69i,I would suggest if you are not  sure of your rats temperament and even have the slightest doubt then do not put them together.I have heard of peoples standard size rats harming or killing dwarfs. The size difference is ALOT so a small fight can be deadly.As a breeder all of my rats must have amazing perfect temperaments. My female dwarfs all live with my standards. All of my litters of babies are even moved into my main female colony cage at around  weeks old. So all of my girls are absolutely perfect with the babies and the dwarfs. The only issue I have had was when one of my female dwarfs Jane was in heat and decided to nonstop hump all the other girls amp they did not appreciate it lol Watching the much larger girls just push her away was cute. Picture it as an adult just putting their hand on a kids head holding them at arms length!My male dwarfs used to live with my standard males. I also put my baby males in my male cages as soon as they are taken from their mom at  weeks. I have no issues with my males. I prefer to keep my males in smaller groups mostly because they are lazy messy butts lol. So now that I have more dwarfs they are in a cage by themselves. One of my dwarfs started putting on alot of weight living with my standards. We joke that he was trying to keep up with them lol But he has since lost all the weight living on his own. So I think it kindof helps. All of my rats must get along with everyone else. Just the other day i actually switched cages around and put groups of males together. I love being able to just put anyone together at any time with zero fuss or intros. No one even batted an eye. ,RATS,dcytd0a,4,t5_2qnh3

10525093,0,t3_5lx2cd,Age is just a number that rat doesnt look so old to me. If you know for a fact that is her age she is in great condition! Id say if she doesnt have other health problems get it removed. There is a risk that she will get another one since she isnt spayed Im assuming but its better to get them off if you can.Tumors will continue to grow until the kill the rat. I understand a vet possibly saying she shouldnt have surgery because of the risks if shes very old or has health issues but if they just said its fine Id be worried about how much they really know about rats. My vets have always recommended removal they actually want to remove them before I do. I always waited a bit for the hormones to calm down since they came in cycles and the chance of another tumor popping up right away is higher if you get them removed immediately but I spay them all now. If you get surgery make sure the vet knows what they are doing and can be trusted enough to perform surgery on a rat.,RATS,dd14tmm,2,t5_2qnh3

There are tons of recent scientific lab studies that have disproved the negative rumors around the use of kiln dried pine for rats and both Aspen and pine are safe.

11062801,0,t3_5xwwx4, Critter Nation cages are made of a bunch of hollow metal tubes and tiny connection points. If the cage is hosed or doused with water moisture can get trapped in those hollow components little crevices and cause rust over time. If you do need to hose it down I would leave it in the hot sun until youre confident that any trapped water has evaporated. I just finely mist the cage with a cleaning agent and use a sponge cloth or soft dish brush to wipe it clean. Place the litter pan where theyre most often pooping scoop all stray poops into the litter at least twice a day. Some rats are just better about it than others. A pee rock can help too. Ive temporarily housed four boys in a single unit and it was just fine. I just made sure that every square inch of the cage was utilized and there were enough hammocks and hideouts for everyone. To block the levels you can just rotate the top level pan so the cutout is not lined up with the opening. You can just put cardboard coroplast or a tile or something to keep stuff from falling through the open corner of the pan. You could also just take the bottom level pan without the cutout in the corner and use it on the second level. Drs. Foster amp Smith is my favorite source of supplies.

11274368,0,t1_df9wg7m,Intro outline and days spent on each step  Let the new rats settle into their new environment for a day or two with minimal disturbance.  Smell intros  days. Cages in separate rooms. Regularly swap blankets hammocks toys etc. between the cages of the new and the resident rats. After a little while swap the rats themselves to explore the cages of the other. This keeps the initial introduction small and focused on smell.  Sight intros  days. Add sight to the equation by putting the cages in the same room and incrementally moving them closer together over the course of a couple days continue to swap smells as well. Do not put them so close that they can grab tails or otherwise reach each other.  Shoulder intros  days. Place two rats at a time on your shoulders and walk around talk softly pet them offer food and generally act distracting. This allows the rats to start a tactile introduction without giving them the ability to  focus on one another. You want them to start gaining familiarity with the presence of the other but without letting things escalate too far too fast. Spend as long here as you feel they need.  Neutral territory. at least  days but as long as is needed When theyre ready create a neutral territory that does not smell like any of the rats and is not a familiar location. Put some treats and toys around and let them get started with a playdate! These should be HEAVILY micromanaged to prevent the setbacks that can be caused by negative aggressive interaction. Put a glove on just in case sit next to them and get in the way redirect offer treats etc. frequently to prevent any one interaction to go on so long that someone snaps. There are many videos and many writeups online that offer neutral territory tips of various kinds. Theres a bit of an art to this so I recommend some research here! This is the most important step to be patient with  Introduction day! a Clean the everloving crap out of the cage theyll all be going in. Clean extra thoroughly. Use an unfamiliar smelling cage cleaner. Rearrange things. Move shelves. Take out toys that smell familiar temporarily and give them new hides and toys. Run the hammocks through the wash twice. Etc. No one should feel like this cage is my familiar territory. b Have a bath adventure! Put the rats together in the bathtub. Concoct a messy slimy delicious glop of apple sauce or smoothie or yogurt or pudding etc. and slime them with it! Sit back and watch them go to work enthusiastically licking it of themselves and each other. When theyve finished soap them gently with a little oatmeal pet shampoo and rinse off some very clean rats. And then plop some wet rats right into their newlycleaned cage! At this point theyll all be acquainted because of all the playdates AND theyll have just spent time going through the bath thing together and will smell like the same mix of yummy food and oatmeal shampoo AND there wont be a familiarfeeling cage for anyone to feel inclined to defend. Theyll still want to establish a bit of a social order and theyll still bicker at first but youve basically broken the ice slowly and carefully instead of all at once and this will help ensure that the bickering wont ever get severe. At that point let them work it out but remain nearby and within earshot for a few hours in case of any problems. If there ARE problems not likely back up to neutral territory playdates again and repeat the process again from there as needed. Hope all that helps! ,RATS,df9xlsc,6,t5_2qnh3

Those are the costs of meds for two rats though so not sure how it would change treating only one. I would have at least  to spend on meds if I were you.Can the owner pay some of the cost?Dont have time to add much else but youre doing a really good thing taking care of these rats. I dont remember your original post why were they so sick and unhealthy when they arrived to you?,RATS,dfxaqis,2,t5_2qnh3

11547052,0,t1_dg4qw0k,Ive heard of people keeping up to five or six rats in a single but thats a little bit of a squeeze in my opinion. I kept four boys in one for about a month and it worked great. I used a second shelf to create more usable floor space and everyone had lots of space to run around and lots of places to sleep cuddled together or alone if they wanted.I probably wouldnt do more than four but its plenty of room for three. The single is a little under  ft so that would be almost  cubic feet per rat. Very spacious. edit the Rat Manor is a little under  ftFor reference this thread has pictures of a sidebyside comparison of a Rat Manor and a Ferret Nation the sister cage to the Critter Nation same size so you can see how much bigger the Critter Nation is.One downside to the single unit Critter Nation is how short it is. You pretty much have to bend over or kneel down every time you open the doors unless youre  feet tall. Also Critter Nation cages like the Feisty Ferret are made from a lot of hollow metal tubes and they have a ton of tiny little metal connection points. If water gets trapped in these hollow components and tiny crevices rust can form over time. You have to be careful how you clean them they cant just be hosed down in the backyard. I finely mist mine with a cleaning agent and gently wipebrush the bars clean.,RATS,dg4uzy9,1,t5_2qnh3

11579672,0,t1_dg8k3up,Oh I see that limits things a bit. I had a series of boys on fleece for a while and I found that I would need to wash it pretty frequently as it absorbed the smell of the urine even after washing with hot water amp regular detergent. I have heard that using a bioenzymatic detergent with fleece will help loosen the urea crystals from the fabric but never got a chance to try it myself as I switched to a different cage and aspen. Good luck!,RATS,dg8k94z,1,t5_2qnh3

In my experience females tend to be accepting of each other no matter the agesize so she could be happy with another baby to romp around with an old lady to annoy or anywhere in between!,RATS,dgnjnd6,3,t5_2qnh3

She is also the closest breeder to my area. Im sorry if I was ignorant i just imagined if you wanted really well raised rats you were going to have to cough up some coinage. As for all the other supplies I guess its subjective. Depends on what you want to get. Im ordered my food and bedding online in bulk so I have to pay shipping. I actually pay about  for both food and bedding so actually I misspoke when i said  for food and  for bedding. My bad gt.lt.,RATS,dgue5dv,2,t5_2qnh3
