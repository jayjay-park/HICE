8888786,0,t1_d7g5k2r,At  hours of blc my in game time right now is  days... this is very very far from his area of expertise. I wouldnt be surprised if I was the same rank as him in OW season  a higher rank in cs go a higher rank in league when I played a higher rank in dota etc. And I promise you I could destroy him in blc or brite. That doesnt make my arguments any more valid does it?An argument from authority is fallacious anytime it replaces reasoning. Its no different than putting something that you need to prove in your premise so that you can get around arguing for it. Theres a difference between saying xyz because Dr. Bob said so in this paper the response to which is to look up the peerreviewed paper and fact check that before moving on something that can be a necessity when dealing with complex enough topics built upon previous research and arguments and saying this is true because Dr. Bob said so and hes a doctor. gtTo respond to your first point yes I even admitted that the system is altogether useless if players already know how to use their skills. Its only benefit would be to limit sustain in v situations as a benefit to the nonhealer.Theres absolutely no need to limit sustain in v situations to benefit the nonhealer. This is not a v game it should never be balanced around artificial v situations.gtAnd to your second point I get that the heal stacks remove agency but altogether I dont think that its such a big deal since heal cooldowns are already fairly low at  seconds with  allies. There are in my opinion bigger contentions to fix like movespeed before we focus on heal stack optimization and its necessity.Not a problem at all and not a priority problem are two very different things. How SLS organizes their time is not something Im either privy to or have any control over. All Im doing is pointing out areas where the game can be improved and this is definitely one.

8991910,0,t1_d7sl3qr,The core fighting game mechanics are very similar in BLC and battlerite thats why Im playing it. It just comes down to streamlining and making something easier to get into without sacrificing much. I used to think like you are now when the latest SF came out because I thought it was really boring with the combo execution being a joke but I learned to appreciate why they made that change.So high level play is all about the mental battle once you reach a certain tier of skill mechanics take a back seat because everyone can do everything. By making combos easier more people can get into the heart of the fighting game which is that mental battle.  Otherwise people have to spend hours and hours in training mode to get a combo down. I believe this is true with BR as well. Just because the execution is easier doesnt mean the mental battle suffers it means more people can get to that level of play quicker and once you experience that you have a good chance of sticking around thus the player base should grow. And like I said before dont think just because execution is easier that a beginner will beat a pro the more experienced player will always win because of their knowledge and experience of being in situations  time and time again that the beginner lacks. Theres so many connections I could make but I dont want to drag this post on too much. ,BattleRite,d7sot97,2,t5_3cpt0

They think oh i should attack the healer and waste the entire game getting kited around by the healer while contributing very little.It also depends on the enemy composition and the healer you are playing and how many enemies commit. No one is getting killed in seconds in BR. It could happen in BLC but not in BR unless you make some very huge mistakes.If  of their dps or even all  are blowing all of their movement abilities to jump on to the healer you in this case you already have the upper hand. They are all ready for your team to capitalize on them while you jump out. Depending on which healer you are you can even attack them along with your team assuming you can CC one or more of them you may not have to run away right off the start. If you do need to run always move to your team. Its a kneejerk reaction to jump back and away but that just moves you farther from your teamates that could potentially help you.,BattleRite,d7w7n56,1,t5_3cpt0

9057234,0,t3_54bdqb,There are so many statements which bother me too much where I question if the guy has even made proper research.First of all can we just stop comparing Battlerite with classic MOBAs like dota and league? Yes they share the same genre  but  Battlerite is an arena brawler  a sub category of MOBAs. Even at the first sight no one would ever say that Battlerite is a Dota or League clone. Wondering howyou  can hate those games if you dont even know what they look like.Its like comparing football with table tennis because they are both sports. CSGO and no random bullshit ? Hasnt played CSGO ever in his life prolly.and dont screw up the gameplay with awful fp system.   For all here. Battlerite will be fp in Q . But I give the youtuber the benefit of the doubt and assume he means that they dont fuck up their fp system by not  having a proper anticheat system and pw elements.bt I think battlerite will become a nice niche esport title. There is already a proper spectator mode we already have the possibility to view past games like in CSGO to analyze gameplay and the gameplay is super smooth and there is no cluster fuck.Unfortunately we dont know what the road map looks like so we have no idea what features they are focussing on which make predictions regarding competivity very hard.,BattleRite,d80j92k,1,t5_3cpt0

9060070,0,t1_d80p789,I definitely disagree.  He can pump out damage if left unchecked and his buffs are actually quite strong.  With the double wuju hes really evasive and he has a decent amount of support which makes him pretty good as a long ranged dps.  His ultimate also does a ton of damage  damage if all your hits connect on a single target plus  if you already had judgement on them.The thing with varesh is you really have to spend some time playing him to understand what does the most damage and how to play him.  spamming mouse one is usually a terrible option compared to hitting a couple ms for example.  And shatter shouldnt be reserved only for consuming his buffs it has a really low cooldown so you should use it to zone and spam it often.Anyway I dont think Varesh is weak at all.

I felt terrible about my gameplay but I loved the game so much that I wanted to improve I wanted to be among the best. So I just kept practicing and focusing and learning as much as I could.

9114742,0,t1_d878u2x,God where to start?Rush is the most predictable skill in the entire game. It has a super long cast time and propels him forward until he collides with something or blasts right off into the middle of nowhere. Its essentially only ever safe to use this skill if the enemy is backed up against a wall that way if you miss you dont shoot out of the arena and have to waddle back since you have no other mobility. Rush is great if it lands but its so damn slow to start up it should rarely land. And if they make it whiff youre very much screwed immediately you have nothing to save yourself from eating a ton of damage even if you throw up berserk and its triggered you only get a second of invulnerability. Your hitbox is massive so youre just going to eat hits.He has no real poke. His rock toss is very slow and even if it hits the enemy can just back away so that it knocks them in a favorable direction. Its an okay zoning tool but being unable to contribute any real damage or control or generate any energy at a distance makes Rook even more reliant on his extremely unreliable Rush since you do nothing at a distance. I mean you could throw meat but where will you even get the energy for it? And why would you spend  on a mediocre middamage projectile with a brief snare? Which ties in toHis energy dependency. For a guy that has trouble closing and sticking but also cant do anything unless hes wailing on the opponent in melee Rook needs a lot of energy to even survive. His one CC skill costs energy and is also dependent on the enemy being positioned near a wall his sustain costs energy his mediocre projectile costs energy and of course you still ideally want to get enough energy to eventually drop an ult because Rooks decent ult is one of his saving graces.Berserk is almost a trap. Its the most predictable trance in the game even moreso than Siriuss trance that is often cited as one of his big weaknesses. Except Siriuss trance lets him get in and out if its triggered successfully Rooks trance just lets you stay in and gives you no recourse if the enemy jumps out. And thats if you trigger it to begin with. Again as the most predictable trance in the game you will more often than not activate it and be left standing there looking like an idiot and then shortly afterwards youre dead because your hitbox takes up half the screen and you have no tools available to not die.Basically Everything. Everything is the problem with Rook. He fulfills no role on any composition nor is he strong individually.,BattleRite,d87g0s4,10,t5_3cpt0

Paying for extra content is the only way theyre going to make any money.  If you want games to be free to play you have to give yourself a budget to invest in that game based on how much the game is worth to you.  If you play it more than a  AAA title then you shouldnt have a problem forking over  to pay for the content you want.  If youre a casual gamer and only play once a week then paying  to get a hero youve been looking at every once in a while shouldnt be an issue.

Your feet should be shoulderwidth apart with one foot slightly ahead of the other karate stance.Squat down bending at the hips and knees only. If needed put one knee to the floor and your other knee in front of you bent at a right angle half kneeling.Keep good posture. Look straight ahead and keep your back straight your chest out and your shoulders back. This helps keep your upper back straight while having a slight arch in your lower back.Slowly lift by straightening your hips and knees not your back. Keep your back straight and dont twist as you lift.Hold the load as close to your body as possible at the level of your belly button.Use your feet to change direction taking small steps.Lead with your hips as you change direction. Keep your shoulders in line with your hips as you move.Set down your load carefully squatting with the knees and hips only.Keep in mindDo not attempt to lift by bending forward. Bend your hips and knees to squat down to your load keep it close to your body and straighten your legs to lift.Never lift a heavy object above shoulder level.Avoid turning or twisting your body while lifting or holding a heavy object.,BattleRite,d8f36ga,-1,t5_3cpt0

His stream is largely an act I agree he went overboard in league but since then hes been a lot more relaxed in other games Ill agree be was a lil ragey while playing battlerite but he was still saying a lot of good about the game. He really isnt as extreme as people make him out to be getting himself banned on league brought him into the spotlight maybe not the best of methods but it gained him a ton of visibility and now his stream following is huge. I understand not liking to watch his stream I just dont think we should be stopping big streamers from advertising this game because I want this game to grow and tons of new players will see it anytime a big streamer plays it. He only had good things to say about the game and he recommended people buy it maybe others dont see it the same but more people playing the game sounds like a good thing to me.

The new interface is pristine the replay system is unique to dota and there are zero pay to win or extensive game time advantages. Gotta say though and Im not sure if this going to be indicative at all of valves direction with dota Im a tad concerned with the things theyve been doing with csgo.

9373295,0,t3_58xpcn,Sorry but I just have to ask what part of this game is a grind? You face different opponents sometimes not every match you play and anything can happen during these matches. Title the post The amount of time it takes to earn free cosmetic items is too long instead mate.When a newer player hits lvl  with a champ Im pretty sure that person has got a good feel for the character and either enjoy himher or move on to another one. I mean you play characters you enjoy because its more fun right? Having fun is the ultimate goal of games or am I wrong? I agree with you on that the feeling of progression is fun but it simply does not matter how long it takes as long as its something you enjoy doing.Since you mentioned your own experience I might add mine as well Ive played half of the rooster to level  which still makes me a newer player in this case and the rest is somewhere around level . These  hours Ive played the game has not only given me a lot of fun but also enough loot to give me duplicates in almost every box I open and even this is still a small progression since tokens are rewarded instead. Its a damn shame though that I have to put time into learning a character I dont know very well to get a bit faster progression on the cosmetic side of things being encouraged to learn another champ sure is a drag..Play the game in the way you think is fun my friend and all of you other newer players! Dont encourage yourselves with meaningless cosmetics play instead and have fun getting better as this will improve your experience of the game unlike that glowing Bakko shield. Use your money on whatever you want food toilet paper or maybe a golden chest? One thing is certain none of the alternatives will change your experience in the arena and isnt that great?,BattleRite,d944qym,1,t5_3cpt0

9385202,0,t3_5909zm,Im really not that fond of supports in this game in general. I understand some people like the role but they feel out of place in such a game in my opinion.Its simple when I play against a team with at least one support and we dont have one it feels like I have to massively outplay them chain CC focused and synchronized bursts etc while one slight mistake on my teams part means instant loss.I think they just really heal too much or do too much damage. Personally I like that they actually do damage it means that supports have a fighting chance against anyone in v scenarios and such.The problem is if they have that much damage AND healing AND usually top disables then why would you ever take something else?On a side note Pearls weapon charge on dive battlerite has to go. It completely invalidates EX. People said the same about Jade if she wants immaterial she can use her EX Q ability.

9459553,0,t1_d9eneow,I would highly recommend checking out some of the scrims on neewhas recent stream if you dont think s requires more team play than s. The high level streamers always play s with comms but dont always do so in s. Theres a good reason for this. In s there are so many things going on that you basically have to have callouts or else youre going to get swamped by information overload. You can no longer see all of the important parts of the field at once since there is more time in which both whole teams are not entirely visible. Even as a spectator it is overwhelming unless someone is talking you through it. Therefore callouts are extremely helpful if not absolutely necessary in s whereas you can keep track of cooldownsenemy positions precisely in s because there are fewer things going on.There are lots of things to call out. You call out when an enemy uses an important cooldown when an enemy gets low so your team can collapse when you need a peel when youre about to make an initiation and when you want to reset meaning your whole team backs away from the fight to recover cooldowns. If you dont coordinate these things your shifu might hilariously javelin across the map only to lose  of his hp because the enemy team turned on him and he didnt have your support whose fault this is is irrelevant to the point.In some sense proper callouts are a form of purely individual execution because there isnt much decisionmaking involved in calling out the important things. It is a skill that needs to be personally mastered and its one that is far more important in s than it is on s because of the sheer chaos that can arise in s if all three members of the team arent in sync. In s this is not as big a deal because you can parse everything and react instinctively to situations e.g. its much easier to tell when your teammate is in trouble.NB Im not saying that s requires no coordination at all but for high level players callouts have much more utility in s than in s because it is much easier to miss something important in s.,BattleRite,d9f2d9e,2,t5_3cpt0

In the most general sense turn times are faster than even the fastestturning Dota characters with specific moves such as the two you mentioned as well as Jade ult Iva ult Iva R and some others. Even then theyre like a slowturning Dota hero or a fastturning Dota hero with Sticky Napalm on them. It makes sense with those abilities so you cant spin around and destroy everything. It forces your threatdefense radius into a cone instead of a full circle but its not like Dota where you literally have to stop to attack and cast spells even if the spell already has a cast point built in.

9736444,0,t3_5ejp7f,Jokes on you. Used the video to meet hot single girls in my area. Dopamine receptors are on over drive now. I try not to get too invested in this type of thought because I think Ill eventually get lost ruminating about game theory and topics outside the scope of the discussion but Ill try to keep this relatively contained. Expanding upon the value and implications of current character homogenization is certainly one of the most fruitful foundations to assess potential changes to make the game more interesting.League of Legends has a lot of character homogenization theyre totally alright with every champion having flash for example. The movement is fluid enough and mechanical depth reasonably rich enough that the design works. It is the same reason why you see more one trick pony or restricted champion pool type players in League like you do traditional fighting games. Mastery of the execution requirements and nuance on characters like Lee Sin or Riven at least she used to I havent played the new kit or just the game in a while takes a bit of dedication.   DotAs design is entirely different but intentionally so to accommodate a strategically grounded philosophy. You dont often see as many players struggling to maintain a deeper hero pools because the execution requirement is tremendously simplified to focus attention on rewarding decision making. In this same light it often makes the decision making process a lot more complex than you see in League of Legends drafting in League is pretty much a joke in comparison. The really strong players have massive hero pools and can adapt to many unique styles of play. They do this because it opens up a lot more strategic options. The game is focused off the richness of strategy from team compositions drafting timings adaptive itemization decision making predicting map movement and so forth. Capitalist recently put it well in his video with Thorin Right now Battlerite feels like  strategyknowledgepositioning  mechanical executionreactions. Considering the strategy right now is super flowchartnot complex in tandem with the game playing at a slow pace this design doesnt work. Whatever change does happen ought to be evaluated as a sort of formulaic dependent function that strives to maintain a perfect balance. You dont want the game to have really rich impactful decision making at a pace you cant meaningfully keep up with some critics of speed chess variants would argue for example as this hurts strategically viable tactics and creativity nor do you want players having too much time to make simpler decisions as you limit human error and outplay potential in a game that is more so about mechanics and execution. As a trivial example TicTacToe is incredibly boring when played slowly but mildly interesting if you give yourself say very little time to make a choice. It seems like Battlerite is dressed up to be treated like a sort of LoL type MOBAFighter game with the homogenization and skill shots but it lacks the execution requirements because of the existence of big hitboxes slow movespeed easy input sequences lack of precise movement controlprediction and coordination for team combos are too simple to make this a reality. It doesnt adequately emulate the strategy that traditional and non traditional fighting games possess such as the depth in mind games reads conditioning baits spacing pacing and so forth.  One of the attractive aspects of this game to me at least was the attempted incorporation of the notable cerebral aspects of fighting games evident with canceling abilities baiting and countering punishing predictablelazy decision making. I dont have a problem with omitting some of the mechanical difficulty like multiple frame perfect links so long as the game compensates with something else. I actually think thats an issue a lot of fighting games struggle with overly mechanically complex in certain areas for no good reason when they could be focusing on making the neutral and punish game more intricate.The short term answer could be as simple as working on higher mechanical outplay to support the current lack of strategical depth more harmoniously. The long term answer is going to be basically making the overall strategical aspect of the game richer through Id suggest mainly tenets of sound fighting gameMOBA philosophy. The comprehensive complexity and advantage conferred from controlling andor challenging spacial advantages on the map as well as between characters needs to improve to help create more tension and risk taking. You do this through have more unique intricate and impactful decision making that players have more influence over than they do now. How can the game improve upon mind games reads conditioning baits spacing pacing and so forth? Perhaps some poking abilities could be more viable while also having a stronger degree of commitment that is punishable? More variance in both offensive and defensive options that counter each other by looking at both the speed abilities and cooldowns as well as perhaps introducing more abilities andor battlerites that complicatecounter player tendencies? More opportunities for higher riskreward play that rewards players who can take advantage of their ability to read a situation well?   The intricate strategic nuances of macromicro decision making that can be leverage to outplay take too long to just bring about immediately and require a great deal of theorizing and testing.  ,BattleRite,dad89gj,12,t5_3cpt0

If the opposite is true you will lose much more than you win and move to the appropriate rank quickly as well.Some classes will inherently have much higher scores than others if you do what you are talking about you will end up with a lot of players swapping to said classes.

Heres the answer I always giveBLC BRs predecessor already had automatic tournaments. They worked flawlessly and they were the best aspect of the entire game. There was no buyin but there were rewards. Any number of teams that wanted to play could queue in the qualifier matches and the top  or  or whatever would be placed into a bracket. Anyone in the client could view the bracket and spectate the games being played. Even if you didnt participate or qualify spectating and rooting for your friends or for the teams that beat you was incredibly fun.So yeah the system has already been figured out it just needs to be implemented in this game.

Apart from this youre much closer to the action than you maybe wanted to be.I find that after some practice at least at my level keeping people off of yourself when getting focused isnt that big of a problem if youre allowed to use most of your cooldowns on selfpreservation then youre likely to not take damage. Its when you have to burn some of these cooldowns on protecting your teammate that things get complicated.The fact that your healing isnt particularly good means that youll be forced into sticky situations from time to time.,BattleRite,db50c0q,3,t5_3cpt0

9973971,0,t3_5ic1ni,I feel like some of the epic seasonal weapon skins have been on par with if not better than some of the legendary weapon skins.

For example Pearls staff  the seasonal staff looks just as complex as the legendary skins and also appears to have an animation. This strange decision making isnt limited to seasonallegendary but also occurs with normal epics and uncommon skins. For example  Ruh Kaans epic skins look like basic color swaps  of them has slight embellishment on the crotch flap of the less rare skins.For most games the more rarehigher priced skins and items seem to coincide with more detail or something cooler.

10019487,0,t3_5j307h,I love your guide though I cant really agree with your opinion on Disperse. Youve said yourself that Pestilus has some issues with peeling. Going as far as to say its usefull to get a teammate that can peel. If you take disperse effectively youre giving up being able to move your queen. Which is usefull and instead you get a knockback. This knockback is pretty huge.Ive noticed that the knockback is surprisingly big. I can use the knockback defensively Creating a huge gap between me and the enemy sometimes even big enough to mount when Im v.s. Melees without many  gapclosers. But I can also knock the enemies into spells CC and my Queen. If you took double infest or the moth spread at lv  youre probably not going to get a TON of use out of exploding your queen. Given that your right click deals  damage and the queen deals only  albeit in an AOE and instead your knockback can be used to both Peel for your friend knock people into damage and CC the orb allowing proper orb control If you can move it without launching yourself in the enemy.So it already seems like a pretty good and versatile deal when you didnt take the moving queen but VS melees this is incredible. Especially against Melees that just stick on you forever Ive noticed its pretty incredible to just go inside of them then wait for cooldowns and knock them in a different direction.Im not saying its better than moving queen but its definitely a great pickup to peel for your ally.,BattleRite,dbdkfov,1,t5_3cpt0

Oldur isnt a bad choice but he relies entirely on the use of energy based skills which is hard for new players to grasp.I like the Ashka  Rook advice because Rook is very straight forward and his play style lets the Ashka free cast. Hes also one of the few melee that can initiate without being brutalized by ranged.Ashka  Croak is very good but extremely hard for a Croak player to do well with when they are new.

10346862,0,t1_dcgu0xw,Its not about underestimating how much work goes into recreating a game in a new engine from the ground up. Its about the fact that they didnt even try to thank the people who supported them previously before the remake. They literally went and took BLC and threw it into the garbage only to throw the people who supported the game in the first place in there with the game. The funny part is that they only check up on BLC in the bin when they want to make sure not to make the same mistakes that they did beforehand. Yet they arent even making the effort to  look and try to say thanks to the people that they also threw away below BLC who supported their previous revision of the game that was remade. Its ironic that theyre saying how theyre so focused on not wanting to make the mistakes of BLC yet they end up forgetting the people who supported BLC in the first place. Thats the actual problem. If they even tried to do that Id be more inclined to buy the game. It sucks because I was really looking forward to this game but the fact they treated the people who supported the previous revision of their game so horribly Id rather not advocate such a practice and not support that kind of mindset. ,BattleRite,dcgvk45,-5,t5_3cpt0
10375600,0,t3_5oj3ig,Some Ideas Maybe you could burn  energy bars to perform a universal no damage push that knocks back all enemies around you for a decent distance and maybe also snares for a bit. This would be kind of like a breaker in Mortal Kombat where you spend energy to get the enemy away. So if youre in a bad position and out of abilities but you have the energy to spend you could spend it on that.There could be deadly environmental hazards which if you touch you die instantly. Now you can try to knock enemies into that and you have to be careful not to position yourself to be knocked in there yourself. Not to mention accidentally walking into it. There could be spinning blades or holes in the map that you could fall through.There could be walls of smoke on the map like in SC. You can walk through them but you cant see past them allowing you to be sneaky or avoid enemies by going in and out of there as they try to chase you. Could be a wall of cloth instead.There could maybe be a block button that you can hold to block hits in front of you. Blocking consumes your energy for every hit blocked. Blocking would maybe reduce damage by . You cannot move while blocking but you can rotate around to keep your attackers in front of you. This would be used to try to block a projectile you think is gonna hit you or to buy you more time when being rushed down. Champs with fast hitting attacks would be able to drain your energy pretty fast if you blocked those attacks. You cant block status effects so you can still be stunned or panicked.There could be special doors on some walls. These doors just lead to the other side of the wall. If you walk through the door it locks the door behind you and it remains locked for  seconds. For an enemy to follow you they would have to go around the wall or use a jump.Pressing Z again during haste could dismount you and still keep your mount charging forward like a projectile. It would damage and knock back enemies. Would probably move faster than while riding. These are just random ideas but I feel that this type of stuff would help raise the skill ceiling without bloating the game too much mechanically and making it too complicated for new players.,BattleRite,dck4y3h,2,t5_3cpt0

Only later on the playerbase will be split between ranked and QM as well. Doing it like league has  implications.  They would have to decide on a game mode v vs v but there are fans of both variants from BLC. Not having a ranking system at all leads to the chaos that is QM with extremely unbalanced games.

I dont need some guy who it too incompetent to press buttons to tell me why he thinks that he loses. Due to low to mid level players making up  of the community you have a big enough sample size.gt Why would someone who just started looking at the game today not have a say in what might make Ashka seem less like a generic fire dudeI never claimed that shouldnt in theory it simply is impossible in practice. Character design and balance are connected. If you come up with a new idea for an ability I can already tell you whether or not its broken based on the tools it provides. The problem isnt that shit players cant contribute its that they are under the impression that their very existence entitles them to contribute to things they dont understand anything about. I never cared about HUD or certain other things they we were question about because I didnt consider myself to be competent enough to comment on the issue. The problem with bad players however is that they usually consider themselves to be competent enough to comment on the one thing they dont have a fucking clue about balancemechanics. Due to them being unable to swallow that reality a lot of them ended up pouting. We are always portrayed as the bullies who told bad players to shut up about anything when in reality the only time we did that was when they wanted to comment on the one thing they clearly didnt know jack shit about.gt I dont think Im that important but heres why I am that important.I said that I contributed not that my contributions ended up being important.

Its that simple. How are people supposed to weed out good from bad ideasopinions? Roll a dice? You make your case and convince people. No idea what cotton candy world you live in. Youre entitled to your opinion and I am entitled to telling you that its worthless unless you can actually back up your claims. Saying that you think X should be adjusted without telling me why for what reason how etc. isnt going to convince anyone.gt and sometimes not used for a reasonThe reason is SLS being incompetent and having atrocious communication practices its that simple. People seem to be under the impression that they engaged in the conversation or provided talking points but they didnt. They posted patch notes updated the test client and let us do our thing. We didnt care why they didnt do A or B we simply pushed for the things we considered necessary for the game to succeed since they would never talk to us. The only reason we even created Docs was as a last resort a cry for attention. Sometimes they added  of our suggestions in a single day sometimes they blatantly ignored us for multiple patches in a row. gt nobody wants to work with an assholeGuess I am simply used to a different kind of work environment especially since the term asshole is up to interpretation. The sort of person youd consider an asshole probably wouldnt even get me to raise my eyebrows. And to be honest Id prefer to work with an asshole over people who cant make their case yet constantly wants to have their way. ,BattleRite,ddaxepy,0,t5_3cpt0

10651219,0,t1_ddela5m,gtThe sound of silence  Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel gtgtHello darkness my old friend Ive come to talk with you again because a vision softly creeping left its seeds while I was sleeping and the vision that was planted in my brain still remains within the sound of silence. In restless dreams I walked alone narrow streets of cobble stone. Neath the halo of a street lamp I turned my collar to the cold and damn when my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light that split the night. And touched the sound of silence. And in the naked light I saw ten thousand people maybe more people talking without speaking  people hearing without listening people writing songs that voices never share and no one dared. Disturb the sound of silence. Fools said I you do not know silence like a cancer grows hear my words that I might teach you take my arms that I might reach you.  But my words like silent raindrops fell and echoed in the wells of silence. And the people bowed and prayed to the neon god they made and the sign flashed out its warning in the words that it was forming and the sign said the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls and tenement halls. And whispered in the sounds of silence.gt serena in Entertainmentgt views since Jun bot inforyoutubefactsbotwikiindex,BattleRite,ddelamx,5,t5_3cpt0

11073026,0,t3_5y42pf,I think its alright atm. I do think being in diamond  and higher you should need a very high winrate just like in other games i played such as LoL or Rocketleague and their matchmaking. I also see that its harder now that you can get demoted less people are playing and you have  divisions that you have to climb until you enter the new league.What I have noticed thou is that me being in diamond now some days we get matched against Champion teams  times in a row and have to take a break cause we simply cant beat them. While on other nights we get Diamond teams and sometimes even plat teams. This ofc makes us rise up way further than we could the night before! This does show a bit that it can be quite random. Hoewever i think that is a problem because of small playerbases. Sometimes at  am in EU there are only High diamond and champion teams online that we get matched with. Its a shame but at least we lose significantly less points when we lose to them. so that makes up for it! One  win against a Champion team gives us more than  times as much as one loss against them,BattleRite,den48ho,11,t5_3cpt0
11084482,0,t1_deodwgz,LoL has millions of players and much longer matches. Its not much of a comparison because they want to reward you more for the greater time investment and theyre actually able to provide teammateopponents of equal skill.All i was trying to say is that looking just a win ratio isnt very telling because of battlerites small player base. You should climb with a  win ratio if your beating people ranked higher than yourself.

11408967,0,t3_62nz3n,Honestly I dont mind an unbalanced game to an extent. I mean if everything was balanced perfectly then there would be no meta. No meta and there is less coordination. I mean if something is obviously unfair then change it. However there is a difference between something being unfair than something being strong. If something is strong then there is always something you can do to counter it or outplay it. That is something I do not mind. I also do not mind some champs being less effective than others. Reason I dont mind it is because if Battlerite has say  champs and every single one of those champs is perfectly balanced. That leaves  champs to pick from. However not all champs will work together properly. Meaning that in Solo Q you could get some terrible comp because there is no meta and no coordination. Metas maximize the likelyhood of getting a good comp in Solo Q. This is obviously my opinion but I honestly dont see a problem with less effective champs.,BattleRite,dfp6yx5,3,t5_3cpt0

It would not affect balance because the maps would still be symmetrical.Its a bad idea it makes the game feel way more repetitive than it has to.LoLDotA maps arent symmetrical and I dont think the map is a square but a rectangle.gtBattlerite will soon be free to play none the less LoL has hundreds of millions of registered accounts and only millions of active players.Battlerite has a pretty bad player retention on average only about . of owners play the game on a certain time and soon itll likely drop down back to around ..SLS needs to add variety to the game I believe thats the only way the game can keep players.,BattleRite,dgeargk,1,t5_3cpt0

11663042,1,t3_66edud,Well... Im gonna be that guy. Its not a bad idea to spend resources in the form of energy and CDs to deny the rune for the enemy team. Get it for cheap if you can sure but youll get quite disadvantaged if the enemy get it just because you didnt want to spend one stick of butter.Just before I saw this post I won a game because I CCd the rune. Sudden death my lucie vs a sirius He wants the rune I Clarity it so he couldnt pop it and I got it instead. Have done similar things with Vareshs EX Shatter. Sure it cost me energy but I got it back  a bit of hp instead of the enemy. Totally worth it. Very situational though ofc.,BattleRite,dgi0ray,2,t5_3cpt0

11683849,0,t1_dgk5lh1,Have you seen some of the latest concepts in our dev blog? Art styling has been the lowest priority on UI . the new UI I am working on so far. I thought this was pretty obvious from my concepts so far.Flexibility scalabity and usability is our key goals for the new UI both for players and for us developers too and whats being concentrated first is the navigation and layout  creating optimal space for everything Battlerite needs.But the art styling what you refer to as UIs themeing is still going to be an important part. Riot spent a long time  years with  artists that doesnt count developers or something... redesigning their LoL client and the art styling and themeing it to LoL was very important to them in fact it was one of their core goals for this redesign they did a presentation on this at GDC . I think the reason no one talks about art styling on UI is because good UI goes unnoticed when its working well. Just because people dont talk about it doesnt mean its not important. Neuroscience tells us that people arent always aware of why theyre perceiving what they are. Thats a really important part of being a developer and UI designer. Someone says X is because of Y but in fact what you later found out is it was because of Z. Reality  human perception.,BattleRite,dgkdqt4,8,t5_3cpt0

11748002,0,t3_67h02h,Its only bad right now because making incomparables of similar power is actually really freaking difficult.The intent is obviously to make all Battlerites more or less equally desirable while also being incomparable or at least make each one desirable in an equal amount  of different situations  if that makes sense. Few are straight up stat boosts most of them add some kind of effect or additional interaction. Most of Vareshs do at least and as a Varesh main Im mostly happy with where his rites are.
