8489519,0,t1_d62iwhe,yes! Its all about praying for spiritual things praying that they will be aware of the spiritual blessings mentioned in verse . Its surprising to me that he doesnt pray for them to be holy or to resist temptation.,biblereading,d62qjy1,1,t5_30xvn

8538324,0,t1_d68p2o9,Hi thanks. I dont know how many people go back through old posts and read things but its good to have this here for reference.,biblereading,d68uvm5,1,t5_30xvn
8592782,0,t3_4xh14p,Its interesting that there are two other places where the armour of God is mentioned.  Isaiah  and  Thess . Neither passage is as clear as this one. Does anybody know how to get Versebot working?stand your ground ... Is  says If you do not stand firm in your faith you will not stand at all. and  Cor  says Be on your guard stand firm in the faith be courageous be strong. Do everything in love.I was just thinking that the armour that we are to wear sounds a lot like the character of a Christian that Paul has been talking about earlier in this epistle righteousness chapters  truth  complete faith in God chapter  salvation  knowing all that God has done for us in Christ chapter  readiness to proclaim gospel of peace . I dont recall any references to the word of God earlier in Ephesians. And prayer Paul demonstrates that in his two prayers for the Ephesians in this book.His second prayer  is interesting to read in the light of the spiritual warfare in this passage. It is almost that he is praying for the same thing as them putting on the armour of God. I dont know why Eph  says and having shod your feet with the preparation of the gospel of peace.  Youre just to be ready with the gospel of peace. He doesnt actually say we are to be proclaiming it. Its just about being ready. What does it mean to be ready or prepared here?vs  gives some nice teaching on prayer maybe someone else can expand on this. Paul also asks for prayer for boldness  twice! and hes in jail chained up somewhere. I think that letters have to be hand carried eg. by Tychicus. I think that the Roman courier service Cursus publicus was only for official matters but I could be wrong.Grace to all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with an undying love,biblereading,d6fosi4,3,t5_30xvn
8726821,0,t3_4zkcfj,God speaks of the final judgement against all nations all for the sake of the salvation of His Church! Jerusalem He says will be a heavy stone that will hurt all who lift it. But here He speaks of Christ as Scripture elsewhere describes Him as the stone the builders rejected the cornerstone the stumbling block which will crush all those who trip over it those who cannot accept the scandal of God crucified for their salvation!And God says He will give salvation to the tents outside the city first  to the poor and lowly. The feeblest among them will be like David and we know of course that salvation came in Christs birth not in the royal halls of Jerusalem but in a lowly stable in Bethlehem.And the house of David will be like God like the angel of the Lord! The house of David is brought to its culmination with Jesus Christ the king of Davids line who reigns forever and who is in fact God sent by God.And God says they will look on me on him whom they have pierced. God Himself pierced upon the cross risen from the dead and now appearing before all the world bringing judgement upon the nations!,biblereading,d6whu77,3,t5_30xvn
9347409,0,t1_d90b6ry,gtIm not certain either if they thought he was crazy or if they were trying to protect him.Probably a little of both but Im leaning towards they thought he was crazy.Imagine growing up with your family and you have a brother a good kid. You never saw him be mean or sinful but the leap from good kid to claiming to be the Messiah is huge! Im sure they were thinking about themselves too imagine the talk back in Nazareth so your brother is King of the Jews huh? What does that make you the Queen of Egypt lol?,biblereading,d90unn6,2,t5_30xvn
9766578,0,t1_dagu3a1,Thats true the mans testimony added to Jesus word. In John  Jesus answered them Destroy this temple and I will raise it again in three days.  Thanks for pointing that OutReminds me somewhat of Eves little addition to Gods command in Genesis .,biblereading,dagy4h1,1,t5_30xvn
11030971,0,t3_5xiamq,Something tells me that there should be a therefore at verse . What is it there for? But anyway the root cause of the passions is rebellion against God. Instead of admitting there is a God and that he wants us to love and obey him willingly we do the exact opposite and run as hard as we can away from him. If he goes north we go south. If he goes east we go west.Paul is addressing more than just homosexuality I think. Rome at the time was anything but good and holy. They would take children as prostitutes and there were even thesis bring written defending pedophilia and such.They is us all of mankind.God views all sin the same. Its just how many are affected around us by the sin. What are the consequences of causing a riot? You might not be hired to work in a good work environment because people know you dont respect authority.,biblereading,deic33n,3,t5_30xvn
11235714,0,t3_604u12,gtWhat does it mean for the promise to rest on grace?The promise of salvation is given by grace a free and unmerited blessing not by our own efforts or works. This makes salvation available to everyone not just those who have inside information to follow.gtEven when his and Sarahs aged bodies indicated that they couldnt have a baby Abraham didnt waver in his faith that God would give him a child. What are some cases where we believe in Gods promises despite the evidence before our eyes indicating otherwise?Death comes to mind ... from everything we can see and what science tells us when we die we cease to exist ... there is no proof of afterlife or the continuation of our souls. And yet we have faith the God will keep his promise to us that our souls will be resurrected to paradise.gtGod is described as he who gives life to the dead. What do you think this refers to?I can see a couple possibilities ... the first to come to mind is that He brings us spiritually dead people to life with faith by grace.I could also see this referring to the power of creation when combined with the second part of the sentence.Lastly it could refer to the future resurrection of Christ.I think its also good to remember that Abraham had some anxious thoughts about this as well ... his faith wasnt perfect Genesis . So we shouldnt get too down on ourselves if doubt creeps into our minds either ... we are not perfect,biblereading,df5jwkw,2,t5_30xvn
