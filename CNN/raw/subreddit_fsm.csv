It cant play checkers or tell you the weather today.gtIntelligent beings such as AlphaGo cannot just happen and cannot evolve from more primitive Go players such as bacteria or humans. Intelligence is too complex to have come around by chance. Intelligence can only come from higher intelligence.This is the very ID apologetics that FSM was created to destroy.,fsm,d3d8a7p,1,t5_2qh3m

10383786,0,t1_dcl1scy,I translated the entire verdict which can be found here      PRESSING MATTER   According to the woman a member of the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster the case is a pressing matter because she needs her drivers license to attend lectures religious meetings and visit her social contacts. She travels over . kilometers per year by car and sees the municipalitys refusal to provide her with a renewed drivers license as a punishment because of her beliefs. She judges that the city should give her a temporary license for the duration of this court case and she says this temporary license should also depict her with a colander on her head. She also argues that the question of whether or not her religion prevents her from not covering her head should be answered by the way she lives her life. She is very devout and always wears a colander. She sees this as a rule of her faith even when this proves to be difficult in daily life.      NO RELIGION   According to the city this is no pressing issue and a temporary license is not possible. Also the city thinks pastafarianism is not a real religion.      REQUEST DENIED   The judge has denied the request as this is not seen as a pressing issue. Also the judge cannot order the city to provide the woman with a temporary license. Thirdly the judge judges the woman did not manage to prove that the Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster opposes her usage of a drivers license on which she is depicted without wearing the colander.      It is actually officially recognized as a religion in NL since early . The city is factually lawfully incorrect here.,fsm,dcl2eew,6,t5_2qh3m
