10583045,0,t3_5rh8uk,That makeup and how you dress isnt a goddamn political act. Im so tired of women acting like theyre so brave for wearing manrepelling mom jeans or pitch black lipstick. They always subscribe to all beauty standards but one  beautiful makeup and hair but fat thin and hot but with a shaved head or hairy pits etc. so they still feel pretty but take pride in the fact that theyre being edgy. If its a political act its the laziest fucking political act Ive ever seen. Men in the first world arent oppressing you. Youre not a revolutionary youre not courageous youre just too damn narcissistic to understand that youre pissing in the wind.  ,FeminineNotFeminist,dd7k5gc,30,t5_3d8b3

10608508,0,t1_dd9ya62,I definitely have! I think theyre adorable and theyre on my wishlist but Im in college and my budget doesnt quite have enough wiggleroom for two  pairs of boots in one year! I plan to own a pair someday though! Haha Im so indecisive with colors my instinct is to get pink or red or lilac or emerald green ones because I love bright colors but black or a pretty grey would go with more things... Im conflicted just thinking about it now and Im not even going to be getting any anytime soon! that it would take me forever to pick them out though!,FeminineNotFeminist,dda6pt6,1,t5_3d8b3

10660586,0,t1_ddfj5xk,Cant wait! My wardrobe is in need of an upgrade. Almost  and still wearing t shirts from high school I never learned to shop for that kinda thing. I was never super girly and am just now making the leap. Its hard bc when I try on clothing I still feel like Im playing dress up and that isnt the real me so I dont feel Ive found my style yet. ,FeminineNotFeminist,ddfk41s,3,t5_3d8b3
10690299,0,t1_ddigtou,Yes to everything here. You really want to see a specialist. Really really. Youre very lucky your hair didnt turn green. I wanted to go darker from platinum so I went to Aveda and she gave me a  blonde with an ash developer for a whole head of lowlights. She did my roots with the same stuff so it wouldnt be as obvious when my roots grew in. It looks so beautiful and people think its my natural color. You can get Clairol Shimmer Lights  at Sallys for like . Its better than most of the expensive brands. Lets talk about it. The darker the purple the better. Get your hair wet get a good handful of the purple shampoo and shampoo it up. Let this stuff sit in your hair for a good  min and then shampoo and condition as normal. As long as you are any shade of blonde use this stuff in every wash. Sallys will occasionally have Olaplex but its expensive. Most hairdressers charge an extra  to add it on with your color. I get mine straight from the source because massage therapists fall under the same licensing for some reason Im an LMT. I just bring it with me when I get my hair colored and tell them to use it. Olaplex prevents your hair from breaking after we bleach it to an inch of its life. Its been a total game changer. And finally get yourself a good moisturizing treatment every week. Sallys has their own knock off brand of Paul Mitchells stuff. I love it. If you can afford it and have time I would go get a gloss every few weeks too. The before and after on me  ! ,FeminineNotFeminist,ddimj0e,3,t5_3d8b3

10714393,0,t3_5t2xnj,I would look at wigs or extensions. I had a haircut last summer where they took off way more than I was expecting and I was devastated from midback to less than chinlength. I was growing out an undercut and asked her to sort of blend the shorter underneath layers into the longer hair. Instead she cut it to the length of the short parts then layered it into a version of the can I speak to your manager cut. I got a few wigs and had a coworker whose hair always looked great show me how to style and blend them because Id never worn a wig before she volunteered when I showed up with my hair chopped off and said I was thinking about getting a wig. Then as it grew longer I got clipin extensions. Its finally to about the middle of my neck but I still wear the clipins most of the time because I feel that I look better with long hair. ,FeminineNotFeminist,ddl3yoe,1,t5_3d8b3
10785335,0,t3_5u9070,Streetwear MA bombers joggers sneakers baseball caps with box braids fishtail parkas etc. needs to go away. I see soooo much of it on women in NYC and its not that its awful persay Im just so sick of it! I use to love streetwear but I dont even wear it myself anymore because its so oversaturated among teenssomethings. At the risk of sounding so edgy an MA bomber jacket was my trademark clothing item around  and now its been ripped from my sad little hands.Trends that can stay....is it wrong that I like strobing including that highlightonthetipofthenose thing that some do?

10904676,0,t1_de4pnz6,Totally! Actually for what its worth I was looking at a lot of videos like this because I want to buy a decent camera  so I also viewed this one and found the girl infinitely more palatable for all the same reasons and was able to watch much more of it. Best part? I put both of their cameras on my Amazon wishlist and decided to add a note about which vlogger I found each model from so I could go back and reference when making final purchasing decisions........I wish you saw how many times I refreshed because I thought there was a glitch on YouTube. Its the exact same girl! I thought it loaded my pages weird and attributed the wrong name. Nope. Same girl. Mind blown. ,FeminineNotFeminist,de4qn2m,2,t5_3d8b3
10909918,0,t3_5vnr6k,Okay ladies so we got a really amazing comment  but the user ultimately deleted it and decided against sharing. I will not name the user because this is a personal comment but it was too wonderful not to be seen and I was about to send my response when it disappeared. So here it is below again not my writingSo I think a middle ground between HAES and body shaming is probably best.Ive been struggling a lot with my weight over the last few years. Theres a lot of reasons  my parents are unbelievably neurotic about food and that led to crazy body image issues when I was at a decent weight and noticing weight gain is a lot harder if you avoid both mirrors and scales also going from meals being comprised of fish and steamed vegetables or undressed salad with maybe some fruit to college dorm food results in a lot more than just the freshman fifteen. I also have some incredibly fun autoimmune issues that make weight loss harder while simultaneously increasing the negative effects of obesity.Ive been able to approach losing weight much more diligently after meeting my husband. Hes amazing at being supportive and encouraging without being harsh. Ill be honest if I get upset enough about my weight all I want to do is cry into a tub of ice cream. The hardass approach backfires badly for me. And I have ample experience with that because of my parents who think that being on the heftier side of healthy is an enormous problem. Anyway my husband has made it clear that he cares that he loves me that hes interested in me. He doesnt deny that Id be more attractive at a lower weight but he doesnt offer that opinion without being asked. And he tries to help with keeping the food healthy although he grew up eating rather unhealthy food so thats not always easy. Either way its largely because of his support that Ive been able to acknowledge my weight problem without feeling like it makes me less than human. Which is rather helpful when trying to fix the problem.Aside from wanting to look more attractive my body helpfully keeps an hourglass shape but Im prone to showing weight around my face which makes me incredibly unhappy one of my motivators is knowing my MIL. My MIL is super obese  she probably weighs around  lbs. Shes not yet  and she has an implanted defibrillator thats gone off multiple times which is kind of traumatic to see for the record. She has type  diabetes and horrible knee and back pain. Because of the diabetes shes not eligible for the stomach surgery. Because of the oesteoarthritis exercise is difficult she can swim but its hard to get in and out of the pool. Because of her unwillingness to acknowledge her problems she found a doctor who doesnt criticize her diet. She cant even fit into airplane seats! My grandma was in better shape at  grandma taught a Tai Chi class for seniors until she was about . I found it mildly hilarious that her students were almost all younger than her. And grandma has both inflammatory and osteoarthritis. I really really dont want to end up like my MIL. But I feel like that usually is where sticking ones head in the sand leads.I think a moderate approach is rarer sadly. And obesity is so visible. But we need to have a balance so that someone who is fat isnt going to treat their weight as a taboo thought out of shame but also wont try to claim that their weight is totally healthy although I kind of think thats another suboptimal shame coping technique.,FeminineNotFeminist,de5a49z,3,t5_3d8b3
10947252,0,t1_de65bjq,I wouldnt put too much stock in antireflective coating. First the pictures demonstrating how clear the coating makes glasses are not candid shots they are edited. All glasses will catch some light. In my personal experience antiglare coating is actually visible from up close and it scratches quickly and easily which reduces the life of the glasses. I think it looks better in the long run if you do not spend the extra  on antiglare coating.,FeminineNotFeminist,de94qy3,1,t5_3d8b3
10969460,0,t1_deb95p4,I agree completely!

11352407,0,t1_dfinjs2,I think there is almost always a way to frame interactions positively. So yes I definitely think you dont need to make it an uncomfortable discussion and focus instead on how she can help you as your friend. I would expect most decent friends to respond well to that even if its not on a subject they can relate to. Beyond that Phantom made some awesome points on compartmentalizing the people in your life. ,FeminineNotFeminist,dfirvvt,3,t5_3d8b3
11452060,0,t1_dftmk8s,Teeth whiteners arent bad per se but there are a lot of shady homemade diy recipes that risk ruining your teeth. Use safe verified treatments form trustworthy sources and according to directionsI dont know any bad examples with teeth but people come to skincare forums all the time with chemical burns on their faces from using lemon juice as a home treatment after seeing it online. I suppose there are ingredients and combinations that could be unsafe for teeth tooAlso nakedness is only attractive is the woman beneath the clothes is attractive.
