310600,0,t1_cfcyd19,Have to agree with you on the first ones. Aizen was pretty nice to watch but when compared to some of the characters Death Note features he is far inferior in terms of intellect. But thats just comparing apples and oranges now isnt it?And yeah those characters were extremely annoying to watch at times but they have a place in the Anime so I didnt bother sighing whenever they got screen time.Youre also right on Kurotsuchi although I think hes a character I liked better than some of the others. Hell at times it was far more interesting to watch him rather than hear Ichigos confidence boosting monologues that last  episodes.Actually quite the contrary on all of those. Im in grade school and Im starting high school in a couple of months. As for my English I wouldnt call it the best. I still make huge grammatical errors from time to time. But believe me when I say that Serbian people simply refuse to learn more than their own language. Well the majority at least.,KarakuraTown,cfcyn5i,1,t5_2w9kg

There you are Miwa said clearly happy that they were here meaning that Aries could be helped with whatever was causing him problems and made him faint cause she doubted that it could just have been anything. Was she sick with something? Miwa didnt know even though she noticed Arata look at some medical books since Miwa was no doctor.Miwa gently placed Ariess body down on the ground for the others to check on her. I dont know what happened. We were talking and were gonna try to find you guys when I accidentally got us here with that shunpo or whatever Aries called it and then he collapsed Miwa explained as best as she could looking worriedly at Aries. Miwa frowned at how Aries was being felt up by his own body. That looked so weird. Man I really hate this body. I want my own body back Miwa sighed.,KarakuraTown,cfgftzr,1,t5_2w9kg
347188,0,t1_cfgq0jh,Pandoras head came up as the man took off with Kenzis body. She stood and started off only to stop at the sound of Aries voice telling her to stop. Pan turned to face the red eyed man to see a small Kenziish smile. Ill talk to... me. She said with a gentle smile as she released Tomoko and pet the girls red hair. Ill be right back you all start looking for that lab and send Pandy to get me... shell be able to find us easy. She promised before moving to follow her body.She didnt try to use any of the abilities just followed at a decent trot until she watched her dark hair find its way into a pharmacy. She followed after pushing open the door and crossing her arms at the sight of alcohol on her lips. Thats going to affect you worse then youll be used to. She warned gently. My cancer... makes me dizzy and the alcohol makes it worse. She explained without telling the man to put it down. Shed drank herself stupid when she first found out about the cancer. So Im guessing youre a little... out of your element. She said thoughtfully. I know how youre feeling just be glad Ive only been through a little bit of chemo right now you wont feel to sick.,KarakuraTown,cfgr657,1,t5_2w9kg

2086750,0,t1_cl4nbj9, male in Norway.I am very creative and had to find an outlet for it all and some writing practice if Im ever going to release a book.Well the way my creative process works is often  make a design you like find a personality you want to write then it goes automatically in my mind.I actually have made  Bleach OCs but they kept developing into their own universe so I kept wanting to save them for my own stories. But one day I was like Fuck it Im gonna make something off the top of my head and use that.. So I went on the wiki made a page using a sped up version of my creative process and waited a month before posting.Now Ive made sense of it all.Externally Rei is the perfect woman. Her stature in society was high She was a noble in life and shes aesthetically stunning. But internally she is violent bad with social interactions and to top it all of she doesnt even like men.I use the rose to symbolize this.  The flower what people see is incredibly beautiful but the thing that keeps her up her stalk what keeps her alive has sharp thorns and its color contrasts the red flower people see.,KarakuraTown,cl52lm8,1,t5_2w9kg

Ive stayed up all night trying to solve things and I cant sleep until I have.gtIm actually extremely shocked at the choices made.This is why I asked if youd like to talk. To discuss the problems you have about these things see if we can solver any of them.gtI also find that whatever process was used to determine them was poorly doneIts been done the same way for the past  years Im unsure why suddenly there is a problem with it.gtThe roleplay has a great number of issues that have been addressed in many threads and down voted when pointed out.Unfortunately I cannot control other peoples mouse clicks.gtAs a whole I feel like the reboot is going to turn out into nothing more than a repeat of the current with even more issues than before.Nope Ive got something to do with it. I wont let that happen. Ive already started spamming comments along with some of the other mods Ive noticed doing so to discourage aggressiveness and hostility and lay down the law of the land where stuff like that in concerned. Im also trying to set in place systems so that things that are broken in the current system are fixed or less broken in the reboot.gtThe Stat System doesnt support all the aspects of how the races workNeed elaboration on this I dont follow at al.gta few of the moderators picked as well as older moderators dont belong in the positions given to them.If youd like to discuss it in private again thats why I asked if you wanted to talk.AlsogtThank you andere for actually discussing it with me instead of dismissing my opinion. PYou kind of shot yourself in the foot withgtThere isnt anything to talk about to be honest.Which led me to assume you didnt want to discuss it.Please dont take this as personal btw I love you to bits.
