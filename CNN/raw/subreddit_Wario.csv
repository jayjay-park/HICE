9764312,0,t1_dagnflu,Yeah it might be a bug. But it makes a really distinct noise when it disappears. Kinda like a whispered sort of zipping noise or something. I dunno how to describe it but it sounds like it was intentionally placed there. Also it disappears when you first walk in but when you go up to where the Gold Wario Statue bit is it reappears for a little bit.I was thinking it might be a shadow from one of those ghost orb things that Wario climbs on to but it has a really weird shape that doesnt look like any other enemy in the level.,Wario,dago2vg,1,t5_2u1i4
