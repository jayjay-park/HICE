1367508,0,t3_29r75f,These are really awesome ideas and I think theyll really make the game more interesting. My only worry is that it will be very confusing for newer players who are not familiar with the new system.,councilofkarma,cinpfa5,2,t5_2wtuw

5841714,0,t1_cxlcgeo,It probably does come across as insulting and condescending which Im sorry for. I think at this point people here are speaking as individuals who play this game rather than members of a team. If that makes sense.Which brings me to this Why do you think we want leadership? If you get any extra people from Dark Mirror or Defections theyd be more like rookies. Ok maybe annoying rookies at the start. But the current OR leaders would still be in charge. And no one is calling OR incapable. Ransom and Toucan were on fire today. And Surf Kitty and others are brilliant too. And I respect you and Dan and Weebs and everyone else who sticks around and still comes to battles. I dont know if Id have done the same if it was my team. ,councilofkarma,cxldiv2,2,t5_2wtuw
