Taking on Lv Divide deathclaws which have  HP?  There is no weapon in the game other than the Fat Man which can do that much damage on a nonheadshot sneak attack critical at the Hard level of difficulty Jon is playing on.Plus more HP wont help too much Deathclaws are the real threat here and their damage output scales up faster than gaining HP through leveling up does  damage per  levels contrasted to the  HP gained.

I dont think Ill use companions though but I might since they cant die anymore. Im not sold on increasing END yet though. I like the idea of its bonuses and perks but Im thinking STR might be useful too for unarmedmelee damage and weapon mods. I like Aquaboy a lot though and I have a feeling this game is going to have a lot of areas where itll be useful. Im probably going to focus on unarmed and small guns first then move onto energy weapons at a later level once Ive increased INT enough.

At the highest rank available at level  you can Fast Travel while overloaded and at the penultimate rank move quickly while overloaded at the cost of action points.It works wonders if need to move stuff between normal settlements without supply lines but also for those special settlements you cant ever set supply lines to like Home Plate. Just take EVERYTHING and fast travel. No power armor or strength bonuses required.Its also a license to print money. You can take everything from enemies then fast travel to a marketplace perhaps one youve built and convert it all to caps.,ManyATrueNerd,cysm8ae,3,t5_2zxio
6254367,0,t3_4161hw,Jon seems to be willfully ignorant of the evil shit the Institute has done. My problem isnt with him siding with the Institute but with his reasoning is built upon a fault premise. ,ManyATrueNerd,cz0jxsn,5,t5_2zxio

6279171,0,t3_41lc6j,I gotta say Jon I really disagree with your opinion on the Institute as the best option for the Wasteland. I mean lets think about like this the Institutes main power is synths. Take that away from them and what do they have left? Experimental plants that probably wouldnt grow on the surface some failed FEV experiments and advanced weaponry that would be totally useless in the hands of untrained scientist. Simple put Synths are the only tool the Institute that makes them powerful enough to influence the surface. With that in mind why then would the Institute want to stop synth production? It would severely cripple their operations as they would have less manpower less agents to keep up with surface and would leave them as sitting ducks against threats like the Brotherhood. Even if the head of Institute demanded that the board will stop synth production the actions they discuss in this video would most likely point that they would ignore that action. I mean when they were discussing the problem of the Brotherhood they didnt ask the director Should we do this? They asked How should we do this? While they did ask for your opinion if you went against their opinion they pretty much shot you down and said this is how we are going to do this. The bottom line is the board of directors is only going to listen to your orders if it benefits the institute not whats best for everyone. So given that can we really say that our player character is capable of changing the institute form the inside when almost everyone who woks at the Institute only care for their own goals?,ManyATrueNerd,cz3ddk2,6,t5_2zxio

6283247,0,t3_41lc6j,I gotta agree with Jon here. Being in charge of The Institute  and The Minutemen covers almost all bases of the commonwealth. They produced seeds that grew a Gourd the size of a beachball at Warwick. Virgils research is proof the FEV can be reversed. Theyve produced an amazing reactor. They can increase a humans life span via cybernetic implants. Synthetic Gorillas.  That you can get meat from if you kill them. Haha. Tasty The amazing things of the synth project in general. The friggin teleporter! Hell if we can get them some alien tech theyll probably reverse engineer it within  years. The Institute might be the best hope for the world not just The Commonwealth. Okay there were some snafus under the previous directors with the mutants and all but we can look  past that for the betterment of society and try to help like they did the first time. Only with hopefully far better results due to far better technology this time.Glory be to science!,ManyATrueNerd,cz3u1sw,5,t5_2zxio

So whats happening in a perfect scenario is your super heating the liquid past its boiling point without it boiling. So the water turns to water vapor and compresses Under the surface tension of the water. The vapor cant break the surface tension because the speed of heating doesnt allow the vapor to cumulate into large bubbles when you move or touch the container all the bubbles rush to each other causing the surface tension to break suddenly with  large bubble. The conditions require a very smooth surface on the container and high heat transfer. A old glass or cup a circular container and a long heat time a necessary. So if you break one of those rules use a square used ceramic mug you allow for bubbles to congregate on the imperfections allowing the water to boil. Also breaking the surface tension with a wooden spoon will prevent it.Tldr you are more likely to be hurt by falling on your way to the microwave then boiling your water in the microwave.,ManyATrueNerd,d3zjbi9,12,t5_2zxio

9014191,0,t1_d7vc27f,The fact that you can talk to him  even barter check him down  is why I suspect most of the western characters in the game who comment on him arent seeing the whole picture.  For all his reputation as the Monster of the East hes clearly very calculating  and eminently pragmatic.  Hes much more invested in the stability and overall health of the Legion  and the lives of its soldiers  than we might expect and a lot less invested in conquering Caesars white whale the NCR.Hes really not that well known a figure in the west and even in the east he seems to be more myth than man.  That the Lanius we actually meet doesnt quite square up with the reputation weve gathered elsewhere seems very plausibly intentional.  My suspicion is that Caesar is much more of a liability to the Legion than Lanius is.  Lanius Legion would be I think less highminded but also less bent on selfdestruction. Its a fair point that there are some small things they could have done to give this particular choice a little more feedback but on the whole I feel like not wildly altering the course of the Legion with Caesars death is a reasonable way to approach it and I think is kind of revelatory narratively speaking.,ManyATrueNerd,d7vd62l,3,t5_2zxio

Still the knghts sword has the reach advantage and their armor makes them harder to kill even if you get round their smaller shield bur a well aimed gladius could probably punch through the less protected areas like armpits neck or inner thighs. If they were forced to fight in a tightly packed formation as the Romans would try to do the knights swords would be limited as they benefit from a wider space to be swung while the gladiusscutum combo is a chunking machine in tight formations.,ManyATrueNerd,dgjy1jh,6,t5_2zxio
11685070,0,t1_dgkhn06,In my most recent campaign I rushed units from Sardis to Athens the Greeks attacked me because of it but I fought them off and took Sparta Pergamon and Rhodes. The Brutii had already taken Thessalonica and then attacked me at Athens so I just slowly defeated their armies and beat them back and from there I just made my way into Italy. My armies in the Middle East were also doing the same thing to the Egyptians holding bridges and passes to prevent Pontus from attacking and then I pushed another lot of armies up through Parthia and Armenia to wipe them out. By around turn  I was in Italy and I had taken all of Italy not long after.As long as you hold Salamis Antioch Rhodes and Athens you should have no trouble with money to support this many armies and by taking Corinth and the Statute of Zeus you shouldnt have to worry about public order problems in Italy if you move your capital to Rhodes.,ManyATrueNerd,dgkiqe0,1,t5_2zxio
