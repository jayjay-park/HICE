159896,0,t1_cew2xzk,gt Thanks for the heads up on the third book. I found the third book the least engaging of the three  not hard to understand but not enjoyable in the same way as the previous two because its much more about the nuts and bolts of regression rather than the heartwarming stories and its going over the same stuff you read before. It does have a bit of additional info which can make it worth reading if you have a serious interest.gt Its also interesting for me to think about why the spirit world would leave these clues to us if on the whole were not meant to knowI think in my case this was necessary to correct my life trajectory.Not everyone needs to know. The people who are happy with the makebelieve provided by the major religions probably dont have to. People who just dont bother with the big picture a whole lot also probably dont have to.In my case my problem is that I dont buy into the makebelieve and having access only to what science knows has changed me over the years from a hopeful idealist to a disappointed misanthrope. If there isnt a spirit world most of humanity to me seems hopeless unworthy undeserving and miserable. The explanations provided by Newton are the most comprehensive and compelling I have seen. If I can find to my satisfaction that I can trust them it would both make sense of things and change everything about my life for the better.For many other people it wouldnt really change their lives a lot.gt I did look up a few in my area too and it is interesting because some require you to do a Past Life regression as a prerequisite for the LBL one.I think thats what they generally ask. Both hypnotherapists I talked to did so. Its recommended by Newton in the rd book as the best way for the sessions to progress. He started doing compressed sessions in one go only after he was overwhelmed with clients and time became an issue.gt Are there particular questions you recommend me asking?In my case hopefully the therapist will cover in depth what people usually want to know but I did prepare a list of questions of my own that I hope we also get to explore. These are highly personal questions related to people and events specific to me.,Reincarnation,cewn8py,-1,t5_2u9b9
472477,0,t1_cfshnq3,I actually scheduled a session in two weeks... I am getting more and more excited for it while at the same time trying not to have too high of expectations.  But I feel like everything echoes if you know what I mean.  I feel like Ive had more personal confirmations and everything I read spiritual or science seems to echo each other.I guess my biggest question is still... how do you know that it was real?  are you able to keep in contact with your guide after?  is our worldunderstanding really as backwards as some of the cases suggest?Have you read the fourth book memories of the afterlife?  There is one case in there called Two Suicides saying that both were preplanned... to test the surviving... I guess we wont know what differentiates when someone is simply playing their role or has failed... do you have a better understanding of this having done a spiritual regression and been to the spiritual world?,Reincarnation,cftz1l4,3,t5_2u9b9

4645247,0,t3_3elpi7,I dont have a religion although I wouldnt consider myself Atheist either. The closest thing I would consider myself would be a Buddhist but I see no reason to believe that Nirvana which is the ultimate goal in Buddhism because A. The idea that you experience it yet you are annihilated contradicts itself and B. there is no evidence to believe that it is real.,Reincarnation,ctg3jhl,1,t5_2u9b9
5416955,0,t1_cw3sca5,Hmm your reaction to the idea of PRL indicates something is waiting for you to discover. Look you might have done something really dark in a past life but the operative word here is past. You in this life are not responsible for what happened then. However you can help your karma. If you owe a debt for instance because you took someones life you can consciously decide to repay it. Kindness and love go a looooooong way to bringing balance to ourselves. You might not be able to track down the reincarnated souls of people you harmed but trust me if you want to right your wrongs you will get the opportunities.After all you are here to learn. Life in body is like a simulation. Its  a test to see what you can handle. The real test comes after this life.,Reincarnation,cw42oyo,2,t5_2u9b9
5834694,0,t1_cxjzn5c,Thanks for the editing tips. I will correct.  Actually she was a slave and did stand trial. It was complicated because she was and we all were seen as property . She was tried and returned to the South.  It was quite famous at the time. Her story is so famous people have written books and poems about it. She has been considered a hero to some and my death and my sisters as a  wake up call to the atrocities of slavery.  In retrospect my murder did some good.  Even if it did bring about an atrocious karmic debt between my mother and  all of her children. My mother was mixed race halfwhite daughter of either my fathers brother or another plantation owner and I was  white and my father owned the land where we lived. We were treated very well for slaves. We had a little house and a garden near the woods. My father gave my mother money when he came to visit. You are right we had a lot more than other slaves. Still we were not free. It was a secret that my father was my father. He told me and one of my middle brother before I was killed. My bother told our older brother who was only our half sibling by my mothers husband. He mentioned it to his father at the dinner table one night. He wanted to know why the white man said we were is his kids. That was when my mothers husband decided to flee. He said he couldnt live like that anymore with another man sleeping with his wife. Thank you for responding.,Reincarnation,cxkgecd,2,t5_2u9b9
6293276,0,t1_cyr7cjz,Wow that was quite honestly one of the most disgusting comments on mental health and suicide ive ever seen and as someone whos suffered with mental health and suicidal episodes Ive experienced quite a few people who assume to know what other people think and feel.  I can tell youve had a hard life or perhaps not one thats been hard enough but taking it out on someone whos suffering is cruel either way. You certainly seem to lack the ability to understand others viewpoints which I find surprising going through your comment history.  You cant be a humanitarian without sympathy for others and Im sorry to break it to you but you cant really be an INFJ without empathy INFJ here hello..   Perhaps you should try getting off your high horse and crawl in the dirt with the rest of us before you pass judgement on others.  I hope you learn something in this life and I hope you dont regret the things youve said and done to others.  Try letting some love overtake the hate you have for once you might enjoy it and find some peace.   To the OP.  Take it one day at a time.  I know its hard to believe but life always changes.  Perhaps if you die now youll miss something brilliant.  Or maybe youll miss something that isnt really that amazing but will bring you a little bit of joy.  It took me  years to find my happiness and the only thing Ive achieved so far is my high school degree.  It takes patience to find happiness and its almost never where you think it is.Nothing is pointless.  If you want to come to earth just to have fun do it!  But do it with love.  Life is a gift this is the only one youll have just like this one.  And theres no judgement after death Only in life if you consider the opinions of others judgement  From what I understand the only judging that will happen is like what you already do as a creator of music and art.  If you draw something and it doesnt quite turn out the way you expected instead of crumpling it up and getting upset what do artists do?  They look at it and say Hm its not as good as it could be what can I do differently next time?  What did I learn this time that I can apply to my next piece?  And perhaps even more importantly when you draw something amazing and top even your own expectations of your abilities what do artists say?  They say  My God!  Look how far Ive come!  Judgement isnt negative.  Judgement is comparison and growth.  Give it a day then give it another.  There will always be worse days but there will always be better days too.  You are important as every soul is regardless of your choices or fears.  Give it a month then give it another month.  Keep trying even if trying means just thinking about getting out of bed in the morning or having a glass of water.  It still counts and it will get easier.  The things you enjoy will come back to you but right now all you have to do is continue for one more day and then the next.  Eat drink sleep and then again until things change as they always do. ,Reincarnation,cz4z3ma,1,t5_2u9b9

10522065,0,t3_5qnbk1,The Deities View human extinction as extinction of the planet Since humans are so physically destructive if we go out we are most likely going to take as much as we can living on the physical dimension with us. This would affect the other dimensions s well but lets say that humans go extinct from disease and not nuclear warfare  anyone who has a soul created for humanity would be stuck as a Lost Soul until another Humanity rose up again.  Those of us with nonhuman souls usually hybrids got pulled into the human cycle would be returned to the reincarnation cycle of their original species.,Reincarnation,dd0sfuo,1,t5_2u9b9

11055592,0,t3_5xr1uq,I totally understand feeling seriously suicidal I tried once too. I cant say I understand how youre feeling ito trans since Im fortunate enough to be happy with how I was born. So heres my cents Personally I believe that each time were reincarnated we have a new lesson to learn. I believe were supposed to learn about the ultimate purest form of unconditional love etc. Ive often fantasised about ditching this body cancer has messed me up and coming back and having a better one. But like someone else has mentioned if you are supposed to have learned something from being trans and you commit suicide youll probably come back to the same situation in order to learn that which you were originally supposed to. At the end of the day none of us can really say what the case is and what will happen. None of us know whether reincarnation is a fact why were here in the first place etc. Its your choice and you have to decide what you believe what youre philosophy of life is etc. If you arent interested in figuring out what you feel is the truth then its probably a good idea to get psychological help since youre mostly driven by depression and I dont feel like were supposed to die from depression I want to believe were stronger than that. Anyway I hope I was of some help or guidance  ,Reincarnation,del4shr,7,t5_2u9b9
