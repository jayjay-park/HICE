If we started releasing on a regular basis songs being pulled people would stop buying last minute DLC before its pulled because they would know that wed release it a few daysweeks later. So yes Harmonix would still lose money if anybody were to release on a consistent basis songs that have been pulled. Plus we would be distributing untouched material thats copyrighted exactly in the format wed be distributing it another thing were not comfortable with. The occasional pulled song popping up by some independent user is no biggie for us but an organized effort at least from us or on our platforms blog forums etc. is not gonna happen.,Rockband,ci6grjw,4,t5_2qifr

No one can beat him!,Rockband,cnotb0y,1,t5_2qifr
2847869,0,t1_cnrgv13,In that case I have a few.First DLC backwards compatability is huge.  I spent a lot of money on DLC for the last games and not having access to it would be a major turn off. Personally Im down to pay whatever price is needed to get as much of it as possible back.  I know getting all of it at once probably isnt feasible but getting as much of it as possible is basically my biggest issue.The world tour mode needs an overhaul. A lot of my time is spent solo so being able to have an expansive career mode would be great. Just spitballing here but maybe  let me choose what genres I want to play because going from punk to pop to metal is a strange career choice for a young band.  I always thought having special challenge setlists where we were recording an album would be cool.  Maybe tie its success to our difficulty and score and use that as sort of boss stages to advance to the next level.  Your album isnt good enough you dont get more fans you have to keep trying. Basically I want to really watch my career unfold and earn going from and opening act to headlining huge tours and festivals.  Im not sure how feasible this is  but some actual real life venues and festivals would be cool.  Playing Warped and actually working your way to Download would be amazing. At least something analogous to real life events would be nice.  Also integrating your friends career progress into your own would be neat.  Seeing their tour making more money or their band getting more coverage could be fun. My last point is that I hope you guys dont forget about Rock Band Blitz. I really think you had something special on your hands with that game and Id be ecstatic to see it come back at some point. Regardless Im super hyped for the return of Rock Band.  I have so many great memories with the series and its definitely time for the series to make a return.,Rockband,cnrsvqa,6,t5_2qifr

Once again I wouldnt consider myself the best real drummer and I am primarily a vocalist in Rock Band but I have gold starred this on expert pro drums.

3119443,0,t1_colbbxn,Yeah I know what you mean. Sometimes the hardest part of hard songs is hitting only  out of the  notes that youre supposed to play.

Im not learning how to play a new Rock Band game from scratch.Why not? What if they can develop a new way of charting guitars that is twice as fun?

5342143,0,t1_cvu9rhf,My issue is that theyve referred to the data before showing that relatively few people played online. Ok fine they have data in hand to back up that assertion. But that data is several years old and in the case of Rock Band  is during the decline of the genre in general. When people lose interest in a game whos going to lose interest first those that have a group of real life friends they regularly play with or those playing online?So their online numbers probably started declining long before offline numbers did and when the series was at its peak online play in general wasnt quite as huge as it is now.Generally my point to is that the numbers they use to insist that most people dont want online play are badly outdated and reflect an environment that doesnt exist anymore. If youre trying to revive a series you need as many people to be able to play it as possible not just those that are happy to play solo or those that can get a real life group together.,Rockband,cvuin7y,2,t5_2qifr

5498489,0,t1_cw5o7o2,I know this is getting old but Beer by Reel Big Fish was the original master recording owned by Jive records. When they left Jive the label retained all ownership of their music and they went off and rerecorded a new greatest hits called A Best Of Us For The Rest Of Us. That new greatest hits album should not fall under any exclusivity deals but the original recordings are all likely stuck with Jive. I think unless Jive releases the music without the permission of RBF since they dont need it we wont see them in RB.

5501647,0,t1_cweumuh,Yeah the vocal delay creates this awful echo whenever I play. I have to turn down the volume on all three mics every time I boot it up. I wish I could at least save that setting but thankfully it seems like this new patch will fix that.Im still fuzzy on how your guitar solos are behaving differently from the rest of the chart in regards to lag if Im even understanding you correctly. I havent had problems with lag I that I wasnt able to eventually solve albeit with each controller having a different lag setting that I have to remember. This means I have to use a setting in between to compromise when friends are over this leaves the game feeling mostly accurate but I let it go so my party doesnt come to a screeching halt for lag adjustment. Nothing kills the vibe faster.  If you mean that you dont hit as many notes as you should during solos compared to the rest of the track that could just be because solos require more precision than the rest of the song. Your current lag setting might feel accurate most of the time but it could still be off and the fast and tricky solos are the only time its apparent. The closer the notes are together the smaller the timing window is for you to accurately hit it. Thats why I always pick a song that has a lot of notes at the beginning for testing lag. You might wanna try that in addition to writing down which lag settings work best for each instrument. Its a painful process but definitely worth it.Edit If you havent seen this video yet check it out. It should explain the way lag works in Rock Band as well as the most thorough way to fix it.  ,Rockband,cwevxz0,2,t5_2qifr

Maybe I dont know a lot about Rifts implementation maybe its just retarded? Ive played games in D off and on since the s with chunky LCD shutter glasses where if we had fps normally without doing two eye views frame alternating on CRT we considered it to be working pretty well.We have a Rift dev kit at work boss kickstartered it that weve never had time to play with... maybe I should crack it open.But theres no technical reason it cant be used as pure display device unless Rift is being dumb and the only reason that at least Xbox couldnt use its gyros as input would be MS refusing to allow  create drivers for it.,Rockband,cxmnkee,0,t5_2qifr

Without these rhythm games I would perhaps not have gotten into music at all now Ive been playing drums for  years and writing my own music. My story is not that interesting compared to yours but I thought I would share my experiences aswell. I hope your love for these games continues and that you end up in a good place in life!

It really just depends on the band because some are amazing live and sometimes the tracks just dont translate as well into this game even if the performances are still good. Things like the ACDC pack can be really awkward when youre really used to the album versions since the tempos are different and you have things like Brian Johnson singing the Bon Scott songs as well as overusing the word mama.,Rockband,d08a5fo,5,t5_2qifr

We hope that it will be sooner but that is just the reality. Im not really trying to approximate the nuance required to manage an online community ultimately you probably know better what a statement like that might have done but I know I myself would have been much less angry with HMX if you guys would have said that then.Also I might have refocused my efforts to keep my group of friends interested in the interim.And again speaking without firsthand knowledge.. but what about the darn issues spreadsheet?  Why doesnt my Coldplay pack or Depeche mode pack work yet? I have a very difficult time believing that some progress on those couple issues couldnt have been made in the in interim.To me this just seems like tunnel vision.And if it is not clear.

Eventually the disc is finalized and the other songs go into the backlog to be used for DLC or other things.So yeah the entire dev team recorded the audience requests based on the songs we thought were likely to go on the disc.

8018202,0,t1_d4b6rtz,If HMX is going to do anything for the leader boards they need to remove nofail and freestyle solos from eligability.  I can pass TTFAF on XGuitar but cant even come close to  stars while people playing with a handicap Nofail amp or freestyle are scoring WAY higher than me.  Then consider that If I play the songs with the easy modes on I get super high scores that I can never actually achieve robbing me of the game actually tracking my progress when I go score chasing.  Its crap and the RB leaderboards are crap.  Viva la Scorehero.,Rockband,d4hbjpq,1,t5_2qifr
8038741,0,t3_4pa93t,Im one of the lucky ones with my RB kit apparently. Its a launch day kit for Xbox One and other than doublefast kicks being nearly impossible until a firmware update fixed that issue theyve been problem free. I bought the RB cymbals to go with them for pro drums mode and both the drums and cymbals are night and day different better than my RB drumscymbals.As far as if theyre better than RB drums hard for me to say. My last RB kit died right around the time RB came out hence why I bought RB drums. I remember the RB kits being amazing but they werent all that reliable  I went through  or  in about a year and a half between the time they were available standalone and when RB came out. The rubberpadding part of the red drum would come off on every RB kit I had.I do remember the RB kits being much better than my RB kit also made by Mad Catz but while the RB kit was never as sensitive hell of a time hitting quadruplet snare hits for example and the cymbals were terrible they at least still work to this day. So I guess in short RBgtRB kit but also RBgtRB kit in my opinion. I just dont know where RB and RB stack up against each other.But like I said my RB kit is fine. Im using a beta firmware Alli Thresher sent me a few days after launch to fix the kicking problem and its been so good I havent updated it since. I have plenty of full combos lots of gold stars on devil tier songs and in just about every scenario I take the blame for missing notes not the drum kit. The only complaint I have is that the cymbals arent quite up to par for songs that ride the hihat disco flipped but Im perfectly happy with their performance outside of that and will take it over the problems over people seem to be having.,Rockband,d4jmom0,4,t5_2qifr

8072810,0,t1_d4n6yvr,gt The utter speed you need to play TIE is fucking absurd.Youre not wrong. Its mostly th notes at bpm the tempo varies wildly. WAHNTHAC is an almost constant bpm but is mostly eighth notes so for comparisons sake its actually bpm.gt The bass pedals speed towards the end of TIE is also fucking absurd.True but theyre short bursts. I can mostly hit these while my leg basically gives out halfway through the first chorus of WAHNTHAC.gt The middleending blasts speed is impossible.fucking absurdIts about  faster on average than WAHNTHACs blasts but its nowhere near as long as that middle blasting section and its all on the ride as opposed to Lucas changing cymbals all the time and even skipping notes on his right hand entirely. I can usually hit this TIE blast for a second or two while Im powerless against the long one in WAHNTHAC.gt The rolls in TIE are really difficult to pull off if you cant double stroke or if you cant move your sticks fast enough from one pedal to the other.No doubt but Im approaching this from a perspective of beating the song not FCing. You can skip the rolls entirely without it affecting your rock meter much.gtSo yes TIE is easier on a complexity scale it destroys WAHNTHAC when it comes to speed. All of this may be a bit biased as I dont have a pedal since I just recently broke my second pedal.I wouldnt say destroys but it is faster. However the combination of complexity and speed is what makes WAHNTHAC so insanely hard. Every part of that song is incredibly hard  theres no respite. TIE has the thrash beat frankly if you cant hit this you have no business playing these songs and the breakdown and you can beat the song without hitting any blasts.,Rockband,d4ngkhw,2,t5_2qifr

Sure I skip the intro too but in the second it takes me to do that the car flashes on screen and I hear a little bit of Highway StarHello There or a club and Break On Through that makes the entire video play in my head.I had a ton of nongaming friends who would casually play Rock Band  on Wii in the series heyday and they loved the intro. I know it doesnt seem like much but even if you skip it its your first impression of the game. I know Ive said it before but the current opener has less going on than a RB loading screen and that really rubs me the wrong way.

Oftentimes there are a lot of fun fills in the track itself that I miss out on because it gets overlayed with the freestyle prompt. Its not for everybody but you might consider giving static fills a try.,Rockband,d7n9180,3,t5_2qifr

I really hope this gets fixed soon so I canvenjoy the full glory of this companion app.  Im not blaming you or Andrea your fellow developer for any shortcomings as accessibility can be with a smaller team and a limited build time something that might be overlooked without it being flagged up at the beginning.  In fact Ill be more than happy to test out the app if you wish as part of any other ingame accessibility changes.I also think it might be worth it to have it mentioned what has changed in updates that might have an impact on totally blind players.  For example the app issues the resorting of your songs by default the new menus being written down in a list to make it clear where things are and when new things are added how to get to them etc.What do you think uHMXJosh?Just throwing around ideas.,Rockband,d8ygpiv,1,t5_2qifr

9332117,0,t3_58b6oj,Yeah as your progress through the sets the tiers increase in difficulty.I think the tiers are based on band difficulty so its possible some early tiers will let you play harder songs for your instrument if they happen to fall within that band tier.,Rockband,d8ywwuk,4,t5_2qifr
9335345,0,t3_58c04c,Been a player since Rock Band . Love the new update the new UI is great Rivals is fun and competitive and makes the game feel fresh! As many have mentioned my only drawback is the online leaderboards for the PS system. Since Rivals launched most of my scores have not been posting to the leaderboards. Also I noticed if your score does not post to the leaderboards you also dont receive any XP towards your crew when playing the weekly challenge songs. I want to play but I feel if my score is not posted then whats the point? I want my score to register to the leaderboards and I want to gain XP for our crew seems unfair if the game goes offline during a song and no score or XP is saved. I would really love if scores can be uploaded to the leaderboards if the games goes offline. You dont even know when you are offline I think there should be a status bar that lets you know if you are connected to the rock band server or not a green circle or a red circle in the corner of the screen maybe? Also Gold stars dont count as well when offline which messes up your gold star stats!!!,Rockband,d8zbn9f,6,t5_2qifr

9549508,0,t3_5bnwrs,In the past Ive had similar experiences which I attested as being related to stuttering problems. Once RB started to stutter in a song even if it stopped stuttering and even if it was just once I feel like my calibration was off for the remainder of that play session. I made it a habit to always restart RB from scratch when I want to play and both the stuttering and long play session calibration issues have gone away for me.Kinda offtopic I did have one really weird issue that developed right before Rivalsupdate .. came out which may possibly have been calibration related ?. I could hit notes just fine but during songs I would sometimes hit the green cymbal to activate my overdrive and nothing would happen. Overdrive wouldnt deploy but I wouldnt lose my streak either for hitting a note that wasnt there. In some songs it would not activate overdrive more than it would. It was strange and I assumed perhaps the calibration was somehow wonky for that green activation note but why would my calibration for everything else seem fine? I havent noticed this problem whatsoever in version .. though and I never touched my calibration settings.,Rockband,d9q6a46,4,t5_2qifr

There are other kinds of clamps as well and as with the cymbals these things are pretty much interchangeable so you can shop around a bit.Another option is to get something like this that attaches directly to the leg of the kit. Its usually a bit cheaper but you lose some flexibility in placement.Or if youre the go big or go home type and dont care about portability you can get actual cymbal stands that will work with electronic cymbals. This is pretty rare and almost unheard of for anything other than the hihat but its an option. Same goes for the pads though they require a different type of stand.,Rockband,da9xo8d,1,t5_2qifr

10114074,0,t3_5kqs6b,I currently own both the strat and the jaguar. Overall you get the same performance from each. Im not sure of the likelihood that one will work better out of box than the other. defects broken units etc However few things to note. Strat Pros Large button for using overdrive  Mini USB port for updating the guitar  Seems to be better with auto calibration in settings Not made by PDPStrat Cons Doesnt fold? if you consider that a con Jag Pros Foldable  Stylish look Stated to have better Calibration tools than the strat theyre worse imo Jag cons PDP is the manufacturer Im sure youve noticed the nightmarish customer service users have had  Use the left arrow or small view button to activate OD. only a killer if you prefer a button for OD its much easier to accidentally hit up or down and strum No USB port for updating as far as I know Just my experience summed up with a few facts stated by Harmonix themselves. Everyones experience can be different I personally havent had an technical issues but if I had to choose one again Id take the Strat for sure. Seems much more reliable and auto calibration is top notch. Ive honestly never gotten the display calibration on the Jag to work. Always stops mid calibration. tldr Personal preference is Strat although they dont differ much in terms of use. Jag looks nicer and folds. PDPJag customer service is awful but you already knew that.

What.You know that In Too Deep is a poppunk song that has been played in mainstream pop nightclubs since its release. I cant go anywhere for a drink without hearing it come on usually quickly followed or preceded by All The Small Things. Additionally you could argue that In Too Deep has gained staying power that Two Princes has lost over the yearsIn Too Deep YouTube video views   millionTwo Princes YouTube video views   millionBonus statement In Too Deep is just a far better written song instrumentally.,Rockband,dd64olq,3,t5_2qifr

Since Bethanys destiny is her own I figure a song so magnificent as she deserves more than the defining and constraining bounds of a genre.  Why limit her interpretive potential to just Rock?  In this way Bethany is most certainly her own genre a genre simply titled Bethany and it was my assumption that this week would be the week HMX reveals this to us since Bethany was obviously the most played song because it is so beloved That or Im posting my weekly Bethany post under the theme announcement so that we dont forget the spotlight predicament lest it repeats itself.

11753161,0,t1_dgs0kq7,Dont be mad at the people. Be mad at the masters who are giving out such a mysterious and limited supply. Its like theres been a drought for the last  months and now suddenly water is available again. And while this current supply may seem plentiful people dont know whenif water will be available again once this current supply runs out so in light of their past suffering they grab as much as they can. They may feel bad about ensuring their own supply but they know that nothing compares to the feeling of utter desperation. Acting unselfishly in the water example could lead to death. With Rock Band theres a good possibility that theyd be locked out of ever playing Rock Band on the Xbox One. Either way theyd rather have too much than too little because most people plan on staying alivebeing able to play Rock Band  for the foreseeable future.Let me know when honor and dignity are able to serve as an Xbox One Wired Adapter but until then Im afraid that they dont really have much use or value in this scenario. The masters have turned this into a dogeatdog scenario and people will typically only be as kind and generous as our circumstances allow. If the masters provided enough for both dogs to eat the dogs would likely be playful and friendly towards one another.

11755241,0,t3_67mk8x,You want my honest thoughts? Keep in mind this is an opinion.  I couldnt stand playing the game.  I bought it and tried it to add to my Rock Band collection and FCGS count.  I could only manage to play a few songs in quickplay.  The selection seemed so repetitive and underwhelming compared to the gems and variety in any other Rock Band including TBRB Even GHAerosmith had guest acts maybe that wouldve helped here?.  Of course I think many many more bands were more deserving of a game but perhaps licensing was the reason they pulled together enough GD songs to make that particular game.  Compared to the design of TBRB it lacked the love and care to make it a truly unique experience.Might I also add that I really dont like Green Days music?   Even though that bias existed before I played the game I at least tried to like it because I spent money on it.Those were my honest thoughts purely opinionated. ,Rockband,dgshihk,2,t5_2qifr
