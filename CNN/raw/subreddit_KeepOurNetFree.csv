11565361,0,t1_dg6wqhn,gtWhere did I say I have the right to tell people not to buy things? Its about regulating companies not to make things that will possibly kill people.Kill people? How does the lack of net neutrality kill people? Youre making an argument for regulation im saying some regulations have their place most dont. Ones regulating the internet definitely dont have their place. No one is going to die without the internet. No one will die because Comcast increases or decreases the speed of Netflix. gtOverall a big problem we have is that were ignoring the fact that were a society and we need stuff to be somewhat regulated so as to continue having a safe society.Whos ignoring that? Im a libertarian but Im smart enough to know we arent just going to throw out all the regulations. The problem Im finding is these useless regulations that are really just the government and people like yourself pretending you know whats best for other people. You have no right to tell people how they can or cant spend their money and yet here you are doing just that. You arent making anyone safer buy prohibiting them from spending their money the way they want. ,KeepOurNetFree,dg6xt72,1,t5_3jo79
11585488,0,t1_dg94vdj,Thank you for contacting me regarding privacy. I appreciate having the benefit of your comments on this important matter.The Internet has driven incredible innovation and economic growth in America and around the world. As a result consumers increasingly have decided to entrust information regarding all aspects of their lives to companies that provide internetrelated services. Furthermore Americans exposed to terrorist propaganda and radicalized online have traveled to the Middle East to join terrorist organizations or carried out al Qaeda or the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria inspired attacks within the United States. Homegrown extremism and the massive online terrorist networks that enable it pose a significant national security risk.It is necessary for the United States to update and reform the law in order to reflect these innovations and modernize statutes with current expectations of personal privacy and liberty. It is the duty of Members of Congress to ensure we balance privacy protection and civil liberties while protecting the safety and security of all Americans.I appreciate the opportunity to represent Texas in the United States Senate. Thank you for taking the time to contact me.SincerelyJOHN CORNYNUnited States Senator,KeepOurNetFree,dg980ba,10,t5_3jo79

11802054,0,t3_68e4lg,The best way to get a message out to the people is to inject it into a popular medium the people use.  The most likely medium that would have the impact you want on the audience you most likely want is Youtube.  You could petition a famous Youtuber to make mention of whats going on in their channel.  Theyre normal people so they might care.  Its more likely to happen if you pick one that actually lives in the US.  If they havent talked about it already they probably wont need much coaxing as it affects them as well.  If I had to guess at one Id say Markiplier might do it.  He typically stays out of politics though.Ill also say what ever way you choose to do it have your ducks in a row.  Meaning at the very least a petition with a lot of signatures from Change.org or an equivalent petition site and the specific message youd like them to convey.  If youre not good with words and speeches you might want to talk to someone who is for tips.  Still the final speaker may edit it to fit their style but it would suck to be contacted by someone to do something then they left me with all the work.Good luck.  I mean it.,KeepOurNetFree,dgxsy0m,174,t5_3jo79
