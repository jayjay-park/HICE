961011,0,t1_chdirvh,I dont feel that runners should be grateful to openers anymore than I feel openers should be grateful to runners. We are working together!Although I have to say that I feel like openers are more often looked down upon going as far as to being considered leechers by many. But thats not really the matter now.Now thats out of the way how do you get  Keystone Fragments in  minutes? Just because some people farm them in split groups on Normal difficulty doesnt mean everyone is doing that. Thats like me saying to you you only take  minutes because youre running the Rift on T You also can finish rifts faster if you lower the difficulty but whats the point of that right?gt ...people who actually do something have a greater chance of obtaining loot...Runners arent the only ones who actually do something we both do runners and openers thats the beauty of this community!And that was not what I meant I meant Rifts have  more chance of Legendary Drops.,riftitforwardeu,chdiy1u,1,t5_31i51
