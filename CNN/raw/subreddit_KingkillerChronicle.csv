I would take this to mean that womens menstural cycles are still in synch with the moon even though its synodic period is so long.

243767,0,t1_cf5ehqu,I said it below but Ill post it here tooWhy would he teach them to behave that way around real Ruh unless he saw it first hand though? They were talking to Kvothe about things theyve stolen. One would think that after you spend a year with a group of people youd learn that you were wrong about them in your preconceptions. PLUS Alleg would have seen them interact with other Ruh at some point. Or if not... elderly old group Ruh arent really thieves. Thats all theyd have to say and he would know not to act that way around real Ruh and blow their cover. I mean hell... they taught him about the water or wine test which is basically the secret handshake of the Ruh. Theyll teach someone that.. something so important and secret to their culture but not fix his misconceptions about them? That makes absolutely NO sense.

No. It was said that the Cthaeh doesnt lie but that doesnt necessarily preclude it from obfuscating or distorting the truth without explicitly lying whether you consider it to essentially be a lie anyway PThat technicality would be for Patrick Rothfuss to decide upon I suppose.Like you said though we dont know how far the Cthaeh can go without actually lying or if its even bound to not lie somehow.

If Im not mistaken and Im not Pat has a longtime girlfriend with whom he has two kids  which takes a fair bit of experience with women to pull off successfully. Now agreed he may or may not be what youd call a ladies man but his accomplishments with his girlfriend indicate his skills with women are very much alive and well. In other words I think you have negative preconceptions about the man who you claim to admire because hes overweight a geek and has a beard that would make a viking jealous. None of those traits will bar him from having success with the opposite sex. Hes got plenty of skills with women. Just not the kind that youre perhaps thinking of  which does nothing but reveal your own prejudices and biases about the relationship between men and women and the nature of the ideal man in general. Kvothe reacts to Denna in a perfectly believable fashion. He understands that she is overwhelmed by entitled controlling men and decides to take a different tact. We shall see if it is in fact successful in The Doors of Stone but its safe to say that Kvothes friend zone experience with Denna is intentional.

His eyes were pure black. In the background there was a bare tree and he was standing on a circle of blue with a few wavy lines on it.gt gt Thats supposed to be water she said pointing. Its hard to paint water though. And hes supposed to be standing on it. There were drifts of snow around him too and his hair was white. But I couldnt get the white paint to work. Mixing paints for paper is harder than glazes for pots.gt gt I nodded Not trusting myself to speak. It was Cinder the one who killed my parents. I could see his face in my mind without even trying without even closing my eyes.gt gt I unrolled the paper further. There was a second man or rather the shape of a man in a great hooded robe. Inside the cowl of the robe was nothing but blackness. Over his head were three moons a full moon a half moon and one that was just a crescent. Next to him were two candles. One was yellow with a bright orange flame. The other candle sat underneath his outstretched hand it was grey with a black flame and the space around it was smudged and darkened.gt gt ... This was Haliax...gt gt ... gt gt I finished unrolling the paper revealing a third figure larger than the other two. He wore armor and an openfaced helmet. On his chest was a bright insignia that looked like a autumn leaf...gt gt The skin of his face was tan but the hand he held poised upright was a bright red. His other hand was hidden by a large round object that Nina had somehow managed to color a metallic bronze. I guessed it was his shield.gt gt ... It wasnt a leaf on his chest. It was a tower wrapped in flame. His bloody outstretched hand wasnt demonstrating something. It was making a gesture of rebuke toward Haliax and the rest. He was holding up his hand to stop them. This man was one of the Amyr. One of the Ciridae.gt gt ... There was a woman with no clothes on and a broken sword and a fire... gt gt ... gtgt ... Shed painted the Amyr so the words Andan and Ordal rested directly on top of his shoulders one on each side. Amost as if she were hoping the names would weigh him down.A candle is mentioned here. It seems to be literally a candle without light. I think we can assume that this is the candle referenced in the poem.gt Next to him were two candles. One was yellow with a bright orange flame.

Both learned very quickly that they effectively couldnt avenge that loss and then went through a period of literally having nothing but the clothes on their back while swearing vengeance.Theyre cut from the same cloth it seems. Lovable sociopaths who have been made extremely Chaotic by external forces and would to some degree wade through oceans of innocent blood to achieve the vengeance they desire.Now Kvothe is a better man than Jorg admittedly.

I suffer through his clunky prose for the ingenuity of characters and plot.ampnbspIn terms of world construction and magic system try the Mistborn series by Brandon Sanderson. The burning of allomantic metals is just as interesting and believable as sympathy and sygaldry. ampnbspCombining both reading pleasure and worlddepth is the Discworld series by Terry Pratchett.

The other reason I believe this is because in WMF when Kvothe is having dinner with Meluan he says she looks familiar to him like maybe he had met her before.

Plus Meluan being his aunt would repair their relationship allowing him to get his hands on the lackless box again where I believe he finds a piece of the moon that Jax captured.

There he was only gone for a few days in human realm time but had aged because it was much much longer in the Faen realm. If he returned to the Fae we would have to assume based on what we know now that he would continue to age and would look older than he is relative to the four corners. It would explain thinking of them as being young but not that he still looks young as well. Note that this is all subject to change as we learn more of how things work.Personally I always took the comment about them being young to be less literal and more of a worldweariness from his experiences. ,KingkillerChronicle,ct2wlye,7,t5_2smxb

Maybe this is why the chandrian are the way they are. An unbound principle at work. gtThe deeper we went the stranger things became. The round tunnels for drainage and pipes disappeared and were replaced with squaredoff hallways and stairways strewn with rubble. Rotting wooden doors hung off rusted hinges and there were halfcollapsed rooms filled with moldering tables and chairs. One room had a pair of brickedup windows despite the fact that we were at my best guess at least fifty feet below ground. Deeper still we came to Throughbottom a room like a cathedral so big that neither Auris blue light nor my red one reached the highest peaks of the ceiling. All around us were huge ancient machines. Some lay in pieces broken gears taller than a man leather straps gone brittle with age great wooden beams that were now explosions of white fungus huge as hedgerows. Other machines were intact but worn by centuries of neglect. I approached an iron block as big as a farmers cottage and broke off a single flake of rust large as a dinner plate. Underneath was nothing but more rust. Nearby there were three great pillars covered in green verdigris so thick it looked like moss.Incidentally Usnea is a lichen that grows on dying and sick trees.

Suddenly its just.. known.gtThis time when I entered the Archives there was a young gentleman sitting behind the desk tapping a pen on a piece of paper that bore the marks of much rewriting and crossing out. As I approached he scowled and scratched out another line. His face was built to scowl. His hands were soft and pale. His blinding white linen shirt and richlydyed blue vest reeked of money The part of me that was not long removed from Tarbean wanted to pick his pocket.  He tapped his pen for another few moments before laying it down with a vastly irritated sigh. Name he said without looking up.  Kvothe.  He flipped through the ledger found a particular page and frowned. Youre not in the book. He glanced up briefly and scowled again before turning back to whatever verse he was laboring over. When I made no signs of leaving he flicked his fingers as if shooing away a bug. Feel free to piss off.  Ive just  Ambrose put down his pen again. Listen he said slowly as if explaining to a simpleton. Youre not in the book he made an exaggerated gesture toward the ledger with both hands. You dont get inside.

All that needs to be said is please give examples of the book being sexist. And then follow by countering the specific examples.On the other hand Whataboutism is basically another name for the tu quoque fallacy that in response to A does XYZ which is bad one argues But what about B they also do XYZ its a fallacy because B doing the same thing says nothing about criticism of A doing it.,KingkillerChronicle,cvnn8vx,3,t5_2smxb

5492375,0,t1_cwdjiwr,In response to your first question I would say its more that the Chandrian has spent thousands of years killing anyone who says their names or tells their story and now the world is ripe for a new tale of Lanre. If her story doesnt connect Lanre and the Chandrian then that may be the point. In Scarpis story Lanre becomes Haliax. And when Selitos curses Lanre the curse is twofold the mans face always in shadow and that he and others would be cursed by their names. Perhaps Dennas song relates to Haliaxs desire to be known as Lanre once more either in a literal sense or because the way the curse works is tied to his name not an unreasonable assertion in a world where the most powerful magic available is called naming.As to the third point again I think it reinforces the idea the Chandrian have been fertilizing this ground for thousands of years. Pruning people and stories that reinforce their names and story perhaps the origin of the curse Selitos laid on them. I agree with your conclusion but I guess I see it as coming from a different path with the song and their names and such being integral to the curse rather than an accessory.

I cant remember the exact figure but its definitely between one and three quarters.The Draccus is massively more heavy so to get similar absorbent properties scale up the handful of charcoal that Denna ate to the Draccuss mass. Then double that for each time that Kvothe doubled the dose roughly  times?. If the Draccus is  times Dennas weight then it would need to eat      times the amount of charcoal Denna ate to absorb an equivalent amount of resin.Thats just an approximation of course. And it has been eating lots of trees but not nearly as much charcoal.

6086644,0,t3_3yxchx,First of allgreat catch with the smells being the same I had completely missed that in like  rereads. Second I think Broken Tree refers to his hands. When Shehyn is talking to Kvothe about where to strike she compares people to the Latantha tree. His name means broken tree because he as a person is a tree and it is prophetic because he becomes injured or broken like he always feared.EDIT Also if he had freed the Cthaeh I think Bast would be a bit more pissed offI think Kvothe would know a bit more about it. I think that the box is made from the wood of the tree because Iax went to the Cthaeh and asked for help getting the moon and took some of the trees wood to make the box to trap the moon. Hell maybe he went to the Cthaeh trapped the moon using the wood of the tree then got pissed when all hell broke loose and trapped the Cthaeh there after.,KingkillerChronicle,cyhfrwy,4,t5_2smxb

Denna could be happy and well off have a nice happy ever after without even remembering the story and Kvothe is left with the third silence.This fails to account for all the guilt KoteKvothe feels.

6169075,0,t3_4016a2,I think that the two of them sum up the teenage approach to relationships fairly well. I would imagine that everyone has their own interpretation of how she behaves relating to what they have experienced in their own lives. Those who think she is selfish probably wanted to get something out of a similar relationship. Those who like her have probably been on the receiving end of something similar to that which Kvothe is pressing on her. In an ideal world she would reciprocate but how many times does that actually happen especially at that age? There was some commitment from Denna but I believe that she was probably just dipping her toe in the water and may have even felt pressured to by that point becase of the  strength of feeling Kvothe has for her. Also Kvothe let her down quite a few times too. Shell of course be aware of this and may be thinking that as nice as he is when hes around hes got some shit to sort out before she can commit to him and thats up to Kvothe to fix not her. I like Dennas attitude because she is one of the only things in the book that keep Kvothe grounded. Dont forget she is the main character in her own life so try looking at it from her perspective and I expect youll find that Kvothe is a bit of a flake.

Lightning can and does strike in the same place if it has a reason to do so.gt lightning is not that lethal lightnings death rate is only  given the best parameter to lightnings favor  fatal rate  lightning strike all  men there is only  chance that  men are all killed. I did the math but I wont burden you with it I like your reasoning here and your match checks out.  But youre also working under the assumption that each lightning strikes lethality is independent from the rest.  A human body thats just barely survived a lightning strike is going to be in bad shape and wont be as resistant to the second strike.  And thatll compound on the third and fourth strikes.  Additionally youre not accounting for lightning bolts not all being equal.  That  includes all lightning strikes from weak not fatal to massive very fatal.  Im going to go out on a limb and guess that this lightning was on the more powerful side given the vigor of the storm and how well grounded the tree was.Besides  is still pretty good odds when the alternative is a miracle.gt Cinders action before it Cinder was trying to listen for something just like in NofW before all  of ran away from murder scene of Ks family they were running from Amyr so did Cinder in WMF.

While most of my experience had been with sturdier breeds bred to pull rather than to race I knew how to cover ground when I needed to.He clearly cant sit as well on a horse as he used and he clearly states that he was in pretty bad shape by the time he got to Trebon.After an hour and a half of hard riding at the gallop Kvothe has this to sayAfter an hour and a half of this Selhan was sweating and breathing hard but he was doing better than I was. My legs were a rubbery mess. I was fit enough and young but I hadnt been in the saddle in years. Riding uses different muscles to walking and riding at full gallop is just as hard as running unless you want to make your horse work twice as hard for every mile.By the time he reaches the tinker he talks about his legs in the following wayI swung out of the saddle staggering a bit when my rubbery legs almost buckled beneath me.Finally as a general note about the world Kvothe lives in especially given his upbringing as a nomadic Edema Ruh riding would be a much more common and essential skill in Temerant compared to any modern liberal democracy which is where I assume you live P. Most people especially once you get away from big cities would know how to ride a bit. At the very least they would have sat on a horse a few times before and maybe learnt how to control a walking horse. If you cannot ride then you cannot get from A to B quickly short of chartering a carriage to take you there or happening to find a merchants caravan heading the right way. Knowing to ride is the literal equivalent of knowing how to drive after all. Of course if you are a poor worker who was born in say Tarbean and lived there your entire life then you probably wouldnt know how to ride and certainly wouldnt be able to pull off what Kvothe did. But then you would have had the polar opposite of Kvothes upbringing so thats hardly surprising! P,KingkillerChronicle,d56yk48,3,t5_2smxb

If you feel like going down the rabbit hole argument I had with Jezer its probably not quite as allegorical as Trapis was because the Adems story of the Creation War and the Chandrian is still relatively accurate after all this time. So while archery might be a metaphor I tried to play it on safe side and take them at their word on it. However maybe it isnt Im not one to say I certainly took liberties here.Jaxs broken house being a symbol of a divided University or just Temerant is actually pretty interesting to me.

It was introduced in the first act and it dominates the room. The bed is going to be used in the final act. Cthaeh alludes to that future event. He is ostensibly talking about Felurian in the passage but I think Cthaeh is also referring to Kvothe and pixiefaced Devi as well as to Kvothe and Felurian. gtBesides youve been busy currying favor rolling around in the cushions with some piksie sating your base desires. Three green butterflies twitched all at once. Their wings looked like leaves as they spun to the ground. Speaking of desires what would your Denna think? My my. Imagine her seeing you here. You and the piksie all tangled up at it like rabbits.WMF p. The scenes involving naive Geoffrey and Denna also portend Kvothes eventual betrayal by Denna.

8782520,0,t3_4ri6tb,I think so there are a lot of strange deaths in th Vintish nobility.  The ship that goes down moves Ambroses father into th in line.  In Severen Kvothe hears about how the royal regent was killed.  This implies to me that there is a boy king on the throne in Vint which historically means that he is easily manipulated by those beneath him.  There was also an attempt on the Maers life.  We could easily see or hear of offscreen other nobles dying.  Ambrose is the only character we know of in any line of succession thats an antagonist and hes been there since book one.  Kvothe Kingkiller is one of his titles and I could easily see him having an emotional outbust possibly a justified one and killing Ambrose.  In the framework tale we hear of people taking the kings coin and joining the army but its purposely ambiguous about which king.  Since they are in Newarre it is close proximity to Vint,KingkillerChronicle,d73hj1o,1,t5_2smxb

8795804,0,t3_50lcrh,Storytellers often deliberately omit details for various reasons stylistic metaphorical practical brevity or just plain but convenient laziness.  Its very common.  The author of the fourth Gospel never mentioned the name of the apostle Jesus loved.  Inspector Gadget never showed Dr. Claws face. Etc.So in and of itself not including the words for sympathetic bindings isnt that remarkable its just one of those kinds of things.  Id guess theres a practical side to it as well.  We saw Kvothe perform maybe two dozen different types of sympathetic bindings.  Thats enough words that at least a few of them are accidentally likely to resemble some other name in the book.  If PR had included the words for all of them we might start to make connections where there arent any.However you are correct to point out that because Kote is narrating most of the story there might be something going on.  Id guess that Kote thinks theyre not an important detail or doesnt want to casually divulge stuff he painstakingly learned.

At least that is the allusion made when he arrives with no hat for his head or packs for his back. Just a walking stick. He also has some vague Taborlin imagery associated with his tattered cloak and his walking stick. Indeed wil says to Kvothe after the story that he expected the old man to be Taborlin the great. The old man meets up the the traveling Ruh in the great circle of waystones. There are  Ruh. Terris Silla Wint Shari Benthum Lil Peter Fent. Sceop himself makes . Sceop story wakes the Ruh from a deep sleep and afterwards they only look at each other.gtBut soon his voice became stronger his words bolder and as the fire flickered and reflected in his bright blue eyes his hands danced along with his old dried voice. Even the Edema Ruh who know all the stories in the world could do nothing but listen in wonder. When his story came to an end the troupers stirred as if waking from a deep sleep. For a moment they did nothing but look at each other then they looked at Sceop. Terris knew what they were thinking. Sceop he asked gently. Where were you headed when I stopped you tonight? I was going to Tinu said Sceop who was a little embarrassed at how caught up in the story he had become. His face was hot and red and he felt foolish. We are bound for Belenay ourselves Terris said. Would you consider coming with us instead?Sceop has done the same for the Ruh that he did for Jax taught them to see. The destination of the Ruh group is Belenay. Ie the university town. This is the beginning of the university I think. The story of Aleph and the Angels feels very similar. If you replace the word wings with the similar sounding word rings the story of the Angels feels a lot like a university ceremony where students earn their namers rings.

9809242,0,t1_dam5glk,Yep found itgt Threpe folded his hands on the tabletop. Since we havent had much luck finding you a local patron I started casting my nets farther afield. Its nice to have a local patron. But if you have the support of a properly influential lord it hardly matters where he lives.gt I nodded. My troupe had ranged all over the four corners under the protection of Lord Greyfallows name.To answer your thread Kvothe mostly needs a patron to be able to afford to do things while hes at the University. Its only after hes slightly settled in that he even goes to play at the Eolian and gets his talent pipes. Before he was forced to take a term away I dont think Kvothe ever considered an exploratory trip far from the University. Mauthen Farm was less than a day away right? And he probably never considered that Threpe had connections with or could reach out to patrons that far from where he lives. Part of having a patron is being at the beck and call in order to play at events for themmore easily done if the patron is local. But would Kvothe ever really want to even to take time away from the University to travel at the beck and call of a Patron significantly far away? Probably not.,KingkillerChronicle,dam76kt,5,t5_2smxb

9817206,0,t3_5fttac,The answer is No.Why you ask? A couple years back Kvothe and Bast participated in the competition called Suvudu Cagematch. Its a website that pits literary characters against each other in a battle to the death.Authors get a chance to give their own opinion on how the battle would go. Whoever has the most votes wins.One particular match had Kvothe vs Jaime Lannister. In Rothfuss write up on how he thinks it would go he had Bast tend to Jaime as the bar while he was waiting for Kvothe to appear and ultimately beat him by poisoning a bottle pouring a glass for both of them and drinking it himself to convince Jaime there was nothing wrong with the drink. Specifically theres a line where Bast snarls at Jaime exclaiming that he would do anything for his Reshi.Assuming Rothfuss was writing the write up based realistically on how he sees Basts character acting then its clear that Bast truly cares about Kvothe and isnt some spy. But instead is someone thats willing to drink poison to help kill someone who would threaten Kvothes life.

We know very little about Cinder but the little we do doesnt seem to fit Bredons character even if hes faking it. It would require that Cinder have magic shape changing or appearance changing abilities which as far as I know we currently have no evidence any Chandrian can do. It requires him to somehow hide his sign which if they can do that what in the world is the point. It requires the Cthaeh to be either outright lying or really pushing the boundaries of it by flatly implying Kvothe has seen Cinder twice and confirming one of them was the bandit camp and the other is obviously his parents murders. I dont think theres any real evidence not even circumstantial that Cinder and Bredon are the same and the only reason its even a theory is the fact that theyre the two main suspects for Dennas patron.Also unless Bredon planted it which I suppose is a possibility hes a known person as someone gave Kvothe the rumors about him and pagan rituals so its not like hes Cinder and is just showing up to mess with Kvothe.

You know very well the part Im refering to isgtLike he seems like a teenagers dream character if the teen was just making up a story in his head. and nowgtOf course Kvothe has some flaws but a major reason hes appealing is still in a men want to be him kind of way. No hes nowhere near a teenagers dream character. What kind of teenager would want to almost die every month? What kind of teenager would want to be clever and witty if that only leads them to constantly fuck things up? What kind of teenager would want to be amazing and powerful if that leads to the most depressing future possible? Heck Kvothe doesnt even get Denna in the end the only thing he gets is people killed. Really if theres a word that truly describes Kvothe is depressing. If I had to choose between being Kvothe and being someone like Simmon Id pick Simmon without a second thought and Im certain  of the readers would make the same choice.To me it seems you just skimmed through the book. You read the cool parts where he saves the day and somehow miss how he usually goes back to fucking everything up right after. gt but that whole scene with him losing his virginity to a sex goddess her being shocked that he was a virgin etc. is the part thats the most like a teenagers dreamWhy? Do you think that Felurian was amazed at how good he was? That he was some kind of sex genius? Nothing states that he was good. He was just decent enough that she thought he wasnt a virgin. Do you realize how low that threshold is? Being decent enough to not pass as a virgin? Thats pretty much knowing which hole to stick it into and what the clit is for.

But in a post directed at this subreddit its not convincing.gt It was a fine book but a fair number of people including myself felt that the scene with Felurian was a whole lot of paddingI would bet  talents that this is the type of little disappointment that does not reflect Rothfuss own thoughts your original underlying point. Peoples critique of the Felurian section is for the most part a bit naive. Not only is it a very miniscule part of the overall bookpg  on the online copy of the book I usemaking it not even  of the overall book the vaguely defined sex scenes are a miniscule part of that section. Even ignoring the significance of the fight between them the Felurian section is a treasure trove of important knowledge and plot points to those of us who have not simply read the book casually.Youre entitled to your opinion on how you feel. Youre slightly entitled to your opinion on what you believe people generally feel.

11434582,0,t1_dfs1zq5,Okay thanks. I am just bored at work and was just posting to see if this was a thing or not. And I do not think Denna would reveal it to Kvothe because they both admit often to keeping secrets and not revealing or asking too much about eachothers past. If she revealed to Kvothe that she was part of his family Kvothe obviously would be super happy Im assuming but also very curious and prompt him to ask questions. Kvothe would see nothing wrong with being part of the family however it may ruin things with Denna as she has to keep up appearances and all that. Also if kvothe knew then he may find out the family she was born into and all that. To your mention about Pats description of beauty yes it is a bit similar in a lot of cases. Also would like to live there because it seems as every woman Kvothe meets is described as beautiful. Anyway there are certain aspects of beauty he sometimes repeats and all that however the similarities not just in the physical description are far too similar imo. I will check out the other posts and see what they say. One more thing though to add to the beauty Pat describes being what he finds beautiful this is for sure true as he mentioned in an interview can not remember which that he gets letters for fans saying oh the forest and hills near Treben are just like my backyard in Wisconsin or that so and so character is definitely you and all that. He responded with yes. So he clearly takes what he has experienced with personalities and landscapes and all that into creating his world so why not beauty. This would also make him have a thing for feet as i remember there is a line when describing Felurian in which he says something to the tune of the arch of her foot knows more of sex than something something something. Long winded response sorry but yeah i do not have friends or anything to talk about the books with so kinda just getting a lot of thought out. ,KingkillerChronicle,dfs3k0c,1,t5_2smxb

11446930,0,t3_625gz9,I do not have the book in front of me but the section or individual line when Denna is laying down with Kvothe I think near Trebon. She is using his arm as a pillow and they are spooning. Obviously Kvothe is stoked about it and says its the most wonderful moment of his life or something. But when he describes how he tried to not breath heavy or make his chest move when breathing so it would not disturb her in her sleep how his arm had been asleep and numb from her laying on it but he did not move it to risk waking her. This imagery and the way he says it every time I read it I relate to that moment Kvothe had. That feeling the first time you cuddle with a girl or guy when her or your parents are not around. Holding her in your arms spooning for the first time and you do not want to ruin it you want it to last forever. She is just laying there half sleeping dozing off but you? No you do not dare fall asleep. You are the most alert you have been in your life wide awake terrified clueless focusing on not moving a muscle not itching your face when her hair brushes against your cheek. You do nothing but wish that your numb arm and itchy face would last forever. Idk I just remember that moment in my life and the way Kvothe recants that moment in his life is perfect.

11667801,0,t3_66ejnu,Blue fire not a lack of fire is the chandrian sign Arliden speaks of. It comes from cyphuss sign. Your theory crafting around lack of fire doesnt follow. Ive seen the theory that Kvothe kills Cinder and takes his place as one of the Chandrian posted here several times. Your thinking there is in line with what others have thought. The theories Ive seen usually follow logic like this Chandrian means seven of them. Kvothe kills one and because there must be seven he is forced to take their place as a Chandrian.Except there is absolutely nothing in the books or associated works suggesting that there has to be seven Chandrian at all times or that killing one obliges the killer to become a Chandrian. In fact the collective KKC is quite clear that the exact number of Chandrian is not generally well known even among scholars. That Kvothe is a Chandrian even though he denies it is very very interesting to me. Why? Because all through the story Kvothe is on his way to becoming Amyr. And not just any Amyr a Ciridae the highest rank of the Order Amyr.  The constant references to Kvothes sense of justice thoughtless action and bloody hands paint a clear picture of this.  That he ends up associated with the Chandrian is fascinating to me because I have a theory that the Chandrian are all Ciridae and thus Amyr. Kvothes sign. I cant take credit for this observation. I dont know which redditor thought it up though.  I love the theory. Kvothes sign is not silence. Its a caesura.   The silence is the pause or the break of the caesura. Bast fears Kvothes silences because of what comes after. The silence is a pause a break. In this way the shattered bottle is not necessarily sympathy but perhaps a physical manifestation of Kvothes Chandrian sign.
