519853,0,t3_202ys3,LeMonsChumpCar most likelyFind a team selling their car and expect to pay about k for it.  Split that cost  ways between your team members.Youre looking at about  for gear.  Youll need a multilayer suit helmet neck restraint shoes gloves socks balaclava and realistically you PROBABLY want a CoolShirt unless youre racing in winter... and even then it gets warm in cars.After all that initial investment is out of the way I think my friend figured it up to about  per person per race weekend including fuel consumables brake pads tires etc entry fee hotel room and fuel to tow to the track.  In an average LeMonsChump race youll get about  hours of seat time if everything goes well... sometimes more.  And some races you can split  ways to bring that cost down even more.Lots of teams also rent out seats in their car.  You still have the initial investment in all the safety gear and to rent a seat youre probably looking at  for a weekend.  Go to the LeMons or Chump forums and just start hanging around there if youre interested in getting into a seat that way.,motorsports,cfzd0qs,5,t5_2qjt1

639029,0,t1_cgcgrij,The reason I added LVMS in particular was because the map layout had a gap in the general area of Nevada and I needed a cookie cutter oval in the picture somewhere. Although this picture focuses on the Americas the full version which is nearly finished will include tracks from all over the world in a somewhat limited space so Im afraid the differences in shapes of the intermediate ovals and milers differences which I am aware of arent enough to warrant their inclusion IMO. I will include Darlington however.The Sonoma layout pictured is indeed the long form layout NASCAR uses a shorter layout. Im not  sure about of dirt tracks as Im tending to focus on major circuits recognized internationally but Ill make an exception for Eldora as it hosted a CWTS race last year.Thanks for your suggestions!,motorsports,cgcwplb,2,t5_2qjt1

Typically it is set at a right angle to the pressure side surface of the airfoil  and projects  to  of the wing chord  This trailing edge device can improve the performance of a simple airfoil to nearly the same level as a complex highperformance design. gtThe device operates by increasing pressure on the pressure side decreasing pressure on the suction side and helping the boundary layer flow stay attached all the way to the trailing edge on the suction side of the airfoil. gtCommon applications occur in auto racing helicopter horizontal stabilizers and aircraft where high lift is essential such as bannertowing airplanes. gtgtImage from article iInteresting Dan Gurney | Flap aeronautics | Spoiler automotive | Bobby Unser Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcjquuyp oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecjquuyp.

We finally disconnected the front anti roll bar which was set at full soft anyway which turned out to be a big improvement.

2247549,0,t3_2kx96n,For reading around the pay wallInfiniti will enter a new twocar squad in the  British Touring Car Championship.Nissans luxury vehicle division is backing a team led by experienced racer Derek Palmer who will drive one of the Qbased NGTC contenders.Fellow Super Touring competitor Richard Hawken who has previously tested with current BTCC squad Speedworks is the other driver.The Support Our Paras charity is also part of the notforprofit team which will compete under the Infiniti Support Our Paras Racing banner.The outfit to be based in a newly refurbished HQ at Mallory Park will include a number of injured paratroopers. It hopes to bring one through the junior racing ranks to join the driving strength in future.Infiniti regional director for North Europe Steve Oliver said To have an Infiniti on the starting grid in the BTCC next year will be an exciting event on its own but to have the car represent the Parachute Regiments main charity makes it exceptionally worthwhile.Infiniti is establishing itself as a main player in the premium sector in the UK with sales on the increase and a new design centre in London. From next year we will manufacture the first Infiniti for Europe outside of Japan from the plant based in Sunderland.These racecars reinforce our commitment to the UK.Team principal Palmer said We are aware of the challenges ahead of us but with the united forces of The Paras and Infiniti we believe we have the power to deliver results in the BTCC.David Leslie leads Laurent Aiello Nissan Donington Park BTCC The introduction of the team coincides with the amalgamation of two charities the Parachute Regiment Afghanistan Trust and the Parachute Regiment Charity to form Support Our Paras.Afghanistan Trust CEO Colin Smith who will become director of operations for the new charity said This is something totally different. Its employing injured paratroopers and they can eventually make a career out of this that has never happened before.Series boss Alan Gow will loan two TOCA BTCC Licenses for Infinitis first season.I keep two TBLs up my sleeve for a twocar manufacturer team Gow told AUTOSPORT. Its great for the championship to have a new manufacturer and particularly a premium brand such as Infiniti.Theres a great initiative behind the team too with the Support Our Paras charity being such a worthwhile cause.Nissan contested the BTCC for much of the Super Touring era of the s taking the drivers title with Laurent Aiello in  its last season in the series,motorsports,clpillj,3,t5_2qjt1
