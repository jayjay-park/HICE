If your talking about making colors and filters like not just the border than you have to scroll through the rgb colors until you find the color you like. The program is easy to use but it is also limited really fun tho.,video_mapping,cxbkhxk,1,t5_31d8s
5982269,0,t1_cy3sndc,Thank you for your response. I have actually been using Madmapper and Arena for the actual mapping part. I am just trying to do something more elaborated installation and that is the reason why I want to start learning D program.,video_mapping,cy3t220,1,t5_31d8s
9052146,0,t1_d7z8ckj,Lmao.  That was a delicious reply. Thanks.  Your poor certificate flaunting just strengthens the pungently hilarious lack of understanding that is perfectly apparent in your post. If you know so much about computers then why are you asking for help on Reddit? ustonetear is that you? Look. Video mixing is intense and if you really understand then you should know this is an obvious solution. Dont use a Mac. Get a better fucking computer. ,video_mapping,d7zx9e2,1,t5_31d8s

Wireframe moving lights and shadows crumbling rebuilding transformation what ever you can think of. It was probably mapped in madmapper resolume or VDMX.  Multiple projector image stitched together at proper angles boom youre done. Source  I do this for a living haha.  Its much more in depth than this but this is the basic idea.,video_mapping,dbaw2kl,2,t5_31d8s
