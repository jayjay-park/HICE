8040309,0,t3_4p91w7,Fall River native. I moved long ago but live in the Boston area so I am back somewhat often. As far as active FreetownFall River has hiking fishing etc. Horseneck Beach is beautiful and a  minute drive. If youre going that way you can go to Buzzards Bay Brewing and Westport Vineyards on the way back both have tastings and beautiful outdoor space where you can hang out all day. Theres a handful of good spots to hang out near the waterfront in Fall River including The Cove Tipsy Toboggan Mesa . Yes Fall River has many shitty parts but theres beauty in it too! Plus youre quite close to Newport and Providence as well as an hour from Boston. ,FallRiver,d4jt15i,1,t5_2svl7
