2589602,0,t1_cmwdudq,The scholarship doesnt sit right with me and I cant quite articulate why. It feels like reddit is taking ownership of Haes memoryidentity. Usually these sorts of things are run by the familyfriends of the deceased. This time its a bunch of strangers who are only aware of Hae because they are interested in whether or not her convicted murderer got a fair trial andor actually did it. It seems like the memory of Hae should belong to those that knew her and cared about her and reddit is using it for its own agenda. Plus putting the reddit name on it seems to steal the limelight at bit. It seems like its more about reddit doing a good thing than remembering Hae and honoring her memory. I dunno. In the end the money is going to a good cause so its not all bad. I just wonder how the family feels. I believe reddit and the rest of the world should each remain separate entities. Its fine for reddit sleuths to dig up and speculate whatever we can but it crosses a line when people start trying to interact with the real world. The scholarship is a positive thing but its still crossing that real world boundary line.,metaserial,cmwlj7u,5,t5_34cru
