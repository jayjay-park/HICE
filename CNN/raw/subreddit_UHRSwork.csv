1911698,0,t3_2givw1,Interesting how does this actually work? Like are you manually posting the hits as you see them come up or do you have a program thats detecting them? Assuming the latter whats the time delay in terms of being posted to UHRS gt being posted to the forum gt getting email notifications? Seems promising!,UHRSwork,ckjjq25,1,t5_32r36
3079555,0,t1_cogzd3y,Just some helpful advice...but that rate is WAY too high for ANY UHRS APP. That means you were submitting a hit every . seconds on average. Youll be lucky if your account isnt placed in review on suspicion of spamming if you repeat that pattern. It depends on the app but at a minimum you should be spending no less than  seconds per hit.,UHRSwork,coh6zd0,6,t5_32r36
4008052,0,t3_36drsn,what country are you in?,UHRSwork,crd5cmq,2,t5_32r36
4389668,0,t1_csk3vx3,Hm. I did that and they either tell me to spend more time on the hits or that they appreciate comments.,UHRSwork,cskg9w6,1,t5_32r36
4445689,0,t1_csr1vc9,I thought the same but I received an email of their payment schedule for this next fiscal year and saw a new article about Appen and Microsoft making a multi billion dollar deal. Maybe that changed.,UHRSwork,csr2cx8,1,t5_32r36
4473869,0,t1_csuid8c,Still No HitApps available for me. editIts back finally!!!Its around  pm PST,UHRSwork,csulpvh,3,t5_32r36

4981484,0,t1_cumf2x4,oh i see. on the actually Clickworker site right? I might be doing some of those tonight i guess. I feel like i could just go on Mturk to make that kind of money lol,UHRSwork,cumgbvk,1,t5_32r36
5207246,0,t3_3ma2by,Ya Ive noticed that happening to. Not with passage quality as Ive only seen v but it seems like things are going to shit over at UHRS between lower pay and lack of work availability. Its been my last resort lately hopefully I wont have to use it at all soon.,UHRSwork,cvdnykc,2,t5_32r36
5467072,0,t1_cwa73dh,Thanks for the warning post at least. I started doing survey sites just to do a minimum  an hour on my downtime and then I saw big batches of is this adult and I figured I could make it on UHRS and just add it to my next paycheck but your post served a good warning not to risk it.,UHRSwork,cwagxjk,1,t5_32r36
5564241,0,t1_cwme796,Waited till today to see if it fixed itself but it didnt.I sent them an email just now so hopefully that will help.,UHRSwork,cwmsm5o,2,t5_32r36
5586570,0,t1_cwp39ba,Funny because I made about  yesterday over the course of  and a half hours. Email Clickworker and tell them no hitapps are showing up. Others have had the same problem and its been manually resolved.,UHRSwork,cwpke2p,1,t5_32r36

6840047,0,t1_d0rawdh,Ah i see. Thank you that really helped !,UHRSwork,d0rmgg1,1,t5_32r36
6933740,0,t1_d127p5p,This is weird. I cant even get that popup window to write the email and the password. Its going for about  hours now and were losing money. Any feedback or solutions? ,UHRSwork,d129knb,1,t5_32r36
7017900,0,t3_4bqg11,I too have always wondered how it all works and how its determined as to what hitapps you see. Obviously I dont see hitapps that Im permanently banned from but besides those what else am I not seeing that others are seeing. At the beginning of March I wasnt able to do much work due to illness but I would check my account almost daily and very little was ever added to my account during those days that I didnt work. Then as soon as I started working again a lot more started showing up. Did the fact that I wasnt working affect how much was showing up in my favorites?There is so much that I dont know about this job and how it all works!!,UHRSwork,d1btsss,3,t5_32r36
7492733,0,t1_d2sr05o,wow you come off like a complete douche. congrats!,UHRSwork,d2tvt0o,0,t5_32r36
7785795,0,t1_d3r00av,I got kicked this morning for the first time as well. My quality is at  ... Ive never gone below  in all the years I have done UHRS. I dont know if they are getting stricter or if it was just a bad batch. Junk Labeling has been hit or miss for me for the past month and I got kicked for the first time ever from Question Answering Relevance last week as well. Im starting to think I need a long vacation which is coming at the perfect time since we are likely coming upon the dry season. Good luck out there!,UHRSwork,d3r6gnm,1,t5_32r36
8127941,0,t3_4qjuct,I have been working on this hitapp with a spam score around  all day today and I havent been temp banned yet. My speed is around h and Ive been skipping quite a lot too. No idea why you got kicked out. ,UHRSwork,d4tnk0t,1,t5_32r36
8274717,0,t1_d588f5t,A few of the RTA questions I remember said that if the irrelevant map results are at the very top of the page then the other side is Better because the st result is the most important and it wastes a lot of space. If relevant recipes are at the top and the irrelevant map results are farther down the page the other side is only Slightly Better assuming all other results are relevant of course.,UHRSwork,d5bwcg5,3,t5_32r36
8421185,0,t3_4uygxb,Havent updated a resume for a while but I dont see why not. Cant imagine getting a reference obviously and am not sure how Id word it but if its some form of work that takes up significant time think it deserves a mention.,UHRSwork,d5u6vl0,1,t5_32r36
8644268,0,t3_4y98r6,It depends on which ones youre doing. Dont go trying to do the highest paying ones if theyre going to take you a long time to do. You need to stick to one at a time that you can do fast and well. Meaning do not switch between Hitapps. I make  an hour on  individual ones but there has to be enough to do in that individual Hitapp to last an hour which there has not been for my  main ones that I just mentioned. For example earlier in about  mins I made  dollars but then they ran out.,UHRSwork,d6m57ht,1,t5_32r36
11253488,0,t3_60kpuz,Im thinking its a global Windows privacy setting or related to anti virussecurity software. If not might be worth repairingreinstalling IE. Good luck tracking it down.,UHRSwork,df7kdyl,1,t5_32r36
