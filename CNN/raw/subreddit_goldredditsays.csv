Lots of people there are not native speakers of English and may just repeat things they heard when they visited Anfield Road or wherever .The most ethnic and homophobic slurs I have read is at Univision.com in comments after match reports.,goldredditsays,cf3ciz7,2,t5_2t72t

7865376,0,t1_d402rzs,Strawman much? I said none of those things.California has a law Penal Code Sections  which state that three years in state prision is the expected sentence. The reason you are getting so much backlash is becausegtI think that theres no way that being raped while unconscious could fuck your life any worse than  years prisonThat is an abhorrent statement to make. How could you possibly understand what it does to a person?gtIf she was completely conscious maybeImplying that rape isnt as bad if a person is blackout drunk.gt I think that a few months prison and not getting into any registry should suffice especially since he was drunk and allImplying that rape isnt as bad of a crime if the perpetrator is drunk too.Lastly your strawman response just makes you look even worse. Go back to the shithole you came out of and leave the serious discussion to people with coherent thoughts.,goldredditsays,d4052jq,14,t5_2t72t

11301999,0,t1_detwe9t,Hey I have an idea! Instead of having corrupt politicians get bought out by corporations making laws which artificially decrease competition why dont we make the market freer to compete in so that the market has power and not individuals! Is a lot closer to what libertarians believe. Your quote represents fascism something which is already widespread in America.  ,goldredditsays,dfd2cgc,3,t5_2t72t
