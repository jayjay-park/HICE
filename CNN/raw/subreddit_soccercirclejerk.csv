5568451,0,t3_3rcjoc,As an American who played soccer for  years thats what I call the sport that I played since I played in America. I refer to it as football as an observer because that is what it is called in the countries that I watch these comments kind of bother me. Do I wish that I grew up in the UK and had a community team like Southampton or someone to support? Yes I do. I am insanely jealous of people who get to grow up and live in places where football is huge and there have been teams for over a hundred years but I didnt. I grew up in America. I played soccer for many years. I love the sport. Just because I live in America doesnt make me any less of a football fan. It does however make it insanely frustrating that I dont get to see the games in person like many people most of whom seem to take it for granted. A lot of us Americans who like these big EPL teams like them because they were the first ones we really heard of. Thats just the way it is. I was in my late teens before I ever even saw a football match on TV. In conclusion sorry Im not English.,soccercirclejerk,cwnbfkf,8,t5_2tfso

6587765,0,t3_45td94,This sub is a disgrace with shit posts such as this one. How can you blame the clubs lack of success on Ronaldo? is he the reason we cant win games now?. I watch every madrid game and sure enough i notice his dip of form and his wasted chances and what not but you people are really nitpicking he is not suddenly a bad player and in fact he has improved over the last month or so under Zidane he seems more pacey and more involved in defence also you need to remember that defending is not his job and has never been so i dont know why someone would expect that from him. So we should bench him and bring whom? who in the bench is better than Cristiano? who in the world is better than him?. What we really need is figure out how to play with him and the others and i think Zidane has done a great job so far Cris is getting his chances Modric is a monster in the midfield and Isco is Zidanes greatest weapon what this team needs is for James to get back on form Bale to get out of injury as well as Ramos bench Danilo forever and i think we would be unstoppable. I trust this team and im very happy with our current squad and manager people like you OP should be banned from posting shit such as this one.Ronaldo high scoring rate even in this dip of form or not scoring the important ones just lets you know how much he wants to compete he needs to keep scoring goals even if we are up  you say it is because of his individual achievements but even if that would be the case i think is great to have someone with that hunger. It can only be good for the team if we had  Ronaldos. On the matches that he doesnt score which i think you dont even watch due to your comments is not that he doesnt try it is not like he wastes every chance Madrid has and thats why we dont score he also tries to set up teammates and is basically always in good position looking for a pass he is always making him and his teammates pressure the opponent he is always trying to win the games he seems super frustrated if we are down or tied. I really like that of him the most competitive guy in the sport even if he doesnt have the ability to win games by himself anymore he really tries. Please watch the games before you make up bulshit stats statements such as this.,soccercirclejerk,d00q8sb,5,t5_2tfso

6894201,0,t1_d0xl4mh,uj I had it saved for inspiration later. Next time just say it was a xpost and dont link to it rule no  in sidebarAs I turned  in the th grade in a small town in southeastern Wisconsin I became infatuated with football. Soccer. Whatever the fuck youd like to call it. To me its football it makes the most logical sense to call it that and I think the rest of the world agrees.I began playing at an early age. I was aggressive in athletics but my small stature put me at a disadvantage in comparison to the other boys who were born and bred outside defensive linebackers thats a position in American Football. I continued playing soccer football and I loved it. I was the one of the quickest boys on the pitch. I took to scoring goals and loads of them. Mind you it was the kick and chase leagues not much actual skill required to flourish.When I reached the tender age of  Id dove deeper into the goings on behind the game I loved so much. Footballers were gods and legends across the world and I had no idea. Soccer football had a real and lasting impact in every country but my own. For a while I cursed my misfortune. But even though Im removed from the location doesnt negate my joy of seeing the beautiful game being played by the greats of the world.Once I was around  and old enough to properly in my mothers words internet on my own I began watching every video clip of football I could possibly get my hands on. After careful review and considering my taste for elegance I dove headfirst into the endless abyss that was The Arsenal.Fluid graceful stunning merciless fear striking aweinspiring Arsenal. All of these terms became synonymous to me. I never had a choice for my favorite Premier League Club. I was always a gooner. My classmates looked up to Alex Rodriguez and Tom Brady. I looked up to Thierry Henry and Dennis Bergkamp. At that age I couldnt afford or even beg my financially strict parents for jersey so I wore red. Whatever I owned that was red became my jersey a handmedown tshirt for catholic league basketball a worn down pair of socks with no elasticity left a baseball hat with the logo faded beyond recognition. When match day came I wore red.When I hit high school and my love for Arsenal grew beyond my containment I begged my mother for a subscription to Arsenal player the video platform hosted on arsenal.com. Back then it cost  per year. Having no income posed a problem. I performed extra chores mowed the lawn and many other things I truthfully wouldnt have done otherwise just to watch arsenal games and they werent even live. I had to wait the mandatory  hours just to see them. Despite being a day behind I loved the fuck out those games. It became a ritual for me  do my homework do my extra chores to pay for my arsenal subscription and finally unwind and watch the game. I didnt mind that I was a day behind. Arsenal was my team and I would do anything to watch them play. Since then Ive grown up quite a bit I can afford to watch the games live and join in the misery of losing  to Swansea at home. But no matter how much I grow up Ill never lose that childlike wonder while watching Arsenal take the pitch.All that being said Ive never been to an Arsenal game. I understand the ticket prices and the absurdity that comes with them but just because I dont pay the prices does not make me any less of a fan. I suffer when Arsenal struggle. My day is ruined by a draw that we shouldve rightly won. Ive cried screamed punched walls and broken glasses because of The Arsenal and Id do it all again. The way this season is going it looks like I most certainly will do all of those things again. Just like all of the fans in England Ive put sweat work and tears into this club.So for fucks sake can we please not let the shit win the fucking league?I am a Gooner and I always wear red.,soccercirclejerk,d0xrxyh,7,t5_2tfso

We used to be called the MetroStars and our fight songs are built to interchange Metro New York and Red Bulls depending on the capos in our ultra squad  and they mostly use Metro and New York.Is there Red Bull branding everywhere in the arena? Yes. BUT its the franchise logo that is in the majority of the stadium and the team logo is only somewhat similar to the beverage logo.Plus Red Bull is the cheapest item at concession stands which can be helpful during midweek games.It feels strange sometimes to support a franchise named after a beverage but learning about the origins of other franchise team names has eased my mind. Personally one of the things I like about being an NYRB fan is that there are other Red Bulls teams in our franchise. Head coaches share tactics and learn from each other. Our roster train with Liepzig and Salzburg giving them an idea of European fitness standards. And Ill be watching every RB Liepzig game with a flag around my neck this season and supporting them because when they do well we do well.,soccercirclejerk,d8vqmy4,8,t5_2tfso

Growing up all my friends were Utd fans and so I rooted for City for that reason to spite all of my friends without knowing much about the Mansour City Soccer Group. I have a deep appreciation for the sport now and like many players but I could never really part with the City Group. Fast forward in time I have since tried to read as much about the group on Wikipedia to get an understanding of the groups history. I dont consider myself a diehard purebred City Group fan but I watch every game and try to support them the best I can which is more than some European fans can say. It is so nice to know that there are other American SkyBlue fans that feel the same way.,soccercirclejerk,d9ulsy0,24,t5_2tfso
