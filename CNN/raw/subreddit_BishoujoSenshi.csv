2624814,0,t3_2pxhf8,I think we should stick with this one. Weve got users directing here already and stuff starting to pop up. I think if we all keep running around and snagging up every Sailor Moon related subreddit name well do ourselves more harm than good in the long run. Then when people go searching theyll find a million different things that just lead them back here. If we just let the other names go unregistered wouldnt they just come up with this and rsailormoon when they search? Im not  sure how it works so someone correct me if Im wrong. But yeah. I think this is good and it has my vote. I dont see why fans wont eventually find it AND if they search for Sailor Moon Im pretty sure that we will use the words sailor moon here enough that we will still pop up. So yeah. This is where Id like to stay. Ill move again if we have to but this sounds great to me! ,BishoujoSenshi,cn177ab,3,t5_2zg2r

2628670,0,t3_2pwx46,I really hate to admit it but Im totally let down. I tried so hard to like this thing and to forgive its flaws but cramming two arcs into one season didnt do the characters any favors and the sloppy animation was just consistently painful. The story is a lot of telling instead of showing its too condensed to build tension or relationships. I think Sailor Moon and its fandom deserved better than this. Not judging people whove enjoyed it but I cant see it as anything other than a disappointing trainwreck. I dunno if Im going to bother with the second arc.    There were bits of it that I think were pretty and nice it was at its strongest when introducing new senshi but then as soon as theyre part of the group they turn into this weird hivemind that just yells USAGICHAN a lot but Im mad Toei cheaped out on us. The ridiculous pricetag on the BDs pretty much proved to me that this wasnt a creative effort so much as an attempt to get nostalgia dollars. And Im mad they strung us along for two years first.,BishoujoSenshi,cn1paii,1,t5_2zg2r
