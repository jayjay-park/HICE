Otherwise youll be able to move in with him about a month and a half after youre added due to not receiving BAH until then.Also keep in mind your future husband will not be allowed to live in the barracks when you get married so he will have to live on his own from March until May whether in base housing or off base. ,USMilitarySO,cejoaxs,1,t5_2ta0n

Just as there are people who will judge you for being the stereotypical Stepford Army Wife theres a manual and it is severely creepy there are other people who will judge you for having your own career your own goals and your own interests been there and developed a great middlefinger reflex. As long as you and your spouse are cool with whatever youre doing within the bounds of legality no one else matters. That said Id actually advise against the stickers tshirts etc. for a more practical reason.

They treat those subreddits like little middle school clubhouses and God forbid any woman including service members or civilian opens their mouth around them.Ignoring the fact that Im not married Im in a minority situation as the male SO of a female soldier though more of us seem to have been popping up around here lately. This probably shields me from a lot of the stereotype which definitely has some basis in sexism. Im sure some people matching the stereotype exist and maybe it used to be a lot more common but thats no excuse for the intentional disrespect being shown by those that use those stereotypes to berate any military spouse they meet.There are two things I think military SOs can do to combat the stereotype.. Dont match the stereotype.

If you are very sick on your treatments he will almost certainly get to stay home. If you are doing fine he may or may not. That also depends on how important his position is and if someone else can easily take over for him.Basically  what was already said... he needs to discuss this with his command.,USMilitarySO,cjyg3oe,2,t5_2ta0n

We spoke often through letters during basic training. She is in Aschool now for air traffic control. Ill be honest its been difficult. In her own words shes changed. I understand. It happens. Id be shocked if she didnt. We are putting off committing to marriage until after we see each other after she finishes Aschool. Her first orders are for a  month deployment at sea. Im still trying to be supportive but Im honestly not entirely comfortable with the situation. So before I get too deep into life story despite all the talking we did before hand her enlistment became a lot more stressful and difficult on our relationship than either us could have imagined.Sorry that turned into kind of a vent comment.

5061328,0,t3_3hsjkg,The one thing I would be concerned with is if your husband gets overseas orders. We are in the process of PCSing to Germany and they will review your medical records  not the details but the fact that youve had ongoing care  and will have a meeting with you and your husband to discuss your ongoing care and then they will make a recommendation on whether or not youre able to go overseas. Then theyll confirm with whatever base youre going to that they can handle whatever ongoing treatment youre seeking. Sometimes it seems silly. My husband and I were going to take Clomid to try and get pregnant. Mind you there are no ongoing issues with either of us but we were told that if we started Clomid then I could possibly be denied being able to move with him. A friend that moved to Germany in June who was in the Army for  years and is now out but married to a man who is still in the Army was almost denied because she was treated for asthma ONCE five years ago. So she was fine to PT and deploy but moving her to a modern European country next to the largest military hospital outside of the US wasnt ok. I have another friend whose husband had command sponsored orders to Japan and she has mild scoliosis and some ongoing dental issues. After about  months of treatment for the dental issues she was ultimately denied because of the scoliosis even though she hasnt been treated for it in several years. Her husband moved to Japan for a year by himself and she moved home. So Im not saying not to get treatment but its just something to be aware of. So if he thinks that overseas orders may be in his future and if youd want to be able to go along then you may want to see if youre financially able to pay to see someone out of pocket. So as others have said I think his clearance should be fine and his career should be fine theres just the one hiccup with regards to going overseas. ,USMilitarySO,cuw2xsw,1,t5_2ta0n

But I did edit it! I read about OPSEC from the link but as I said in other comments since there is a public article about them I thought itd be okay to post the country and relative time frame. Just not the time hes coming back. He wont tell me the exact day hell be back in the U.S. though. Just the month...well...I guessed the month from what he said. He didnt confirm or deny it but I know that thats the month based off of his response. Just wont tell me the date. No one will know that one not telling his mother that either.I am staying a bit busy while he will be gone. My good friend and I are rooming together he and I have been friends for about  years now so all will be good there so Ill have him for support. I do enjoy baking hate cooking though a bit but I dont have the right stuff for everything and I despise the cleanup who doesnt hate the cleanup?. I am taking  classes  because of Biology lab at school because Im still working on a degree. Ill also be working full time and Ill be getting back into the gym since the car is almost fixed. Money is just a huge issue with everything. He told me theres also a facebook group for the units SOs but I havent heard anything about it. He told me quite a few of them have been through a couple deployments already.As for letter writing...thats going to cost a fortune. I do plan on it but it may only be once a week maybe only once every other week. I asked him about care packages too and he told me theyre . I told him thats not too bad. Ill do it like every other month if I can. Maybe every  months. I heard socks and beef jerky are a luxury. lol. Especially the jerky. Underwear too? hahaha. His mom and kind of him told me that while hes gone no matter what everything is OK. He doesnt need to know the personals. Especially since he was in Afghanistan the first two times. He already knows Im not going to handle it well at first. But he also knows Im going to counseling soon so thats going to help.As for big decisions well he wont be gone long enough for me to move again unless someone buys my friends aunts house since were renting it from her but he doesnt care much on where I live in the area. Just as long as its not a really crappy area. Ill be in a technically crappy area...but theres never really crime or anything bad.

I was just asking if others spouses do sometimes go home during long deployments. gtthough I know many people doYou answered my question. Though Id really like to hear what experiences people have had in similar situations whether they went home or stayed. I dont need anyones advice on what to do or not do.

Skype and FaceTime is a wonderful thing. Personally I think its more difficult that my husband is down range rather than my family living across the country. CDC rates are based off of your income you can look it up online. Her daycare is week and I think with the GSANACRRA program we pay week? But thats definitely something to look into. My friend is in Alaska and at the AF base there is no openings on post but there are no daycares that are part of the GSA program.

I love him dearly but I can see him being a little bit selfish at first since hes been the one away. He wont be getting away with that!

I can tell he misses me by what he does like spend an extra half hour chatting while he falls asleep or asking me about my day so he can feel like hes not missing out. When he gets home he doesnt talk about how he missed me but I can tell by his actions. Hell hold me extra close or talk to me about random things while falling asleep in bed. My SO isnt a big emotional person his love languages are quality time and physical touch. He doesnt say much but hes actionsfeelings are very clear.

9087121,0,t1_d843pbv,No you are mixing travel with movement of household goods.  They do not ship your vehicles anywhere in the US only OCONUS Navy but pretty sure all branches use the same regulations.  Youd be driving and hauling your pets and personal luggage anyway. I always used packers the insurance is top notch you get free storage when you arrive until you are ready three months? and they unpack too.  You will not be on the hook for boxes etc.  And how much experience does your spouse have driving a moving truck?  The gas mileage is dismal and rental trucks are poorly maintained.  When I say always I mean as a minor dependent as a sailor as a dependent wife and when we retired.  I lost a few books on Diego Garcia British customs laws and security made things different and a few jars from a spice rack set which were fully replaced. That is in a literal lifetime!  ,USMilitarySO,d844iv4,1,t5_2ta0n
9148987,0,t3_55lge2,Im not sure what an ADOS is but you cannot go live in Germany for a year without the Visa. You get this when you are on your spouses orders. You could stay for  month periods without that.I would not recommend moving if its only a year and especially NOT with you animals. An overseas PCS is very expensive and not all covered by the military. The animals are not paid for. We lived in Germany for  years so I can answer any questions about that if you have any.,USMilitarySO,d8bp8ch,3,t5_2ta0n
9463497,0,t1_d9fi94u,You will get a paid move to that first base no worries.  I always used the packers and let them box stuff up and deliver it.  Doing it yourself means no or little damage insurance weighing vehicles empty and full and a lot of driving and elbow grease.  Used to be you could make money on a DIY move but that is not as true as it used to be with the tighter reimbursement rules.  Right now prepare a hand carry file of all important papers and begin sorting out old or broken things to toss or donate or even sell.  Dont pack anything as that voids the shipper damage  insurance.  They do not ship vehicles so get your car ready for a road trip and ask your insurance company about roadside assistance coverage.  If you have kids or pets get them ready too.,USMilitarySO,d9fkcee,2,t5_2ta0n

10872146,0,t3_5vdlyd,If youre unmarried you basically dont exist to the military. Are you talking about if you both have your names on the condo paperwork and youre not married? He can look into VA loans which can be a great option but youd have to figure out how that works with your countys program or if they can even be used together. If he gets stationed somewhere else there arent extra benefits or help if he owns a condo in another location. Many families own a home while renting out another and its at their own risk. If renters are hard to come by or a house cant be sold thats their burden.Look into what it would be like to rent out your condo from a distance if youre serious about the condo and potentially marrying or moving with your BF. Being a landlord especially from a distance isnt for everyone. If the home is in his name with a VA loan he may be unable to purchase with a VA loan wherever he is moved next depending on the home price meaning a much higher interest rate and that can create a burden if the rental market is crappy. ,USMilitarySO,de1duk7,1,t5_2ta0n
