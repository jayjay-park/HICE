3955875,0,t3_35rmv0,About  pages in I think. Enjoying the story but I cant help but be a little annoyed at the formatting for somemost? of the characters. Dont want to give anything away but for me at least its definitely going to be a bit of a challenging read.,TheFamiliar,cr77c07,3,t5_30bo6

6414169,0,t1_cwf1g4l,spoilers I had thought the beginning of Xanthers first chapter was her having a seizure. Mostly because of this line Xanthers teeth grind down against the assault... What are your thoughts?,TheFamiliar,cziq5e8,1,t5_30bo6
7248331,0,t3_4eosui,Being that this particular thread is on the The Familiar subreddits front page Im sure youve seen this It doesnt really answer any of your questions per se but it brings to light another mystery of the fractal.Perhaps the fractal imagery is some kind of static like the film grain described in Clip  In other words the books are clips or recordings observed via an Orb. That still fits the fact that no fractals are present in the Narcon interjection. But as someone pointed out no fractals are present in pages wherein the text depicts images the how many raindrops pages for example. Not sure what that means.Furthermore you point out that the pink coloration of the fractals doesnt occur until after the Narcon interjection...which occurs after Xanther finds the kitten. So is it the cause of the Narcons or the cat?One last idea that just popped into my head relates to your theory that the fractal patterns simply serve to represent the presence of the Narcons. Since all of the fractals are different but similar in nature perhaps each fractal represents the different subsets of TFNarcon a kind of fingerprint for each one.,TheFamiliar,d22311u,3,t5_30bo6

8769870,0,t3_503ftk,Theres a bit of science fiction. But mostly its a story of a bunch of characters. With it being a long term project that will hopefully work for it. Im sure there are plenty of details that will take awhile to hash out and force a need to go back and compare past volumes. I flew through the first few just trying to understand. Im taking my time with the third one. Give it a shot. Ive never seen anything like it. ,TheFamiliar,d71wcq4,2,t5_30bo6

9490164,0,t3_5ar2pi,It starts to clear up the deeper you get into the series. With  volumes out a foothold has been established in the universe but thats all we have on this sub. One you get caught up you can start searching for other places to grab onto. Certain parts of the story are supposed to be mysterious and probably will remain that way for a while. Take the New This Season sections. They dont really have a clear purpose but the community has been musing about what they mean. Its a lot of fun once you get into the swing of things. Happy Reading friend.,TheFamiliar,d9iv69u,3,t5_30bo6
