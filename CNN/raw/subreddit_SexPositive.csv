518273,0,t1_cfz50pa,A therapist would probably be a great place to start. And honestly if your appearance is fine and your intelligence is clearly fine then it comes down to you psyching yourself out about your lack of experience. PLEASE STOP. Find a woman who you are attracted to who is kind and youll be fine. Heres the thing. A A good lover has to learn sex over again to a degree with ANY new partner because everyone is different. B You can learn a lot about sex from good porn like the Nina Hartley video on giving oral.Given that you need to stop living in your head about it and just start giving it a try. Even if its not amazing sex the first few times either a it doesnt work out with the woman but you still learned something or b it does work out and you just keep on learning! Either way you win. Sex really isnt that hard and no reasonable woman expects an amazing lover the first time she has sex with a new person. If theres chemistry it will feel great even if it isnt technically amazing sexchemistry accounts for a lot. And after that its all about learning how you two work together. With my partner the sex we have now is WAY more adventurous and kinky and awesome and complex than when we first had sex because weve learned each other and talked about sex and what we like.So. Stop being stuck in your head and just start asking women out flirting and trying sexual things at a pace youre comfortable with. Keep in mind really dumb people have sex all the timesometimes its good sometimes its bad sometimes its blah its all kinds of sexand youre smarter than many of them so you can do it too. You just need to stop wringing your hands about it. You sound like a relatively attractive and smart person. Start believing in yourself and go LIVE.,SexPositive,cfz6jkn,5,t5_2r7c9

1232123,0,t1_ci80th3,I guess it might really depend on the area then. By answering sex positive questions with high importance I have had success filtering for people that way. Gender inequality issues do still make stuff like tinder and okcupid a bit dicey. Its a much different experience for girls and for guys and that does lead to girls getting way more messages than guys do but then the girls have to put up with a certain level of harassment. ,SexPositive,ci88bpa,4,t5_2r7c9
1655084,0,t3_2d9csb,Im not familiar with the become one flesh thing as you put it. So Im not sure if any of what Im saying will make sense. I think what I wrote below sounds kind of combative but please believe that Im honestly trying to understand. I really respect you for trying to change your feelings about this!In the CMV thread you saidgt Ive internalized that sex is the highest way of relating to another person you know the whole become one flesh thing.Im not sure thats really incompatible with casual sex. Does becoming one flesh have to be a permanent thing? I understand that Hassidic Jews allow divorce.Could you look at it as a profound way of relating to another person and not require it to go beyond that? So you could have sex with a guy and just leave it at that. Thats a beautiful little relationship wrapped up in a bow.,SexPositive,cjnsc4w,1,t5_2r7c9
1697853,0,t3_2btxs3,I know Im late to the conversation but I want to say good luck to you.  You are so very not abnormal and your body is not broken or anything like that. Id also like to agree with some of the women who have commented earlier with some tips for you. . Lube  fo sho. Lube it up. I do not like my vulva touched dry. It just doesnt feel good and often hurts . Get aroused first. I think we ladies grow up in a culture that subtly encourages us to train ourselves to not let arousal take over. As a result we dont masturbate as much and we go into our sexual partnerships without a lot of experience with becoming aroused. However orgasm doesnt happen without our bodies getting aroused and going straight into rubbing the clit without being aroused is just well blah  at least it is for me. . Start slow and not directly on the clit and then as you become more aroused increase your intensity and begin stimulating closer to the clit if it feels right  you may find that its always best to stay just to the side or top of the clit. I definitely get the best results if I start slow and work up  and I tend to keep the stimulation just to the right of my clit as opposed to directly on top.My humble suggestion would be to find something to read or watch that is arousing I love Literotica too. It doesnt matter what it is just look around until you find something you like. It might take a while. Then dont even touch your genitals until you are really really aroused like wait until you really feel like you need to touch them. Then start slow make sure its lubed and just touch yourself however feels good if you have a vibrator use that later on in the process  vibrators can be just way too much if you use them when youre unaroused or use them too directly too quickly. Just think about it as a slow workup. It probably wont happen the first time but try it the next day and the next and it will happen. best of luck to you.,SexPositive,cjt6en2,1,t5_2r7c9

Which doesnt necessarily mean its bad but it doesnt help.To me it seems like its popularity is a testament to how sexually repressed we are because critics are hailing it as a sexual revolution  like as if they never read the Kinsey studies that were published over half a century ago.,SexPositive,coitv0g,3,t5_2r7c9

3342871,0,t1_cp9adie,Consent can be nonverbal though and nonverbal consent often feels like a natural part of sex  for example if you start to reach under your partners shirt and they freeze up or they move your hand to somewhere else thats a pretty clear nonverbal equivalent to I want to keep my shirt on. Also once youre in a relationship with someone you get to know the way the other person ticks and to learn what is always okay to do whats never okay to do and what still requires casebycase asking. For example in my relationship with my boyfriend its always okay for him to kiss me something Ive never objected to and usually enthusiastically respond to never okay for him to ask me to give him a lap dance something weve talked about at one point and Ive shown clear dislike of doing and sometimes okay to have PIV sex I have a medical condition that makes it difficult for me to do and he cant tell whether Ill be able to do it on a given occasion or not so its generally left up to me to initiate.These are just things you work out with a person as youre getting to know them either by picking up on their body language or if youre not so good at body language or just want to make it clear by having a verbal discussion about boundaries or a combination of both. Its perfectly okay to sit down with someone and say Look I dont want to ask for consent so often that it becomes annoying but I also dont want to violate your boundaries  whats okay for me to assume here? It might feel a little awkward because were socialised to see sex as this thing that people just know how to do without having to talk about it but still far less awkward than hurting someone because you didnt know where the boundaries lay.  ,SexPositive,cp9b8v5,7,t5_2r7c9

5414166,0,t1_cvyynin,I agree the market for mens magazines is competitive and they already have an established brand. I dont think Ive ever read one but I might if they started publishing serious journalism again. In an age of porn social media and the dying of print though its going to be an uphill battle.Pretty dubious to think of them as a net positive though. I think the effect they had on gender and sex in America will never be as great as say the feminist movement. Really it was built very specifically around the sexual liberation of Hugh Hefner. They encouraged women to be sexual but in a way that catered to his specific ideas of a fantasy woman.,SexPositive,cw3pvqm,1,t5_2r7c9

6515707,0,t3_44t3ke,many omissions and oversimplifications in this interview and very bad form to interrupt the interviewer all the time no matter how strongly one fells about something.that said there is one central problem with the whole concept it is not a gendered issue. most men face almost all of the problems mentioned most men are normal employees who get almost nothing of the profits of the company they work for. men are expected to provide many servicessocial interactions for which they are never paid. mens sexualities are policed as well. men too are oftentimes products sold to others without informed consent or any profit ever going to them. most men have to conform curtail their other interests and cannot be themselves if they want to advance their career in almost any field.what we actually need is a unconditional basic income for everybody not just women and many of the mentioned issues solve themselves. for anyone interested rbasicincomethen again I might have totally misunderstood the concept.

10329813,0,t3_5ntkuv,I am autistic and I am not asexual or demisexual. I also think humans are monogamous. Or at least most of them are. And even though relationships do often not last forever because people dont always fall in love with people who are a great fit because we need to learn from that because people change that doesnt mean that the relationship itself was a failure or not monogamous. You sound very hurt and very afraid  more than you need to be. I am not going to say cheating doesnt happen but its not a given and it does not have to stop you from having great and meaningful relationships. Love is a great thing and a great partner will be a plus to your life which also means its not necessary to have a partner and also not that every partner is a plus  because bad relationships happen and it would be a shame to throw it all out of the window.Have you considered talking to someone about how you feel?

11434096,0,t1_dfs0o3p,Obviously but you do comprehend that theres a difference between straight up forced labor vs. simple exploitation right?If I live in a community where there are alot of illegal immigrants and I know that those illegal immigrants cant just walk into any company and get hired because theyre not citizens then I can hire a few of them and pay them a few bucks an hour below minimum wage.  And what Im doing at that point is taking advantage of their situation.  Im unfairly benefiting from their legal status.Using your logic those illegal immigrants Ive got working for me are just doing it for the money and therefor it cant possibly be exploitative because thats the definition of having a job.
