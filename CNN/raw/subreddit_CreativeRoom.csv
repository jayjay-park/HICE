7926385,0,t3_4nftfm,You and I are not so different after all! Youre in a more wellestablished position and youre much more educated in the craft than I am though haha.Just listened to The Beginning And The End from beginning to end and I really liked it great album opener! Makes me wonder if my stuff will be up to par heh. I will listen to the rest and probably some of your other albums to see how youve progressed should be interesting. Keep it up man!,CreativeRoom,d47019n,2,t5_37xk7
