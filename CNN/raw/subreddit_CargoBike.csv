7247830,0,t1_d1p5ylk,I got a Yuba elMundo last year and love it to death. Your post reminded me about the RadWagon crowd funding. Are you able to get a true  miles out of each charge? My elMundo gets the  miles advertised with my wife kid and dog..but we are pushing the bike to a lb load as well.,CargoBike,d220z9h,1,t5_2wh2y

8220863,0,t3_4rya74,That last reason is good enough!  Plus once you have one youll realize there are lots of things you can do with a bike you wouldnt have thought of before owning a cargo bike.I love replacing trips that used to require a car with the bike.Also should you ever think about having kids cargo bike is the way to go.  I have my two on the back most of the time and once we ditch the baby seat I could get one of their friends on too.  Just have to deal with the hills.,CargoBike,d555x3j,3,t5_2wh2y
