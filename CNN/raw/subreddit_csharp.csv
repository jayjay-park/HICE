172241,0,t1_cexy35c,I have. I am using a combination of RestSharp and JSON.Net for a frontend for a legacy backend system written in Delphi. Delphis equivalent of WebAPI Datasnap uses some serialization policies that doesnt immidiately lend themselves to deserialization in C. Here the JSON.Net frameworks really helps with picking the objects you need out of the somewhat cluttered datasnap return values.JSON.Net is a very rich framework with every possible tool you could ever need for reading and writing JSON but it doesnt contain a REST client. So you need some other way to actually call the API and then feed the results to JSON.Net. RestSharp is a pretty good choice for that.,csharp,cey1u7g,1,t5_2qhdf

Your example bears the cost of an extra reference true but since the service instance count is likely to be tiny in the grand scheme of things it would probably work out nicely relative to the casting cost of the alternative. I like it!EDIT funny that you mention the term not existing yet. Im sure I got it from somewhere rather than coining it myself. Perhaps Ill have to do some digging some time to see if I can rediscover the source.EDIT EDIT I havent found the source but do recall it being a riff on  which instead of describing how an entire system can be made and guaranteed correct focuses on the construction of a single object and how the object should be essentially guaranteed to be fully usable by the time it finishes being constructed. I seem to remember it coming up at times in the context of DI specifically with respect to the risks of property and setter injection in comparison to constructor injection. Im sure the concept kicks around under a number of names and Id be happy to run with a more common one if someone were to bump into it or know it offhand and reply with a pointer to it.,csharp,cfdll2g,1,t5_2qhdf
333653,0,t3_1xw54j,The question is the basic failure of the concept of object orientated programming.In simple terms you should only inherit to extend. Not to save code there are other ways to do this.This is because your class hierarchy of inheritance should have identical interfaces.For example. If you do class FootBallTeam  ListltPlayergt How do you now get FootBallTeam to act as a list? A FootBallTeam obviously isnt a List of Players. However it may contain a list of Player which is why it should be a property eg class FootBallTeam  ListltFootBallPlayergt Players  get  Another obvious thing that would happen when you attempt to extend this further. Where do you put the list of sponsers  managers  trainers?Or as a good example of when you should inherit Listltgt would be if you wanted to build a sorted list. eg class SortedListltTgt  ListltTgtNow you have something that can be used with the ListltTgt but will be forced to be sorted no matter weather you access it by SortedListltTgt or ListltTgt.The problem with attempting to use really bad inheritance like in the post. Might make something functional  work really quickly. But will generate a massive amount of technical debt down the line.,csharp,cffcqm9,2,t5_2qhdf

It will iterate through each value in your selected range returning a list of elements that meet the conditions provided by the predicate substituted with a lambda expression here that it takes as a parameter. A lambda expression can take the place of a delegate andor the method that it encapsulates. So the A represents each value in your range as it is looped through. It is passed as a parameter to the rest of the code in your predicate or lambda expression. This just tests to see if the given value is divisible by  or . If either of those  tests return true the value is added to the new list.,csharp,cfp03l2,2,t5_2qhdf

While most classes will start with simple properties eventually some new requirement comes along and you need to do other things to calculate a get value or do some other thing when the value is set.  Auto properties allow you to do that in explicit getter and setters down the road without changing the external API of the class.If you had just exposed the private field as public when that thing needed to cause side effects on update or be calculated at retrieval you would have to introduce the backing field and turn it into a property regardless.,csharp,cgl9keg,3,t5_2qhdf

755182,0,t3_22soby,While I agree with you wholeheartedly on the Law of Demeter front I think this is less pandering to the lowest common denominator and more of a pragmatic move given the current position of the C community. There is a lot of existing code out there that sprinkles nulls liberally throughout its public methods and properties and there are lots of people who strive to build .NET libraries that read like Office Automation  lots of asking not much doing. So I see the nullpropagation operator as a way to help mitigate the existing NULL nightmare which fits well with Cs pragmatic approach to including various new features based on their immediate usefulness to the developer community. Its less about creating a beautiful language and more about getting things done.Theres also the whole you can lead a horse to water but you cant make him drink side to the issue. The people willing to pickpocket like crazy probably dont care about null or only fix it when they get an exception in production. These people arent going to start writing LoDconforming code overnight and giving them a nullpropagator isnt going to make them any less willing to learn how to do it. If anything I think the critical fringe group between people who care about LoD and people who dont know what it even means is fairly small so even if there was a negative impact it would be mitigated by the fact that the people the operator is ruining only comprise a small percentage of total C developers.Im personally excited about nullpropagation if only because I can see it making certain boilerplate sections of code much more expressive. For example I can see Dispose method bodies shrinking significantly as well as deep XSDgenerated object graph handling code getting simpler. Raising events turns into a oneliner as well.,csharp,cgq4d22,2,t5_2qhdf

1191034,0,t3_27r6hi,It sounds like theres more to this. Are these API contracts? If so you have to take into consideration that client is going to have know which contract to use and the the controller is going to have be expecting that version of the contractobject in order to deserialize it correctly. And also any business logic that uses new information added in newer versions of the object is going to differ from earlier logic i.e. it also needs to be versioned and that can get really messy but it is what it is.Unfortunately Im not sure theres any pretty way to do this. Typically what I have seen is that the version is either called out in the url a custom header or custom media type. What we did was use a custom media type which gets parsed before the controller is newed up. Using MVC we created a custom controller dispatcher that would analyze the request before instantiating the controller so that it could choose a versioned controller the versioned controller action parameters had the correct version of the contract so the incoming payload would be deserialized properly. And then the ugly part...Like I mentioned earlier new contracts usually mean new logic which means the business logic has to be versioned as well so your architecture should be SOA to support this cleanly. Every controller lived in a versioned namespace like you suspected e.g. MyApplication.Controllers.V.AccountController and those referenced the new contracts e.g. MyApplication.Object.Domain.Account.V.UserInformation and the controller would correctly map the versioned contract to a versioned domain request object if needed if its just a structural update then you can still map the new contract version to an old domain object. The basic idea is that once a version is selected by the dispatcher the controller can start the new versioned path of execution. Here are a few examples     old controller contract domain request and operation    public class V.Controller  Controller        public HttpResponseMessage DoWorkAccount.V.MyRequest request        var operation  new Logic.Account.V.MyOperation    var domainRequest  request.Mapnew Account.V.MyRequestMapper        return OperationProxyoperation domainRequest                 new controller new contract old domain request object old operation    public class V.Controller  Controller        public HttpResponseMessage DoWorkAccount.V.MyRequest request        var operation  new Logic.Account.V.MyOperation    var domainRequest  request.Mapnew Account.V.MyRequestMapper        return OperationProxyoperation domainRequest                 new controller new contract new domain request old operation    public class V.Controller  Controller        public HttpResponseMessage DoWorkAccount.V.MyRequest request        var operation  new Logic.Account.V.MyOperation    var domainRequest  request.Mapnew Account.V.MyRequestMapper        return OperationProxyoperation domainRequest             new controller new contract new domain request new operation    public class V.Controller  Controller        public HttpResponseMessage DoWorkAccount.V.MyRequest request        var operation  new Logic.Account.V.MyOperation    var domainRequest  request.Mapnew Account.V.MyRequestMapper        return OperationProxyoperation domainRequest                 or even a new controller old contract old domain request new logicoperation    public class V.Controller  Controller        public HttpResponseMessage DoWorkAccount.V.MyRequest request        var operation  new Logic.Account.V.MyOperation    var domainRequest  request.Mapnew Account.V.MyRequestMapper        return OperationProxyoperation domainRequest        ,csharp,ci3lz17,1,t5_2qhdf

I could think of these Attribute initializer syntax is different from object initializer when setting properties. While attributes come from C . and object initializers come in C . the syntax for attributes is inferior and therefore can be considered a mistake that caused inconsistency. anonymous methods should not have existed.

3907106,0,t3_353lky, So I created a data model with the additional suggestions I received yesterday.  I still havent thought much about how to deliver the content in the form of a UI and Im having trouble not relating my objects to what theyll look like on a UI.  But I think staying away from those thoughts and focusing on how the actual objects will behave is more important for me right now.  So here are the objects I have and what I think theyll need to make sense.                                                  Player  Will be able to get the name of the player from the user and will need a team to be assigned to it.           Team Will have a players assigned to it and will require a name.  Duplicate team names shouldnt be allowed so I suspect Ill have to compare its name to other team names to make sure they do not equal each other?                   Date Will have a month and day specified to it.  As well as a TimeOfDay.                        Now this is where things start to get a little fuzzy for me but I think Im closing in on the right track.                           Schedule Will have a bool for available and unavailable.  It allow the assigning of teams that have not yet been scheduled for a date to compete.      League Has a schedule of current assigned games and teams assigned to those.  The ability to cancel games  the ability to add teams remove teams add players assign them to teams and remove players.    So Ive been looking at tutorials on how to create an object.  I found a useful MSDN link as well as a youtube video.  Both of the tutorials create a Person class which is really similar to my idea of what a player would be.  The only thing that is throwing me off is that the objects have all of their information prespecified as opposed to being dynamic.  I have ideas on how to make my players dynamic like using a text box to enter a player.  But thinking like that throws me into this tailspin of getting confused on how the whole UI would work.  For example if I created a player or multiple players where would they go?  I find myself thinking of it on terms of what should I put them in?  An array?  A listbox.  Is this the wrong way to think about it?  I also found an interesting winforms app online that was coded in VB thats sort of similar to where Im headed with my program but the complexity seems to be on an entirely different scale than what Im looking to do so Im not sure Ill get much help from it.  I feel like my biggest issue is not understanding how to bridge together the objects I have in my mind.             Sources  Custom object classes youtube video               VB coded Sport league database                         MSDNs walkthrough on how to create an object                   ,csharp,cr1n7te,1,t5_2qhdf

But at best youre saving a temporary stack allocation anyway and Im unsure if has other performance implications e.g. preventing certain optimizations. Unless you have gigantic structs that take long to copy and are passed around in performance critical code I wouldnt bother with it. Otherwise benchmark it I guess.,csharp,ctbiv9n,17,t5_2qhdf

4728586,0,t1_ctpwok8,Yeah.  This is close to the approach I ended up taking along with Wiezys recommendation.  The bottom line was that I didnt want to keep useless update code lingering around in my project since after a year or two it could amount to a bloated mess.  On the other hand implementing some kind of downloadable script or serialized fix seemed too difficult to implement to be worthwhile.What I ended up doing was reconfiguring my project with conditional compilation symbols to allow for different entry points one for the main program and the other to be used with an optional library to build customized patch executables with access to all of the functionality of the main program.  Then I just manually get the file bytes of the compiled executable and upload the raw binary data to a secondary distribution system luckily this was already in place otherwise it might not have been worth it.  From there it wasnt so bad to make the main application download the binary patch data and load it as an assembly to be executed.I have no idea if this is considered best practice so Im open to suggestions but so far its worked out pretty smoothly.,csharp,ctqkunn,1,t5_2qhdf

6286453,0,t1_cz45pf6,You dont.  Thats decided by the .NET Runtime and the Operating System.  Its out of your hands.  The component that controls it is called the scheduler.  Heres a wikipedia article to learn some general information.  In a perfect world if theres another thread that would like to run it would get run.  I dont know how Microsoft has implemented the Windows scheduler.  Now that .NET is open source you may be able to look at the source to see how the .NET Runtime schedules thread.As I reread what youve quoted me I realize it isnt completely accurate due to the mention of OS threads.  This is my understanding.  I treat the Windows scheduler as a black box.  The .NET Runtime will control which .NET thread is allowed to pick up the next work.  The OS would only control when the .NET Runtime runs and how many OS threads it gets.  However since theyre both made by Microsoft there may be more integration and communication between the two.Edit Using the Threadpool directly is no longer the recommended way to create threads.  Use Task.Run or other TPL methods and that has what Microsoft has said is a more efficient way to create and manage threads via their thread pools.  There was a great diagram someone created a while back explaining how TPL allocates threads in threadpools but I cant find it now.,csharp,cz4763l,1,t5_2qhdf

The unnecessarily complexity of its nuances may make you murderous.  I dont have enough experience with Winforms to compare the two but I can tell you that WPF is a heartbreaking disappointment.  Nearly every week or two we find a new bug.  The latest one is that you cant set a null value to a binding when the property name is Item.  Thats hardcoded in the framework because of indexer stupidity.

6330248,0,t3_42892j,Its really hard to say. Ive been poking at WPF in some form or another since its release but Ive been a WinForms developer for  years and counting. I worked on a team developing controls for both platforms and then a major WPFSilverlight application from about . Then for a myriad of reasons I jumped ship to a mobile shop. We ended up in Xamarin.Forms which is very clearly inspired by WPFSilverlight but frustratingly short of parity.WPF is quite difficult to learn there are many things you have to know for it to all fit together. And others are right there are parts that just seem nonorthogonal and buggy.  I think some of this is similar to how WinForms stopped getting much love once WPF released. MSs attention right now seems to be on evangelizing the Windows Store and also porting everything they sell to Mac OSiOSAndroid. Thats part of what motivated me to jump off the Windows platform as my main career I want MS to decide what their plan is before I settle down again.If youve got a good WinForms codebase and its truly extensible in a way that keeps you onbudget and onschedule I dont think you should leap into the deep end of WPF. But I think you should start reading books and for smaller lowrisk projects start using WPF. It will be slower there will be mistakes but youll build some crucial experience and have some idea of how hard itll be to consider larger projects with WPF. More importantly youll make your mistakes in places where the stakes are lower. I think you risk shoehorning yourself if you dont learn some basic WPF concepts.One sad fact is a lot of the presentation tricks that are why WPF feels so much nicer dont matter to customers. If youve ever tried working with transparency in WinForms youll know what Im talking about. But most customers are perfectly fine with interfaces that look exactly like what was delivered by VB in the s. Dont be fooled into thinking that because WPF can be made gorgeous by a designer that it cant also use developer art. You dont have to hire a team to polish your UI unless youre trying to make glitz a selling point. Im cautious here because my personal belief is the nature of Windows Desktop as a product is about to change radically and that the only framework MS will support in the aftermath is something that looks like WPF. I felt so strongly I left a stable job to get onto a different platform. Apply that conspiracy theory and bias to your evaluation of my opinion.,csharp,cz96h7y,2,t5_2qhdf

In mine all you do is implement an interface and the runtime automatically registers it and figures out what you want injected.  Controlling the injections just uses an XML file or it provides a GUI to build the structure.Heck here is the link on github  Ive looked at a bunch of these injectors and they are all kind of annoying to deal with so I ended up rolling my own in .  Again this one is for transportation modelling but the basics are.

7244413,0,t3_4em97u,Ive been in the computer industry for  years. Ive hired and fired a lot of people over the years. My experience is .NET developers are more likely to be full of shit than others. I cant tell you how many .NET developers with  years of experience Ive fired for gross incompetence. One guy I fired recently broke into a former employer and shot his former boss who fired him for the same reasons I did. So my experience is that Java developers mostly know what they say they do and so my interviews focus on the personality fit while .NET developers are full of it so my interviews are a technical grilling and even then I may have to get rid of them if they turn out to be an idiot. I was very proud of the fact that Id only ever had to fire one guy and that one for serious insubordination. I was his boss. I asked for access to the database. He refused and said I wasnt competent to use the database even though Id previously been a DBA. So I had someone else cut him off and put me in and I fired him.

7639865,0,t3_4jybq6,Your problem is this line    string content  string.ConcatcontentThis says that you are creating a new variable content each time you loop through your code.  What you want to do is define your content variable outside of the scope of your for loop and then content.Concatcontent.  Review your variable scopes if youre still confused why this is happening.Incidentally this is a poor way to structure this code.  Essentially every loop youre writing out the entire file again.  What I suggest you do is instead open up your file as a FileStream use a using statement! and write out each line the same way you do to the console.  Also for bonus points consider using a StringBuilder instead of string.Concat since it is generally faster for these kind of situations.  Its also not clear to me from your code snippet why you need to accumulate all the previous text either.  If you change to writing out each line as I suggest I suspect this goes away entirely.,csharp,d3alzd8,3,t5_2qhdf

7804964,0,t3_4m7wgm,As I understand it its a shortcut for a pattern sort of like    if someObject is someType         var x  someType someObject         expressions using x    So the big value again as I understand it based on this and this right now is that it handles the cast and assignment to the local variable for you. That reduces the possibility of errors e. g. checking for is TypeA then casting to TypeB and hopefully increases readability.So its not huge but it does clean up something like this    if obj is Foo         DoFooThingsFoo obj     else if obj is Bar         DoBarThingsBar obj     else if obj is Baz         DoBazThingsBaz obj     else         DoNormalThingsobj    to something like    if obj is Foo f         DoFooThingsf     else if obj is Bar b         DoBarThingsb     else if obj is Baz z         DoBazThingsz     else         DoNormalThingsobj    or    switch obj         case Foo f            DoFooThingsf            break        case Bar b            DoBarThingsb            break        case Baz z            DoBazThingsz            break        case             DoNormalThingsobj            break    This isnt a huge improvement which is why there was marked disappointment when the fancier pattern matching features were pulled.

8122788,0,t1_d4t19br,I admit its probably not a particularly popular post. I do want to clarify it a bit though.Im not saying that libraries are bad or that we shouldnt use them.  I just think we might want to be a bit more careful about when we use them.  Id prefer  lines of code for a particular feature over adding a mb DLL dependency to a library that contains the feature when thats all Im going to use.To use my example from earlier all I used in Prism was CommandDelegate EventAggregator BindableBase... and that was it.  Did I need Prism.Core.dll Prism.Wpf.dll and whatever other dependencies they came with?  Probably not.  I dont know what it takes offhand to write EventAggregator but BindableBase could be covered functionally in maybe  lines of code and CommandDelegate has code implementations all over the internet.  Needing those DLLs ended up overkill.It didnt help that I was writing the app as a code sample for an interview and when I zipped up the whole project including dependencies it was mb.  I stripped out the dependencies  since VS will happily redownload them when the recipient compiles it  and the resultant zip file was about k which is much better for an email attachment.  My ultimate point is that we as programmers should be careful.  The library that saves us  minutes of coding time could end up adding a plethora of files to an application which are their own potential failure points.  And maybe my opinion is just a relic of the days when a bunch of DLLs added to an application caused a million headaches but if your application is sufficiently simple you shouldnt need mb of dependencies to support a k application.,csharp,d4t2okq,3,t5_2qhdf

8286662,0,t1_d5cor2o,I was curious from your comment and uAPimpNamedAPimpNameds comment about contextswitching and knowing a little about IOCP just how expensive asyncawait actually is. Stephen Cleary pretty succinctly explains the process in There is no Thread and theres a followup comment at the bottom regarding where DPCs execute.It seems that the execution of an async Task is actually pretty cheap. Perhaps allocating the memory for it is more expensive however. Granted those ms and s operations can add up but I think its negligible to the point of stating that each individual request is slower is a misnomer even if technically true.Regarding contextswitching it seems that only the DPC and of course the application process and any threads involved are involved with the process scheduler and thus have that additional expense. Async Tasks themselves however arent involved in contextswitching as the work is handled by devices and completion is handled through interrupts which happens for synchronous work too and IOCP.EditTo help sate my curiosity I threw together a small benchmark console app Id be interested in feedback regarding how the benchmark can be made to more accurately measure the results. It seems to take  operations to produce a . second difference.,csharp,d5de3rr,1,t5_2qhdf

8836656,0,t3_517r2f,I see you understand the issue now but if you have similar problems in the future the best way to figure it out is to pretend to be the computer and run the program yourself.Get a pencil amp paper or use Notepad whatever to keep track of variables and their values and in your head step through the program one line at a time doing whatever the computer would do.So in the case of this program youd start at the int y line and add the variable y to your notepad with a value of  since this is the default value for integers.Then youd move on to the for ... line notice that y gets set to  and update the value of y in your notepad with just one variable like this you could just keep the current value in your head but with multiple variables it makes sense to write down their values!.Next youre onto the if y     line so work out in your head if that expression is true which it isnt for y so onto the else if y     and so on.Youll find that often you can spot the flaw in the logic this way.Another good technique is Rubber duck debugging,csharp,d7a1ib6,7,t5_2qhdf

9019259,0,t3_53t24z,A Windows Service is fine.Before creating the actual service create an assembly to do your donkey work. That is all the functions that your service will be doing. Once that is working you can test it in a console or other construct app you can then wrap the assembly in a service. And this will be as simple as constructing your assembly as you would with inside any other application.One thing to note about Windows Services though they have specfic events that are fire when they start upshut down. Also a windows service still runs top to bottom like any other app so it will stop when it reaches the bottom of the OnStart method. So youll need to await for your service logic to end. Personally I use the TPL library to spin off my worker assembly onto another thread and use the task generated by TPL to monitor its activity in loop that checks every second or so. Or simply await the task before exiting.The actual Windows Service wrapper code is dead simple in reality. You should concentrate on the code your service will be executing before actually implementing the service itself.Forgot to mention as uMacAttack said you may have to have a Windows FormsWPF app to act as a notifier in the system tray.

9132954,0,t3_55aog6,Ive been dealing with AutoMapper .x gt .. upgrade nightmares.The older version sort of handled inheritance the newer version does not.  The starting point I was handed didnt run Mapper.AssertConfigurationIsValid after configuring all the profiles to be loaded and there were missing types compounded by undocumented and possibly documented breaks.On top of all that even if you do run that its possible to configure the same mapping multiple times in multiple profiles and unknowingly pull them all in especially if youre handed a code base written by contractors who left a while ago so you might want to write some test code to figure out what type maps you have and warn if youve got redundant maps because youre just stuffing all of those maps into shared state and who knows whats happening when you do that?Like I get the point of AutoMapper.

9197085,0,t1_d8hp8c1,Ok I just did some digging around about GameMaker and unfortunately I dont think it supports what you need to do.  It seems to be pretty limited on what you can do when you call external dlls specifically in the way it passes parameters.  It seems there are only two variable types it lets you pass as arguments strings and doubles floating point numbers.   Furthermore it does not have any mechanism to allow external code to call back into your GameMaker code.  I think youre going to be stuck doing something like you were talking about earlier with files.  Unfortunately I can tell you from experience that that path will be a buggy nightmare.  Ive had to use similar hacks in cases just like this where youre trying to force some new functionality into a third party application that doesnt provide any of its own mechanisms for doing that.  All I can say is that I hope the debugging tools provided with GameMaker Studio are good because you will be giving them a workout.   Its also seriously bad news for trying to distribute this game because youre going to run into a whole pile of problems with different configurations and permissions on the end users computers that you never saw on yours.  Its a crappy situation with no good answer.  If youre not too far down the rabbit hole you might consider changing to Unity as its a whole lot more robust from what I can see from my cursory examination and can easily call arbitrary C code.

10997728,0,t3_5wgt59,Oldfashioned fourfunction calculators work by keeping track of what mode theyre in.  For instance if the calculator is in its default mode then if the screen says  and you press  then it will change the screen to say .  On the other hand theres another mode triggered when you press the decimal key while in the default mode where pressing  will change the displayed number to . instead.  Theres yet another mode triggered if youve just typed something like     where if you press  it will clear the screen and just display .Additionally if youve just typed in . and press  then your program needs to remember the . while you type in the number to divide by.So youll need fields that track the number displayed on the screen the number stored for an operation and the current mode the calculator is in.  For the decimal entry mode youll also need a field to track the place value youre currently entering.Then just think carefully about precisely what should happen in each mode when each button is pressed  what should happen to the number on the screen?  Should the stored value change?  Should the mode change?If you want to make a scientific calculator i.e. one that follows orderofoperations instead of a fourbutton one then the architecture is completely different you probably want to let the user just build up an entire line of text first and then execute it at the end.  ,csharp,deek4m1,1,t5_2qhdf

11139106,0,t1_deuiu1a,I feel unbelievably dumb right now. You are a genius hahah. Turns out I ended up accidentally commenting out the null check on the list before sending the updates from the objects in the list to their respective server in the ListView. The way I have the background worker...working and this may be bad practice because it certainly doesnt feel right is sort of like a ski lift. I wasnt sure how else to run it continuously so at the end of RunWorkerCompleted I call RunWorkerAsyncagain to start it over. Before I left out the null check if the object returned from DoWork was null it just skipped through and restarted this would be the case immediately after opening the program and until you actually added a server address to the list. At that point it would scoop it up and actually have something to work with. Thanks for making me look back through it! I hadnt removed that check when I was still testing with just a single instance of ServerInfo being returned so I hadnt even thought about it. ,csharp,deuludx,1,t5_2qhdf

11383409,1,t3_62dyf3,You will be taught objectoriented programming. You will be told that objects through their class represent some reallife domain thing. And all reallife things have a set of characteristics that describe them mapping to class fields and properties and expose some kind of behaviour mapping to class methods.So class basically has some data in form of fields and some behaviour in form of methods. Right?Wrong.Mixing the two is usually a really really bad idea. It may make sense for data structures and for some sideeffect logic i.e. IO streams but for implementing domain logic things get way simpler if you clearly separate simple dumb objects that only hold some data DTOs and things that only implement logic to process these dumb objects in a meaningful way services. You can then describe services with only their contract interface and compose them  i.e. a particular implementation of service A may require service B to work. And suddenly things like proxies adapters decorators and all those scary patterns make sense.So no please no Shape abstract class that defines abstract method to calculate area. Shape is a simple and dumb DTO it should only contain your rectangles sides or circle radius. Then you may have services strategies for calculating areas of different types of shapes and compose them all with a facade that chooses correct strategy based on the concrete type of shape.It may seem like overengineering in some cases but its usually totally worth it.,csharp,dfmagd1,2,t5_2qhdf
