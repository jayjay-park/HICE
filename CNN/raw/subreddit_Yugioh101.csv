497440,0,t3_1z820u,Mermails hit hard and fast. Theyre a very comboheavy deck and most of their effects revolve around discarding or sending Water monsters from either the hand the field or as XYZ material to the grave.They tend to do a lot of XYZ summoning for their more powerful plays and in the past they also did a lot of Synchro summoning by using !Deep Sea Diva. Some Mermail decks still use her although Diva is limited now. The Genex engine has been more popular lately with !Genex Undine used to trigger Water monster effects from the deck while also grabbing !Genex Controller for Synchro summons.Mermail decks tend to have very large numbers of monsters because of how reliant on combos they are. Mermails generally need to have monsters in the hand to trigger their effects. As an example I run  monsters and only  SpellTrap cards. Unless Im siding in specific traps to counter an opponent most of those SpellTrap cards are there to help me get to my monsters faster. e.g. !AbyssSphere !Reckless GreedMermail decks also rely heavily on the hand and graveyard for their effects. Their big beaters !Mermail Abyssteus !Mermail Abyssmegalo and !Mermail Abyssleed all activate in the hand and discard other monsters to the grave to summon themselves while their supports !Mermail Abyssgunde !Atlantean Dragoons !Atlantean Marksman and !Atlantean Heavy Infantry all need to be sent to the graveyard either by being discarded Abyssgunde or by being sent to activate a water monster effect the Atlanteans. Its also worth noting that the Atlanteans can be sent from anywhere to activate their effects as long as they end up in the grave. Mermail Abyssmegalo can tribute any of them from the field to trigger his second attack Genex Undine can send them from the deck for her effect and any Water XYZ monster can detach them as materials while still triggering their effects.Because of how reliant they are on the graveyard however cards that take away their graveyard like !Macro Cosmos and !Dimensional Fissure can really inhibit their ability to maintain field presence and put pressure on the opponent.,Yugioh101,cfwt9g4,1,t5_30a9p
1363930,0,t1_cin3fva,I also want to add one more thing....by no means is the deck list I gave you super competitive...it might win you a couple games and it is fine enough to take to a local tournament or what not.  Once the mega tins come outno idea when Fire fist rooster is probably going to get reprinted  as well as wolfbark and maybe fire fist cardinal.  When those cards become easier more accessible I can teach you how to build . axis fire fists which is by far one of the most fun decks I have ever played and if actually very competitive.,Yugioh101,cin9aus,2,t5_30a9p
1474912,0,t3_2b10a2,Heres what I came up with. Ideally Id like to test it out a bit first but youre missing some of the important cards so itll have to wait.    Monsters       x Fantasia Maiden Aria    Im sure I dont need to tell you how much work this will put in. With this you can stall until you get the cards you need and protect your bigger monsters.     x Summoner Monk    Its not a fairy and its not Light but it searches out Aria which is infinitely more important. And since youll be running a lot of spells you should almost always have discard fodder for him. All in all much more useful than Nova SummonerShining Angel. Run the  you can.     x Fantasia Maiden Sonata    Canon is pretty bad. Besides being easily summoned and lvl  she serves no real purpose. Sonata on the other hand is useful. All your boss monsters are at less than k attack so having her will help you in a pinch. And shes easily SSed with Francois which will boost her attack to a more reasonable level.     x Fantasia Prima Laureate Francois    Her effect is good but only in combination with the other Fantasias. If you open up with her youre gonna be in trouble. Possibly cut entirely or bumped to  depending on how dead she is.     x Fantasia Prima Prodigy Mozart    Really the heart and soul of the deck. Her  Aria  bad time for your opponent. The best part is she isnt limited to Fantasias so she can also bring out your other boss monsters. Too good.     x Archlord Kristya    You dont really want more than one Id think. You do a lot of special summoning so his effect is really only good if you already have your board set up. Id probably keep another in the extra though just in case you need it.     x Athena    Really good for bringing back your dead MozartFrancoisAriawhatever really. Coupled with Francois bringing back Sonatas you can potentially get in quite a bit of burn.     x Master Hyperion    Im not sure how good this will be since you dont run any agents but that destruction effect can turn the whole game around. Plus it thins your grave so you can SS Kristya.     x Hecatrice    Good for deck thinning or if you just need a monster. Not to mention with x high level monsters you really need Valhalla out on the field.     x Honest    Absolutely wonderful card. A necessity in LIGHT decks. Run the  you can.     x Herald of Orange Light    A tuner when you need it and effect negation that has a little more versatility than veiler. Run  depending on personal preference.    Spells       x Solo First Movement    Hooray searching! The other card that will bring Aria out to the field. Definitely run .     x Valhalla Hall of the Fallen    This card is going to be essential with the number of high level monsters you run. Search it out with Hecatrice ASAP for deck thinning purposes.     x Upstart Goblin of Duality    Youll be doing an awful lot of special summoning with this deck so Duality is second to Upstart. Once you get your board set up you should have no trouble knocking off an extra k life points. Both of these options are leagues better than Cards from the Sky.     x Dark Hole    Staple clears the board so you can make some Valhalla plays.     x Forbidden Lance    Semistaple. Protects your monsters from pretty much everything Aria doesnt and can lower a monsters attack so you can get over it. Very useful.     x Mystical Space Typhoon    Gets rid of problem cards. Side the rd for sure.      Traps       x Breakthrough Skill Chain    Monster effects are going to hurt a lot in this deck. Breakthrough skill can be used twice but Fiendish can last for a couple turns and prevent attacks. Try both and see which you like more.     x Solemn Warning    Dont let them get their boss out.     x Torrential Tribute    Mess up their plays and set up for a Valhalla play for your turn.     x Bottomless Trap Hole    More of the same. Staples everywhere!     x Call of the Haunted    Can bring back your Aria back to stall again can bring back MozartFrancois for another push any of your boss monsters and even Honest during your MP so you can bounce him back and get over something big. Lots of uses and Id consider bumping it up to  but Im not sure what to cut. Something to think about.       And thats what Ive got. From what I can tell you dont need much of an extra deck. Maybe some synchros for Herald and a couple staples like Blackship of Corn that you can go into with Summoner Monk. Some other things you might consider     Running a few more darks and cutting out HyperionAthena so you can run Chaos Sorcerer and BLS Envoy. Both very good cards but dont synergize much with the archetype.     Dropping KrisyaAthena for more Hyperion. Destruction is good man. You might find you need a little more. If you cut any monsters Athena should probably be first.     Running Sanctuary in the Sky. This can protect you from potentially quite a bit of damage. Especially if Aria is out this can save your bacon. Im not sure you have the room but it could be quite useful.     Think about Gellenduo as well. Also stalls very well and then you can even tribute summon your big monsters.    Edit I just realized that Francois can recycle Honest. Wow! Id probably take out Athena for another Francois then. ,Yugioh101,cj15ll5,1,t5_30a9p

5354827,0,t3_3obp7b,Nekroz is a difficult deck. You arent going to have a lot of success the first few times you play. I dont know how experienced you are with the deck difficulty playing period? know the plays but difficulty getting wins?Some generic tips  Pairs you should look for are CycleShurit KaleidoscopeUnicore and MirrorTrishula.  ManjuSenju  KaleidoscopeUnicore gives you a rank .  Clearing your board occasionally is important to get Ritual searches. Use valkyrus to do that.  Send a  from your extra deck with kaleiodscope to summon both Valkyrus and Unicore from hand. Attack tribute both and then search for a mirror.  Mirror banish Clausolas and Brionac is the standard way to summon Trishula.  Try to trish when possible but dont do it into lots of backrow  especially Bottomless. If your opponent bottomlesss your Trish youll have difficulty winning.  Djinn lock combo Manju  Summon Unicore with Kaleidoscope to make Lavalval Chain. Dump Djinn. Discard Clausolas to search Cycle. Use cycle to banish djinn and revive the Clausolas you discarded.  Try to Djinn lock when your opponent doesnt have many outs or if you have some way to protect it Gungnir Trishula Valkyrus Solemn Scolding etc.  If you djinn lock and your opponent cant draw into RaigekiDark HoleBook of EclipseBook of MoonDD Warrior Lady before you kill them you win. If your opponent has already used several of those cards then djinn locking is more likely to win the game for you depending on the matchup.  Dont ritual summon unless you are trying to accomplish something with that summon. You only have  rituals ever so make every one count. Putting a Clausolas on board for no reason just makes you more vulnerable to Dark Hole.  Try to predict what your opponent will try to do and search appropriate defensive cards TrishulaGungnirDecisive ArmorValkyrus to protect you. If your opponent is playing a deck that cant otk leaving your self open is okay  the only damage that matters is the one that kills you.  Dont forget your Rank s. Its the most effective toolbox available. Get several of CastelSilent Honor ArkBlackship of CornDiamond Dire Wolf.Some other Sources  more of a deck building guide than a howtoplay but a useful read.  The first in a series of decent youtube videos on introductory Nekroz. May or may not be below your level already.  Patrick Hoban is a WriterHigh Level competitive player and these are his notes on how to play Nekroz.

5529031,0,t3_3qub1e,Well it depends.  Do you want something thats strong or something that youre comfortable with?I think the closest fit for you right now is Yang Zings.  Theyre going to be a stronger deck because they didnt get hit.  Theyre a Synchro archetype that relies on their own self destruction to swarm the board with Synchro monsters.  They can also grant the Synchro Summoned monsters extra effects based on what materials were used.  One of their big monsters Chaofeng Phantom of the Yang Zing makes it so that the opponent cant activate the effects of monsters with the same Attributes as the monsters used as its materials making it able to shut down certain decks entirely.  It is also not a braindead deck as you need to be able to figure out which monster you want to swarm in to make your Synchros to counter your opponents plays.,Yugioh101,cwidrzv,4,t5_30a9p

5553759,0,t3_3r6zne,You can Normal Summon OR Normal Set only Once per turn unless you have a card effect that tells you otherwise eg. Double Summon.You can perform your Normal SummonSet in either your Main Phase  or Main Phase . Now due to the game rules you can not manually change the battle position of a monster the turn you summon it except with a card effect that says otherwise. So if you Normal Set Geargiarmor for example you are NOT allowed to flip summon it the same turn that you Set it. Not all flip effects require you to flip summon though. So if you set a monster and your opponent attacks it therefore flipping it face up its effect may still activate at that time if it uses the wording When this card is flipped face upNote however that Flip Summons do not use up your Normal SummonSet for the turn so if you set a monster the previous turn and flip summon it during your next turn you can still Normal SummonSet one other monster if you wish.,Yugioh101,cwlht4h,1,t5_30a9p

7214723,0,t3_4dzu1v,Okay I am an OCG player so if I cannot help sorry.I used to go with Igknight Majespecter. Its a very fast paced deck but you run out of cards in your hand very fast also. It is also susceptible to counters such as the solemns. And this deck relies heavily on the scale to be . This ensures that you can summon Kirin through pendulum. Furthermore you can also use the igknights to xyz summon.Here is the core of the deck Majespecter Racoons Majespecter Kirin Majespecter Frog Majespecter Fox of all igknights from level  to  except the level  scale  is reduced to . Majespecter Tempest Majespecter TornadoThat is one option. The second option is using Dracoslayers with majespecters. I usually call this Pure Majespecter. This deck relies on the effect of Kirin and shutting down the enemies hard. This deck is actually slower than the first deck but it doesnt burn your hand as fast and it ensures that you still have cards to play later on. Notice that Kirin is at  despite being the powerhouse of the deck. This is because you can only summon him through tribute summon or through pendulum summon with archfiend as one of the scale. The second option rarely happens when I play. This means that having too many Kirins could make your hands useless. That is why I reduced Kirin and the field card to .The weakness of Majespecter as usual are that your monster is very weak and you need to control your opponent at all times. And because Luster Pendulum and Draco FaceOff are limited now it will be even slower for this deck to prepare its control.Here is what the core of my deck looks like Majespecter Racoons Majespecter Kirin Eccentric Archfiend Majespecter Toad Majespecter Fox Luster Pendulum Vector Pendulum the Draco Overlord Master Pendulum the Dracoslayer Draco FaceOff Majespecter Pegasus the field card Majespecter Tempest Majespecter Tornado Majespecter SonicsHope this helps.PS.

Know what each of them do and then when you ask your opponent What does that card do? no matter what their response is you can formulate a plan against that response.For example if my opponent says this card Special Summons a monster from his deck I already know that Cards X Y and Z can stop whatever he pulls out of his deck.

You can also not run a side deck. In addition there are some cards Kozmojo and Dark Lady in the main deck that arent necessary for the deck to run that you can replace with budget options.Depending on your build you can probably fit  Dark Lady in there and the Cyber Dragon Nova  Cyber Dragon Infinity combo whilst staying in the price range.,Yugioh101,d7etj0t,2,t5_30a9p

9202736,0,t3_56bpbw,Subterrors is a fun option with Ghostricks to abuse the flipping effects of the level threes especially jiangshi and doll. They also provide beaters which Ghostricks sorely lack. I would definitely be running the speedroid engine cuz terrortop is a free alucard and thus a free angel turn . Some decks can utilize a small Ghostrick engine consisting of Marys Jiangshis and occasionally some of the other hand traps because the Marys and Jiangshis can grab each other and the xyz can recycle them. You can also try a mill version of Ghostricks using Ghostrick ScareSkeletonDoll to banish up to  cards from your opponents deck during each turn and has the potential for huge control and card advantage because of the disruption ghostrick scare has the ability to recycle it with dullahan and alucard and the fact that if you have an angel and a jiangshi in the mix youre getting at least two free cards a turn. Theres also the doll special summoning your Ghostricks and parade to search. Another more gimmicky thing to mention would be something like final countdown cuz of Ghostricks ability to stall and the fact that u can use it to activate Mary. Also when it comes out if youre more interested in making your opponent go wait what? You can try Tierra goddess of rebirth because Ghostricks can often get a board of  spellstraps  monsters usually with different names.
