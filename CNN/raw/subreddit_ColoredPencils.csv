4624306,0,t1_ctdedxz,I dont use colored pencils all that often. I really just started playing with them in the last few weeks. The rate Im going now if I had a sharpener dedicated to just colored pencils I think it would be years before Id need to replace the blade. I have a Jerrys Artarama not far from my house... Maybe Ill go take a look this weekend.,ColoredPencils,ctdgu6q,2,t5_2we0b
