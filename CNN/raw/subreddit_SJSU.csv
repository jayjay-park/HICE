Granted Im only there on campus one time a week and its at night anyways.Do you know at least information will be out via the Spartan Daily or what?Update  pmGot this email about  minutes ago...so roughly pm.gtA shooting occurred late this morning off campus just south of the intersection of th and San Salvador Streets. The shooting involved a UPD officer following up on reports of a person believed to be acting dangerously.gtThere is no safety threat to the campus.gtThe incident is under investigation by City of San Jose police.

SJSU has decent science and psychology programs  there are many professors with research interest you can get involved in. Some research labs might require prereq courses so ask the professors. Luckily for psych majors theres overlap between some of the premed reqs and your major courses. Youre probably looking at  units of major courses which could easily be done in four semesters not including summerwinter. As for extracurriculars you can definitely be involved with lots of stuff but its really up to you on how you manage your time between them your classes and personal life.

4970135,0,t3_3iroaw,I believe as long as you get the CSU minimum then you wont really run into a problem because SJSU does have low academic requirements. Im not advocating that you do try and get the minimum but just that they dont look more at your scores compared to your location honestly. What i mean is that theyll be more likely to accept students outside of the Bay Area and San Jose area regardless of scores. Its not hard to be competitive if you are outside of these areas. For instance Im from the LA area my gpa was like . and I got in. Ive heard from friends I go to school Bay Area with that some of their friends didnt get in even with a .XX gpa.If I remember right you need like  or  ? or whatever score to be exempt from taking the remedial math test at SJSU. The English score on SAT does the same and exempts you from remedial English if you get a good enough score.

5777912,0,t3_3u19bt,Ethnic and cultural student associations were created as a response to institutionalized racism. These student associations were created so that these POC groups would have a network and means of support from other similar POC. In other words these student associations are beacons for minority groups who who are in need of assistance from other students who can identify with them. The implication of a White Student Union is that those who identify as white experience an institutional disadvantage. Those who identify as white are already well represented in academic professional and political areas. I understand that you wish to represent students of European descent but white cannot be appropriately used to describe anyone outside of America. History lesson White was created in America in order to have a means of separating those who should be in power and those who shouldnt. White once included people who are presently identified as Native Americans Chinese Filipino Indian etc. Early ethnic identifiers were literally black and white. You can obviously see the many reactions to promoting yourself as a White Student Union. Quite frankly its in very bad taste. Although you say that you dont actually align yourself with white supremacists your title says otherwise. This is implied especially in the context of the current state of race relations in America. Now if you were a European Student Union it would be a slightly different story.If you wish to create a student organization that will serve and give back to the community then I would recommend identifying as a volunteer student organization. Id highly recommend reaching out to Rotary San Jose  or contacting Reuben Chen of Silicon Valley Lions International and starting a conversation about creating a San Jose State University Lions Club or Rotary Club. I dont think we have one yet.Understand that as a minority who seeks to better I say this inclusively OUR community I write this message with both assertion and compassion.,SJSU,cxdayww,2,t5_2saah

6784458,0,t3_48jy02,I did the exact opposite  I applied and was accepted to both CSUS and SJSU after high school.  I went to CSUS first and transferred from CSUS to SJSU this year.  I was in Computer Engineering there SE here.  Id say the program at CSUS is much better.  I learned a lot more there.  I came to this school because I wanted the SE degree and for the Formula team... and because I was tired of Sacramento.  The heat sucks and I dont like the country feeling there.. lifted trucks and all that.  But traffic is MUCH better there and its WAY less scary walking on the streets at night.  Its actually pleasant being there late at night.As others have said you do have to reapply  as a transfer student.  And since the application window just passed my sister just got her acceptance letter youll have to wait another year.  Dont miss it!There are a lot of incompatibilities between the two schools in terms of classes.  Some lower division stuff at one school is upper division at the other.  And yet the lower division stuff at CSUS was more indepth and more difficult than the upper division stuff Im taking here.Anyway in the mean time make sure you have all the CSU transfer requirements met  an English class Communications etc...  I took classes at community college before I transferred here and I guess I counted as a community college student and not a university student.  Dont know if that actually helped me or not but I made it anyway.Good luck.,SJSU,d0laz12,2,t5_2saah

6956665,0,t3_4ayvdv,Like other said refer to the other thread for major information on the program. I also have gone through the year program and now that its over I miss having that high schoollike class where you have the same group of students or relatively similar and youre learning through a timeline of history covering core topics like art history philosophy and literature. After running through the program youll have a greater knowledge of the great classic works and be able to identify a Bosch from a Picasso. Youll be able to connect the great philosophers from the past to modern issues and perspectives.Knowing all of this information might seem unnecessary sure but I completely enjoyed the experience. Additionally the writing assignments consistently kept me up on my writing techniques and prepared me more than enough for upper division W Im an engineering major so we have to take it.Overall if they offer you the program do it!

The acceptance rate is  percent so it was not too difficult to get into the school at all. Ive gotten into sjsu in the past when I was applying as a freshman so hopefully I get in again.

7431182,0,t3_4gn4pg,I recently graduated from SJSUs BSEE program and have also just finished deciding which grad program to attend so I understand your situation. The biggest strengths of the program I would say are communications and embedded systems. If youre interested in image processing last I heard they didnt even have a professor for that area since the last one left for industry. And if I were being honest... I can only think of  great professors. The rest... Not so much. Also all the grad classes are evening classes if that matters to you. For a MS program Id say the most important factor is the courses youd be taking. Look at what both programs offer make a tentative schedule for both and see which one wins your over this method ultimately helped me in my own decision process. Personally I feel the UC quarter system allows for getting familiar with way more subjects. If youre worried about getting a job in Silicon Valley based on school location both are nearby CA schools in the first place so I dont think SJSUs proximity is a winning factor alone. Lastly if you want to further consider SJSU I would recommend going to the EE symposium next week since you say youre close. You can check out MS thesis projects to get a feel of whats available talk to professors about their work and ask Masters students about their experience. Its a pretty relaxed environment. If you cant make it you can google a list of project titles as well.  ,SJSU,d2mvmi4,1,t5_2saah

When you speak with your counselor tell himher of your intent to switch majors and they will run you through the process.If you have time though Id take it at De Anza college just to knock it out while you wait for school to start.Another thing to keep in mind is when your orientation begins go to the LCoBBBC workshop LCoB and BBC are the two business buildings and speak with the counselors there.

11583393,0,t3_658fxi,Recent EE grad here F and I agree completely to what uCriscDisc said about going into EE with the intention to just make a lot of money. You need to be passionate or at least have some sort of interest about anything EE related semiconductors circuits control systems signal processing etc. Motivation and interest is key to keep yourself sane if you were to pursue a degree in EE.Electrical Engineering for a lack of better words is one of the most broad yet versatile engineering subject. Towards your junior and senior years as an EE the tech electives offered to you may broaden your horizon on a specific career paths within EE that you may pursue. I felt like after graduating with a BS EE in SJSU it gave me a stigma of being an EE who has the jack of all trades master of none in terms of applying for entrylevel positions in the industry. This is the reason why some EEs decide to enroll in grad school after finishing undergrad to further specialize onto what kind of specific EE they would like a career on ex. EE with concentration on Power Systems EE with concentration on Networking EE with concentration on Analog design and more.I entered SJSU in the F semester declared as a Computer Engineer and decided on changing my major before the F semester after watching a few videos from this site which persuaded me more to be more interested in EE than CMPE All About Circuits One of the main reason why I switched from CMPE to EE was that I am not really keen on programming and that I prefer hands on labs EE messes with plenty of circuits in labs than programming code and implementing it into hardware. After transitioning from CMPE to EE the first few EE classes kept my interest in EE giving me no regrets on switching majors. However heading into the Junior and Senior level classes I started to realize that I had to discipline myself studying more hours than I usually did before during my FroshSoph years. To answer your other question I try to study every and any chance I get. Make friends at IEEE there are plenty of people who can help or to share similar misery with. I find IEEE to be very social and somewhat distracting so I study at the library more and arrange group reviewstudy sessions in IEEE before a quizmidtermfinal. I also think that studying at the libraryanother building rather than in the engineering building increases morale as studying in the building you have been stuck in for  hours each day drains the living hell out of me. My typical day as a juniorsenior is taking a morning class study for a few hours eat lunch study a little more then end the day due to either having a late lab or a late lecture. I probably stay at most  hours on campus. After my last class I would go home eat dinner and study some more maybe until like AM to AM. And call it a night. I usually have class the next day at AM earliest has been AM. To keep myself sane socially I would hang out with a few friends met from IEEE or previous classes for a bit then continue an elongated study grind. Id say on a normal school week I would average  hours a night of sleep and at least  hours of studying with breaks.As a side note during my undergrad EE career at SJSU EE   Physical Electronics was undoubtedly my favorite class due to the involvement of Chemistry mostly Chem A concepts. This class recently became more difficult over the years but I still like the content taught. At the time of taking this class I spent more time hanging out with my biology friends in Duncan Hall who were taking organic chemistryphysical chemistryetc. After taking this class and with influence from the chemistry classes my biology friends were taking it inspired me to pursue a Chemistry minor alongside my EE degree. I also was under supervision for an organic chemistry research lab which I thought was fun active and social. I understand that having a BS EE with a Chemistry minor is by no means equivalent at all to how chemistry is deeply intertwined in Chemistry Engineering Materials Engineering or Biomedical Engineering. Although with my EE degree alone I can get into many different entry level EE positions just having the chem minor in their would give me the edge on specific EE jobs such as semiconductor fabrication and more.If I were to restart college again I would have majored in either Biology with emphasis on Systems Physiology or Biochemistry.,SJSU,dg8zgao,1,t5_2saah
11631940,0,t1_dgefzae,Anyone who qualifies for the class as I mentioned so it could definitely be a freshmanErgh Im not too sure about that...can someone who did undeclared to a program answer the question I am replying to? There really isnt a lot of information about the process except for Justice Studies lol...just get a high GPAActually I found CMPE  After analyzing the st page on this Google search you just have to do superior in the preparation classes but the overall GPA is still important DO NOT FAIL ANY OF THEM Cs are okay if you just have  per semester...they just drag the GPA down. But like STEM GPA for college admissions the requirements to commit to a major are the most important factors. Complete all requirements for CS with at least a . overall GPA and you should be fine. As for SE complete all requirements with at least a . overall GPA and that should be good. Your adviser during the orientation should give you advice too. Just be proactive and do well on your classes thats all you need to do. No you cannot but so can no one else. You register for the classes for the next semester.,SJSU,dgehr71,1,t5_2saah
11691946,0,t1_dglakgg,I can answer this. Undergrad students dont really do research based studies its more practical experience. UCs and private schools do research based studies so if you are looking for that a state is not your best option.If you do go to a state you can still get research opportunities through internships or other companies. The old CS club president had a research project with IBMs Watson AI which was pretty cool. Im sure there are others but most people go here to get into the industry and start working asap.,SJSU,dglati3,1,t5_2saah
11717734,0,t1_dgmrjg1,haha same. I can get the same thing from work now but havent since graduating just because I might as well save time doing the paperwork and just use the SJSU one.,SJSU,dgo8fzs,1,t5_2saah
11733111,0,t3_67d01b,Start planning now and have a lot of classes in mind come orientation. You can get a decent schedule but youll have to do a lot of searching and planning,SJSU,dgpz82k,1,t5_2saah
11738596,0,t3_67c5zz,Not trying to sound like a nark but honestly you dont want to be on Adderall if you dont actually have ADD. This shit is no joke. You will feel miserable if youre not on it and your memory will suffer substantially. I have ADD among a host of other conditions and it is honestly crappy bring on meds. source was prescribed adderall for  years fucked me up fam. ,SJSU,dgqllqn,3,t5_2saah

11802212,0,t3_68e4d7,I dont have any experience with taking all those classes at once but I can tell you that Chem A is very time consuming.You have to attend lecture MWF CHEM LAB  once a week and CHEM Seminar  once a week. Just as reference I think about half of my  class is failing. Despite all that I have a solid B. I think that if you dont mind putting in the time youll be fine. ,SJSU,dgxtlb4,1,t5_2saah
