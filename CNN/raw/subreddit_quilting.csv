2442,0,t1_ceepqik,Well that makes sense with why its better for quilting and binding  Also my machine doesnt have a way to set the presser foot pressure and I have heard many people say drop the feed dogs and get quilting for free motion quilting. With the lack of pressure foot pressure adjustment will my machine be able to drop the feed dogs? And how do you usually do it so I can start there and have a looksie  ,quilting,ceepslm,2,t5_2rjcg

256436,0,t1_cf7bhf8,sorry! old user name from my tiny apartment past this year we moved into a place with a spare bedroom that promptly was taken over by my fabric stash that I used to store on our deck. No I would not say that it is user friendly to move but I have mine installed in a sewing table with a knee lift. You could move it its heavy but doable but certainly not something I would want to lug around on the regular. I feel your pain as in our old place  square feet the dining room table was an office desk with only  chairs...

But that was like  years ago and Im a bit out of practice. I got very behind a few years ago so sent out a couple tops to be quilted. What a relief to have them in the done pile and just having them done spurned me on to start and finish more projects. Im back to straight line quilting and feel confident with my skills there so thats what Ill stick to for the time being as I dont have plans to send any quilts out for a while. ,quilting,cgmr35c,2,t5_2rjcg

I sew on my Brother machine so no long arm dont know how to use one etc.I am frustrated to hell and back back because I cant seem to actually quilt my layers together without causing bunching  either my quilt top now has scrunches in it or the bottom does. By bunching I mean places where the fabric isnt laying flat or the layers dont stay together. Ive tried basting. Ive tried using safety pins. Ive tried basting and safety pins but I cant keep the layers tight enough together.Does anyone have a solution or trick to this?

They might be able to recommend how to restore it yourself or know of someone who could help you. If the binding is fraying it would be not terribly difficult to pick that off and replace. You could also add some simple hand sewn patches to any tornloose seams in the quilt. How big is it? If its laptwin sized I wouldnt cut it down for a baby just let them have a bigger blankie use it for play it can be a fort a playmat a cape a special place to snuggle up and read and eventually it can go on their bed when they get bit bigger.

I spent hours there picking out fabrics that I loved  each of red blue and green. Plus an orange and a yellow numbers  and  in the pattern and then a white. I didnt really worry about coordinating them or balancing values or any of that because I wanted the quilt to be as bright and gaudy as possible.

2951438,0,t3_2ty8n5,So the trick here is to measure as you go.  Sew  of the  blocks together.  Press. Measure them.  They should measure . unfinished.  If not resew checking your scan  seam.  Next add the other strip.  Press and measure. Should be . unfinished or  finished.The only way you could be off is if your strips are either cut wrong or your scant  seam is off.  By checking yourself step by step you will find the answer.Best of luck!,quilting,co3lbyo,3,t5_2rjcg

3019598,0,t1_coadsvl,I took a quilting class once where the teacher told us all VERY SERIOUSLY I have a hard and fast rule about changing needles. This is important. Pay attention. I change it EVERY TIME ... it breaks. I decided that if that was good enough for her it was good enough for me. Although if I can hear it making a kind of popping noise as it goes through the fabric I will sometimes change the needle. How are you with changing the blade in your rotary cutter? If this is confession time I will tell you that I tend to wait until there are  or  skips  notches in the blade before I change it then I marvel at how much pressure I dont have to use to cut through my fabric and wonder why the heck I waited so long.

Thats one of my favorite things about quilting  you can do pretty much whatever you want!Now for the actual quilting Im probably not the best person to chime in but I will anyway. My machine has a zig zag stitch that is a little more decorative than the traditional one and thats what I personally would use in all the ditches. Or depending on how large your blocks are andor how densely you want to quilt it I would maybe do that same stitch about  away from the ditches inside each block. And repeat as desired so the squares get smaller and smaller. But like I said the actual quilting of a quilt is not my strongest suit.

4583031,0,t1_ct6ueql,Sewing machines have attachments called feet that perform different specialized tasks. The feet attach to the shank thats the part that sticks down behind where the needle goes. The metal plate at the bottom is called the throat plate and doesnt get changed out ever. As the other response suggested a walking foot is useful when quilting because it works in conjunction with the feed dogs teeth looking bits encircled by the throat plate to move bulky fabrics through the machine. Walking feet have plastic feed dog like teeth that bite the fabric from the top in time with the feed dogs underneath the fabric. Without them a quilt sandwich is hard to move through the machine and can get puckered.A longarm machine is just that a machine with a long arm. The arm of the machine is from the vertical piece to the end it is the piece that creates the throat space along with the base. Longarm machines have a throat space of at least  and while some can be small they are mainly associated with using on a frame in a standing position to quilt the quilt.,quilting,ct8ak2m,2,t5_2rjcg

It took us about a week to finish it. But Im a novice so its a pretty simple one....a few rectangles and squares of cute assorted baby themed fabric put together randomly. We cheated a little and found backing fabric dinosaurs and cute aliens! with batting on the wrong side and attached that to the quilt top. But as for the actual quilting sandwich...that was a learning experience. I couldnt tell you how many times I stabbed my finger as I was trying to push the needle through all those layers. To save us the time and headache we just made simple lines across...no curves or anything. To be quite honest I had contemplated keeping the quilt because well...its my first one and it was by hand.

6914303,0,t1_d0z5dvn,This is the tutorial I learned from and I struggled with that step too. I figured out through trial and lots of error that you press in the step before just to mark where you need to sew then trim then pull out a pin or two from both sides of where youve just pressed so that you can fold up the quilt a bit and have some slack in the binding to work with. You can leave the rest of the binding attached and just pull away the little bit that you need to sew. I dont even bother to pin the two ends together I just sew right side to right side in the crease its only a teeny bit of sewing since youre going perpendicular to the length of the binding press the new seam open refold the long way to match it back up to the rest of the binding and press if its not folding nicely repin that one little segment of binding and start attaching the binding to the quilt.Did that make any more sense??

One pattern that was commonly used in my circle was Attic Windows using black and gray strips to frame each block. All the blocks were fussycut to show off the main feature so a fall quilt for example could have Halloween motifs Thanksgiving motifs and fall leaves and animals. The blocks were laid out in a way that encouraged sequential thinking and free associations.Not to mention a bit of Wheres Waldo analyis. Can you tell that all my quillting friends were teachers and nurses?And I would still advocate for darker framing blocks due to small sticky hands and bodily emissions.You had to be there. And no I dont know of any examples that have survived because they were loved and fondled into oblivion.So snuggling with children and grandchildren and having conversations with them that help them structure their world and the language they use to describe it?

9959506,0,t1_db5g2ot,I wont lie I am always terrified as the first few inches glide under the presser foot. Heres what I do make a sandwich that is at least  in. square and use it to practice. Start at the middle of your circles so any movement of the quilt will be pushed to the outside. If you want the circles look through your machine accessories for a short bar with a degree angle. The long end fits into your presser foot and is moved until the end of the short part touches your last row of stitching. If you want to try circles mark your quilt for the first circle and stitch that with a walking foot if you have one. Your second circle should be a good distance away on your practice square! with the short end of your stitching. Then you can decide if you want a more dense quilting. You can add more but to take away is ugh a pita.I have a hard time free motion quilting because of my psoriatic arthritis I have in my fingers wrists and shoulders so I often use the walking foot. Actually I am taking a class on Craftsy right now. It is amazing what she quilts with just her walking foot.Good luck and holler if you run into problems.,quilting,db5qzov,2,t5_2rjcg

10163635,0,t3_5lj0jd, Do you have a pattern in mind?  If not do you think youd like to make a quilt with repeating blocks or all different ones?  Or have you saved pins of finished quilts you particularly love? Do you know if the quilt is going to be for you or someone else? Also the FAQ is great especially about the fabric and how to get started!  IMO Id add a  piecing foot spray starch and elmers glue as my tool suggestions,quilting,dbw3ri7,1,t5_2rjcg

Whenever I give away a quilt that I made for someone else that I really want to keep I remind myself that if I kept them all I wouldnt have room to make more. Besides its worth the look on their faces when you give someone a homemade quilt.,quilting,dck1nh3,3,t5_2rjcg
10412060,0,t3_5p2ezb,Nice fussy cutting.  Catch a little less fabric on your whip stitches and theyll show less if thats something youre concerned about.  Also match the thread to the darker of the two colors youre stitching together but dont go darker than that.  Teal or a medium grey would have helped those seams.,quilting,dco9wbd,4,t5_2rjcg

I believe if youre thinking something nice you should always say it so I teach both of those things to my child. Its simply not good enough to not say bad things in todays world. We must also go around saying the nice things we think if we are to make nice changes and help people believe the best about themselves.

11182866,0,t3_5zlvc5,I think for the ones you described as random they were doing a jelly roll race  Sidebar if you join the quilting obsession and want to quilt with precuts again but want to up your difficulty level I highly recommend all of Missouri Stars quilt tutorials. They use all kinds of precuts. I also like Cozy Quilt Designs strip club presentations they have a new pattern every month using jelly rollsbackground yardage. Their patterns are a little more involved though so I think I would buy their pattern before making one.I really like uerinburrells suggestion I think youll be happier with it if you cut it up into blocks. uSandyQuilter had a jelly roll race that did not turn out as planned that she cut up threw some sashing on and turned into a completely different quilt!,quilting,dezkcq4,3,t5_2rjcg

11246171,0,t1_df6c1ou,Okay so it looks like to me that what Ive been thinking of as a single block is actually  blocks put together and the colored fabric is then placed at the intersections of the blocks.  The colored window is then hiding the stitching so all I end up seeing is the stitching around the diamond window.  Is that correct?And then all the origamilike folding means that there are no places where the backside of the fabric shows right?  Does that mean theres typically no batting amp back for this style of quilt?  Is there typically a border?  Do you typically try to put a colored window in the half triangles youd be left with on the edges?,quilting,df6qj40,1,t5_2rjcg
