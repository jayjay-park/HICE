6557624,0,t1_czxjwya,its dope so far man although Ive only had it for a day or two. I primarily got it just to run my MPC through for effectsfilters after the beat is done but Ill also use it for samplingprocessing before bouncing it into the MPC. I honestly dont see myself doing any chopping or sequencing on it though just because my MPC does that x betterquicker I feel like chopping might be a bit tedious but Im sure once you got the workflow down it wouldnt be too bad. I wasnt even planning on getting one but I found a used one for  CAD which is less than  USD when I was randomly browsing online and had to hop on it lol,LofiHipHop,czxm1yz,1,t5_31kv6

10649404,0,t3_5sdfke,Its important to not try to replicate others though thats always good for practice.  When taking my own crack at Lofi I try to make low fidelity music that features certain genre quirks i.e. Sidechaining to the kick or heavy compression or whatever fits the song.  I usually dont only make instrumental tracks though so I dont have the luxury of copypasting what works for other producers as itd make for a pretty bad song haha Id say picking out a couple of aspects of the genre and applying them to your own original music will help you stand out while still being Lofi in the current sense of the sound.  Also obviously the music is supposed to be Lofi so really all you need to do is make low fidelity music lol,LofiHipHop,ddeejtx,1,t5_31kv6

11130513,0,t3_5yx7i5,I would tell him to get rid of that FI ligature in the header. Makes it look like A. Also I would switch the green tint of the posts with the green shade of the announcements... seems kind of backwards bringing more attention to the posts as opposed to the pinned announcements at the top. Alignment seems awkward and off for the announcements. The next and prev links arent very readable tell him to make the background of the link a darker value of grey... its too close to the white text in the foreground right now. Hes also missing the Snoo link on the top left but I figure hes working on it. I know you guys didnt ask for a critique... just trying to help as a possible user of that subreddit. Also not design related but take some direction from rmakinghiphop and make shit organized... the last thing you need is mostly self promotion like in this sub. Encourage people to post other peoples work as opposed to their own stuff... maybe have a pinned weekly thread for self promotion IDK.,LofiHipHop,detmtrk,3,t5_31kv6
11198094,0,t3_5zuuuu,Gorillaz  Double Bass sample tickled my jimmies. Cool that you used your guitar and it sounds like you did it all in one take pretty much perfectly on time. Thats pretty skilled!It sounds a bit sparse even for a minimalist track. Its up to you what you want to fill the space with  crackling vinyl white noise synth pad field recordings bass  be creative with it! I think  hihat hits between the kick and the snare would sound great.Also the kicks hit too hard and close together which kinda ruins the whole chill vibe. Try shifting them off beat maybe use less compression if you are applying it maybe they need more EQ or filtering idk. Also reverb bus for the snareguitar if youre not already using oneKeep at it!
