Folks that are not yet responsible with their money should not be using credit cards  very easy to go nuts and build up huge debt.But for folks that know how to control themselves CC rewards are really nice! I pay all my bills using CC and use CC for almost all purchases. If I could pay my mortgage using CC without paying extra Id happily do that as well. Just remember to pay it off at the end of the month and alls well. Even if I only spend k a month with my  everywhere card ignore the  bonus categories I end up with at least  extra each year.

10694450,0,t3_5d9mze,So I too have this setup.  I discovered that I had to create Activities for each action I wanted to control.  For example to change the channel I created an activity with my TV and Sound Bar as the selected devices and set it to press channel up.  I needed to reprogram all of different buttons on the remote for that activity because when the activity is triggered as the active activity all of the buttons on the physical remote switch to that activities remote layout.  This was very tedious as ultimately i created over  activities channel up down volume up down channel    etc input cable input hdmi you get the idea.  Once it was all set up though it works great!  As long as your activities and devices remain in sync.  I wish there was a way for the control devices to know the end devices state what input the TV is on if the sound bar is onoff etc.  For instance if the TV is off but the sound bar is on for whatever reason listening to music activating the TV on activity will power toggle both devices as it does not know the sound bar is already on.,googlehome,ddj1x82,1,t5_3enp4

SmartThings natively supports ZWave and Zigbee protocols and integrates with WiFi given the right circumstances so there are a TON of products you can purchase to integrate into your home.  A general rule of thumb is about  per thing you want to do but deals can be had if you are patient and look around.  I picked up a  GoControl garage door controller for  color changing LED strips for  and put door sensors on all of my external doors and the basement door for  each.  You can also find things like generic leak detectors motion sensors and what not for much less than name branded things.
