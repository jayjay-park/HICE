45236,0,t1_cejkswv,The issue is starting. Put a pan of W outside right now let it sit and try to stir it.  Its fine. It will flow under pressure of the oil pump. Now try this at F and it may begin to get waxy.  Thats when you switch to W oil because its less viscous waxy at cold temps. That said the more shit in it sludge the higher the viscosity will be. If you maintain your car like you should and change the oil there are no worries in these parts. Maybe in International Falls or Grand Rapids or somewhere really cold ...Without fuel spark compression the engine wont run.  The fact that the engine starts at all implies there is plenty of oil ready to go to run the engine.  Otherwise wed need to prelube it ... prelubers are used with diesels to widen the effective temperature operating bands for oils. Where temperatures fall below the F threshold the prelube system will ensure oil pressure and flow BEFORE engine cranking can begin.  We dont have these on modern gas cars  they are not needed. ,Louisville,cejkxgh,7,t5_2qqvg

When I went you just sorta walked in took a seat and hung out but Im not sure ifhow much that has changed because its been awhile since I went. Its an early thing but just a really really unique experience and very quite and weirdly peaceful. If you do call I would just ask if they let people come and watch the morning workouts from the grandstand still. It has a really different atmosphere from a day at the races though. Also less bourbon so that part sucks. This is the show info as it stands theyre still waiting to confirm an opening act before we start making posters and stuff. Lisas Oakstreet Lounge is a dive bar in the Smoketown neighborhood. The beer is cheap but they only take cash which still blows my mind a bit.

1114087,0,t1_chuw0fh,Do you mean like fans of any other sport wearing their kit?  Soccer fans wear soccer jerseys basketball fans wear jerseys etc.  Hell most fans wear them while not actively participating in the sport! A lot of times a cyclists kit IDs them as affiliated with a particular group or team.  We wear wicking noncotton clothing to keep us cool and visible. Usually these kits are expensive  so we add our sponsors logo to defray the cost.  Blending in increases risk because drivers pedestians etc. cant see you as well. Riding on roads is perfectly legal for bicycles unless they are prohibited e.g. on interstates. In fact I prefer vehicular cycling to riding in a bike lane.  Riding in a bike lane marginalizes cyclists exposes them to greater risks from car doors debris less visibility etc. Its almost always better to take the lane in traffic becuase cyclists ARE traffic. There are no minumum speeds except on limited access highways where bikes are prohibited. ,Louisville,chuxi9v,5,t5_2qqvg

So you get these chefs that take a crazy ideaand also inexpensive since  restaurants fail like opening a restaurant in a basement and make it into something where the customers keep coming.  Obviously Hammerheads is doing a lot of things right.  They were able to open up Game which is still another small building.  At the end of the day if you dont like waiting dont wait.

Some of you are underestimating the amount of damage about to occur as a result of the sub zero temps coming Louisvilles way. Last year during the Polar Vortex it hit  wind chill for just a few hours and that resulted in thousands of broken pipes and sprinkler lines throughout the city. I believe some mains froze also. JCPS missed a few days as a result. The wind chill is going to be  for close to a day. There will be lots of damage as a result. Add in the inch or two of rain on Saturday and you will see major damage throughout the city. ,Louisville,copq9up,2,t5_2qqvg

Without this little bit of help these people are giving me I could probably die. Its a problem that apparently didnt occur to him until after he backed the farright candidate.andgtOwsley County JudgeExecutive Cale Turner responded To be honest with you a lot of folks in Owsley County went to the polls and voted against gay marriage and abortion and as a result Im afraid they voted away their health insurance.  Some choice quotes from the article that MSNBC links togtThe trend seemed to hold across the state. At Transylvania University political scientist Andrea Malji said she has crunched state data and found a  percent confidence level between the counties Medicaid enrollment levels and their gubernatorial choices. The larger the Medicaid numbers the more likely they were to back Bevin she said. The lower the Medicaid numbers the more likely they were to favor the Democratic nominee Attorney General Jack Conway.This quote from Bevin is ridiculousgtBecause in reality it has been increasingly proven that if you have skin in the game if you have a vested interest in the outcome you are more likely to make wise decisions that ultimately effect your health. Studies have shown that people on Medicaid have worse health outcomes than people who have no insurance at all Bevin said at a town hall forum in September.What does that even mean? Is he seriousy saying that you have to pay for your healthcare to actually care about your health? WTF kind of sense does that make?

6660168,1,t3_46sfpj,Why voting for Trumps jackass would be better than voting for Hillary. She is a proven hawk. She has only made this more explicit by her recent praise for Henry Kissinger a war criminal and zealous militant who is probably responsible for nearly four million deaths. . If elected Clinton would taint the reputation of the Democratic Party with her corruption and dishonesty. This impact could last decades. Long enough for seven Supreme Court justices to be appointed by Republicans in a worst case scenario. . She is so conservative that it would shift the entire national spectrum rightward for her to represent Democrats. If we accept that Hillarys position on the spectrum is the left we will have allowed the right wing to pull the entire national conversation drastically to the right. A Hillary Clinton Presidency would be a huge win for the right wing despite all of the kicking and screaming they might perform. . If America wants neoliberalism I prefer it be under Trump because then when we learn our lesson about how damaging this economic policy is to our very sovreignty we will have somewhere to turn to correct our course. If we do allow Hillary to drag the national spectrum to the right there will be nowhere left to turn when we are ready to grow up and stop acting like the Somalia of the west. . Thomas Jefferson wrote that a wellinformed electorate is a prerequisite to democracy. To reward the unethical style of campaigning that Hillary has used both in the  primaries and now in the  primaries by allowing it to be a path to the White House would lead to more of the same. Candidates from then on would know that unscrupulous and devious campaigning is how to win. For Clintons tactics to be rewarded especially by Democrats would undermine our very democracy. . Hillary has shown herself to be corruptible. Trump would not be susceptible to the types of monetary incentives that Hillary has shown herself to be. . Hillary Clintons Presidency and the corrupt means by which she achieved the office would be taken by many to be emblematic of what we might expect should we elect a woman President. The sentiment that Hillarys presidency could be held to be indicative of what we can expect as a result of electing a woman to the highest office would work in direct opposition to the pursuit of true gender equality. This thinking may be wrong but it would be common. The damage to the viability of the Presidential candidacies of honorable women who have the potential to be great leaders such as Senator Elizabeth Warren would be significant and longlasting. Repercussions of the backlash which would result from this symbolic first being a monumental disaster would be felt in all areas of public life. Contrary to what Hillary might have you believe her election would be huge step backward for egalitarianism. . There is far too much disloyalty to the electorate inside the beltway. Bernie Sanders might have said this best when he said Sometimes I think that the people in this institution and the White House are really losing contact in not knowing whats going on with the American people...The American people hold this institution in contempt they hold the Republican Party in contempt they hold the Democratic Party in contempt. Hillary Clinton is not a variation from this theme. She does not represent the people. She has been an insider in the corrupt game we call politics for a long time now as her surname can attest to. A second President Clinton would quintessentially embody the perpetuation of a dynasty of indifference to the will of the people. . Her election would be deeply demoralizing for those who have a vision of a future for this country that transcends what focus groups and polls tell them. Visionaries are the architects of the future. We can do better than to darken their visions with Hillarys unique brand of dreamless cynicism. . The Democratic party seems to be drifting ever toward the right. Its time for Democratic voters to wake up. If losing an election is what it takes to makes that happen it will be worth it. I hope it doesnt come to that but it would be far more preferable than a gradual unrecognized slip toward conservatism. . Because if the way she panders to demographics Hillary Clinton is a divisive figure The opposite of what a leader must be. Leaders must bring unity to those they lead they must find what is common and shared among the citizens or they cannot lead effectively and risk deepening the fissures which make life more difficult for all decent people. Despite my opinions on his positions on most issues it is clear to me that even a nation unified under Donald Trump may have more potential to advance toward the goals we all share than a nation divided under Hillary Clinton would. . Finally and probably least compelling For all of these reasons Ive discussed because she constantly underestimates the intelligence of the American people in her transparent dishonesty in its myriad forms because she stands for so little but makes such a loud noise about it because she is so remorseless for the many mistakes she has made I find her to be deeply grindingly vexatious in a way a blockhead like Trump could never be.,Louisville,d087vqm,-1,t5_2qqvg

However like someone else said KY taxes will eat up your profits if you arent bringing in solid numbers every month. I also found that both the Louisville Revenue Commission and Kentucky Revenue Commission have poor record keeping I changed addresses and filed it out on my OL form but they never updated their system. For KY DOR pay close attention to all the forms you need to send when you file yearly taxes you wont be able to use online business tax software it will send the wrong forms and youll end up owing a crap load of money. Also if you are doing c I would get an independent CPA. The IRS will scrutinize your account if they see you are doing your own taxes I imagine this would be even higher if set up as a charity. tldr its easy to get the LLC started its harder to manage the yearly taxes if you arent going through a CPA. ,Louisville,d10jq61,1,t5_2qqvg

There is nothing for them to learn from it while its there theres no context saying otherwise. Im not saying that it should be destroyed by any means. But I do think its significance could be much more appropriately appreciated somewhere else like in a museum or in Cave Hill. I think theres a lot more that people could be learning about its history but arent because its in the middle of the damn street. Its the last place Id look if I was trying to learn about civil war history. Ive learned more about the history of the civil war and the confederacy in Kentucky from this thread than Ive ever learned from that monument. Perhaps a change in setting could change that. If its that important doesnt it deserve something better than this?Not to mention its right in front of the newly renovated Speed Art Museum. Not only would its removal greatly improve traffic flow to the Speed but it sounds a bit odd to say yeah turn left right after that confederate monument and theres the new ultra modern art museum.

The neck was badly warped from sitting in an unconditioned garage for a decade or more.  The Doo Wop Shop gave me an estimate  to steam the neck off of the body steambend the warping out of the neck reattach the neck and repair any finish damaged by the work.  I went ahead with it the value of the guitar is in sentimentality not material value.  Anyway they sent the guitar to their luthiers shop and I had it back in  weeks.  The action on the strings is exceptional and the guitar is one of my daily players now.      TLDR  Try the Doo Wop Shop. They fixed my guitar. They did good work.,Louisville,d5vh0ou,2,t5_2qqvg

I started looking for one all the way back in fall  and have only just now found one I like.My advice is to start with the directories provided by the different hospital networks around townNorton Health CareBaptist HealthKentucky One HealthUofL PhysiciansFamily Health CentersThen narrow it down by office location closer is better when youre sick whoevers still accepting new patients and accepts your insurance. The holy trinity! If you have Humanas PPO plan you should be able to pick anyone but if youre on the HMO then I think but dont quote me on this youre limited to some Norton doctors FHC and maybe UofLKentucky Ones network. Basically whoever they contracted with this year.Other things to consider  Locations with labs on site will generally give you faster test results. APRNs can be hit or miss. Just depends on their individual experience  how well they communicate with the doctors on staff. The offices in popular areas of town are generally packed and either dont accept new patients or only their APRNs will and youll be on a waiting list anywhere from a week to three months out for your first appointment that is. If you have any conditions that require monitoring pick an MD or Internist. Take online reviews about doctors with a grain of salt. Websites especially for smaller practices rarely get updated so call and be sure they accept your insurance still do same day appointments etc.This is uh getting long in the tooth so Ill just leave it at that.
