4655000,0,t1_cthbj9w,Here you go...Ive been meaning to tell you guys about my expereience on MissTravel.com since someone on the FAPlus forum asked about seekingarrangement amp months ago there was a thread about mailorder brides.In the spring of  I watched a ABC News Nightline clip about a couple that met on MissTravel and went to a Mexican beach resort. Curious about it I looked at MissTravel...thinking hey if I still have plenty of money and a job after my last definite trip which was to be a solo hiking trip in Mt Rainier National Park in September  I may think about this arrangementto fill a pipe dream of taking a beautiful girl on a trip even if it was weird and something simple...like a twonight trip to Vegas or NYC.I should note that I dont make a ton of money but I do have substantial savings. I have a luxury apartment and wear nice clothes but I drive a cheap car and have cheap furniture.MissTravel is owned by the same company as seekingarrangement.com a straightup sugar daddy site. Generous users read men have to pay to message women and you pay per message not per month. Anyways I wanted to see what was on there but even to browse the women you need to set up an account and put a picture up even if you dont pay....So to browse... I made an account.Then I got a message. From an attractive woman my age in my city. Now I was tempted to pay so I could read and respond...and I did pay. I actually met this woman and went on two dates...however I knew nothing special would ever come of this after talking to her on the phone. We were completely different people. I figured this wouldnt work out when she said she had previously dated a guy  years older than me. Ill call her Taylor.Obviously I was paying for the dates but even then I was the one working completely around her schedule. Not the other way around. For our second date I thought hey this woman likes fancy things...this is my chance to go with someone to the fanciest restaurant in town that I know of...Tonys. Right as Taylor met me at my apartment I started to feel off. It was just a ton of awkwardness that day both conversing with her and being at this superfancy restaurant where the waiters explanations of the dishes just flew right over my head. She was actually going to order some mushroomtruffle appetizer for  but I said no to that. After the awkward date ended I never called her again. This episode basically told me if I dont mesh with someone we dont mesh. It doesnt matter how attractive she is or how desperate I am or how much money I have I cant force something to work.I still hadnt given up my dream about walking around Vegas in a fancy casino with a gorgeous woman around my arm so I started messaging a few othersoutside my city because there werent many women near me. Now Taylor was  real but then I ran into the fakes. One from Chicago basically just trolled me and made fun of me through text messages two from Dallas seemed to be fake accounts that I bet the website created to keep getting money from guys. I cant give you my number because I dont have a phone. The others location was suspiciously changing every time she sporadically logged in and replied to me. DallasGermanySaskatchewan? I wasnt even that attracted to the latter.After conversing with three fakes and several messages I sent were not returned I gave up on it and deleted my account July .TLDR It didnt work. Site was scammy but not a complete scam. Dont bother with it.,FA30plus,cthblxc,2,t5_37trq

The normal people get lucky but are confident and social enough to make a few dozen or hundred attempts over their lives so its a guarantee. And the guys who are just ugly need a whole lot of luck.

5002064,0,t3_3jfx3c,How people react to secrets like that is pretty context sensitive. I remember seeing a dumb little sticker which said something to the effect Once you dislike someone everything they do seems offensive Look at her eating crackers like she owns the place! Its true. If someone already has reason to dislike you a previous incident or even they just dont like your face no matter what its difficult to get them to like you. The reverse is also true. If someone is already a good friend or lover and they come out of the transcloset or reveal theyre positive often the person being told will find some way to accept it. Those positive gut feelings about the person generally dont go away and they override any moral compunctions which would normally apply. People listen to their gut feelings first and then pound the pegs into the holes until they fit. People tell themselves that theyre objective when theyre really wallpapering excuses on top of preexisting gut biases.,FA30plus,cuoxq4q,5,t5_37trq

5819788,0,t1_cxggc9g,I can offer what Ive learned from experience. Women dont even care so much about what you say to them  its more about the vibe you give off. Thats based on who you are as a person and how you express yourself your body language behavior etc. She obviously liked your vibe otherwise she wouldnt have dated you. So in many ways how you suggest the next outing and what you plan to do doesnt matter so much as long as its reasonably interesting and you get to spend time with each other. And YOU do have to make the moves on her. Otherwise shes not going to know how interested you are. If youre not sure about howwhat to do then just do it the way you think. Youll improve over time. One of the reasons guys dont take chances is that they think theyll make a mistake and lose the opportunity. But this line of thinking is really the result of a scarcity mindset i.e. I dont get to meet women often so I should be really careful not to lose her or make a fool of myself. What you need is an abundance mindset which most easily comes with going out there and meeting lots of women regularly which itself might not be easy Ill grant you so that you dont get as hung up on what to do in such situations.,FA30plus,cxihziq,2,t5_37trq

Relationships with abusers can make people feel even more alone because the abuser doesnt actually want you either they just want a feeling of power.Edit Sorry for the rant but thats in fact how many abusers control their victims even by making them feel as though no one else will ever want them  so when they cut loose from what nobody should have to put up with FA is a real feeling.,FA30plus,cyjyy8r,5,t5_37trq

6582094,0,t1_d000gye,gt Did you know that strawberries arent berries?Yes as a matter of fact I did.  Technically a single strawberry is many fruits joined by its flesh.  Another funny one is that a tomato is a berry.  Like you I find that stuff fascinating.  However in defense of scientists they are not usually the ones changing the meanings of the words.  As laypeople adopt them they tend to get watered down or generalized.  A berry is anything that looks like a berry... who cares about botany.I share your wonder at the evolution of language and words over time.  Words and their meaning have always been very important to me.  I especially get irked when I am using words correctly or more precisely and get ragged on about it.It is amazing how often a word becomes so misunderstood and misused that the misuse becomes the accepted definition.  For instance just a few years ago the Oxford dictionary accepted the common misunderstanding of literal.  Which means we now have literally no word that truly mean literal given that it can now mean the previously incorrect figurative version.  This is also how we got the common misunderstanding of what theory means.  Evolution is just a theory after all.  To a layperson it means an unproven conjecture but in science it means current best explanation for a given phenomena  otherwise known as excepted fact.Still curiosity aside I am more often interested in our current best understanding of things... not the common misunderstanding or disproven historical understanding.  Sometimes the history is important for context but doesnt effect our decisions given our new information.  Depression is serious business and people throw that label around like its nothing.  Last data I saw said that  million people in the US are on antidepressants when only about  percent of that are actually suffering depression.  Anyone feeling a little blue can go and pop a pill  great or the pharmaceutical industry but no so great for those truly suffering.  The research and funding should be focused on them... not on the next happy pill so a suburban mom can cope with not having it all only so the bio company can make another billion.,FA30plus,d0054u0,1,t5_37trq
6635286,0,t3_46gu4z,OK so the last girl who Im pretty sure was into me and who I could have had a chance with was back in th grade  years ago.We met in science class. She was painfully beautiful tall with long wavy blonde hair bright blue eyes and an angelic smile. We were assigned as lab partners. She turned out to be kind and down to earth. In contrast to so many kids with their toocoolforschool attitudes she had an enthusiasm for learning which I really dug. We shared an interest in the  class and worked well together on science stuff. One day I took a different route to class and she shouted my name and ran over and we walked the rest of the way together. I went that way from then on and we often walked to class. I fell hard for her.I like learning but never did homework. I was failing all my classes. Every day was miserable except for the  minutes I spent with her. Some days she was the only reason I even got out of bed and went in I had a habit of truancy. I struggled to talk to her about things other than class related stuff despite wanting to SO badly. Some days we would get to class early and I would pretend to be ohsotired and sleep at my desk purely out of fear of the topic of future plans coming up. I was greatly ashamed of my grades and didnt want her to know about them. She had perfect grades and was so smart destined for university and success. I had a . GPA and was destined for nothing. I felt totally inadequate and worthless.We had several more classes together throughout the rest of that year and the next. I continued to be aloof and unreceptive to her and we drifted apart despite me still crushing as hard as ever. This caused unbelievable levels of self loathing which have been long lasting.,FA30plus,d05n92k,3,t5_37trq

9012613,0,t1_d7ub0hk,Basic photography is a big one.  Photos have to be the proper resolution for a smart phone.  Dont mistake a photo where you look good for a photo that is well composed.  A photo with good composition has good color balances and will stand out instantly while you are quickly flipping through.  Dont take photos at night unless you know how to retouch them the lighting will always be off for photo or film purposes.  Critically no selfies and definitely no gym selfies. Get someone to take a good photo of you.  Its difficult to take one that looks good and it generally makes you look like a loser with no friends regardless of whether it is true. Looking just slightly less of a douchebag goes a seemingly long way to standing out.  Im awful at dating but I do get matches and dates enough to know what I am doing in the early parts of dating. ,FA30plus,d7v6byx,3,t5_37trq

I dont wanna be the pig phucker.Healthyweight amp averagelooking girls get their fill of Alphas and high value Betas they have great Social lives esp. when young  and can even get Alphas whilst cleaning toilets at Starbucks for peanuts.

Its called having an opinion. I dont think Im a better person unless you find sloth and obesity to be indicative of lesser character traits I just find them unattractive and uninteresting.

10127730,0,t3_5kp48o,Having had no experience when it comes to relationships personally I have been fortunate enough to be on the outside looking in as my sibling has gone through many relationships. In regards to your worries I have two points to make You worry that your lack of adventurousness in life would lead to your hypothetical girlfriend disliking you or at minimum disliking her life with you. The thing about relationships however is that theyre based on compromise. Nobody is going to get to do what they want all the time without temporarily doing what the other party in the relationship wants to do as well. This means that each of you will have to do something that theyre not  comfortable with in some situations. In effect both parties sacrifice their happiness on certain occasions to make the other party happy because it makes them happy to see their SO happy. So to build off your hypo some days you may want to stay in and game when your partner may want to go out. However your partner will stay at home with you because she knows it makes you happy. Other days your partner may want to go out and despite hating going out youll indulge your partner because it makes you happy to see her happy. Lastly if someone likes you enough to go out with you then that person will probably like you even with the aforementioned faults. When someone in their s or even late twenties in some circumstances decides to go out with someone they will likely have vetted that person first before deciding to go out with them. If you were in high school or college Id say it was a real possibility that someone is going out with you without thinking about it first which of course would lead to them having second thoughts and splitting with you but Im assuming that youre talking about someone who is an adult physically and mentally. As a result a mature person wouldnt go out with someone unless they knew a decent amount about that person and thought it was a good idea despite that persons flaws to go out with them.,FA30plus,dbrndnb,3,t5_37trq

I used to feel very low not being able to share but ive gotten used to it now. I hardly care anymore.i spend a lot of time at work and im even working from home right now a bit of break so here i am. Ive come to realize why i do that though. Its because work is the only social life i have.
