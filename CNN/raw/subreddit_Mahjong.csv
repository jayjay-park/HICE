355499,0,t1_cfhk9r8,This is exactly right. If you call a  of a kind either drawing all  or calling the th you draw a tile from the dead wall so you are not short a tile THEN you discard.,Mahjong,cfhm494,2,t5_2rk71

891430,0,t3_24bsrm,It depends on which style you plan to teach.If you go with Riichi wildly popular here get a set made for it. You do NOT need to have the Arabic digits. People are smart especially university students and can learn the digits and winds in about  minutes. Make a little handout with scoring and the Kanji digits or Yellow Mountain Imports has fair prices and free shipping at ... well they DID but now it looks like their site has been redone and gutted. Not much inventory.So to eBay You want colored backs smallish tiles dice and bettingscoring sticks. A round marker is nice too. Solid backs have slightly reduced utility as the white dragons are usually just blank on Japanese sets so those tiles get slightly more wear.If you plan to play a Chinese style get larger tiles  dice and a wind round marker. Maybe bettingscoring chips.Get plastic not bone and bamboo. The bonebamboo tiles are usually too light and the rounded backs are more annoying that you would think.If you plan to play American style well good for you. ,Mahjong,ch5lyp4,2,t5_2rk71

3596985,0,t1_cq1qbin,Flat hand is really good I love that We personally use Peace at my mahjong club just because its memorable but I think flat hand is better by far and might try to change to that for next year.Aside from that the only changes Id recommend for naming conventions is turning the clunky terminals and honors in each setall terminals and honors to orphans in each set or all orphans.,Mahjong,cq2a701,3,t5_2rk71

4368410,0,t3_3ap9a2,I discarded the last tile and my toimen rond me with riichi houtei... The tile looked dangerous but at thay point I thought fuck it.On last weekends tournament in Prague somebody apparently got a kokushi I wasnt on that table though.,Mahjong,csi1z9d,1,t5_2rk71

5542528,0,t3_3r17le,What does a mini set mean? The smallest possible legally sized .cm tiles? If so Ive been playing with a .cm set I have big hands too and the tiles havent been particularly troublesome for me. Maybe demo a set before you purchase it if possible?,Mahjong,cwk3obv,1,t5_2rk71
5571681,0,t3_3rc7y0,I mean any hand where you open with a triplet of fanpai dora is probably as good.,Mahjong,cwnpvhb,1,t5_2rk71

7498179,0,t1_d2ntx77,Sorry for the late answers was away and didnt check reddit.Okay mats they are called junk mats.Two kinds mat between two borders that you roll out and then put the other two edges on and puzzlepiece mat.roll pro nice and flatroll con will eventually stretch out.puzzle pro cheap and cheap to shippuzzle con eventually gets frayy on the piece edges.Roll Puzzle I definitely suggest the roll. just dont lift it with tiles on it.,Mahjong,d2ui5rt,2,t5_2rk71
7763090,0,t1_d3oetex,Woah thanks! That cleared things up double rons being quite rare for me at least even more ones with riichi sticks on the table that Ive never even though about what would happen to these.  And fantasy rules sound nice  Is that a thing? Or did you mean just some random made up rules new yaku for having an even number of bamboos drawn on your souzu tiles or allowing chiitoi despite having an open sequence lol at that one      I checked out of curiousity how that app handles riichi sticks in case of multiple ron and its messed up... Seems to be giving these points to priority player but starting from the player who last contributed a stick if multiple riichis then the first one in wind order o Guess I wont allow multiple rons while using the app to track points its great otherwise,Mahjong,d3olphp,1,t5_2rk71

11444934,0,t1_dft9579,Yes! There are rules for thatThe called tile is rotated sideways and placed according to who it was called from. If you called from the person to your left it is placed to the left of the tiles from your hand if you called from the person to your right then its on the ride and if you called from the person sitting across from you then its placed in between your two tiles.Also you always rotate the tile you called that is not important for PONKAN but for CHI it is. So if you have  and  in your hand and call CHI on the  you place the tiles like such rotated,Mahjong,dft9u7s,5,t5_2rk71
