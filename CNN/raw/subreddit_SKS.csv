440565,0,t1_cfn8mq4,I think its great. So far Ive put about  rounds through it without any problems. Only issue Ive had is that the pin holding my lens cover for my reddot on is wiggling out which had nothing to do with the rifle but rather the sight.,SKS,cfqfgol,1,t5_2tmua

1715227,0,t1_cjurr44,Its been stripped and oiled  looks and smells amazing and is slightly lighter in weight than standard chu wood stocks w lacquer.  Id strongly prefer it over the chu stock i have but it wouldnt fit without ruining the crossbar.  Ill PM photos if you have a pinned sks. If youre interested ill sell it for what i paid for it  shipped. ,SKS,cjvd7df,1,t5_2tmua

2226969,0,t1_clmwc35,Im okay with using either but the mag CATCH releasenot magazine is damaged and should be changed. The stock was incredibly damaged so it needed to be bubbaed anyways. I prefer original military configuration but this one has new life in black and might as well go full tactical.,SKS,clmwgfd,0,t5_2tmua
3085225,0,t1_cohqo8u,I traded my stock Gen  G for the SKS  rounds of ammunition  AKstyle round steel magazines and a Tapco  round magazine. I have no interest in the magazines so I figured I would try to sell them. I shot the G quite a bit and figured itd be worth around  at the most. In my area the ammunition would be around  so I thought I would be getting the SKS for about . Im not entirely sure what the value of the magazines would be. ,SKS,cohs5y9,1,t5_2tmua

3498921,0,t3_30bzwv,That would be the factory stamp. It looks rather worn in your picture but if you want you can look up the Norinco factory stamps and try to match it yourself.,SKS,cpr3p7x,3,t5_2tmua

8152797,0,t1_d4wn3kk,true enough my good man.Though with all the outcry for gun control we can at least point to our poor pinnedto magazines and make a statement about how semiautos are not the same threat up here.Australias solution may have gotten results but I think it was an extreme kneejerk reaction to tragedy. Also everything in Australia is fucking endangered so its not like they are doing a ton of hunting.,SKS,d4wnb8f,1,t5_2tmua

10309473,0,t3_5nm22y,How does your barrel look any pitting or issues with the crown? Is your gas tube just a light rust or is the bluing deteriorating? An new tube is around  USD. If its the folding stock swaying you Ive seen original wood stocks on ebay for usually less than  USD. Seen one as cheap at  even. Possibly for the price of getting the sight fixed you could do a refurbishment to yours. ,SKS,dccmuvl,1,t5_2tmua
