3210149,0,t3_2ww7dd,There is more to stenciling than the threshold filter. In my experience youre only going to get detail in the places you want by actually making that detail happen yourself. Think your stencil out and layer accordingly. Whats most important? Maybe the general shape of the face right? Do a layer to convey all of the lines you need for that. The shape of the eyes is more important than the irises right? Get that shape down then move on to the finer detail in the irises. You really need to be asking yourself artistically Whats the bare minimum I need to convey the image in question? Its less of a technical endeavor at that point and more of an artistic one. At this resolution youre going to run into problems using a raster file. Individual pixels will cause detail to elude you. You may want to either start working in physical space using the constraints of your stenciling medium e.g. an xacto knife and mylar if thats what youre using. You could also switch to a vector program I recommend Illustrator if you have access to it but Inkscape is free. Vectors will give you full control over the lines youre looking to make. Finally and this may be personal preference on my part I would recommend reducing the total number of layers. You could accomplish the detail youre looking for in  layers tops and using fewer layers is going to make your work that much more manageable. Best of luck improving your stencil.,stencils,couqc27,3,t5_2rz4w

10947493,0,t1_de93rk6,Mix  parts flour to  part water. Pancake batter consistency.  Use like paper mache paste. Paint a layer on the canvas then lay paper on then one more layer of paste on top. Then do a final layer with decoupage glue. You can find at any craft store. It will harden clear and you can paint anything over it. Let me know if that doesnt make sense or if you have any other questions!,stencils,de95n5e,7,t5_2rz4w
