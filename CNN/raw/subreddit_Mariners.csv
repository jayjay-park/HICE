I used to get so excited for spring training keeping up on all the new and young players following the off season transactions and just being a regular fan boy.  When this season started it was so weird that I didnt even know half the guys on the team any more.  Admittedly I pretty much stopped following the team at the All Star break last year not that hard since I moved out of the north west years ago.These past three days have been amazing I feel like a kid again watching all the players hustle for extra bases field like they care pitch like all stars and just flat out hit.

They do not have good starting pitching. Jiminez and Tillman are having subpar years and just do not look consistent enough. Bud Norris has been good but hes the only reliable guy on the staff. They have also lost Weiters for the season and I dont think Cruz can keep doing what hes doing throughout the entire season.  games over right now but  wins looks about right for them unless they make some big moves in their pitching staff. ,Mariners,ciijrlo,6,t5_2rylc

That could easily be the best rotation in all of baseball.By  Peterson will be fully entrenched at B Cano will be winding down at B hopefully Taylor is our fulltime SS Seager will still be at B and theres a possibility that Alex Jackson could be making his debut in LF or RF. If he can improve over the off season I see no reason why James Jones wont be back in CF next year and possibly in  and as long as Zunino can get his bat going hell still be our fulltime catcher. At that point our only mystery position is LF or RF wherever Jackson isnt. That is an extremely solid lineup of all homegrown talent outside of Cano that could very easily compete.I understand that there are a ton of ifs involved but people need to not be so short sighted. As much as I want to see it were not making the playoffs this year.

The only team in our division that we play in the month of August are the Texas Rangers on the  who are injury bug laden thus not anywhere good as they should be.   games are against NL teams  of being played at home. There are going to be some tough and important games in there like vs. Toronto and Detroit.  If they can manage to make it through this month still over . figure out how Jackson and Denorfio fit into the lineup get a healthy Paxton and a Walker that refinds his command and the  of Felix Kuma and Young keeps on trucking and then use that to play their best ball in September that would be amazing. Cause September is the month the Mariners could sneak attack into first place more likely back into the  or  spot Wild Card team. Two series against Oakland  home and  away Two series against the Angles  away and  home Two series against Houston  home and  away One series against Texas  awayThat  games against AL West teams.  Those will be the series that decides whether or not the Mariners are a playoff team or just the same ol Mariners letting  and  losses happen over and over again.

2013579,0,t1_ckvqvbu,I dont think its that clear cut regarding Miller and Taylor.Miller really just had a shitty start of the season. From June  yeah I know kinda arbitrary Miller hit ... with a  wRC. Which is actually better than what he did last season.Chris Taylor on the other hand had a . BABIP this season. I dont care who you are youre not gonna sustain a . BABIP for long. Taylor also didnt show much power either. While I do like his pitch selection he still has a fairly low walk rate since pitchers go right after him since hes not much of a power threat.Honestly if I had to pick a SS long term it would be Miller.,Mariners,ckvtzwv,18,t5_2rylc
2014840,0,t3_2htnrv,As much as I would love to have Cruz or V Mart I just dont see ownership paying for those guys. I could see Ichiro wanting to retiring in Seattle and as awesome as that would be I dont think it would help the team in the long run. It might be worth it to take a run at Melky and Tomas.. Even though Melky is injury prone he is a big bat and that isnt necessarily a reason to not pursue him. Tomas would be cheap and even though unproven it would be worth it in my opinion to give him a chance given the upside. I really think our best chance to get a big bat would be through trades. And yes we might have to potentially give up a prospect or two and maybe someone we dont want to go but in the long run it could really help our team. As long as its not The King Kuma Paxton The Beard Condor JJ Mike Z Lomo Robbie obviously  or Kyle I wouldnt mind as long as the players we got would be an upgrade Edit grammar,Mariners,ckvzgu8,2,t5_2rylc

I mean great we got a run but it just highlights how bad the team is at getting runners on base or scoring multiple runs in a game. Were supposed to be ecstatic whenever any run scores but the reality is that a single run is absolutely insufficient. Can the team be playing well as a team when its just home run derby out there?And Ill add a corollary This entire team struggles with the fastball. They mash off speed pitches for home runs but cannot catch up to even mild heat. Cruz excepted. He can hit anything for now.,Mariners,crvi7el,1,t5_2rylc

If you win series then you win over the course of the year. You dont win  games in a row. Youll have a couple winning streaks but the winning streaks are a result of a consistent team. Consistency is winning series.  out of  wins in a series times  equals a win loss of . Who is currently  and ? The Cardinals. Theyre longest win streak this year is  but theyve strung together those streaks over several series. Because their consistent. I would so rather see the Mariners win  of their next  series then see them win  games in a row. Know why? Theyd be in fucking playoff contention instead of having a bright and shiny  game win streak and then playing . ball for the rest of the season.I dont question your baseball knowledge I question your knowledge of elementary math.

When the body was first created all the parts wanted to be Boss. The brain said I should be Boss because I control all of the bodys responses and functions.        The feet said We should be Boss since we carry the brain about and get him to where he wants to go.        The hands said We should be the Boss because we do all the work and earn all the money.        Finally the asshole spoke up. All the parts laughed at the idea of the asshole being the Boss. So the asshole went on strike blocked itself up and refused to work.        Within a short time the eyes became crossed the hands clenched the feet twitched the heart and lungs began to panic and the brain fevered.

5503477,0,t1_cwes17k,First I dont think you need much power from SSor any of the non traditional power positions if you have it all over the rest of your roster which we basically do. For instance....looking at stats Cano is above average for second base in terms of power. Cruz is obviously a freak. Trumbo is not a weak person. Guti was unbelievable. Seager is above average. Miller has pop. Smith is not a power hitter but has a decent career Slug and hits a good amount of doubles considering he is really only a platoon guy.Second Marte is still very young and will most likely add at least a little strength. Based on his numbers his  game average is HRs and doubles yes I know its a small sample size. With his speed and adding some strength those numbers will go up unless of course he suffers the same fate as most mariners....By the way I wonder how many people were complaining about Ozzie Smiths power?Ozzie Smith   HRs in  yearsAnd before you say it NO I am not saying Marte will be as good as Ozzie considering he is considered one of the best defensive SS of all time. Just trying to point out how flawed your power argument is.Bottom line is that you are over the top on your negativity. Teach Cano B for all I care.

Well probably play OMalley in place of Taylor from now on til Ketel is back and thats just great. Also Leonys is still hitting and he was the coldest bat a couple weeks ago. The fact that each bat on the team has had at least one significant game or even stretch of games is huge. Theres no outright stinker. Lind is improving Martin is improving Gutiwell Guti isnt really playing but in general its not just Seager Cano and Cruz and thats enough for me not to lose hope. This isnt a house of cards and we that just fell down. Its not the same old Ms. This is a good pitcher giving us the business for a night. Happens to every team.Our offense is inconsistent yes but still very good. Other than Taylor crapping his pants at SS our defense is still nails and our bullpen arms are stillmostly good.

I want to watch the players deal with that struggle. When they win Im certainly a lot more excited but for the most part a baseball team will win as many games as they lose.

Id say his base running skills might be whats propping him up but otherwise not that great offensively. dude has  walks on the season and  strike outs,Mariners,d4rncjm,5,t5_2rylc

8137837,0,t1_d4uppcg,Minor league salary signing bonuses and the like are negotiated by the MLBPA of which minor leaguers are not members. Minor leaguers have to sign on the dotted line so you are right that its consensual in that sense but at this point they essentially have no recourse or ability to change that amount. If you want to play baseball professionally MLB basically has a monopoly on it. Its sign the dotted line for a below living wage amount or give up the career youve worked for. The only reason MLB players make so much is theyve developed a strong Union and the best of the best actually have power and of course are deservedly paid more being the best in their field. The best minor league players wont hold out because of the promise of becoming major leaguers. These protections by and large exist because employers will always have the ultimate power over those that arent at the top. Unskilled labor could be paid even more dirt than they are because if they wouldnt take it they wouldnt make money and the company can always find someone similarly desperate. Just because you are signing a contract doesnt mean you have a choice.,Mariners,d4urwse,1,t5_2rylc

8211627,0,t3_4rted8,This team is built brilliantly minus a few key components. Components  that are vital to sustaining a playoff contender. Servais continues to make rookie manager mistakes. A few of the latest examples. Look Diaz is brilliant. He should increasingly be put in the more important spots. But on Wednesday he should have never been left in that long what  pitches? Especially after he gave up the leadoff double after a brilliant th I might add. This is one of Servais very puzzling bullpen management mishaps. Tonight Paxton was taken out of the game at  pitches. Cishek came in for the th and promptly shat the bed. Why why why would you take Paxton out when he was ruling the Royals lineup so hard? Orlando withstanding. You bring him in the th just keep him on a short leash.And now the second massive achilles heel for the Ms that will continue to doom them unless they make a change the closer role I dont see that happening we simply dont have enough riches in our farm system to give up for a premier closerWhen they signed Cishek last spring many were puzzled why you pay that much for a guy who hadnt had sustained success as a MLB close since . He can clearly be effective in other roles his second half of  with the Cards shows that. But the guy is just not going to get the job done as often as we need for the Ms. Mark my words Cishek will break our hearts many more times in . I realize his numbers are not all that bad pretty good for the most part.But just watch the guy closely next appearance. He is visibly a nervous wreck. When the camera is on him as he peers in at Iannettas balls or I mean fingers you can literally see his pulse on his neck bursting out of his jugular. Years ago when I had a panic attack I could see my pulse in the mirror beating out of my neck. Cishek will probably call it pitching on adrenaline. Ill believe him when he serves up a few less meatballs. The guy is pitching on top of egg shells hes a volcano of nervous energy. It pains me to write this and I hope Im wrong but Cishek will never be a consistently effective closer again. Would you want Cishek to close out the game Wild Card playoff? If you had a choice that is Benoit was brought on in part to be a sort of backup just in case because his resume has a lot of closing experience but he hasnt been very dependable either.So I gotta hand it to Dipoto for getting so much right including a thumping offense but then again for striking out when it came to a few very important keystones the manager and the closer.EDIT apologies for the wall of text. venting just a smidge here...,Mariners,d540b3y,13,t5_2rylc

Thats essentially a night off for the bullpen that they havent been getting for the last couple months. Injuries to other starters have only exacerbated that issue. Guys like Paxton and Karns who have had to step up and grind out more innings while the other starters are out havent really gotten it done.We arent getting decimated by other teams. We lose a lot of close games and you can point directly to bullpen regression. I think the bullpen was always going to be a weak link on our squad but at the beginning of the season our starters were pitching well enough to mask that deficiency. Now that we dont have any starters to hide them behind they are getting exposed for what they are. The bad news is that there isnt much help in the farm system that we can pull from and we dont really have the pieces to acquire anyone of consequence.,Mariners,d59clr2,4,t5_2rylc

8382562,0,t3_4ufwzq,Well overall batter has to be Edgar Martinez. Pitching is tough. If were going by those who are no longer playing I think Jamie Moyer might be the best simply for his longevity and time as a Mariner sorry Johnson fans.

8403233,0,t1_d5rtx4k,gtYes Ichiro is probably a defensive upgrade over Cruz.

8608856,0,t3_4xqmad,Were going to make the wildcard game after a one game playoff. Iwakuma is going to be the guy for the one game playoff Against Baltimore. He is going to go six innings and Diaz is going to get the save.The wild card game will be versus Toronto. Felix is going to go on three days rest. Going to have a shaky start giving up  runs in the first three innings but going to settle down after that. The offense is going to take a little while to get things going but in the sixth we get to their starter for two runs. Sanchez who is going to be shut down until the playoffs in late September is going to come in and not be fresh and give up a quick home run. Its going to go to the ninth and the Mariners are going to get to Ozuna. Diaz is going to come in and go  making a strong closing statement on rookie of the year and we are going to make the playoffs and head to Boston. Im not going to pretend to be too optimistic about that but the fact that we are going to make the playoffs for the first time in  years  sure makes me happy and is going to do a lot for the team as a whole.Anyways Im really high but thats going to happen. Someone write it down.,Mariners,d6hpb8m,83,t5_2rylc

11595019,0,t1_dgaapch,Seriously.  First thing youre taught in little league is to go halfway on a fly ball and wait to see what happens.  Later on when you can start tagging up youre never ever told to tag up from first to second only second to third.  Even with Heredias speed trying to tag from first to second is going to get thrown out  of the time.  You just dont even try it.  You go  of the way to second base so you can take third if the ball lands and still get back safely if its caught.,Mariners,dgaay77,3,t5_2rylc
