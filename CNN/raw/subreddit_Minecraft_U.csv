6134959,0,t3_3z8o7j,Keys No keys in minecraft but you should be able to set up a hopper system that can open a door when a certain item is placed in it. Mob Detection Pressure plates would work but im fairly sure that with a bit of tinkering you can make something that wont be seen. Im thinking of something along the lines of using mobs and their characteristics for example how ocelots scare creepers away zombies are attracted to villagers iron golems attracted to hostile mobs tame wolf attracted to you something like that. Moving blocks cant think of anything other than your piston idea other than having obsidian somewhere and mining that with a diamond pick that  you can put in a dispenser to destroy it or place it somewhere. And you most likely have enough time to mine it until all mobs are gone since it takes a while to mine it.Just some ideas i thought of. I havent built enough redstone contraptions to have specific examples but Ive watched a good amount of videos that have something like that. There are a lot of videos and tutorials out there if you need specific ideas! Good luck and sounds like an awesome idea for a map.,Minecraft_U,cymzat7,2,t5_3bare
