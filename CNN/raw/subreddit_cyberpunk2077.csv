7718438,0,t3_4l1blz,As far as I know it has no connection to the Witcher series. Someone correct me if Im wrong.The books are rulebooks for the game which is a tabletop RPG like Dungeons amp Dragons. Theres some story in them but mostly the story gets written as you play.,cyberpunk2077,d3jj7lo,7,t5_2vc2o

8949908,0,t1_d7nn3mg,oh man i hope so is will have an oldschool vibe!i really would like to see a neo noir atmosphere with heavy rain and dark alleys among neon lights with fair amount of npcs. My only concern is how will they handle the huge city it must be a truly living and breathing world,cyberpunk2077,d7nn9h5,11,t5_2vc2o

9279063,0,t1_d8s68d7,I figured as much. Still it will be interesting to see what the result will be like. The CGI trailer is more or less a reference of what we can expect in terms of visuals and art style.,cyberpunk2077,d8s6s5g,0,t5_2vc2o

9846644,0,t1_daqzqmm,I like it for its melody could probably do without the lyrics since theres literally a line that goes youll feed on a tree frog but other times its not so bad either. There were some happy coincidences I found when I made this where the lyrics kinda made sense the most obvious one was like crime its the way I fly to you and its literally bullets flying to the assailant.,cyberpunk2077,dar1gxh,2,t5_2vc2o
10170374,0,t3_5lc3cz,Fallout s reveal was really epic. Though the game wasnt that great but the reveal man. I hope CDPR does something like that for Cyberpunk this year. Even if the release is next year Ill be happy.,cyberpunk2077,dbwv91z,5,t5_2vc2o

10344960,0,t3_5o4fgq,Cyberpunk will likely be released in late early . Mid  at the latest should they delay it. We know Gwent is releasing sometime this year while the other project is a mystery. CDPR themselves said the projects are due between  and .Cyberpunk  is a massive project but I doubt it would be a tenyear development. CDPRs dev period is usually  years. Considering theyve been unofficially working on the project since late  it will probably be released before the new decade.,cyberpunk2077,dcgnrxq,11,t5_2vc2o

10843568,0,t3_5v10im,It could be that they are making it sound overly ambitious just to make sure they get the grant but I think that it just means they want to make the world less static and non interactable. Essentially making the world feel like its changing to fit the atmosphere of the game.,cyberpunk2077,ddyfrqy,7,t5_2vc2o
11566756,0,t3_651rrt,Do you call it st person because it is possible to play in first person too?. Just curious because I never considered those games to be first person games. Just some games which supported rd person as well as st person.,cyberpunk2077,dg73iad,10,t5_2vc2o
