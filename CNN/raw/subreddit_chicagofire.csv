I dont think hed be a difference maker maybe a better option than Fondy but well thats not hard to do. As for Gentile  Id guess that he wasnt performing in training but its impossible to say. Shipping JLA off stinks as well since his contract is up after this season anyway and hes been effective as a super sub. Yallop hasnt been perfect but I think hes made more good player moves than bad ones. He was up against the wall to start the season and its hard to predict how many of the guys who were proven MLS quality would be flops. Losing Berry sucked but as I understood the situation it was lose Berry and use that allocation to buy down Magees new contract or risk  losing Magee. The cap situation was ridiculous at the start of the season. Moving Rolfe on was the best option for both sides  sure hes been phenomenal at DC since then but he was pretty miserable for us this year and last. The midseason transfer window was where a lot of people said theyd start grading and... well I wouldnt give him an A on it but a C or a B is reasonable. Fondy is just a total flop though. I cant imagine what anybody saw in him before we brought him in and I cant imagine why hes getting minutes.

Yes there is a difference.  You correctly identified the apathetic attitude of many FO folks and most media outlets but you also have to consider the mindset of supporters and fans.  The SaturdaySunday crowds that bring their families and attend one or two games a year are casual fans of the game happy to watch any teams play and are not the audience to be concerned with at the moment.  S Sector Latino and the like who are supporters of the club undoubtedly will be on board and can be involved in this from a distribution standpoint and proofreading.  That said there is an entire middle group of folks who are involved in the club from a season ticket and regular admission standpoint that I classify as simply fans who have the potential to become educated like the John Kass of the fanbase.  They could be a very powerful tool to have grievances heard the voice and numbers get bigger and really put the pressure on the FO to respond appropriately.    If this information and the pamphlet reaches them and has a call to action for them could be very powerful.  They just need this information since most are not informed or too casual of an observer to fully comprehend the full picture at the moment.  Spend some time talking to these folks and youll hear this being conveyed.  The HauptmanOut and BlackOutCF have had an impact and questions are being asked this is the next best step to take and why the suggestion is to have that call to action for supporters and fans as we continue to push forward.,chicagofire,cufc67g,1,t5_2se2b

Not great but through all the CB switching hes been the one guy whos been constantly picked when healthy.  I think Nyarko is clearly one of our best players and his stats back that up.  I think Palmer is bad and it should speak volumes that we are seemingly happy to play a rookie out of position in order to not have Palmer on the field.  I dont mind keeping him as a backup but if we are starting him we are going to be giving up lots of goals and abandoning any hope of quality service from the right back position on attacking plays.Polster is a stud IMO and I wish we would sign him to a long term deal and build around him.Accam is a dangerous player.  We need more of him.I dont think Jason Johnson has done enough to warrant keeping.  Same with Magee bc of health issues.  Im not sure what to make of Adailton.

8541506,0,t1_d68ysdk,Correct me if I am wrong but the expansion fee in  was less... m? Also the value of sports franchises rise faster than the rate of inflation that is why Andell invested to begin with. m would be the league shooting itself in the face not impossible but highly improbable. The reason why Marc Lasrys hedge fund bought the Bucks for m was so the NBA could add book value for accounting to each other team without actually doing anything to increase the value of their product. The NHL upped their expansion fee and so did MLS for that matter so that the value of each team would go up without doing anything either. To sell at m would devalue all existing franchises. Also to put such a ridiculous premium on recent results devalues the fact that their is a star on our jersey and the Kings of the Cup bullshit they keep trying to sell us every year. Assuming the  Forbes valuation which is actually wildly inaccurate and more click bait than Forbes doing due diligence on a valuation and the expansion fee was less at the time and inflation still exists the Fire should be worth more than m. My bigger concern is not where the final sale price is but whether the new owner would change the crest or do other stuff that new owners tend to do to leave their mark on their new clubs right away.,chicagofire,d6999l6,1,t5_2se2b
