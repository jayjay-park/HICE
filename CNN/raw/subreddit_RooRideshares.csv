7864680,0,t3_4mzy3m,Hey I live in Tallahassee and Im ! I think that Im in the way. The only thing is that Im an international student so my drivers license is international as well. Ive been driving around to go to concerts or festivals and I have never been pulled over so I dont know if I can legit drive around with this license. One time a car crashed me from behind and I had to wait for the officer but they didnt have any problem with my drivers license being international since I had my passport with me. So message me or reply if youre interested in sharing this journey to Bonnaroo!,RooRideshares,d4028ta,1,t5_3ekpe
