780320,0,t3_2319on,Ive never had an issue with experience and I leave my garrisons in when running HBM. The best experience is simply doing HBM and making sure you use all your raids up. You can leave your underleveled hero in a garrison when doing HBM so it doesnt affect your chance of completing it. I will say that some people raid other players with their new hero and just end the battle right after starting it. It gives you a little bit of experience at the expense of some HB which is why it doesnt seem worthwhile to me unless maybe you were doing it when you had  HB in the first place but theres no cap on how many times you can raid other players.,CastleClash,cgsz5lb,0,t5_2ya92

923266,0,t3_24oga4,Youve got the two most importanttoprogressin legends in Thunder god and Druid so thats a start.I see your talents presumably came with these legends when you rolled them?I would suggest consider rerolling a few of these talents decide whether to farm PD hard or every now and again rerolling talents either way itll take a long period to do so as Fp.For HBM Look at the wave youre currently farming or wanting to farm. Is there a lot of ground heroesmobs? what about flyers?Base your team off this to decide. My line up for G is TG  Druid  Thundergod  Pumpkin Duke  Cupid  Minotaur. While you dont have some of these you could still effectively perform well with Druid Cupid Thundergod Champion and Grizzly. Or succubus if the only thing you struggle with is wave .Arena Id use succ champ for meeting lane on lane TG Cupid and Druid.Also get cupids arrow to  asap if you can and druids minimal decent requirement is  energetic  so you can heal your entire  hero team on raids and hbm.

963388,0,t1_chdrrbx,ah. good to know about AC proc. didnt think it was possible. Would have thought the boss would  shot your AC but cool beans! Your druid will need to be  stars before he can be an actual tank for boss. otherwise hell keep dying. Was suggesting you use your druid instead here because he is ranged and you are resigned to hit and runs. Didnt think your AC could get off but if he can keep doing what you are doing. i think you are on a good path here but just need more levels. do keep in mind zerk is an all around good skill for things like boss fights but revite is king for arena. So it depends on what you are going for. My revite team currently wipes might ranks that are much much higher than mine. If I had a zerk team id get wiped but a zerk team does a heck of a lot more damage in boss fights than my revite team. Your TG ideally should have revite or zerk. revive is pretty useless for him i would think. And cupid is a must have in any hero party so if you have the gems revite is the ideal talent for him. ,CastleClash,chdsogw,1,t5_2ya92

I can beat players in the arena with the same heroes at higher levels than mine  but my heroes are at  and  skill and Im assuming theirs are not.

I pmed people from world chat that posted interest in a guild. If they posted one of the looking for guild lines I would pause the chat and look at their base.

I my self never used a revive talent so i cant help too much on that.  the  shard dungeon last of expert dungeon  is probably the one you want to farm as ive heard. but i cant even get past   .. too much stun for my team to handle.  i too would rush vladif i had him. hes just a god...  im maxing my PD to  so i guess that would be your second goal.

That said you are a long way from stun locking with your current team so if you need more survivability you might consider running Shaman in your boss lineup I could go the whole  minutes with Shaman before I could consistently stun lock.Your biggest priority right now though honestly needs to be getting your PD skill up ASAP.

4590474,0,t3_3dvav7,For HBM try PD Immo Aries Druid Siren and Cupid. OB or TG might work too in place of cupid but more than  melee is usually bad news. Anyway look up the Warmachines or hyuga base and put some slowdown crests on a couple guy and you should be farming O no problem. P when youre  star.For arena since you dont have a high revite Aries you could try doing a counter strategy with pixie and scatter crests or sending an atlantacore down their lane with psyshield. Not sure on the specifics but I get stomped by those setups sometimes.Also with PD less than berserk  is kind of useless so unless its letting you keep  stacks up some lifedrain crests might work out better.

My cupid also died to the spirit mage but cleared the top half of the base before getting there. He still had  left on the clock.gtI guess your dupe Cupid must be some amazing monster.or maybe its that inscriptions and crests contribute more health than you realize and a  cupid only has  more health than a lvl  assuming they both are inscribed to  and have level  LD. Simply putting that crest set on a  cupid gives him more health than a level  cupid without a crest.

At  for demon If you dont have at least one revit Aries in the group and you dont know your drop order or have any scatter then youre going to have a bit of a tough time.Rewards are sick though.  red crystals for demons get random crests  rare crests from mobs x blue crystal bags per silver chest up to x green bags per bronze chest etc. The red crystals you get per trash mob go up faster than you realize too and youre going to need a ton of thoseThe passive income generation is huge  your crystal mines are are limited to your LR level.

They dont need deadly strike.  You cannot  shot the altar in arena witboit it though so people like it there.  Too bad arena is worthless. The new hbms aa throu b ae have a demon boss that has k capped damage.  T is long ago and not discussion co cerning progression even though some still need it.your money analogy is not accurate nor relevant.  I would rather in this game have a hero th a t always hits for a good amount more than one that randomly hits for a crap ton and where at least  out of  times that hit does more damage than the health what it hit had.  As to bulwark mpre hp is always good.  Most people will have leech andor goblet to heal their sk so more hp means he lives longer and revives for more.  If sk lives longer he will make up for your imaginary more damage fro deadly strike.final note deadly strike is for people who like big numbers but dont really care about theorycraft.,CastleClash,cykcry1,0,t5_2ya92

I did suggest you use him except in two instances dungeons and Arena OL.   I see some people use him in OL Arena but I think hes best at HH.  For OL you want someone who can do damage to the opponents heroes while theyre chipping at your crystal.  TG does that and he also gives them short little breaks with his stun.  As far as dungeons go I dont quite remember if I used him in Expert but in Insane SK just gets stunned and provides no quick AoE damage to take the towers down or disable them.  Again TG does that.

6146536,0,t1_cynovv4,It is just the  heroes that you use.  Placement and position have no bearing.  I was thinking that maybe it was the order that you got the heroes but I dont think that is right either.  Ive had frost witch forever and Aries must have came after her.So the best way to test the order is in lost realm preferably in  a battle altar that you dont own.  Because then you can go in see the order it drops the heroes then just end battle.  You can do that an infinite number of times until you find the right mix for you.The bad part would be if frost witch is always placed before your pumpkin duke then what do you do?  Maybe you can still reach max speed with your lost realm demon partner with their PD and a couple cupids.Now that I can consistently kill any demon with this strategy I am finally at the point where red crystals arent a limiting factor in my advancement.  My lost realm base is level .  All my blue crystal bases are level  and I have about  red crystals sitting in the bank so that when I reach level  I can immediately raise all my blue crystal mines up to level  as well.I have some level  crests mostly sprint for the arena but most are level  still.  I could probably make a level  set of flame guard but meh.Anyway my point is that once you can beat all the different demons you can advance much better.,CastleClash,cyoaos7,1,t5_2ya92

Im not saying this is what will work just that it can work so you can have room for other heroes. GH is your main scatter hero but his proc makes his scatter nearly ineffective.

7849351,0,t3_4mtrbc,For your questionsCondemnation isnt such a great talent  works best on a tank obviously so BT would be ok but so would AC unless youre happy with the scorch which isnt bad.For dungeons even though SK is a monster its probably better to go with heroes that can destroy en mass like ... damn you dont have many... Given who you have Id go with PD Druid Cupid your core  Vlad Spirit Mage and either DK SK or TG.  In insane dungeons most people will use PD Druid Cupid SM and TG  plus one other ranged hero like DD Santa and so on.  SK and Vlad make rare appearances because you want the stackable procs no cool down of TG and SM to destroy everything.  I would say that unlocking goblet three flaming  is impossible with your heroes but maybe youre a lot better than me.  My heroes are e PD amp Cupid  Druid ee DD e Santa with  wargod and  SM my weakest link and I was very happy to make  flames on it...Hero Trial   try Vlad PD Cupid SK Warlock amp TG or DK.  like with the other hero trials you have to get a bit luck.  Corner bases are what works for me.  Death Knights and Trentaurs are the easiest but with a good spawn a SK can win out against Sirens and Warlocks as well.  Having very high level stun towers apparently helps but Im nowhere near that mine are only level  with level  garrisons.  If you think back to when you were struggling through HT and got a PD and just instalose vs. how it went with Ninjas... thats kind of like how HT goes  Vlads are the new PD and Trentaurs are the new ninja.Good Luck!,CastleClash,d3yc4si,2,t5_2ya92

If you arent sitting on a bunch of fame you should be working on your main team first. Better to have  evo than  devo and everyone else nonevo. You dont have to worry about her skill level yet just use her as an exp mule.Work on ghoul to  then probably WL to . Once you evo Val use the books to bring ghoul up and evo him. Once you have a well rounded full evo team youll be doing well in every game mode and getting better rewards.

HBM has always been my favourite game mode I really like the little tweaks that can improve your chances while theres still plenty of RNG involved. Im looking forward to AF but hope they put a new wrinkle in there so its not just the same but harder. AA was great because you suddenly needed scatter and had to combat those crazy self destructs.    I wonder if they could make AF like  consecutive hero trials.

9405189,0,t1_d95mzso,Thanks for the comments and opinions.  I think youre talking a little past where Im at in the game but it help to plan ahead.You are one of the opinions I have seen a few times that kind of steers people away from spending the resources to Evo in my case as posted above  multiple Enlighten Champions junk.I understand what you said above but if you were in a place way behind where you are now...  Would you consider eating the cost of only Evoing  not Devo  those high Enlightens to effectively gain the ability to take   core heroes at a time to  and Evo at xp.In this scenario you would spend the time sweeping for XP plus k fame and red meth and gain an instant  Evos that you could get to at least e in a day.Or would you toss the dupe junk high Enlightens  and gain the XP naturally on each of the  target heroes and Evo them at xp?The question wouldnt even exist if it wasnt junk dupes  if it was a Champion and a Paladin and a Succubus for example  Youd get  Evoed unique heroes  plus the books to either get the HB or the XP to Evo  Core Heroes.I dont know  Im just fishing for more opinions while Im stockpiling resources for  days from now when I mass Evo.Thanks if you read all that and take the time to reply!,CastleClash,d9869vb,1,t5_2ya92

Hes a great FP option in many dungeons especially in  and most of ID.  skill would be great too for extra target and extra damage.    PK is also worth evolving. He will help a lot in LB.

9501443,0,t1_d9i4rgu,Sorry for the delay in response... yes you will get a LOT more HB from expeditions than from boss  I get around  a day from expedition K might but even at lower might youll be pulling in  if you are able to complete them all.  It may not seem like a lot when you need  to  your heroes but it adds up.For expedition focus on your key heroes to ensure their skills and level are effective.  And dont hesitate to quit a battle if youre going to lose a key hero  its better to flame  opponents than  flame  and lose your key heroes which prevents you from progressing.Be picky about who you attack  skip anything that looks too hard and especially at the start avoid opponents with dangerous heroes like SK DD or a revite aries.  Also any hero that is more than  levels above yours will be considerably more dangerous or if youre looking at evoed heroes  levels less than yours... meaning a level  evo is as dangerous as a level  nonevo hero.,CastleClash,d9k97ia,1,t5_2ya92

9972258,0,t1_db7d9td,Ill take your word for it.  My reaper was devo and  to get through dungeons so I like that he hits all the heroes.  Most people dont keep insurance troops out.  He just seems to have better crossover to me than Pixie.  I see her value just not at the same level as others.Do you see snipable bases?  I cant remember the last time I saw an HBM base over k might.  If you arent hitting k might accounts in gw then you also probably arent sweeping  and definitely not .  So I dont see how you are placing war god on a pixie.  Then if you are going after high might accounts you gotta have an Aries.  If you have silenced  heroes then Pixies proc isnt doing much for you.If you are cheesing Pixie is a bad choice because she would remove the DD damage reduction which is what you are stacked on.Like I said though I dont use her so maybe thats not how it shakes out.,CastleClash,db7eulh,1,t5_2ya92
9996347,0,t3_5imwoe,Well first off youll want to get to . Without Mino youll want to use PD Cupid Ghoul SK SM and probably the mighty TG or possibly Val. You can easily get to  if you get your SM to e . You should also seriously consider getting PD to   its a really nice boost in dungeons HBM LBF etc. It sucks that you never gave Molt a  scatter youve rolled a lot and shes  priority for that but oh well...in the absence of such use PD Val Ghoul Vlad Harpy and Grim. Use a side base garrisoned magic towers obviously  ofc. I ran with that setup but Molt instead of Grim and it was pretty easy though you should get both those scatters to . As for LBF...here is what I would recommend.Team  Aries DD Cupid Vlad Santa. Pretty simple. Lots of firepower simple DD and Aries combo thats been working for forever. If you have psyshield Aries and DD are both top targets for it on this team.Team  SK Ghoul Val Tree PD. The combo of SK Ghoul and Tree is well known and quite common. Val is in there to combat Aries and get PD going. PD provides muchneeded DPS to this team very easily.Team  DK Grim Harpy PK CK. This is the scatter team. Yours will be very effective due to the amount of scatter you have. Devo DK will help a lot however because you wont run Arc or Molt and they help keep him alive. The enemies shouldnt ever proc against this team and thanks to the revite CK they can even beat Aries teams at least  of the time which is actually pretty good odds combined with the other scatters corrode and PKs proc Id say Aries teams will routinely go down to this team.,CastleClash,dbajwkl,2,t5_2ya92

Both of them spawn more often if you are chasing chests  from a stamina point of view.

She probably wouldnt help much for ID  could be useful in T I used her in my first clear of T but she wasnt essential to my team.

11541490,0,t3_64o989,I would agree with your guild and go for SM.  I know it may seem like a waste now but it may shave a few seconds off of Lava when hitting the demons with no cap.  Also it really is the best talent for him.  ID  may be a bit out and we are not sure if SM will still be the beast he is in there but to me it is the best choice.However if you dont want to put there then I agree with most others and say HB.

11705927,0,t3_6712ay,ATM you cant get to  your heroes are just too low. i give the following points. you want all of your heroes to be  and i at least preferably i. i had a full evo team and was struggling to wipe  at times.. Lineup i would ignore the guy suggesting TG and use SM instead. he is a much better investment long term. try PD Cupid Mike DD SB SM. with the boost from mike sbsm should be able to wipe the base in  procs.. use al funs videos. Your spells are too low. you need SS and GA  at a minimum for the duration increase. nobody uses restoration in IDs i was using a mix of fervour and meteor depending on base. Frenzy and fervour probably better for you since with SB and SM you should be using a smash and grab strat.. Your talents arent good but theres not much you can do about that until later. use the enlightens to get people up to  quickly will be a good boost to damage having everyone higher.,CastleClash,dgmw3st,2,t5_2ya92
