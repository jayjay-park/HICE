Im telling you how to find a decent guy. Not how to get a google grade dev. Also most recruiters are worse than the interviewees.  weeks ago I saw a recruiter from a famous consulting company making the bold statement that he had a masters in economics and had learned to program on a  week course the audience laughted very loudgtWhat projects they worked on for fun. Many developers dont do this. Especially freelancers who would rather be spending their time getting paid while developing.Good devs are usually hobbyists hobbyist are generally good devs. Generalization means exceptions but empirically this is a very very efficient rule. You cant rule out someone who has no hobbyist projects but you will definitely want to look at a hobbyists portfolio.gt How many programming languages they know. Thats like asking a carpenter how many types of nails they use.No thats like asking a carpenter how many tools does he know how to use. A nontechnical person wont be able to take much conclusions from someone who says I know java ruby and python. But they will have understood that that person know how to use  tools.

Many states will compare your workers comp and disability policies to quarterly employment returns and issue large fines if you dont have policies for your employees.  Its especially tricky because its totally possible to be employing people for months before the state notices it and then you can be in the hole for huge fines the longer you are not compliant the larger the fines will be.

Plus additional appointment services and mobile ordering for restaurants.The entrepreneurs will be area partners that will receive POS materials training access to the Price Cheetahs platform and customer support handled by Price Cheetahs. These area partners will not even have to deal with the money as their earnings are deposited directly to their PayPal account and all sales transaction fees are swallowed by Price Cheetahs. Price Cheetahs will eventually hire a development team to build onto the platform and progress the business forward based on what is learned by the area partners as a collective from the collective experiences.What Ive done so farSo far Ive been working with a development company to build the platform to my specifications. These specifications have come from my own experience with marketing affiliations owning online businesses participating as both a consumer and merchant in daily deals. Talked with business consultants interviewed consumers and merchants and shared my idea with other entrepreneurs and even business students. The general consensus has been positive with little nay saying but including some suggestions that have been carefully listened to considered and in some cases applied to the overall plan.What am I looking forCurrently running a crowd funding campaign to help with software improvements and offering several great perks to contributors. So any help from newsletter writers or contributors would be amazing and greatly appreciated.Once the software is ready I will be looking for area partners to manage territories under a yearly license plus percentage. ,startups,cg57qgc,1,t5_2qh26

They want to use their printers to make a project.Were not going to be supporting every printer thats sold unless theyre sold by us. Basically were selling printers locally but theres a larger organization thats also selling the same printers. What theyre not interested in at all is supporting the printers. They just want to sell them.So the only way their customers will know about us will be if they purchase an extended warranty or premium phone support which is a per printer per month cost. With the phone support we do pretty much anything but replace the parts. If they need a replacement part we either send it out and charge them accordingly or they send the printer to us we fix it and charge them accordingly.Any printers that we sell ourselves will be completely supported by us premium phone support or not.There are limitations on what can be replaced so if they drop the printer off a truck thats something thats not covered by the warranty.,startups,cg64jgf,1,t5_2qh26

722864,0,t1_cgmc95n,Im in the UK so its difficult for me to judge but is the problem price ?I can walk into any shop  super market in the UK and get apparently equivalent teas for between p .  and   per g . What is like where you are? No doubt youre offering premium teas but your descriptions arent making that clear. Your descriptions are currently short and the barest minimum where they should be rich and evocative. The site itself isnt terrible but it isnt great either. Your floating shopping cart is barely visible and not where most would expect to find it ie top right.Not a biggy but the checkout page seems cluttered and the drag products to basket didnt work for me.Back when I cared about PPC you could reduce your CPC by increasing the relevance of the page that ad links to. ie linking to specific pages that had a keyword density  relevance that matches the search keywords. eg search for Chocolate mint black tea links to a page with a page title of chocolate mint black tea not to a generic home page. Reducing your cpc  increasing relevance may be the key to successYour negative keywords dont seem at all silly. In fact I would recommend spending some time expanding the list. If your ad is clicked less then google considers it less relevant for that keyword and you have to pay more for the same exposure. Equally having people click your add if theyre not in buying mode wastes your money.i would suggesting focussing on and experimenting with one tea. Experiment with different advert texts longer copy maybe lower prices if that might be the problem. See if you can find out whats wrong with one of your pages then roll that out to the others this will also cost you less.Im not thrilled about your advertisment text either . Being brutal  Brew tea in minutes isnt your unique selling point. All tea can be brewed in minutes. Youre selling Fresh fragrant premium tea hand picked by mermaids or whatever right? yeah my ad text needs a bit of refinement too !You could also experiment with selling on ebay  Different prices different copy. See what works. Use the ebay historical prices report to see what similar products sell for cant remember the url sorry.Have you tested the site on mobile? How many of your visitors are mobile?edit also better product photos. when you click through to the product detail page you should almost be able to smell the tea from the photo ie significantly higher res. Also an additional photo showing the nice packaging possibly gift quality packaging.,startups,cgmfylm,2,t5_2qh26

He constantly comments in rstartups saying the most pessimistic shit and treats everything as if its the same laboratory like scenario just like this instance.Giving two weeks notice at any stable company is acceptable. But for a startup where OP is one of the lead guys he could potentially kill the company by leaving on a whim. Nacho basically said you dont owe them anything and you can just leave. While thats true thatll most definitely burn bridges which OP said he wants to avoid and possibly even kill the company.

Essentially they owned Yahoo and they were dominating Internet search. He even said that it was as daunting a task to dethrone Yahoo then as it is to dethrone Google today. They had a few search startups come to them for funding each one very good but none of them code dethrone Yahoo. There was nothing that special about Google relative to the others except one thing straight up fucking luck. Google had come to them right after Yahoo had started to shift its emphasis towards portalsmediacontent and away from search. Sequoia happened to know this because you know they owned them etc. No one else knew. Google just happened to be the next company that came along and Sequoia was sold on the idea of having a search startup in their portfolio so they took it.Maybe they wouldve been successful without Sequoia but maybe not.

I think you would need a strong initial marketing strategy to get a high enough DAU for the coffee shops to see your products value.So far weve been doing the typical route of soclal a few ads and were getting in touch with local coffee blogs but I think the biggest advertising push would be when its finally rolled out and cafes and our marketing is in their premise.

If you succeed you will have the stress and reward of an entrepreneur. Anyways if someone is offering you  initial investment that means that they think you and your product is worth something. Do you already have a working product by the way? Or is he investing in just an idea you have? If you already have a working product  seems a bit much to give up that large of a portion of your business along with  to each of your classmates.Consider how much money you truly need before you can run a round of funding at a higher evaluation. Maybe consider counter offering with  for  or just saying you will do  for  of your company. If he is willing to evaluate your company at  million then you should really do some soul searching if you truly believe in your product and are passionate about it.

1326224,0,t1_ciit38v,Fine. You arent dumb. Your ideas are dumb. If OP has an idea worth protecting then its worth patenting. If OP cant put his idea into a patentable format then its not worth protecting. OP asked how to protect his idea. That is what patents are specifically for. Its that simple. As far as changes go again thats part of the patent process. If I had a patent on a bicycle calling for circular wheels and somebody tweaked it by making a bicycle with square wheels... well that tweak is worthless.  If they tweak the bicycle by putting two handlebars on the bicycle instead of one well.. that bicycle is still going to violate my patent. Im not sure you understand what a patent protects. If OP has a novel unobvious idea he can patent his idea in such a way that nobody else can use it. Hotwire does not let you name your own price like Priceline.com because Priceline patented that idea. Without that patent anyone could rip off Priceline... how dumb of them to get that patent??

I started out by submitting to a bunch of startup launch type sites built with laravel built with bootstrap and directory types hotscripts published the WordPress plugin on their market setup some GitHub repos and used Twitter to follow people in our market with some keywords customer supportservice managers marketers agency in their bios and about  followed back and I tweet new feature updates which gets some engagement from it and answering questions on Quora about knowledge base software. I seem to find places every couple of days thats relevant one of them is I manually send personalized direct emails to people who are using knowledge bases that are  on separate domains and  dont match their business layoutdesign at all. The email basically says that we could deliver a better experience and I attach a screenshot of their contentarticles from their current solution I copypaste them into our site with a demo account and then inject the code into one of their pages of their site. So far that gets some good response rates but requires very tedious amounts of effort to deliver and so I havent done that as much and have gone back to focusing on SEO and building quality non spammyirrelevant backlinks.I fixed a bug in the WordPress plugin which was making us hard to find category tags werent being detected right and weve started seeing  downloads a day now and I want to say a signup every few days.

1761040,0,t3_2embxb,TLDR I work for the Web Summit I was in a similar position to OP in  learned loads from going to an event like this. Everything is a risk be calculated. You get out what you put in. Do your homework. k startups applied this year k will be present over  days. My user name is my real name. This is me on Twitter  and this is my website Im a tech community organiser in Dublin Ive organised and hosted a lot of Dublin startup and developer meetups and I started the longest running monthly meetup of founders and developers in Ireland Ive also been a founder I have been through an acquisition and I have invested my own money in startups.Last week I joined the Web Summit team. Some of the negative stuff that has been said here is probably warranted. Yes the marketing tactics used by the Web Summit in the past have pissed some people off and depending on the stage you are at  is a lot of money. But there are also people out there posting on throwaway accounts   that seem to have a problem with the Web Summit being a business and one that actually makes money. OP as a founder of a startup you understand that your whole world right now is about risk... but calculated risk. In this case is the Web Summit worth it? I faced the same question myself in  when a startup I founded was selected to pay  to have a table for one day at TechCrunch in SF. This event was the predecessor to TechCrunch Disrupt. Combined with promotional materials airfare accommodation and living costs for a week we probably spent the best part of . We had raised a small round and at the time I wasnt sure it was the right thing to spend money on but my cofounder convinced me. We were very early stage and had not yet figured out a load of things such as productmarket fit pricing GTM strategy. We didnt know the words we should use to tell people about the product or even what our exact customer looked like. On top of all that I hadnt a clue what an elevator pitch was... never mind for this startup.  hours standing on my feet talking to probably  people taught me a hell of a lot about all these things and more. In many ways it actually helped to put me on this path. Was it worth the money we spent? Yes absolutely. Will going to the Web Summit be worth the expense for you OP? Honestly? You wont know unless you go and unless you are prepared to make the absolute best use of your time. That means you should plan on who you want to meet in terms of customers partners investors and people you might want to recruit.Yes a  person event is chaotic and noisy. But what weve seen over the past few years is that the teams get the most out of it are the ones who put the most in. They do their research they turn up early the leave late they have a hit list of people they want to talk to and they do what it takes to set these things up. If this is not something you want to do then fair enough. But heres a good example of some startups who showed up last year and worked their arses off For context and to give you an idea of the size of this event heres some information I can share at this pointBy the end of September we will have had circa  applications.  of those will pass the application process. We will have  startups showcase over  days in  main industry areas Marketing Hardware Enterprise Design amp Development and multiple other smaller industry areas Sports Lifestyle. Entertainment Social Entrepreneurship. We have startups represented from over  countries.OP and anyone else if you dont feel the Web Summit is right for you at the stage you are at right now fair enough. But if you do and you want to connect you can get me on eamonwebsummit.net  happy to chat. ,startups,ck14wq3,4,t5_2qh26

1826316,0,t3_2db1p5,I know people are being dicks below but heres one a twitter list neural network or whatever Im not smart with terms.Basically we can create smarter lists by using the mediocre human curated ones. A friend of mine didnt want it because hes on some lists he doesnt think he belongs on and theres also some automated lists like SocialBro and the LinkedIn one. However I think in the grand scheme that wont matter.Lets take Mikko umikkohypponen. If we want to create an infosec list we might look at one someone else made but everyone seems to have a slightly different definition of who belongs on a list. Hes on over  lists and someone like JZdziarski uJZdziarski is on only . TheGrugq is on . So what Id like to do is input one or more seeds and then go through all the lists theyre on. See who also appears on a lot of those lists. If of TheGrugqs  lists over  have mikko too we can surmise that both belong on a good Infosec list.The end result is a site that can create a dynamic set of smart lists of quality individuals for categories. The end goal is to get bought by twitter to improve their recommendation engine.,startups,ck99fu8,1,t5_2qh26

1851801,0,t1_ckcb3t8,He wants to get a solid userbase before telling everyone that the actual service is not free. After that is announced there will probably be some kind of quota for  free services that you can skip by paying. The silence about monetization is kind of an obvious sign that the free version is going to be heavily restricted after the initial customer acquisition is considered a success. After that they can use the money from paid service to still serve a few free requests but the main weight will be put into paid version of the sevice.As this service can only scale via employees unless of course they have a very sophisticated AI that is actually handling all the requests which I heavily doubt is the case they need money to scale. Money can come from investors but investors only invest if there is opportunity of profit therefore the service must be either ad based doesnt probably work here or fee based. comparing to youtube or snapchat is irrelevant as these services scale differently they are in a software business not service business... or that is what I am reading between the lines at least so this is purely an educated guess.,startups,ckcc5gb,5,t5_2qh26

1963619,0,t1_ckps5f6,Thanks for the reply!Those are all good points. I hadnt really thought about offshoring it. Part of me is using this experience to shore up my coding skills another wants to ensure that the code is high quality and is designed such that it is easily scalable.I definitely dont work on it at work because my contract states that they would own it. Im doing this purely on my hardware and on my time. Im also looking to change my current employer soon anyway likely before this project completes no further growth opportunities.So Im stuck between finding another job programming for someone else or starting my own thing. Ive got a lot of good ideas and a lot of drive. What I dont have a lot of is money. Im also getting married next summer so the savings are currently kind of off limits anyway. Id prefer to not switch companies and then bail if my thing takes off but Im wasting my time where I am and its no longer as enjoyable.So ideally Id like to find someone who sees the vision I see who is willing to invest so that I can do this full time and hopefully someone who could help guide me through the process of turning an idea into a product.,startups,ckptgfv,1,t5_2qh26

1966798,0,t3_2h7vx6,Here is one viewpoint on the value of ideas that I happen to agree with Ideas are just a multiplier of execution    Im kind of in the same boat. Although I am in the process of learning to program and learning the technical side I am the idea guy. I am the business guy accountantfinancial analyst for  years plus I study everything about business such as marketing product strategy etc.. Even though I will be involved with the technical side I want to find a technical cofounder as my CTO. At first I didnt want to part with much equity but after thinking it through I decided that I will probably offer  ownership. I want someone who is going to be equally dedicated. I dont want any resentment from a feeling of unfairness.    I also realize how difficult the actual execution is going to be. People come up with great ideas all the time. How often do they actually get executed? Sad to say almost never.    It will be interesting to see if your friend accepts .

2004894,0,t1_ckuruoq,gt There is also a timing problem to consider...what measurable activities are the marketers doing during the sometimes lengthy transition from idea to sellable product?I guess  just measure the buzz. Count mails flying around with potential customers count numbers of entries on landing page and mails in the database. I think that its in the resposibility of the marketing team to  via CRM and collected mails  establish connection between potential customers and product development. Also  measure social media engagement and so on. All of that will lead to the sales as product launches that could be just change of a thing measured. gt Honestly I think youd be better off with two distinct entities one for the product team and one for sales. The sales entity should probably work off of commission. That allows the product team to fire the sales team if need be and allows for the very different organization and motivational structures these two very important roles need.I think that marketing and sales departments are even more important that DEV on the begining of the startup because its worthless to do a product that noone knows about but its not worthless to do a buzz and generate demand over nonexisting product. I think you are right actually. Marketing team in our perspective is planned to be small  team of  where Im the   and distributed through the projects. In the future we plan to expand that department through normal salary based employment. Then I would be happy to design it in a way marketing amp sales have measureable profits comming back to their pockets once the product launches. Its easiest to increase motivation basing it on commissions. ,startups,ckusdn5,2,t5_2qh26

2036504,0,t1_ckyhwaq,Some good thinking there but Im confused by thisgt If Im the technical cofounder I need to know that Im getting compensated fairly because Ill be pulling a lot of weight in terms of company value. Equity is fine but because most startups fail its essentially meaningless. If you have a proven record of successful startups that will count for a little more. Almost without exception I would expect to get paid market rates from the beginning.If he has to pay you market rates from the beginning why would should he even bother to offer you equity? Furthermore why should he make you the CTO? Why not just hire his own coder?No devs that I know of who work in San Franciscobased startups make what they would make at Google or Facebooknot by a long shot.I dont mean to slam anyone here but Im getting the sense from this thread that devs think they have more value than they actually do at least compared to other members of a startup team. Theres a lot of I could do this myself or What value will YOU add?For every  dev in Silicon Valley that started hisher own company there are literally  that are too chickenunimaginativewhatever to do the same. I know because I work with them.If I had a nickel every time I went to a Meetup around here and watched some dev present their technologyonly to get torn up by the juryId have enough to start my own VC fund. No stage presence. No ability to tell a coherent story. No point. Hell some cant even string two sentences together. This is why founders team upto complement each others strengths.The fact of the matter is that development is largely a commodity proven by the fact that OP already has his MVP built and is generating revenue. What a CTO should be bringing to the table is a vision about the technology... leadership... foresight and planning for scalability... and opinions about every other area of the business. I can code and make k a year therefore impress me? You are not a CTO.Yes its hard to find a good technical cofounder. I know. But its just as hard to find a good design cofounder. A good business cofounder. A good sales cofounder.ltEnd of rantgtOP finding someone you want to found a company withand sleep with over the next  yearsis not going to happen overnight. It could take a year to find the right person. Dont give up you have an MVP and traction. For what its worth I think your location could be a factor but not a huge one as distributed teams are common these days especially among devs.Let the down voting commence,startups,ckyonpp,3,t5_2qh26

Ive written some teaching material for PHP beginners see my post history and it seems to me that marketing and differentiation in the free space is difficult. Bear in mind that wanting space in the market is not the same thing as there is space in the market.Its worth doing an analysis of how you would do things differently. What specifically is wrong with current material or teaching approaches? What would be your business model? I was quite impressed with PHP Academy which I found today  a lot of video material for free and an inexpensive subscription model of GBP per month for extra features. Thats a good differentiation on Treehouse who I think are USD without free material afaik. The material looks sound too  obviously of importance.One thing to be aware of when teaching programming is there are a lot of ways to do it unintentionally badly. There are a glut of dreadful sites offering tutorials  usually advertbased  and their code is out of date or insecure. For a giggle Ive recently taken to tweeting complaints to a few of them but the response rate is about  at the mo. If you are not yourself a seasoned programmer it might be worth getting a few years under your belt before attempting this. One recently tweeted that they had passed a  million visitor mark  not at all infeasible  even though at least some of their material is woeful.Youd need to work out how to maintain tutorials as well  one of the weaknesses of many sites is they are stuck on old practices and they are loathe to remove it it generates revenue and they are unwilling to improve it that decreases revenue.Long story short start with an honest competitor analysis!,startups,climxdl,2,t5_2qh26

Felt bad for him cause I realized that he and maybe Apple execs doesnt appreciate the local cultures of different people and how they got there. Copycat entrepreneurship for me makes sense if there are more people who cant afford your niche product that there are who can. During a weeks visit to China I saw a copycat iPhone  running iOS and thats when I realized its a whole new ball game if people are willing to go that far. Point is while it may be morally questionable copycat economy from replicating models to replicating products is extremely relevant. Some guy can copy you deliver better execute better price it better and will likely beat you at your own game. The Chinese have perfected that. ,startups,clkyu5z,3,t5_2qh26

If Id enter all that can be said right now itll be the length of a full book.Side note I actually have  custom CMS systems just like yours although different. First is a highperformance CMS that Im using for my businesses and providing to other partners. The other is a nextgeneration CMS developed that will be released as opensource probably next year this is developed by a close friend and partner.You should start by deciding who are your target customers what kind of CMS features are they looking for and what kind of licensing you will provide.My take on this just a few basic items You are confusing the CMS with features.The CMS should provide the core  and only the core. The CMS does nothing but connects everything and makes things work. If you make it otherwise you have a bad design concept that will bite you back in the next years.Everything else every item that is a specific functionality that does something visibly useful should be a plugin removable. For example if I dont need authentication public site then I wont install the auth plugin.  You are inherently competing with opensource CMS systems. You have to offer something better in some direction. They get all the above features for free with Wordpress via free plugins. What are you offering better than WP andor Drupal for example? If you think youre offering more features youre kidding yourself. All major CMS systems come with a wealth of free plugins available. Matching this is no job for a small team or developer. Which licensing type? If you are using pieces of code from someone else under an opensource license type you need to provide your CMS under the same licensing. If you provide only as a service SaaS then you dont have a problem. But if you make the code public you need to follow a single license type and all embedded code from third parties must be following the same license. E.g GNU General Public License GPL. What level of security? Did an external company perform a security audit on your CMS? This is critical time consuming and costly. Without it you are simply selling an insecure app and putting your customers in jeopardy. Your coding skills might be great however this has nothing to do with the need of having your own code audited for security by an expert third party.You need to focus on an unmet need. So far I dont see you have found one. A CMS with all in it is not an unmet need. Rather focusing on a very specific advantage that some specific customers have hard time finding.As a coder I definitely appreciate your coding efforts and the sheer volume of work needed to wrap this up although I cant really evaluate your CMS in any form without access to the code itself. Took me years to complete mine. And I dont have a sellready product yet wrapping for market is far from ready although Im using it and will be using it for heavy load projects next.Youre facing the same hard wall that stands between a product and a successfully sold product. Product concept identifying the right customer identifying the right marketing channels to that customer sales team support team tech team management project funding... there are a wealth of things that you need to care of from this point on.You have indeed identified your situation right  you are walking blind and you also need a partner to cover the business portion. And funding.,startups,clulbfr,2,t5_2qh26

2289531,0,t3_2lgopo,Ive used Designs for multiple projects both for clients and for projects of my own and have been uniformly pleased with the results. Ive also worked directly with professional contracted designers in the past and frankly have found the Designs process to be much better in terms of the breadth of designs we see the quality of the work and the final product its also usually a much better deal frankly. I consider it some of the best money I spent when bootstrapping my own company.Biggest thing no one has mentioned yet You do not have to guarantee the prize until you select the finalists! I.e. you can launch a contest allow submissions to come in for four days until you have to select your finalists and if nothing looks good to you simply cancel it no money lost to you. Its particularly useful when you only have a vague sense of what you want your brand to look like. Youll literally end up with close to two dozen designers taking your descriptions and running with their own visions. Theyll see things you never even thought of. Yes as some other posters mentioned some of the designers try to game the contests with generic designs but there will always be at least five highquality designers competing.With one designer even a really talented one youll end up with just that individuals narrow vision and skillset. Theres an expression to the man with the hammer every problem is a nail and thats true with designers as well. Theyll give you what they happen to be good at. Great if it synchs up but often times it simply wont. Also for several hundred dollars you can run a midtier designs contest but youre really not going to be able to hire anyone of significant quality Freelance.The key with running a successful Designs contest is to actively engage the designer community. Rank the designs as they come in provide active feedback for the designers and post general updates as frequently as possible. Its an iterative process so youll be able to constantly tweak the designs as they come in.,startups,clupajl,0,t5_2qh26

2535583,0,t1_cmpinu0,You know reading your reply makes me think more about it. I want to say sure sales and talent recruitment would be very valuable because both of those can have massive gains in the short term and then the team can very easily take it over whereas the tech is such a harder to understand problem that it would be hard for a startup to keep the momentum after leaving the accelerator a.k.a. what do they do when the first bug pops up and you arent there with your guru debugging skills anymore. But I can see a lot of nontech guys saying that sales and building out their team are their strengths and they dont need help with hiring and sales. But maybe if your hiring was specific to the tech side as in building a tech team that could support the project and you being the guys who get the momentum built until you can hand it off to the newly built company dev team.  Ive seen too many nontech founders give me an update after  months and say Weve finally gotten onto the right track with our tech we brought on a new lead developer who told us that python wasnt the right language for our product and we just finished converting our whole product to php. Meanwhile Im thinking... ok google was built off one and Facebook was built on the other theyre both capable of handling your basic ecommerce website... But your new lead programmer that you hired only knew one language and convinced you to change because you dont know enough about tech to argue....  So maybe there is a very specific type of startup you can focus on. The ones where the tech side is more general or basic where you guys can find the tech specific talent properly vet the guys check their work and advise the founder as to what they can expect then get the dev team going in the right direction. Build project management for the dev team including priorities and tasks. Build out timelines and budgets for the nontech founder to understand the dev process including training them on very basic tech stuff so that they can understand just how unexpected and potentially devastating debugging set backs can be so they arent promising early delivery to customers.  One more thing I want to point out for you because they have been instrumental to me in the past I have brought each of my startups through the Communitech Hub in Waterloo Ontario or the Velocity Garage in Waterloo also. These guys are killing it Thalmic Labs BufferBox MappedIn and a ton of other big names. They offer sales legal tech talent recruiting marketing general business plan building gurus for all startups they offer space in the hub the normal things like printing receptionists professional looking meeting rooms etc and a very unique environment where all the startups and mentors are constantly checking up and helping everyone else in the Hub. And they actually dont take any equity from anyone. Instead they go to the government and get a government grant. They then managed to get a couple of really successful startups launched out of the hub. Now they boast that for every  of government funding that they receive they create  in the economy  through jobs sales etc. Including paying back something like  to the government in various sales and income taxes from it. So now it is in the governments best interest to continuously fund the hub. This year the Ontario government announced a  Million investment for the Hub which could tap out at  Million  Feel free to PM me if you have anymore questions,startups,cmpjcea,9,t5_2qh26

2612733,0,t1_cmzkdo7,gt It seems to me that you are saying small customers are important because they could turn into bigger customers. In which case the goal is still to get larger customers...I threw that analogy in there but really meant to showcase that you cannot determine lifetime value upon initial glance or current experience.It may be the case that your customers never become big customers or may even stop being your customer later on.Even in those cases word of mouth is still very valuable. Reviews and testimonials can greatly sway a potential customers buying decision and knowing that those three star reviews could have been mostly five stars but you focused on getting big fish instead will do more harm than good.Id rather have  people that are die hard fans of my product and will vouch for me online than  customers that are paying more than all of them combined. Should these big customers take their business elsewhere I would immediately feel the pinch in a very bad way.Instead of thinking about who is a big customer or who is a small customer its better to quantify and bank on your satisfied customers because they will be as loyal to you as you have been to them.,startups,cmzmdi0,1,t5_2qh26

2756911,0,t1_cnhafgu,Hey glad you found it helpful. Keep in mind that I dont know the specifics of your operating conditions so my post was necessarily generic. Its possible that if youre in a particularly affordable area in terms of rent you could start out with less than that. If you can get into a space thats prefurnished that could also cut down on your start up costs.But startup costs really take people by surprise in most every industry and the restaurant business is particularly brutal because theres normally such a large upfront investment and long tail before profitability hits. Heres pretty much what you need to be on a truly solid financial foundation Rent for three months. Employee pay for three months. Projected utility cost for three months. Funds to furnish your kitchen with the proper appliances or cash for three months of appliance rentals. Check the prices for a fairly standard range of commercial dishwashers and youll see how this can add up in a hurry. All of the required permits for your area. If you want a liquor license this is typically a several thousand dollar cost for a restaurant.  Enough in the bank that you can live for  months without making much if anything. Food costs for the restaurant for a month. A rainy day fund for all the things that will break go wrong and otherwise turn into a disaster.So it may or may not be K but its going to be a very real amount of money and its going to be tough to get a bank to front it to you unless you have someone underwriting the loan that has a pretty impressive credit situation. Additionally the lending terms of such a loan would likely be pretty onerous. I dont say any of this to discourage you I just think its important to go in with eyes wide open.Something I think you should consider is opening a popup restaurant before having your first go at it be in a major commercial venture. This will give you an opportunity to test ideas work with your partner in a real environment and see what the response is to your foodserviceconcept. It will also let you see how open you are to the lifestyle of a working restaurant owner and chef. The work is surprisingly physical as Im sure your chef friend will tell you. Just the simple act of spending most of eight hours standing and moving can take a lot out of you.Popups are a great entrylevel look at the life of a restaurant owner and its probably the easiest way to get started in the field cheaply. Run your popup for a day and see how it feels. Then the next month see if you can run it for a week and fill the room each night. From there youll actually have a tiny amount of data that you can use to start building realistic projections and show to angry spreadsheet obsessed bankers.,startups,cnhg6wc,2,t5_2qh26

I saw it below on some creative pieces...it needs to be at the top of your page...in the header.  Be cautious how you use your brand name. Some of the wordplay gets too cute and takes away from your brandproduct name. ie.Axess the Video!  I feel like the design is all over the place. Theres too much going on for a landing page. Id like to see a header a hero your sign up form a video about the product and thats pretty much it. If you cant live without the content I would suggest adding a couple of pages.  The color scheme is too bland for my liking. I want something bold or warm feeling. I want to be able to smell the wallets through the design...if that makes any sense. In general...everything feels too washed out.  Try using a better font...the current font is tough to read...especially the headline against the background Handmade wallets that fits seamlessly in your front pocket.  The content on the page needs some work. Why is your wallet differentbetter than others? Sell me on the concept of a front wallet I have one...I love them. but tell me why having a wallet you can put in a front pocket is better than a traditional wallet. I dont really care about the vegetable tanned leather...thats not going to get me to enter my email address...a wallet that blocks RFIDs and isnt a literal pain in my ass will.

I think the company even subsidizes a part of it. This model seems to work because they can do all of this stuff onsite in the company parking lot. I park my car by their setup they send me an email when its all done. I go pay  pickup my car around lunch or when Im ready to go home for the day.I think this model can work and exists but the choice locations are probably already spoken for.You can see their terrible website here Under your model realize that an oil change will be somewhere around  imagine the time it would take for you to take it to a nearby shop the liability of driving someone elses car expensive insurance coverage and the potential issues that can happen with you as the middleman. How much can you really charge per oil change to make some money off of this?This seems like a nightmare to me and your margins for something like this would be razor thin and not scalable. Not saying its a bad idea but under your current model it doesnt seem like it will work.There is certainly demand for it people wanting to take care of their cars in an easier way but the way you have it laid out wont disrupt the status quo.,startups,cnyrbt4,2,t5_2qh26

2951792,0,t3_2tyv3v,I like the idea I had a similar one a few weeks ago but the business model I thought would work better was a iTunesish one where individuals could purchase titles individually for download or stream rights.I think youre spot on in looking at services like Voped and Brightcove. You do not want to be in the business of developing video streaming technology you want a vendor to do that for you.Youll have enough on your plate just managing content advertising and keeping your website easy to use and up to date.Just to ballpark figures Voped listed their entry level package at  with GB of data. Thats about . per GB down. So if you want to ballpark the infrastructure cost of a single movie view HD movies stream at about GB  hour.Assuming Vopeds pricing doesnt improve as you scale up and that your indie movies tend to be short  hour flicks youre paying about a . every time someone streams from your site.Sounds really dangerous in a subscriptionbased model IMO.In paytoplay models you could charge something like . for a rental stream and . to download and purchase. Or alternatively let the movie provider set the price themselves and add on a flat . service fee to whatever price they set or you could even scale the . based on the size of the videostream.In order to make subscriptions work youd have to figure out what your average bandwidth per user would be multiply that by your bandwidth cost and then tack on something on top to cover your overhead and desired profit margin. Its a lot simpler in my mind just to set up a price structure that puts money in your bank every time you stream rather than having a model where you have incentive to make your users stream as little as possible.,startups,co3ms6w,2,t5_2qh26

3064006,0,t3_2v4uch,Hi I think the web development industry is too saturated which means you need to do things that others dont. Most companies just make a website buy ads and expect to get a lot of people to contract their services. As your finding out customer dont usually come to you you have to find them. How can you set your self apart from those companies? I believe will be by having a good relationship with the customer. How can you have this? I think you need to have each sales personbusiness analyst find your clients build a relationship with them and they in turn will continue to come to you as well as refer you to other prospect customers. One thing I have found about a lot of web development companies out there is that they get a customer get an idea of what they want build it and ask for the pay. Another problem is not having someone in person to communicate with them about their vision of the website this leads to misscommunication. Whats your sales process? how do you go about building the initial scope doc? requirements doc?

3212204,0,t3_2wvqau,I am a developer and I usually jump in and build websites whenever I have an idea that I think is killer. Or someone says they have an idea and need my help Heres the issue . No one cares. . Generating traffic is not easy. And I keep finding ways to spend more money to either promote or improve the service. What I am trying to say is this An idea is definitely worth something. Being able to implement it finding someone to build it is somewhat easy. And you will need to put something in money to get something out. Cant escape that reality. If you feel your idea is really that good youll have to find a way. Learn to code if you have to.But before you do that realize that THE hardest part is marketing. Your idea may not even be marketable. In which case most people will tell you its not even worth building. So if I were you the first thing Id do is find out if anyone needs the thing you are trying to build. It wont be easy. But if you can figure that out and promote your service even before it is built you will be successful. I know that sounds counter intuitive But all you need is a single web page that says what it is you will be offering and ask people to sign up for updates if they are interested. Im not saying people are interested in freely giving you their email addresses. But if you have something that people genuinely needwant it will make a big difference. my  cents.EDIT I should have been clearer  Im not saying creating a web page and collecting emails is the priority. Im simply saying make sure it is worth spending resources on by getting solid feedback before spending on building anything. If you already know how to put things together with little to no cost obviously its a no brainer  build yourself a prototype. But since you cant first use the skills that you DO have marketing and then build on that success  you definitely have a better chance in my opinion than a lot of developers who know to code but have a hard time marketing. ,startups,couy1lx,3,t5_2qh26

For those out there who may have given up following tech sometime back in the late s  Think of BZOO as the lovechild of AOL Instant Messenger AIM and your modern day smartphone with a healthy dose of powerful steroids.

Weve been busy framing designing and developing BZOO and we still have a ton of work to do. In the meantime weve taken great care to make sure everything is currently right . Today the app is performing beyond our wildest expectations. This week weve decided to open up registration for up to  new members. Once our quota is met we will then pause temporarily to analyze the BZOO platform.

Eg a simple app to take voice notes on the go could be used to study and discuss the changing societal trends due to the fast pace of life and the affect of technology on them you get the flow.

With a quick precursory look here are a few points that stand out and I am being super nitpickyHome Page What you do is not immediately apparent to me. You need a concise statement about what ScholarCheck is and what it does does. Then you can go into your available features over  registered institutions etc. Consise should be spelled concise. What does Welldocumented with realworld examples mean? Without context I am not sure what this is referring to. Are there images of what the validation actually looks like? Screenshots? What is the customer getting if they pay you monthly? A dashboard? Just a simple landing page with yes theyre a student or no theyre not? This needs to be illustrated more clearly to drive your value statement. Also where are the institutions based? The US? Europe? Everywhere? Because a lot of the emails that I saw flashing across the screen seemed to be based in Europe. Make sure that you make your target market clear.  Easy API Integration Page Add a period at the end of the sentence to be consistent with the other elements on your site. Features Page Validate students emails... should be Validate students emails.... Fetch the institution name... might be better worded as Retrieve institution names directly from students emails. The F in Userfriendly should be capitalized to UserFriendly. Include a dash in the user friendly phrase in the subtext to be consistent with the title.Contact Us Page Can you make the email icon clickable so that potential customers can just click the icon to have an email written?

There are tons of great reasons for working in the space but financial upside isnt one of them. There are two reasons for this.  There is no equity in a nonprofit. They couldnt give you ownership even if they wanted to. The way the laws are written is that there is no stock or shares. So lets say you are on the founding team of something that becomes the next United Way or Salvation Army. You own nothing besides your skillset and experience that you could ever sell to anyone that reflects the massive delta in value between when you started the project and after it realized its potential.   The board decides compensation for all team members and likely has to constantly justify that compensation to grant sources and definately has to justify it to the IRS. As a result what you earn will constantly be measured against market value of your skillset rather than when you started.

3686023,0,t3_32kcam,I have worked for  different start ups in my career. Usually starting with about  to  employees and some start up capital. Your experience I would say is absolutely normal. What you need to keep in mind is that start ups have limited money and aggressive schedules that they must meet in order to be successful. This is amplified  when the capital is VC funded since there is always the threat of loss of funding if delays unexpected costs or shifts in the market occur. Amplify this stress again for a start up that does not have an initial product on the market since the only capital available is VC.What you see is a company that is being unreasonable asking for immediate action and not giving you the time that you need to think about your other options. What the company sees is the need to have someone that can fill an immediate need. Every day that you delay is a day they lose on their schedule it is time they could have had to find an alternate candidate and it calls into question whether you can be passionate about what they do. The company is probably moving at the only pace they know so that is not a major red flag for me. The major red flag that I see is are you sure you want to work in this kind of high stress fast paced uncertain environment. For a company that does not have a product on the market and an uncertain path to generating revenue you dont have details on when the product will launch I would expect some reasonable stock option plan or profit sharing model. This is the typical trade off for signing your personal life away for the success of a startup company.  GOOD LUCK!,startups,cqcfj5q,2,t5_2qh26

3806117,0,t3_340ns6,If you have some developer skills leverage that for the first version. You can hire someone to clean it up later just give them the power to rewrite your shit because it will be shit.Prune your idea down to the bare minimum of features  the oftmentioned MVP. Anything extra goes into a list of nicetohaves. Your first customer will provide you with plenty more you wont have thought of so dont burden yourself with more technical debt than you need right now. As I mentioned above the first version wont be the best quality so it will probably be needing a rewrite anyway.That said make the best possible version you can deliver. Maybe the code wont look great but it should be thoroughly tested.Once you have the MVP mapped out i.e. what is promised to the pilot customer nothing more nothing less then break the project down into reasonable milestones for each discrete feature. For example loginsignup add one thing search all the things editdelete a thing. Test each step  not just you but your partner and your mother and your dog if necessary. And make sure you test your target platforms your customer uses IE? Then prioritize that over latest IPhone. And for the sake of all that is holy use a bug tracker and version control from day . When youre far enough along get a deployment set up on Azure or Heroku or whatever and make sure your deployment process just works.Use off the shelf components and techniques as much as you can. e.g. if your idea isnt heavily designdependent then just use Twitter Bootstrap and tweak some colors or use a theme instead of pissing around with CSS. Dont get fancy or distracted. For example for a .NET app use SQLServer instead of MongoDB or Cassandra. Finally pace yourself. Dont burn out working too many hours. Set aside a certain number of hours a day and set a target of what you want to achieve at the end of that day. Despite a lot of bullshit you hear about startup hours a smallandsteady approach will get a lot more done than you think.EDIT I once worked for a couple of guys who bootstrapped their company and wrote the first version themselves despite not being coders. The code could induce vomit in strongest of developers but they got the company off the ground to profitability on their own.,startups,cqq4lni,43,t5_2qh26

4066496,0,t1_crjbij7,I like the idea of projects. My best times in college was getting graded and evaluated in making my own experiments. I learned so much more on my own. But the issue is that the education system wants a way to track how much you learned. I have an extensive knowledge in computer hardware chemistry and physics but my majors was Biology and Psychology. I cant demonstrate any of my abilities without have to go through standardized tests and that to me ends up just wasting my time and money.In addition projects are expensive! materials safety and legal issues can follow so funding from places like the government needs to be something thats always there for us.,startups,crjt50y,1,t5_2qh26
4070561,0,t1_crk6v00,So the voucher and incentive argument in my opinion isnt one structured to improve education its one built to bust unions and major opposition to a specific political party. Its obvious that is the underlying concern and it really aggravates me that politicians would be so selfserving. That being said I do agree with you that the whole system is structured incorrectly. I dont know that competition per se is de facto the best approach. While competition has been shown to create positive returns in areas like sales and marketing it has long been shown that it has detrimental effects in areas of engineering and science which flourish more in collaborative environments which the competition like what we speak of tends to kill.  I dont think enough consideration has been given to this and I think those who have been pushing for voucher programs et al havent given that any thought because they simply dont care as that isnt their real intent anyway. ,startups,crk9s86,1,t5_2qh26

Its compiled into an executable for you and you just click it and... Voila.HTML CSS and JavaScript essentially work together as different layers of a compiled web application. HTML provides page divisions and sequestration of individual components. CSS provides styling to these components. JavaScript controls the functionality of these components. You can actually compile a ton of disparate parts of an application many JS CSS and HTML files into a single HTML page that contains an entire application. Though more frequently for the purposes of caching and faster load times well see one HTML page one CSS file and one JS file.

4146838,0,t1_crsxwc5,Im in the UK here so cant really comment on local economic factors in the US. Im nominally in favour of extortionately priced hotels getting some decent competition though to what extent depends on the social cost of doing so.I dont have strong views on Airbnb and I like their website took a look last year but there is inescapably a social impact inherent in people buying properties they do not need. Decreasing the supply of property and increasing the demand pushes up the price which in turn makes it harder for firsttime buyers in an area to purchase a property and longterm residents are pushed out in favour of wealthy newcomers increasingly a topical issue in SF as I understand it.We have a group behaviour dilemma if say the friends of the OP are the only people in their area to purchase for the rental market then only negligible economic distortion will result. However if everyone does it and there are nolimited market controls then property prices will go up and that will have an real effect on people. The complainers on this thread might just be grumpy they are not the ones making the money  who can say?  but they may also just be frustrated that the one property they actually live in is becoming unaffordable.

Their algorithm will also identify  people it thinks is most likely to start a company based on predicted likelihood.

If it is a success you as founder will reap much of the financial rewards and it will be your name on the company.As an employee even if your start up is a big success you will receive a fraction of what the founders receive and people care about employee N way less than they do the people that started the thing.Plus from the other comments you seem pretty insistent on remote work. It is not impossible but companies that allow fulltime remote work are few and far between at any stage in the company life cycle. If you are in charge however you get to decide where and when you work.Start your own thing.

It seems like the fields are too big.  Page  should have more degree options.  It isnt clear to me what someone with an MBA or JD should choose.  Or both.  How much work experience you have is a weird question.  What do you count?  Relevant work experience?  All work in your life?  Part time?  Work in your intended field or degree?  Maybe specify something there.  How much work experience in your field of study or in your prospective field might be better.  Your industry selections are somewhat restrictive.  I know you cant just have infinite tick boxes but even off the top of my head youre missing some major industriesfields of work.   If you log out on the third page during the survey thing it doesnt let you complete your profile when logging back in works fine if you exit on the nd page.   Not totally convinced on the value of Zyn credits.  Have to click a button to see what theyre about.  A little skeptical about the ultimate setup of the site.  Rather than being collaborative between employers and job seekers it seems to me that its mostly crowdsourcing granular company ratings and matching the ratings to individuals it might be work but I suppose I expected more collaboration between your site and the employers I expected an employer portal of sorts.  I think this will hold you back to some degree.  a employers might not want to be defined by former employees as places to work particularly potentially anonymously and b it may inhibit your ability to have a robust list of places to work particularly for smaller companies.

And before you actually do make sure you go to the market and see if people want this and if theyre willing to pay for it. Just reach out to people and ask about how they usually consume articles. Then just listen to them. Listen very carefully what they say. Pay attention what words they use. What emotional phrases you can hear them using. I think this step is by far most absent in so many entrepreneurs approaches. Id pay for this kind of service. I actually have paid. Ive used a VA to go through longass articles and just to give the most important  takeaways from the article during busy weeks. I was thinking of using similar approach for insanely long  hrs podcasts. But what aboutThinking isnt there XYZ who already does this isnt useful at all.

As a potential users Id want to scroll through a list of currently listed spaces and get an idea of what the cost is what the actual spaces are like and a little bit of a feel for who the hosts are.For testing purposes this can be FPO content but it needs to be there. Give the user a way to passively click around the site and get some type of value for spending time here.A featured hosts section would be good too.

Thats pretty messed up.Anyway I LOVE the concept. It has nearlimitless utility. My friend has been doing something similar with cryptocurrency microtransactions but he focused on social media influencing. Facebook likes retweets youtube views etc.But my question to you is are you holding onto any bitcoin? When people exchange coins for tokens are you immediately converting it to more stable currency? Because even with the Grecian crisis presenting an obvious need for it bitcoin is still very volatile. So if someone buys tokens from you and you hold onto the coins and they plummet in value youre losing a good amount of money when users redeem their tokens.EDIT are you planning on phasing in higherticket items once youre able to gain traction develop trust and provide a feedback system?

Once the site launches the token can be openly traded on exchanges and its value will be variable depending on demand.

All you have to do for now is keep all your business money in one exclusive account.   Go hit up the credit union nearby and open a business account.

But right now you have a recipe on a postit note that you think is original think is going to taste good and you think people would want to eat it but you dont even know where to buy the ingredients let alone how to cook let alone how to run a restaurant.Ill go ahead and tell you what isnt going to work that a lot of people try. You arent going to find developers and designers that want to work for equity in your idea. Since youre young its also a safe assumption that you cant afford to pay someone to build this for you.That isnt a problem. If you believe in this idea and youre committed you can do this. You have access to a resource a lot of us dont which is free time. You can use that time to learn to develop well enough to put together a prototype. Once you have something to show off theres the potential to get funded or to turn it into a real product yourself and just go after customers.One final overarching thing to keep in mind is that the best ideas fail all the time even with good execution. If youre actively interested in doing something like this for a livingthat is software development running your own business et ceterathe time you put into these skills is going to be time well spent for the rest of your life.

I had to quit for my health.Talk to him. Dont make it a stressful mad boss scorching a bad employee situation have a good hearttoheart instead. Figure out where both of you stand. He probably has a place in your company but not the one hes currently filling.And keep in mind when you set out to hire a senior they can be far less manageable than inexperienced juniors. A bad senior will create serious damage that usually means a complete rewrite of the software after she has moved on.

4965684,0,t3_3ivy5y,From what youve written here it sounds like there are  issues. You gave this person cofounder status too quickly without knowing them well enough.. You arent managing expectations yours and your cofoundersThese personal situations are always complex and Im sure it would take a book of details to do be able to get to the root issue. Given what youve mentioned here I get the sense that theres a big expectations gap between you and your cofounder.You need to confront this immediately and headon by having a completely candid conversation to get both of you on the same page. Weve had several of these conversations within our startup. Theyre a sign of a healthy cofounder relationship. A few thoughts on how you can approach it Spend your time listening rather than lecturing. You probably dont really know whats going on and you need to hear your cofounders side of things first before deciding on a course of action. Consider everything you wrote in this reddit post. Would you feel comfortable if your cofounder saw it? No? Then you havent communicated clearly with them. They need to understand your perspectives so they know where they stand and the person they are about to get into a  year business marriage with. Focus on outcomes rather than hours worked. Are those networking events really important? What outcome do they drive that you expect your cofounder to be responsible for? If they are important does your cofounder know you think theyre important and that by her not attending them its leading to bad outcomes? Take your cofounders perspective.Your entire post is an indictment of your cofounder. no concept of working outside  She refuses she constantly needs to be told what to do.  Consider how you devilsavocado could have caused this situation.Overall I do empathize with you. Its a big blow when you have this burning drive which you thought you saw in someone else and it turns out they may not have it. But keep in mind either that person is one of the worlds most clever actors who overtly deceived you or more likely your instincts arent good enough yet to distinguish between cofounders and employees.After everything is clear on both sides consider the best outcome for both of you. The best outcome may be that she is no longer a part of the venture. Pay her fairly for the contributions she has made so far and end the cofounder relationship. Shes been working for you unpaid for several months and deserves compensation.From here the best you can do is suck it up and level up those communications management and appraisal skills so you dont burn yourself as badly the next time.,startups,cukgogk,9,t5_2qh26

5051481,0,t3_3k2uv0,These are my experiences.  It took quite some time for the first picture to load even on my very high speed internet connection. If I didnt have the goal of looking at the site for you I would have gone back to my search or just immediately left the site.  I had the page scrolled halfway down so only half of the picture was visible and as the picture transitioned to the next image the page autoreset me to the top so that the whole picture was visible. This happened three times but now I cannot recreate the issue so perhaps this is not a problem?  My German is not what it once was but it looks like the My Family History page is a kind of case study using yourself as the subject. Maybe make this more obvious? Or possibly offer more case studies so people can see the type of information you can discover? On the pricing page it says ... you are willing to TO spend... You may want to offer an uberpackage something like I will follow your familys history for as long as the data exists and all for the low price of k.  I know that a lot of people on riwantout would be interested in this but only as it relates to determining if they are eligible for German citizenship. It may be worth creating a package for that too or offering that as a separate service.  In general its easy to navigate easy to understand pretty basic site.

My proposal is very different in that it focuses solely on milestones. Like I said in another comment users would have the ability to group similar milestones together for example achieve X sales where the value of X could then be plotted on a graphed alongside the date achieved.

5101613,0,t3_3krpus,Heres something to consider people who have raised VC funding previously are far less likely to need whatever EV other than money VCs can potentially bring with them. Someone whos raised money already probably has a great network. Someone whos raised money already probably knows what heshe is doing. Someone whos raised money already has established a track record of credibility. And so theyre in a position where they can say they dont wantneed what VCs have to offer.And so a better question would be do VCs offer resources that are invaluable to startups who lack them? And the answer is definitely yes.Should you look for great advisors to help you out? Absolutely. But dont count on getting any that have more to offer in the way of networks than a VC.

The next step is to validate the problem and solution. That is your goal is to find real customers who a have that problem and b are willing to pay for your solution. You want to know that there is a market for this product before you invest a lot of time and money in building it. Or to put it another way if you cant find ten people who say theyll buy it your company is bullshit The general process is known as customer validation see The Four Steps to the Epiphany and it typically involves showing potential customers a Minimum Viable Product see The Lean Startup or MVP.

Those marketing and growth plans will be viable up until this point which is usually a few weeks after MVP launch. then he will probably target newdifferent markets and need to rethink all the above. . agreed but when he has no experience an idea and some marketing skills it seems to make a lot of sense if you want to bring on a strong programmer.,startups,cvi3zgb,1,t5_2qh26

5364122,0,t3_3oh3ri,gt If we gave you  worth of Clef stock today you would have to pay thousands of dollars in taxes this year. If we give you options for  worth of stock you dont have to pay any taxes until you exercise them more on exercising later.This is a bit misleading.  If you give somebody k in stock youve given them something worth k.  If youve given somebody k in stock options youve given them something with a book value of way less than k.  I think it is also bad marketing to think of stock options as money for an early stage startup.  The stock is so illiquid there is just no point in caring about whatever the stocks value is.  Options should be talked about as percentages in the company until people are regularly getting liquidity for shares at which point the company is very big and your CFO will deal with it.Also Id recommend not reinventing the wheel when it comes to explaining stock options. Put the Clef specific stuff and then link to An introduction to stock options for the tech entrepreneur or startup employee  I think your guide is pretty good as far as these types of primers go but just stick with a legally vetted impartial source that will cover most of the basics.  In fact you might want to link to specific sections of that guide where it applies to your company.Im not in love with your salary structure though its a complicated problem.  But kind of like mandatory sentencing you are taking away your power as founders to use your best judgement.  What if there is an ultra awesome developer who wants to join but theyd want . and a full salary?  Are they going to have to wait for  more employees to be hired before you might consider that?  I think a rubric as a guideline is fine but you shouldnt be so rigid about everything to give yourself the freedom to make good decisions.  Youve got to be able to trust yourself.Make sure there is a purpose to this.  Every second you spend working on these guidelines is time you arent spending improving your product.  Every company is not the same and perhaps this helps with recruiting but when your company is  founders and  employees you probably shouldnt be having too many issues with this kind of stuff.  When you start getting to  employees the value of this goes way up and certainly it is great to have a solid foundation like youve built here but dont go nuts with it.  There are tons and tons of well designed companies with noble goals for employee happiness and fairness that dont succeed because they never create a product that people pay money for.,startups,cvxbshy,11,t5_2qh26

These tools are a mosthave for products and services that are hightouch and require a sales team to close. Theyll organize and send email and coordinate updates to a CRM system like Salesforce Not sure if they have social media capabilities yet. One would hope. Most organizations using marketing automation software will also use a tracking software to accompany it  theres no substitute for know what your users are doing or not in your app!

Today I have driven around in Palo Alto and seen first hand how a self driving car not only is possible  but can solve a lot of transportation and safety issues that are present today.I think remote surgery is just one of the ways that we can start to address improving access to surgery around the world.Of course this will rely heavily on other technologies  like you mention the stability of a good internet connection for example.  Do I think that remote surgery works today  probably not. Do I think it has the potential to work in the future  yes with the caveat that a lot of other technologies will need to line up to provide this service.I believe that eventually technology will progress to the point where it can support a lot of applications in medicine.  What I wonder about is whether the applications themselves are really answering the right questions.For example  what is better remote surgery using robotics or better training of surgeons around the world so that they can perform the surgeries themselves?  Should we focus less on surgeons and think about tasksharing getting nonsurgeons to start performing procedures.

5609556,0,t1_cwsd40j,I would frame any conversations on a  year timeframe. This is how long minimum you are looking at to get to a stage where the company is successful enough that your job as a founder will be done.In this light three months isnt a huge length of time. And remember Fairness and the perception of fairness is much more valuable than owning a large stake.Everyone needs to buy into the above sentence . For example if you would have originally split the equity equally five ways but for some reason decide that months worth of work is worth repaying in equity and go   . x  what does this really achieve? The working founder now owns . more of something worth precisely  than the others but you already have power dynamics that are unhelpful to the company longterm.Say you make it big and in  years exit for m you will have all sold down the initial equity to  of the total meaning this difference in equity is further diluted and the month founder will come away with a little more cash than everyone else. But I would wager hisher possible future financial reward is fully outweighed by the negative consequences of a perceived unfair equity split which has a real chance of sinking your company by destroying cofounder relationships.Pay the working founders for their time with money not equityIn terms of you providing cash  this should be injected into the company as per any other money. By agreeing on a valuation with outside parties and you investing for a percentage at that valuation.Say you get everything set up and running and you need some operating capital k to pay two founders to work fulltime. You consult externally and find an interested investor who agrees the company is worth k on the work youve done so far.You have some money in a savings account and you and the external investor each put up k to invest. Postmoney the company is now worth m and the investors you and the external get  each. You now own your founder equity original percentage of the remaining  plus  as an investor. These shares may be different classes when it comes to voting rights or dilution etc.Dont give yourself founding equity in exchange for putting up cashDisclaimer Just one guy on the internets opinion.Fire more questions if you have them.,startups,cwsf4g9,2,t5_2qh26

The good thing is that Omnifocus  is the premier Getting Things Done style app and it has some major glaring weaknesses. . No crossplatform support.  e.g. I cant view my projects on windows and I cant create tasks in windows without using a workaround. . Cant sort by time like you are talking about.

6084687,0,t3_3yv53v,I used to do PR and Marketing for a startup and managed to get regular worldwide coverage of our products. Theyve been in most of the worlds top newspapers and have appeared on TV on shows like Good Morning America and BBC News. We never spent a penny other than my time achieving this.You probably dont want to hear this but there arent really any tips or tricks to getting in the media. Well there are some tips but I can assure you there arent any tricks  its hard to trick a journo. Below Ill summarise the main points.. This might sound obvious but the best way to get in the media is to build something incredible. Do you ever stumble across a product and say to yourself I have no need for that product but what a fantastic service!? Build something like that.. If your idea is new sounds like it it may be that you need to prove how good it is. Id spend  of my time building the product getting customers and making them happy. Then you can say this is my startup weve managed to help  people pay off xxx from their student loans... This will make people take more notice of you.. Follow on from the above point. Just spend all your time building. The strongest form of marketing is word of mouth. I can guarantee that if you start doing something amazing and people begin talking about it online and then the media will soon find out.. Are you targeting the right people? Make sure that the bloggers and journalists youre contacting actually write in the space youre operating in. I also had great success targeting junior journos and newish bloggers. These folk are crying out for their big break and will appreciate you going to them. They will take the story to their manager with lots of enthusiasm.. In terms of actually contacting them I like to give them a tweet asking if I can send them an email with more info. Theyll look at your profile probably click the link to your site if you didnt include it in the tweet and either not respond or tweet you back. That way you dont waste your time writing a large email that will just get ignored or stuck in the spam folder as theyll be expecting it.. Dont blanket contact people  especially in the same organisation. Colleagues talk to one another and if they find out theyve all been contacted they wont like it. These people thrive on exclusivity  they want to be the first to break the story. Just contact one person.. You should aim to foster relationships with no more than  people in the media. This is after youve had some success of course. Every time that you have something newsworthy you can just send them a quick email about it. They wont ignore the email if theyve had success writing about you before. It only takes one story in a decent publication for all the other media sites to want to write about it too. . Dont do any PR stunts. Complete waste of time and money especially in the early days.I could talk about this subject for days but I feel the above are the main points. Good luck!,startups,cyh6l0r,3,t5_2qh26

6098840,0,t1_cyitlqj,gt Whats to stop the artist doing a k IPO and then stopping making commercial music? Or maybe just release a couple of tracks?My thought is that a lot of those details are going to be variable and worked into the contract. So if the artist isnt continuing his music career there is the clause to get money back to the shareholders. That being said the kind of artists were attracting are those ready to sign to a major label with a substantial fan base. I think that quitting music entirely over a small lump sum would be incredibly short sighted and they likely wouldnt have gotten far enough in their career to even be considered by Svrf with that mentality.gt Also who owns the IP in the music? Royalties synch mech etc?The artist owns all their recordingsgt And finally  why would an artist sign up with you? They are signing away X of future earnings for an IPO but unless you can actually help them grow their career then noone makes a profit.Why choose your company over something like Patreon or a real record deal? The larger indie labels offer some very favourable deals these days unlike the system back in the ss.So like I said earlier one of my most difficult things about describing this to people is explaining that it is not like gofundme or any crowdsourcing platform. As an artist youre not simply asking for money to make your career happen youre offering fans a chance to be part of your career.As an artist youre more likely to sign with us because we offer far less of a stronghold on your creativity and we also  arent interested in owning your recordings which is huge. That being said you raise a great point and one Ive considered as well. Would it be possible to offer services to better the artists career as well? Could we offer label managment services of any kind? Maybe so Id love to look into it.Thanks for the questions man I would love to hear what you think of this too,startups,cyivjji,1,t5_2qh26

They give  of sales to the sales force.Pro They are able to sell a LOT because theyre in these peoples faces.Cons Sales make promises of things at times which are no what we even offerWith  commissions going out we arent left with much to actually be able to help these clients as other companies would be able to.Ridiculous politics with the heads of the sales forces. Sometimes Im left wondering if our business is sales or marketing. If I ever try to make changes to any processes I have to pass it by the sales force to see if its ok because regardless of if the services are helping clients or not its about what will sell.

6155318,0,t3_3zsst0,As someone who works for an ISP this is going to cause the people who rent out their wifi all manner of problems.If you are paying someone to use their wifi so either the customer or your company pays the owners then they are reselling it. If they were just unlocking the wifi for anyone within range to use then that is different and pretty stupid for the following reason.The main issue is liability for copyright etc material or criminal activity using the network. Lets say Joe Bloggs signs up to rent out his wifi. Someone then pays him for access and downloads a movie. Joes ISP then gets a letter from Movie company and gives them the details of the owner of that service. Not the person who downloaded it but the owner of that service. Who is responsible for that service. Or someone goes online using Joes wifi and buys a load of drugs? Even if Joe proves it was not him he is where they will look and thats bad news. As an example from the TampCs where I work Our Use Policy requires that no element of any of the Services we provide shall be used by you or any user of your services...So you as the person who signed up are responsible for all the activity on that network. ,startups,cypamwx,1,t5_2qh26

It isnt something to obsess over in terms of tracking how you rank for a keyword weektoweek but you do want to make sure your site is being indexed and that webmaster tools list of keywords for your site show high relevance for targeted keywords.If your SEO is good it means most likely you have a site packed with good information relevant to your industryproblem. That makes it not only more attractive to spiders but also to human readers.SEO is great because it is relatively cheap man hoursopportunity cost whereas a lot of your marketing avenues are going to cost a decent chunk or require intense amounts of time building relationships. Once you are visible and producing good content youll find your organic marketing shoots up dramatically.Case in point as a newcomer to our industry were struggling to be considered when our more famous competitors are compared and mentioned. We produced some highly relevant content aimed at our customers this year that was relevant to the whole industry. As a result a lot of those competitor comparisons also refer to that article getting us a link and mention in discussions about our industry we normally wouldnt have access to muscle in on.Without good SEO that content sits on our site unread.,startups,cz55iq2,1,t5_2qh26

Your k investment translates to  of the company.Its relatively easy to agree on what your discount is worth. What is the valuation of the company at the idea stage? No one knows and it doesnt really matter. This is a number negotiated between the owner and a company and an investor in this case you. As long as you both agree on the number thats what its going to be.Note that ownership only converts into money only if the company is sold or IPOs which are very rare in the best of times. It means that the company could be wildly profitable but as long as its not sold your  ownership will be worth .For that reason you might consider some other way of repaying e.g. if the company is profitable it pays you some percentage of profit up to x ROI i.e. up to k.

7326649,0,t3_4fp1wx,In most cases its better to start with a product and a hypothesis of what problem it solves.Why?If you start with a problem you will significantly constrain opportunities. In other words the space of problems that you currently understand is very small compared to the space of problems you could stumble upon by talking to people from various industries usually by showing them a prototype of something youve built.Case in point we built this IoT device and we thought we were going to sell it to Industry X but by talking to reps from over  industries we discovered that Industry Y would actually benefit from it most. There is no way we couldve thought of Industry Ys problems from the outset and we wouldnt have gotten there without showing them the prototype.The only exception to this rule is if you absolutely know  from personal experience  of a problem in a highly regulated industry e.g. law enforcement or a very difficult problem to solve e.g. selfpiloting cars and you somehow have a strategy to overcome that barrier where others have failed.,startups,d2azna4,2,t5_2qh26

Im a  year attorney and I regularly get hired for this which let me tell you is damn rare. There are so many facets to effective negotiation. Lots of it is emotional intelligence and experience which cant be acquired quickly. What you can do to get better in a hurry is research and prepare. Do the math research and develop counter arguments summarize your position in writing especially when you think the other side wont take it that seriously. To prepare your mindset I have two really helpful recommendations. First play poker. Poker teaches you to imagine others positions make decisions and display calculated behavior based on those decisions all with very incomplete information. Those are all hugely important negotiation skills. Second on that emotional intelligence front read a book called just listen by Mark Goulston. The secret to convincing anyone of anything is to really listen to them and make them know they are being heard. That sounds manipulative but its not. Its impossible to fake real listening. Its impossible to make someone feel heard unless you really hear them. Youll be amazed at how much easier it becomes too negotiate solutions when you are really listening.

Leandomainsearch is a generator I am a human that does have lot more experience than most of these domain generators have been code  compiled before they probably did not even exist.  What I do is I listen to client all cases are different  some want to rebrand. Some have budget of K to spend on domain and some have   so its a game of metrics as to what kind of domain they are after. What I do after that is Check what I have for them from my personal repository  second I verify that domain sounds good has good links bad links social networking stuff still exists etc.. So for someone that might take a long time for me it takes bit less than an hour depending on what type of research i do I have my own custom built software that does what I do best and I update it regularly.

And a maturity date is set usually  months at which point the individual can buy said options. Or not buy said options. The point of this is that if the company grows as they project the individual in question will profit quite a bit provided heshe has the capital to pay for the options and the ensuing tax burden. And if the company actually decreases in value the individual may choose not to exercise said options.,startups,d3snyws,1,t5_2qh26

A lot of these startups are founded by members of the industry as you noticed and they have to deal daily with freigth costs or healthcare APIs. Plus incidentially they have the knowledge to build applications or know someone who does AND have the guts to start their own company. Which as mentioned above is best when it solves problems that can be quantitized using this will help you  a year. And then of course you have companies that are just doing new things and then sell the solution to everyone like Uber. For this to work you need a solid ego and really solid salesmanship.As a student looking into the future ask yourself what made me work in this field whats my interest? Do you want to solve problems? There is an infinite number of problems available in computer science alone you wouldnt need to be an expert on another field. Google found and improved upon information organization a topic that  years before hardly existed.If you want to be rich quickly well thats another question and unlikey to happen.

8056959,0,t1_d4llrlf,Just to chime in here users are notoriously bad at selfidentifying how much they are or are not willing to pay for something. Like its almost worthless to even ask the question. I have seen survey after survey of reallife userbases who either a tell you they will gladly spend money on something when they wont its a lot easier to say youll spend money on something hypothetically than to actually do it and b even if you survey people who likely would spend money they will give you wildly unrealistic values of what theyre willing to spend. Meaning they will tell you they would only pay  for it when you could realistically charge  and they would indeed pay it or they say they would buy it for s of dollars and none of them actually would.Unfortunately pricing a product is one of those things that its really really hard to get right based on user feedback. You have to look at what else is out there that sets anchor points which create predefined expectations which you might have to basically accept because its hard to counter them or if it really is a new thing then you really just basically have to guess and be willing to experiement. This is hard even in businesstobusiness stuff. Firebase Tokbox Google Stripe...pretty much every single thing our business buys or uses has changed their pricing scheme sometimes drastically in the last  years.And if its hard for businesstobusiness where at least your customers for the most part have money to spend its x worse on the consumer side where people have limited budgets and always want more than they can afford which means they want to keep their money not spend it on your thing unless its really worth it to them.On the other hand users are great about telling you what features they want and you can usually tell the ones they would pay for. So I would absolutely ask what is your mostused feature of this? Why do you use it? What could I do to make it better for you and solve a specific pain point you have? But I wouldnt ask how much will you pay me? because its just pretty much pointless ,startups,d4lof9z,3,t5_2qh26

That being said one of the biggest resources NYC has for startups is. access to good talent. We have a lot of devs here I think the only ppl who would argue against that are the SV people and they are rightbut NYC Is getting there. Investors. Most industry investors are in NYC and SV.  In other words talent and money are here i think that is a motivating factor for growingscaling a business.   Side note as someone who has done a traditional accelerator Id reach out to the mentorsalumni of the accelerator that you are applying to just to get their feedback on what they think.

8165520,0,t3_4r426h,gt OK guys lets hear it. Pick the idea apart. .  It doesnt set out to cater to the majority or near it.  People are somewhat adventurous with food  but theyre fairly monogamous with alcohol.  Even if that relationship is just one season theyll drink repeatedly in the same places until circumstance moves them. . It would take a ton of data in a lot of different places just to keep the app relevant.  Once pockets of old data pile up due to lack of use in that city  people will be upset.  Either that they hat no results or useless information. . Even if you can make it and keep it relevant its impossible to protect.  Once business owners see that a high rating here will impact their bottom line that night theyll hire people like me to move the needle.  Theres too much money to assume people wont go that route. Even with perfectly open data so that the community can protect itself it would be vulnerable.  With anonymous data you dont stand a chance.  .So its a dynamic and creative idea.  But the people who would be needed to support it are neither the same people nor in the same proportion as those who benefit.  The volatility is too severe to keep it in motion without an ungodly investment.  And Even if it were to work out it would be highly susceptible to fraud which would undermine and destroy the app.,startups,d4y8mao,3,t5_2qh26
8182603,0,t1_d507il6,I think in the context of your situation the answer is to never go all in on any of them and to also avoid utilizing all of them.I think the strategy to take in the context of your situation would be to run a cycle of testing each potential channel and then focusing on the one that shows the highest return at the conclusion of that testing period.  Spend four weeks focusing on that one and then begin the cycle again with conducting a new test.  If the test shows the same channel is giving the highest return you continue focusing on it for until the cycle ends.  If the test shows a new channel you focus on that instead until the cycle ends.You can get some great ideas of how to identify strategize and test marketingadtraction channels in this bookwww.tractionbook.comor by doing some google search for validation tests and testing for return on investment in marketing Im sure.,startups,d50diyl,2,t5_2qh26

8227831,0,t1_d55jzq3,A  plan can be risky for both parties. Some clients run out of money and cant pay the last  and some programmers will take the  starting payment and run. I am a flash developer and I usually will break the requirements down into monthly milestones or  sets of feature I can complete in a certain amount of time. I usually like  so  to start. Then two  milestone payments and a  finishing payment. This way its easier to pay rent having it spread out more if they cant pay me a milestone payment I am not out a ton of time and money and can walk away from a job early. As a client you get to see progress being make and can address any concerns before making milestone payments. Also I never give the source code to the client before the last  has been paid but i will send the final product for approval. If your job is k the you should ask them to break it into k milestone payments. If the developer wont do milestone payments then that should be a red flag.,startups,d5619yb,2,t5_2qh26

8285234,0,t1_d5cde7r,Thats very interesting.  I think we may just have a difference of opinion here.  I personally dont subscribe to the tipping point concept for startups.  Ive read several of Malcolm Gladwells books and although I find them interesting I dont think its a good way to run a startup.  The way I see it roads are paved with entrepreneurs that were  convinced that their product or idea would tip...and it didnt.  I see it as a justification to pour a huge amount of time and money into something.  Its very easy as an entrepreneur to get caught by your own idea and be  convinced it will take off and be successful.  To stay awake at night in front of excel and look at all the profits youll make when you have X customers.  Ive been there so many more times than Id like to admit.  I see that talking about tipping points just adds fuel to that fire encouraging people to put good money after bad next years time after this years all on the hope that once enough people understand...well make it.Im not saying tipping points dont exist they totally do.  There are standards that get set ways of doing things that once you have a mass of people that becomes the default.  I feel  of ideas arent like this and for the ones that are  of those have local areas that can tipped individually.  Uber for example you might say requires tipping.  You have to have a population of customers and drivers.  If there arent dozens of drivers and hundreds of customers in a city then the system doesnt work.  But look at how uber launches a city. Hire drivers  hiring bonus pay drivers a hourly minimum hr for working weekend nights . Start with high fare prices that more directly compete with Taxi prices. Market to customers and drivers. Wait for word of mouth marketing and referrals to increase demand. Lower driver pay and customer rates periodically as driver and customer count increasesThis was done city by city.  At which step did they tip?  Step ?  They already had many customers and employees by then.  They have a great plan and executed it well with a large bankroll to pay drivers out of pocket to cover low demand times. I dont think it tipped so much as they pushed it over.  As an entrepreneur I cant risk waiting for an idea to tip.  If I cant see a way to push it over its too risky for me.  ,startups,d5d7og0,1,t5_2qh26

Many companies produce several variants of the same logo that fit all these options. After looking at sizes you also need to consider colors. What backgrounds might your logo appear on? Does your logo look good with both a dark background and a light background? Again multiple variants can be created. When creating variants they must all share the same recognizable features.

8711896,0,t1_d6uiozs,Hi again! So during lunch time I was thinking about what could you do to market your services. First of all I think it is important to state that it does seem there are a lot of people selling explainer videos. When I googled for it I literally found hundreds of companies.Secondly I was recently on Fiverr.com and I remember finding a lot of dudes doing those videos for a really cheap price.In my humble opinion I think the first question you must ask yourself is the following?Can you sell those videos for the cheapest price in the market? Now assuming that you cannot  because you dont have the demand necessary to scale and reduce variable costs  there are only two options on top of the table.. You do not differentiate you sell a standard product and you hope for customers  which I do not recommend.. You find a way to differentiate your offer from the whole red ocean of the short videos market.Ok so you can differentiate your offer in a set of attributes. Customer experience. Pricing. Style of the videos  look amp feel. Being really good in one specific type of video for a tiny niche of people. Business modelI know this might sound complex and yes I think it is kind of overwhelming but lets look at the following example to make it simplerYou could have your website but focus on selling your services through a network of resellers. These resellers would be agencies or other freelancers. You could agree with them that anytime they have a need for an animated video they would hire your company. Naturally you would give them some sort of incentive namely through the price or speed in the delivery.This channel and different business model would allow you to avoid the online promotion which is highly competitive Im assuming. I also think that you could increase your prices and sell higher quality animated videos. What type of skills does your company possess that no one else has or are less likely to have? How can you increase the quality of your work? The goal here is to focus on the topnotch segment avoiding all the cheap video creators where  of the market is. In order to achieve this would you need to develop a particular skill? Perhaps using a new technology? I dont know but this is what I believe makes sense to create a unique positioning for your company.So recapping my suggestion and adding few tips try to research what are the different market segments  the different types of customers and see what do you need to do to enter and position your company within a market segment that has fewer companies addressing. Usually this market segment would be the premium segment. Thats why I suggest you find a way to create unique videos that are more expensive so the best customers who look for topnotch animated videos will go straight to you instead of the cheaper vendors.Now to make sure that I help you out anyway even if you dont follow this approach let us assume that your videos are pretty standard with no differentiation whatsoever.Itll all come down to the way you promote your work. And it might require some capital because people wont just appear on your website you gotta reach out to your customers.The best way to promote online is through the social media Facebook Instagram and Pinterest actually Im not sure but Pinterest has been growing a lot for this type of use you should give it a check. Facebook ads with a powerful commercial video would work beautifully.You can also work with Google Adwords. This stuff is pretty much straightforward. I have no doubt that it will help you but my doubt is that you can make it a profitable business. There are a lot of people promoting that service and it is possible that your customer acquisition cost is higher than his lifetime value.A final suggestion would be if you have a standard service with no differentiation you could differentiate by developing pricing options that drive customer loyalty. Imagine that you create some special packages on your website for regular customers. That way you would increase the likelihood of someone buying from you again which is already a good marketing tool that  of other players dont have. Think about it. What type of price packages could you make? Could you decrease make a special discount for repeated customers? Could you have a different price model? Instead of charging per video you can have a monthly fee for regular customers and they could ask you to develop all the videos they would like? Sorry for the length I hope it was useful.Anyway I love this type of topic so youre very welcome to email me and we keep on discussing business ideas.All the bestPedro,startups,d6umgep,3,t5_2qh26

9103631,0,t3_54xzjg,Crossfunctional collaborative teams are definitely the way to go and communication is important but unless youre INCREDIBLY selective with hiring you need managers to build this into the culture. A holacracy can work in theory but you really need to hire the best people and have the right culture for it to work. And its clear you just dont have the kind of culture that makes selfmanagement effective. I dont think you can do much about it beyond trying to get management on board because this is a problem with your managers. Employees dont feel like they have any ownership so they just dont really care to take any initiative to change things.I think you should start tracking this stuff. Every time theres an issue stemming from a lack of communication literally write it down in a document or spreadsheet and also include how much time was wasted. Im sure management knows that the culture isnt optimal but they probably dont think its a big enough deal to really step in and overhaul everything. Kinda like people know that going to coffee shops isnt cheap but they dont really see how much money theyre actually wasting until they add it all up.

Patents or TrademarksWhat is the industry and how much will the industry grow in the upcoming years?Are there any current contracts in place and what are the terms?These are just a few places to start when putting a value.

His firm supposed to support my product with tech team but I realized that he did not have the capacity. His website was all glamorous and he boasted that he is an experienced businessman who is well connected. I was pretty upset that I had put so much work to in and had to walk away..but I am glad that I did. The project that I worked on probably is going to die. He is saying that it is his content because we worked on together and he put his input. I disagree but that is what he is saying. I do not want possible law entanglement with him. So decided to start a new one brand new one.Whatever you decided to do good luck. I asked these questions to myself before I made the decision working with him makes me happy? the answer was no.

9647014,0,t3_5d5fyr,When you seek funding depends on the type of business you are creating. If you are the traditional SaaS business model businesses or consumers pay a monthly fee for your software you will need to demonstrate that you have achieved product market fit. Product market fit means you have a product that people are paying money for and that there are enough more people willing to pay money for your product that you can generate millions in recurring revenue every year. When you raise seed funding your goal is to raise enough money to cover your expenses for  years  years of runway and use that money to grow to at least M in annual recurring revenue. That means you will need to have a proven method for acquiring new customers. For example you might know that for every  you spent on advertising you could acquire  in ARR. The higher your ARR is currently the easier it will be to raise and the more you will be able to raise.If you have a different business model youll need a different plan and metrics to target.Seed funding rounds are usually between k and M. You should ask for what you need to get to M in ARR. You should expect to sell  of your company at your seed round.Some other pointers Raise from a credible VC firm or seed fund. Fundraising is all about telling a compelling story about how you are going to turn their investment into a x return. A CEO has to be a master story teller. The best way to get introduced to a VC is through a CEO of a venture backed company. If you dont know any then you should try to network with them. A warm intro from anyone that is connected to a VC is better than a cold email.Source Ive raised M in venture funding.,startups,da270fs,2,t5_2qh26

9775751,0,t1_dai1qzz,Im not saying UX is the only reason for failure but it is a key one for many startupscompanies I have encountered.Cash flow is linked to UX.  Misunderstanding a market pricing competition and timing is linked to UX.  Not attracting talent is linked to UX.  Proper UX should be rooted in research. Proper UX research frames the context of everything you will do. Proper UX design should guide every assumption strategy and decision a company makes.Again UX isnt just the UI.It is the sum of all the moving parts together.  Understanding that and working towards a common goal with everything the business does increases the chances of success by mitigating risk through research validation testing and actions that all share a common goal of producing an experience with key benefits to be sold to an audience that finds value in those benefits.If you dont have a clear vision for what that experience is what the benefits of the experience are and who could find those benefits valuable...youre very likely to fail as youre flailing around chaotically and not being as aware of the process as you could be.

10014741,0,t3_5j1sfw,Just playing devils advocate here but if your only differentiating factor from other US online electronics stores will be better prices that means your target market will be onlinesavvy shoppers that value lower prices right? If so why wouldnt that demographic just order direct from Chinaoverseas and save even more money? There are probably some good answers to this like better shipping times and service but I think its worth thinking upfront about what will differentiate you from the competition aside from price because I imagine with online retail there will always be a shop somewhere that sells at lower prices than you due to geographic advantage.,startups,dbcy6va,4,t5_2qh26

10116101,0,t3_5krdgr,Id highly recommend HubSpots intro course for Inbound Marketing. Itll help create some foundation for your marketing plan. As for your specific question if I were you I would focus on following a lot of small businesses in your area that youll be prospecting on their social media. Like their posts and comment when appropriate. This will help get your name in their heads. Then when it comes to start reaching out to prospects try to group them together by industry. This will help you make the prospecting process more streamlined because youll be able to use the same general sales pitch for every business rather than tailoring a new sales pitch for  different industries. For the pitch compare their companys social media offerings with a competitor who is doing better. If you have a competitor as a client even better. These are all general tips let me know if you have any more specific questions.,startups,dbq4whe,3,t5_2qh26

From the viewpoint of a property owner on Airbnb the insurance is great but for me the biggest benefit would be the ability to have a lot of people see my property a booking system and an easy way to accept payments  that way I can maximise the amount my property is off the market.As a holiday home tenant the benefits to me would be a wide range of properties which help make the prices more competitive the ease of booking and a real ability to understand how other people have enjoyed their trips to the properties reviews.

10166670,0,t3_5lgr32,I discovered quite a lot from a startup that were about to launch called www.paypress.co its a PR marketplace. Our design sucks and we want to make it better. But I thought why not just go for it? If you check it out and see what I mean by design  it needs a lot of work!So well improve the design and web copy later on. Figure its better to silently launch and test it first design can always be improved later even though its a little embarrassing.If we launched earlier it would of been a mess. We tested a few different business model variations and decided that the Freelancer.com   designs business model was better.We are gearing up to launch early Jan the platform is built and I thought ... I could try to go for the launch on gut instinct  but this doesnt necessarily mean Ill be right and could make mistakes probably a lot actually.So Im personally reaching out to other marketplace to find out how they went to market what problems they had how did they overcome their probkend and if their have any advice.I thought if I listened to other founders experiences it would help me to highlight any problems I might encounter and work out how to overcome them in advance.I learned from one marketplace recently M that his startup launched really quick and had a lot less people signed up than what I imagined. His product is really similar to mine but in a different vertical. If I remember correctly they only had around  people signed up on the supply side. It was a lot less than I expected. The other thing I learned was that it was t hard for them to find workers it was all about web traffic and getting people to post tasks. They had a lot of hiccups and dozens of user complaints in the early days some bad PR too. Now its doing really well.I think you can launch too early and too late. And theres  a hard balance between the two.My takeaways dont be too embarrassed about your design  you can always make this better. If you talk to people who have worked in your area or similar it might help you to launch with less mistakes. Doing something is better than doing nothing. At the end of the day its all just a learning curve.Ask Reddit Dont suppose have you ever come across a kick ass guide for startups about to launch? A checklist would be really useful right now,startups,dbwg52k,1,t5_2qh26

10337114,0,t3_5nydch,My only problem with this writeup is that it assumes there can ever be an idea that doesnt have some sort of competition. Im yet to see that no matter what the idea is.Take Uber for instance. You could argue that Uber had no competition at its outset. No one was using an app to summon a car driven by a nontaxi operator to take you from one place to another. Therefore you may conclude that Uber had no competition. But they did they had taxi operators as competitors. Even if I came up with an idea for spaceships to take ants to mars Im sure I could find a way to spin the narrative that some existing company iswas my competitor at the time of idea inception. Now if what the author meant was direct competition then I see the point.How I like to look at things and I am hoping this is what the author meant  is to be clear where you expect to gain marketshare from before you start your idea. Ford took marketshare away from the horse and buggy Uber took marketshare away from taxi operators and the IPhone took marketshare away from a host of companies. Similary right now FinTech is hoping to take marketshare away from banks VRAR is hoping to take marketshare away from video games and a host of productivity apps etc.The whole competition argument doesnt seem to make sense for me.,startups,dcfrqe8,4,t5_2qh26

10588700,0,t3_5rgryb,Business and people first! Dont lead with what you want or even the new design. Certainly not the paperwork. They will likely only care about reaching a new market or more customers so talk about them and the money to be earned. You have to convince them that you can bring new business to justify any investment in time or otherwise but mostly by demonstrating your ability not your design at first. Focus on yourself as someone who can deliver for them. Highlight your skills and experience but mostly your passion and vision at a high level. What is the opportunity for them? Assume you are essentially promoting yourself as a potential business partner. Then start working with their people build confidence and a relationship. Present the outline of a business case and a pro forma. Work through the design and eventually a prototype will become the obvious next step. In an equal partnership you cant expect them to carry all the costs though. You will need to contribute. Your design may be something special but dont assume it is a more valuable contribution than a qualified team established distribution and money. If its your first time and you dont have a plan to bring new customers you will have to offer up something.,startups,dd855yz,1,t5_2qh26

Find a local small business attorney and explain what you are trying to accomplish. I gave my sister the same advice. The lawyer charged her  for the type of work you need. Her business is now starting to franchise and that  is nothing compared to the tens of thousands and potential millions it could save down the road. Do it the right way now and avoid problems later.

Where I currently work my cofounder and I met over drinks. Just going out and meeting people of the same entrepreneurial mind as you will let you know what you are and are not looking for in a potential business partner.gt I am also very curious on how you see some startups that have been running for a while with full teams with little to no income?Equity and faith. Usually the latter runs out before the former is realized.gt I have been approached by a couple local startups but have always been a bit weary if it will ever be worth my time or if the people approaching me are legitThis no one can decide but you. If you believe in a plan that someone else has and your place in it go for it. But also consider How long will it take me to get paid? Can I wait that long? What other opportunities would I miss by staying with this personteam? Do I have to put in any of my own money?

Ive started  businesses failed  in New York suceeded  in New Jersey and now im on my fourth one in Latin America. My advice is dont give out anything that can be an asset for your companys future growth Series ABC for example. Best way to market a product while youre bootstrapping your resources is to study how other benchmarks are doing it and how you can set yourself apart from them. See what catches peoples attention. On the other hand tying your equity in a stranger who hasnt prove himselfherself yet is a huge risk. One scenareo would be if everything goes well and you need an investment then you have less leverage from your own personal equity unless you and the marketing guy agree to dilute proportionally from each others equity.

11588442,0,t1_dg9j9ol,Yes in theory but your overall value might go up and you also usually get more options with time. So if the share price is valued lets say  now and your company grows by  and you are still entitled to buy  shares at .  x   .x    your take away . x  . x    your take awayThis is really basic. What you worry is the dilution which is more shares will be issued and overall share price will decrease so instead of  it is worth lets say .. . x   . x    your take awayIt is a possibility of course and when you have options you care about the share price as well as number of shares but usually what happens with options is that as they bring in more investors you tend to get more options with time if you are diluted too much. If they keep the same number of shares and the value goes up you get the benefit of the upside. I normally would not worry about this too much if your relationship is good with whoever gave you the options. If you are then watch what they are doing. In UK we have companies house where such notices are filed for everyone to inspect. ,startups,dg9k2kp,2,t5_2qh26

11711567,0,t1_dgn2g50,I think this is true although the growth shares mean the shares are worthless until an exit. The idea of these is that they mean lower cost for employees to purchase and because of their almostzero value they dont have a tax implication. I know the company is aiming for an exit in  years which seems realistic given their current sales trajectory. My thinking is this Im taking a k pay cut to join the company permanently. If they perform as planned and exit in  years I want to make sure my shares are worth more than k possibly k allowing for lower taxation on capital gains vs income tax. Being offered x amount of shares doesnt give me any indication. I know theres no guarantees and this is all really a risk but to have some sort of indication would really help me get the offering straight in my mind.Thanks for the advice  its all been very helpful.,startups,dgnjam0,2,t5_2qh26

11764884,0,t1_dgt8ns2,Not sure I would say greedy but as a founder of my company I have retain control and also if Im thinking funding I have to give the VC folks their share.  So ultimately I wouldnt expect employee  to end up with a large equity in the firm say over .  This would cause me many downstream problems and ultimately lead to stock delusion.As for your math Im not sure I follow exactly but it sounds like your suggesting that if the Series A was a M round you would be granted .M shares.  How many outstanding shares do they have today?  I ask because the number of shares to grant is a percentage of overall shares issued and just giving out more and more ends up with the delusion factor see facebook with their cofounder and makes those millions of shares not worth very much.Also you mention the the rounds of funding as if thats the goal.  Is it?  In the  startups Ive been part of funding was something we did in most of them but it wasnt the goal at least not for the line mangers and employees.  As a founder I would rather take as little money as possible to hold more control rather than take in millions and not reach my ultimate vision for my company.  So is Funding a kpi for your role?  If not then I would think about what are your goals for your product and structure it around that.  Plus is funding something you have any direct control over?  I wouldnt put myself in a position where my bonus was based on a task that I could not personally manage.Lastly just out of curiosity you mentioned a couple times the technology your building will hopefully be a cornerstone of the company..  what are they doing now to drive revenue that is not your new tools?  It might help me understand how important your toolset is to the overall company because saying hopefully to me says not necessarily part of the long term viability of the company and therefore might not be really part of the leadership or equity of the company.  I hope I am wrong on that last part...,startups,dgtkvd0,1,t5_2qh26

11793962,0,t3_687tba,I met a startup cofounder yesterday. She runs a business that facilitates HR departments rewarding their employees at large corporations. Their business model is they tack on a surcharge to the amount the corporation spends on rewards. Their problem is its very expensive in effort to sell these clients and when they do the revenue booked is not commensurate with the work. This is a big problem but possibly fixable.  Unfortunately your problem is worse and cant be fixed to achieve longterm success. You have high costs to run the business employee pay creating small margins a limited market only so many people want stuff delivered in your area and huge venturebacked competitors Uber Eats GrubHub etc that will eventually be in your market if theyre not already. If it were me I would shutter the business yesterday and seek out a better business model that has lower costs higher margins higher sales price and isnt dependent on a limited demand in a local market. Wishing you all the best. ,startups,dgwvvwi,3,t5_2qh26
