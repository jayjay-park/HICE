3776771,0,t3_33kxhb,What a spectacularly written article. I feel like I read a fun piece of short fiction or something. I think Im going to look up what else hes written a Dawkins critic... interesting...,longtext,cqms2we,1,t5_2qh8f
4055654,0,t3_37097n,This article starts off seeming like an over the top art piece but turns into an utterly intellectual assessment of the ambiguous role of police in a society founded on social contract theory.    This didnt spark much discussion on rTrueReddit possibly because its too long so I thought you guys might enjoy it.,longtext,crikpk2,3,t5_2qh8f
6772278,0,t1_d0jw3gn,You dont know what you are talking about.I am a lawyer.  I spent a couple years doing criminal defense for sex offenders.  Recidivism is a genuine problem.  Some are more at risk than others but the urges do not go away.  I know.  Because sex offenders told me so.I do think sex offenders are a threat but I do have compassion for them.  They are human beings.I wouldnt change the criminal justice system.  Let that stay the way it is.  However there should be a city built for sex offenders somewhere remote.  Of course children would never be allowed in the city.  I think it should be voluntary to live there.  That would remove the issue over whether a halfway house etc. is another form of prison.If they move to the city they will get housing food and medical care.  They will have to work one of the jobs things like maintaining the city farming working at call centers or doing manufacturing.  I would think it could be close to selfsupporting.  Also I think it would become a community where people would make friends and not want to leave.This would solve most of the problems.  It would keep sex offenders away from anyone they could harm.  It would not violate civil rights either and the sex offenders could have a somewhat normal life after serving their sentences.,longtext,d0jx47p,-2,t5_2qh8f
