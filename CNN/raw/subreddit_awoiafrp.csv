11308823,0,t1_dfdh4xj,Terrence did not like Kings Landing. Last time hed been here hed been here to see his sister sent off to Dragonstone and just before that his eldest sister had stolen away with their famed axe. He was a Celtigar but he was none so bold as his father a little less savvy with his coin and a little more than flawed. He was a hawker though and he did not lack for propriety. At twentyeight years of age the man came decked in beautiful colors those of seafoam ranging from the deepest ocean blue to the lightest of skies. His sash tied about his neck was a brilliant white.When Elaena had first seen him shed embraced him lovingly kissed him on the cheeks and told him how beautiful he looked. Then shed proposed the idea of marriage to him. Twentyeight years and still no wife? If only they knew he thought sadly. Hed introduce himself to his goodbrother in time. Well he knew the man but he wasnt going to do anything short of bow and simper. Then hed take his seat and observe. Hed dance occasionally through the night taking pleasure in the women he danced with and wishing he might be able to dance with some of the men without seemingBold.There were beauties alike at this feast and hed have to choose one eventually. Question was  which one?For Elaena it was different. A smile perpetual on her lips as she sat beside her husband presiding over the feast. The clamor and the sound and the beauty of it all was intense and for once she wasnt aching. Shed giggled and laughed already so far enjoyed some small amounts of wine and looked to Helaena and Baelon both  even a glance at Vaella anticipation brimming on her fine lips.Shed come wearing a thick gown of white and violet her bun of silvergold done up high in the back and she was nothing short of beautiful. Her eyes greyviolet shimmered with intensity as she leaned over and took Baelon by the hand.Her husband had always been a caring gentle man. His years in the Vale had done much for him and he had so much humility. The swell in her throat. Thought of the news. It was so overbearing so chilling and for a moment she thought she ought to speak to him alone.But what good was that?Its been so long since weve danced she said to him. Would the Prince of Dragonstone mind taking a break? uDorneSucks ,awoiafrp,dfdu6d5,2,t5_3ja0f

Jasper breathed his cheeks already taking on the ruddy look of drink. It seems our fathers do have a lot in common  though I am not his heir as you are. Im the fourth son of Melwys third if you only count the trueborn. If I were born to any other houses chances are Id be a septon or a maester.The admission soured his mood bringing fair freckled features into a shadowed frown. I wont be either though. Jasper said with conviction. Ill be a knight like my brothers  only better and more famous than any of them! He sipped at his cup once again and that seemed to lift his spirits somewhat Jasper grinned at Haegons question and nodded.My very first. Mother wished me to wait until I was a man grown and I imagine Bryn did too  but Im nearly sixteen so I think Im close enough. I didnt think itd taste quite so awful but the more of it I drink the more it seems to recommend. He sipped again blinking rapidly.

Tytis looked to his brother with eye that said Trust me. After pocketing the letter. And excusing himself from the feast he had made his way to the office of the Master of Coin.

Ive not much to offer you but your daughter will be well protected and can live a happy healthy life and you can know shell be loved devoutly. Should we be wed and sire children your grandchildren will reign over the Vale. Out of these things the most important to me and should be to you would be that she would be loved and safe. After finished what some might consider a plea he prayed to The Mother that she might hear and influence the older man. Id like to ask for her hand. After actually have one the words out he felt light headed and his face went white. Hed no clue what would be said and had not thought of the consequences.

She slid out of her bed early before being awoken by Megga or Bella walking quietly towards the living room where she heard people muttering as to not wake her up. She stood silently for a moment listening their conversation as she wore her vert azure silk morning gown.My lady is still asleep. I will not wake her up for a letter ser. Hissed Bella.I was ordered to give this to Lady Alerie and no oneYes you said ser. But shes asleep.Alerie heard enough to come out of the darkness of her room. Im awake Bella.

I am awaiting his answer although Im sure he will deny me. If you get the chance please write back or come visit me.ArtysampnbspWhat to do? He asked father for my hand... Said one voice. He truly loves me... But another clear voice uttered in her head Queen of the Seven Kingdoms...Ser would you deliver my response to his Lordship? She asked with courtesy trying to hide her internal turmoil. She sat at her desk filling a piece of parchment with her elegant handwriting.ampnbspMy lord Arryn my sweet falconI am unwell today and must remain in my chambers.

She rose from her seat and gave him a quick bow though she did not even know where the Eyrie was or what kind of house Arryn was known to be.

Grave words heralded from Lannisport had the Lady of Lannisport in tears for the better part of a halfhour before she stood and made her way to see her brotherbylaw.It was a dark day and it seemed as if the sun hadnt peeked through grey clouds. It mightve been raining for all she cared but the windows were sealed and she dared not look outside. She wore a gown of the simplest red and little more. It might have been better suited for black.Nevertheless the Lady Celia of Lannisport knocked only once on Gerions door after she was met by two Lannister guardsmen.

Trebor though he never once spoke of Baelors demise had at least had the common courtesy to recognize his prowess and invite him to Sunspear. That was more than could be said of his predecessors.And for all his indescretions and all their disagreements it could at least be said he too cared for Dorne.Dragons. He tapped a single finger upon the frame of his chair. Terrax. Saeryx. Cannibal. Two too many by his reckoning. Cannibal had his uses. Though his hunger exacted a heavy price in livestock from the herders of the Red Mountains of which the hinterlands of Kingsgrave had many Mallador preferred to view him as an investment. His presence tempered Reachman raids and had to factor into any consideration of another invasion.It was the other two that occupied his thoughts. How long until they grew?

As I am sure you understand Lord Forrester if one does not talk to people be them Lord or Lady one finds their House alone when the time comes. Daemon meets the eyes of Rodrik as he speaks. This is a banquet Lord Forrester. I do not know how you treat celebrations in Ironrath but in the south asking a Lady to dance is expected.

He kept his eyes locked to the Dornishwomans taking eons to look away if he had to.Some would consider the man bold for having his hand so low as it hovered on the small of her back more yet would call it unseemly. But he had seen the dauntless attitude of the Lady he danced with as he spoke to her and decided to make it known to her that he too could play whatever game she had in mind.

As he looked away he tried his best to maintain a normal exterior. I made the mistake of arriving as Desmond Dustin and not Desmond the Bard. Is it the formality that exhausts you? Quickly between sentences he let the wine flow between his lips. Maybe itd calm his nerves. I know it does for me. Just... Just everything here is a farce it seems. The smiles the nods the...

I simply wished to petition you on behalf of the Lords of the Marches specifically those Reachlords who watch our Southern borders with Dorne. I spoke with Lord Tarly but a few days ago and it distressed me to hear that his lands and people continue to face harassment from raiders coming from Dorne.Alesander frowned a little as he continued to speak.The situation seems not to have changed in the slightest since the last time I visited the Marches many years past now. I spoke with the Lord Hand a few days past and was greatly reassured by his words on this matter. I simply wished to ask whether there was anything that House Florent might do to aid in the solving of this problem. We have some standing in the Reach and are not short of friends in the Marches.

To believe that it had only been a short time before was astonishing. She could feel the scars on her back still aching on occasion. His Grace looks at you differently I think though it pains me to say. Before my father passed he always doted on me and your mother does the same for you if in different ways. Yours can be for love too Im certain of it. If not love then She sighed trailing off. She didnt know what to say or how to assure her really so she simply reached for the empty cup of wine and set about refilling it.When she returned it was roughly thirty seconds later and both cups had been filled to half again. The same red tart and sweet. A hand extended offering Helaena back her chalice. What of the Lady Arryn?

No Ser Tion neither of them are with us right now and I will not hear of this again Aelinor commanded before turning on her heel and continuing down the road.With a sigh the knight  with his tousled brown hair and stubbled face  fell in line behind her. He kept a hand on the pommel of his sword and his slategrey eyes constantly surveyed their surroundings for potential threats to a young noble woman. Tion was less than pleased needless to say that his charge had insisted on venturing so near the street of silk but there was little he could do to charge the situation without being inappropriate in some manner himself.Oh look at this! Aelinor enthused stopping outside a small twostory house. Tion sighed again and frowned squinting up at the sign hanging above the door. Mlady Im not sure what that first word is the knight admitted to which he earned a look of admonishment. Mercurial Ser Tion Aelinor answered as if he were a simpleton or a child. Mercurial Magics this place is called. Mercurial means volatile she explained even as she opened the door and started inside.Tion rolled his eyes as he followed. So it means you then the man thought to himself but would dare not utter out loud.Hello? the Riverlander lass called out as she entered the shop twisting a strand of her auburn hair between thumb and forefinger.

No regaining composure trying to get hold of good body posture again meanwhile staying polite in an authoritative way  that was certainly some good Kingsguard material in front of him. Though it did not escape the sensitive Morrigen that Rin must have felt quite embarrassed already.Nah what a sweetheart. Finally Morryn would release him. He took a calm and confident breath let go off his prayer beads and adopted his notorious upright body posture again.Rin spoke Morryn now with his gentle bright voice in his most welcoming nearly touched tone.

It is a great pleasure for me to finally meet you. For I am your brother Morryn.And with that he reached out his slender hand covered by a soft white Chamois leather glove.

Urrathon Goodbrother stood before them his back toward the shore. He had a wash cloth thrown across one shoulder its offcolour fabric stained dark with obvious cause the Lord of Hammerhorn was soaked in blood from the tips of his fingers all the way up to his wrist and was using the castiron basin to wash. Reddish water sluiced across broad forearms pulling away most of the stillwarm liquid and pooling in the sand at his feet. Periodically the Goodbrother would dip his hands back into the cauldron scooping out more seawater with a cupped hand and scrubbing once again at his arms.Lord. One of the bearers said his voice strained in his attempt to keep it steady. Riders.A pale yellow eyebrow rose Urrathons expression shifting from neutrality to genuine interest.Do they bear colours?None lord. But there are only two.Curious. And you recognize neither?No...well wait. I think I might? They dress like one of ours at the very least.Urrathon turned to look for himself taking hold of the washcloth to dry his stilldripping arms. Blue eyes narrowed as they gazed across the beach watching the forms of two riders as they picked their way forward. From that distance he could not quite recognize them  but they did look like Ironborn. And if in truth they werent and had instead slain and stolen the armour from one of the other raiding parties....well. There was still room left by the tide.Eventually the newcomers arrived at the edge of the small encampment hailing one of the guards and soon directed further in. From this distance the Goodbrother was fairly certain he knew just who they were  but when the foremost of them spoke all suspicions were confirmed.Urek Wynch. Urrathon said grinning broadly with even white teeth. I was having fun truth be told until you opened your mouth and reminded me of your existence. Sunstone has been a kind and welcoming host  Ive no complaints.He paused then let his gaze fall to the shoreline where only a few feet away a dozen of his men surveyed the execution of over twenty four writhing bodies. Their mouths had been stuffed with seaweed gags of course. The faint sounds they could still make were hardly heard over the waves.Oh. Im guessing you meant them then.,awoiafrp,dgy8tuw,1,t5_3ja0f
