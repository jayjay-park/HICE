10579696,0,t3_5qht69,According to this the update function only works if Radarr is not being run as root. How do I go about changing the user Radarr runs as? I want to use my media user so Ive chownd the Radarr folder already but now I just need to set the user to media.,radarr,dd77ozu,2,t5_3icg7
10648238,0,t1_dde7r29,One more question. I notice that when I add stuff to my list its not searched initially. Its monitored and will get picked up in rss sync but it wont go back and search for prior releases. Just making sure this is normal for now maybe adding search later. ,radarr,ddea80h,1,t5_3icg7

10738193,0,t1_ddnivu8,I think hes talking about the fact he didnt request a movie just randomly grabbed a movie and he  ants to add it to the library like CP did. For radarr you have to be monitoring a movie.,radarr,ddnkarm,2,t5_3icg7

10906155,0,t1_de4viji,The periodic query they call it rss but it technically isnt is how both sonarr and radarr find things to download. That you havent noticed this w Sonarr is a testament to how well it works.You can also trigger an actual search in both if you want.,radarr,de4w561,3,t5_3icg7

11784510,0,t3_684rsy,TheMovieDB Theatres. I use Vote  and Votes  otherwise the list is too long and judging by the log Radarr only takes the first three pages. I found these settings keep it to two and hopefully filter out the garbage.For anything specific I use my IMDB watchlist.,radarr,dgvt9rt,3,t5_3icg7
