I understand that with no maindeck relics or dismembers my deck will have a far harder game one vs BGx but there is basically noone running that deck in my local meta.My thinking behind these matchups was that I can trade  for  with burn or last until I outgrow with two lords. For Zoo it feels like a hard matchup but I would hope that spreading seas will deal with the greedy manabase and kiramonastery siege would make them work for their removal with delve creatures I felt that bounce was a good way of getting value and Grixis are likely to be running islands to make evasion more available.

Its kind of a  or nothing mulling your hand against Affinity trying to find hate is not a viable solution when racingtop deck mode. If you look around mathematically a of in the opening hand is significantly more likely in the first  than a of than a of.I personally gave up the Affinity match up to allow my deck to take a control role against the whole meta instead of a  card that doesnt even move the matchup to . On a random note at my LGS I won game  against affinity care of my maindeck Spellskites wrecking Modular on Arcbound Ravenger and killing him with a Master of Waves ground flood I always board out MoW against affinity.   ,FishMTG,cz00wf9,1,t5_37n1h

Its tapping out and taking a risk on turn  to try and cause a blowout on turn . If they use removal on Reejerey it sucks because I took a risk and it backfired but I have more cards I can utilise to try and make up for it vialling in a lord  which is also extremely mana efficient or grinding with Silvergill and Seas and theyre down one removal spell at this point making my goal slightly more attainable.This is all in theory though which can go out of the window in any specific game.,FishMTG,dc9jlzd,1,t5_37n1h

10724853,0,t3_5telqp,Congrats on your result! This list is all over the place though. Chalice and Seas are a nonbo as you noted. Tax style counterspells such as Mana Leak are also a curious decision when combined with Seas. Youre also playing a little fast and loose with your U sources  Frank Karstens chart link  suggests that youre a bit under the threshold you need to cast a noncreature U spell on T with  certainty. Were all under the threshold for UU on T but we mostly get away with it thanks to Vial but I dont feel its wise to tick it down further. Lastly Im surprised youre not opting for any Vapor Snags or Harbinger of the Tides given their awesome synergy with Seas bounce creatures they are then unable to recast.
