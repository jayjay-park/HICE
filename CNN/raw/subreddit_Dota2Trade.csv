1676,0,t1_ceemjv0,lol you wanna talk about math yet you have no idea how to judge prices off market. You dont take the price minus the fee and then divide by . to get the price. Thats double penalty.

88809,0,t1_ceoj7tz,The recent rise on lockjaws price is because people realized how good the TI aura looks on other couriers i.e. platinum roshan and the fact you cant pull them out of heroic lockjaws without screwing the sockets up anymore so theres less gems around. You cant even see the effect on lockjaw itself.And Im not sure about price but I guess you can take the TI effect and colors prices sustract it from a full lockjaws price around  I think not sure and add some value to get the base lockjaw price,Dota2Trade,ceojfxo,1,t5_2t22d

The link may even seem correct in steam chat since I believe there is a way to modify hyperlinks. The page will absolutely look like a valid profile page because they want you to sign on that page but it is a phishing domain.

I verify the middlemans credentials and add him. Meanwhile Im pretty sure this is what happened the second account changes his profile to impersonate the middleman. The middleman messages me. The three really two parties agree to the terms of the trade. Im not being hypervigilant at this point because Im not putting anything on the line.

1142070,0,t3_277gzu,Why would you want to be one? Its stressful and often an ungrateful job where you stand to lose more than you could possibly gain from the occasional tip. Youll have people reporting you as a scammer when someone impersonates you and you will be impersonated as every middleman can tell you and youll have to deal with all sorts of shit because people dont know anything. Its most definitely not cool.This is no offense against you or yours You may be the most standup guy out there but unless I saw you around conducting cash trades and being helpful and active around the community I would not even consider you as a middleman. Right now you dont seem like anything more than someone who could potentially be stealing my items. Its hard enough as is to find reliable cash trade partners the last thing you need in the middle is a dude you cant verifiably trust.Discounting everything what was said above To become one youd need an impeccable track record of community involvement andor an inventoryaccount that would make a middleman scam where the middleman uses his reputation to get into facilitating a big deal and cashes out his rep by stealing the items  this has happened in the past not worth it for you for the potential repercussions.The actual verified middlemen of this subreddit can tell you about the woes of being one first hand but this is how I see it as someone who could potentially use a middleman.,Dota2Trade,chy3e9c,4,t5_2t22d

If the buyer wanted to resell your inventory hed have to waste even more time selling parts of your inventory. Your last point about your items being subject to price fluctuations.. yeah sure it might change but most likely only downwards.

Most of his socalled money transactions are with guys from the PH. Probably his accomplices with scamming. Thing to note Paypal is rarely used in the PH given the amount of stuff you have to do to have it workingverified Having an affiliated bankcredit card.

There are many gems out there that have increased the color wheel and there are some pretty nice replacements for the higher tier colors plushy shag.         Not much incentive. Theres a huge price tag for a legacy and negotiations end up usually being a bitch.        Not to me its a true collectors only market now.There are no patches geared to benefit the legacy owners. They dont provide a revenue stream for Valve. So there isnt that much of a growth especially as there isnt as big a WOW factor as before.        Not anymore.

Now he knows its a Legacy courier because of the tag. From that on he can use Google. Process wasnt so easy back then!  gt I can understand your position because to admit otherwise would be akin to saying your collection isnt worth what you believe it is.  I dont know what to reply here. My collection has value to me. I dont think anyone else gives so much value to it as I would. For me they are far more than Legacy couriers.

Personally Id have liked for them to be limited to TI only to make them truly special but then again I dont have any nor have ever planned to get one either so its irrelevant. I suppose if an offline event sells  demis out of which  are golden the supply never gets to boom when there are like  offline events a year with even the possibility of a secret shop so thatd be  of each golden during the year so I do believe youre right  that wouldnt actually put a dent in the asking price.Its a whole different thing if the demis are to be sold online without limitations however. That would eventually turn the graphs down but I suppose the items look good enough for them to hold even if each item gets  copies.,Dota2Trade,ck78vwx,1,t5_2t22d

1845397,0,t3_2fppwg,Well I was investing in an ethereal flames legacy earlier this year and I started just like you by asking fellow redditors here for advice. I made some new friends and I learned a lot about hightier trading. Legacy couriers are more then just cosmetics they are pets artifacts and Treasure. So it is not easy to acquire any legacy courier but to acquire an ethereal flames legacy always takes time and great communication skills. Very few ethereal flame legacy owners are selling so you will probably need to be patient also. Never offer low for an ethereal flame legacy because its value is probably higher regardless and the seller will never take you seriously again. Pricing is very difficult because since there is a tiny amount of transactions with these and thousands of people who want legacies so be cautious with your offers.

This all boils down to them wanting complete control of the market and while I can understand that I most certainly dont appreciate it.What it is is effectively taking a working system and making it less userfriendly and thats just poor customer service.Cyborgmatt was right when he teased that wed be spooked by this patch because this really has my jimmies rustled.,Dota2Trade,clp6bf9,2,t5_2t22d

However since the reserve has not been met and theres nothing definitive that shows that the reserve will be hit its preferable to keep it to H W tag.After which the reserve is met you can feel free to use the auction tag.Otherwise create an auction with a fixed end time in mind.,Dota2Trade,cmcgupm,1,t5_2t22d

One can only have so many unusual couriersfancy immortalsset pieces for heroes. Valve shows  innovation for items add unusual wards ffs! so their is less demand. For those that do still open setsuncrate its easier to sell on market then list herelounge whereas CSGO items are priced so ridiculously high they cannot be listed on market.

4220954,0,t3_397xge,Well I did start rSteamTradeRep a few months prior when dotatraders started dying. The idea was to link steamgameswap tftrade globaloffensivetrade and have a centralized reddit database recording successful trades aligned with the reddit flair system e.g. rsteamgameswap but never had the time to get it off the ground. Regardless if someone also wants to contribute and helm the project that would be terrific. The major problem with starting that sub is getting traction and the supporting cast of moderators to do verification. I would propose a team of x mods from each sub to moderate totaling  people to verify cases to manage the load.Restrictions being on a per case analysis on the sum of the items traded and successful trades. So the documentation on the flair would have color for N number of trades for flair tier  total sum of  exchanged for legitimacy.Im all for ideas and brainstorm. While starting a new site is good the integration into reddit for a subreddit would be beneficial.Edit Interested parties can contact me ,Dota2Trade,cs1dbxh,6,t5_2t22d

4421348,0,t1_csnvfmt,My comment was made based on your heroic item. But thanks for your feedback I think I should take up your suggestion and take a closer look at your heroic item.Your heroic items match date is on th Sept which means it belongs to Starladder Xs Europe Qualifiers Round Robin where Cloud faced off against Hellraisers bOne used Tidehunter in that game.Cloud incidentally was out of the running for Starladder X from the Europe Qualifiers but was given a slot second chance in the main event playoffs to replace the  China Qualifier winners VG amp Newbee.Tournament wise most of the tournaments that Cloud appears in will be major tournaments. Because of that the tournaments where the item drops from doesnt matter unless youre talking about it possibly being the really big tournaments like DAC or TI that are better than your average tournaments like Starladder where your item was dropped.The lowest tier teams Cloud would ever play against in their career would be tier  teams like mYinsanity but majority of their matches are against tier  teams eg. EG Secret to tier  teams eg. HR NIP.The cheapest bOne double kills on the SCM at USD. The Summit  Cloud vs VP  the old VP back then is a tier  team not the current VP  VPP fusion and USD. MLG TKO Cloud vs Team Liquid. Both old VP and Team Liquid would be considered around the same tier  status as HR.Item type wise the cheapest Heroic Hat of Fortune starts from USD..Gyrocopter is also not a signature hero of bOne.I think you are right the item cosmetic should only matter when it is popular or expensive eg. Juggernauts Blackened Edge of the Bladekeeper which starts at USD. and the last one was sold for USD. today based on the price history graph.True saying bro I will remember not to forget about these points.Thnx for suggestion given to me I will take note to make a more comprehensive assessment before I help to give a pc next time.Cheers. D I hope you get a good price for your heroic!,Dota2Trade,cso0rkr,1,t5_2t22d

It really depends on how much somebody wants this item. Some people are desperate to have an item and will slightly overpay in order to secure it more quickly or because its from a person they trust rather than risk getting scammed from an unknown person with a cheaper price.,Dota2Trade,ct70n3m,1,t5_2t22d

8142589,0,t3_4qrt0d,It depends on what timeframe youre talking about.  When they become tradable they will be very low value compared to what they will be at their peak.  Probably ...Lets assume youre talking about the time from TITI.  The prime selling point of an immortal treasure is its rares.  The normal drops from a treasure are a dime a dozen and everyone has them.  The people who buy the treasures  months later are the ones gambling for rares they dont want to pay full price for.  The value of the rares depends on the popularity of the associated hero and the availability of comparable items and the value of the treasure is further augmented by the quantity available on the market.Take for example the Immortal II last year with the Golden Basher Blades for Antimage.   Antimage is a relatively popular hero and there were no other blades that came close to being as blingedout as the Golden Basher Blades Manta Style blades aside.  This drove the price and kept it high for the entire year leading up to May before TI.  The treasure itself reached a peak of over .  I believe . in May  before the TI Battle Pass dropped. When it became tradable it was . and reached as low as . in October I assume corresponded with the Fall Major Battle Pass?.  Over  increase in value over the year.  Now take Immortal II this year.  Is it safe to say there are fewer Immortal IIs this year when compared to last year?  Perhaps due to the way the reward system breaks out but I would suspect the difference is minimal.  Are the rares different?  Yes.  Invoker is one of the most popular heroes in the game and far surpasses Antimages popularity.  He gets picked almost twice as much and therefore almost twice as many people are in need of a blingedout cape.  Are there any other Invoker capes that offer particle effects?  Not yet.  These two aspects will drive the value of the treasure.  Assuming the TITI time period is similar to the TITI time period I suspect the Immortal II has all of the capabilities that last years did to reach a peak of . or higher in mid.  Keep an eye out for Immortal III and its rares.  This treasure will definitely be affected by the reward system.  There will be fewer Immortal IIIs this year over last year and if the Ultra Rare is a Pudge Sniper PA Jugg Windranger Riki Slark Axe or Earthshaker item it could be very valuable.,Dota2Trade,d4vdard,3,t5_2t22d

10766312,0,t1_ddq1vkl,Yeah basically. The value is usually the highest  of the  values the  things being. The unusual couriers base price in market. The price of the prismatic. The price of the etherealIn theory if its a great combo you could charge for all  but people would just build it themselves and not buy yours.  So usually its the higher  of the . But at the end of the day its all about the haggle.That said yours is a bit special since Reflections Shade ONLY comes in an Arcana so it would never be a normal gem in an unusual courier. But Reflections Shade also sells on market from  usually so its not crazy high either.I hope this helps! ,Dota2Trade,ddqgrfw,1,t5_2t22d
