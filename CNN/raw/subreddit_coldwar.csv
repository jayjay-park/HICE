6808905,0,t3_490hbn,This Wont End Well  U.S. Just Sent an Entire Carrier Strike Group to Confront ChinaMatt Agorist March  image On Thursday the US Navy announced they dispatched a small armada to the South China Sea. Consisting of the John C. Stennis aircraft carrier two cruisers two destroyers and the th Fleet flagship the US is making their mission clear  we are not scared of kicking off World War III.Confirmed by the Navy Times the standoff has been heating up on both sides. After news in February that the Chinese deployed an advanced surfacetoair missile battery to the Paracel Islands U.S. Pacific Command head Adm. Harry Harris told lawmakers that China was militarizing the South China Sea.In my opinion China is clearly militarizing the South China Sea Harris testified on Feb. . Youd have to believe in a flat Earth to believe otherwise.However China is not the nation sending warships halfway across the globe in a clear attempt to provoke a fight.While China is no saint they are not the country with nearly  military bases in dozens of countries across the globe whove been responsible for the total destruction of multiple nationstates in just the past decade.The reason the Chinese have shown a military presence in the region is due to the nature of the dispute over who lays claim to the Paracel Islands chain.The Paracel Islands also known as Xisha in Chinese and Hong Sa in Vietnamese is a group of islands reefs banks and other maritime features in the South China Sea. It is controlled and occupied by the Peoples Republic of China and also claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.This dispute over who lays claim to the region dates back decades and physical violence has erupted between the disputing parties on multiple occasions as recently as . However since then the dispute has remained peaceful  until now.The US is attempting to claim that the Chinese presence in the region is some new conflict and are touting strawmen such as closed trade routes as a reason for flexing their military sway. But there is no evidence that trade will be affected at all.No country in their right mind would hinder its ability to export and China shows no signs of halting exports any time soon.Stating the obvious Fu Ying a spokeswoman for Chinas National Peoples Congress saidThe accusation that China is militarizing the region can lead to a miscalculation of the situation. If you take a look at the matter closely its the US sending the most advanced aircraft and military vessels to the South China Sea.Defense Secretary Ash Carter seems hell bent on escalating the situation. On Tuesday Carter in an evident failure of logic and confirming Yings statement warned China to halt their militarization of the region or the US will further militarize the region.Backing up Yings claims about US militarization Carter noted that the US is unafraid of increasing military deployments to the AsiaPacific region and would spend nearly  million to pay for more joint military exercise with countries that feel threatened by Beijing.China must not pursue militarization in the South China Sea Carter said in a speech in San Francisco. Specific actions will have specific consequences.As the global economy teeters on the edge of collapse the U.S. has ramped up its saber rattling not only with China but with the Russians as well. While America spends more on war than anyone else in the world the idea that they can take on China and Russia simultaneously is deadly insane.More ,coldwar,d0o33sq,-5,t5_2uaat
11786135,0,t3_662t17,Winston Churchill said The inherent vice of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings the inherent virtue of socialism is the equal sharing of miseries.Im reading a book right now called The Cold War in which author John Lewis Gaddis states that in a capitalist society equality is traded for liberty. In a communist society liberty is traded for equality. Marxs vision of the proletariate uprising and overthrowing the bourgeoisie he felt was a matter of time. He said that capitalism creates its own executioners and revolution would come about naturally when the working class became tired of being used by those in power. Lenin came along and sped things up with the Bolshevik revolution prior to WW. The Bolsheviks came into power and paved the way for Stalin  a man who was very much himself a worker. The idea of this uprising all along had the understanding that there would need to be violence and bloodshed  but that the ends would justify the means.Of course human nature being what it is Stalin was egotistical brutal paranoid etc. he took the idea of having absolute power to a new extreme in his vision to turn the Soviet Union into a communist workers paradise. What that vision became differed greatly from what happened in reality. Stalin was directly responsible for the organized killing of millions but what sets him apart from Hitler is that they werent singled out for being part of a particular ethnic groupreligionetc like the Nazis had done to the Jews. Thats the equality part.After WW many countries in SE Asia were growing tired of being left out of largescale alliances such as NATO or SEATO more appropriately. Vietnam was quarreling internally after they defeated the French in . Like other countries in the region the leaders saw a benefit to aligning themselves with America or the Soviet Union for assistance. They soon split into North and South  the North aligned with the Soviets and the South aligned with the Americans. Then they learned that they could get more of what they wanted by flaunting their unstable governments and how easily they could fall or defect to the other side. This leverage cause the Americans and Soviets to reluctantly increase their presence and assistance to keep their ally afloat. This was before the outbreak of the Vietnam War as we know it.But the person chosen to lead South Vietnam was not a good choice. He was an authoritarian and really did a bad job leading the country. But America was his ally so their credibility was now on the line by the early s. American ramped up their support reluctantly to keep communism out of South Vietnam. In turn North Vietnam told the Soviets how easily they could fall to the Americanbacked South. So the Soviets reluctantly increased their support for the north in response  lest their communist friends fall to capitalism. Things went downhill and the Vietnam War as we know it began.In short America didnt fight the Vietnam for the sole fact that South Vietnam could fall to Communism. They fought in Vietnam because they had invested so much into it that backing out completely would make them look bad in that part of the world. It was a series of bad escalations in an attempt to prevent the spread of communism ultimately to that regions bastion of capitalism and our ally  Japan. If we failed South Vietnam President Johnson said the world would not longer have the same confidence in American protection.Overall I feel that communism will likely fail because of human nature if given enough time. The only way to make communism work on that scale is with an authoritarian regime. Even if that regime claims to be of the people forcing restrictions and killing you population for not being obedient is not a popular move in the long run. It turns out that people would rather roll the dice with more personal liberty than oppressing equality. ,coldwar,dgvzx8n,2,t5_2uaat
