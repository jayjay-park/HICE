634577,0,t1_cgcdvj0,Thats funny Ive found the exact opposite. Not only does it stick and release better the release is a big part but the finish looks better as well and you dont get slurry discoloring your prints.Im guessing youre not applying your hairspray thick enough. Before I learned this trick I thought Kapton was better.Get the Aquanet extra hold and really coat it on. I mean it needs to be dripping wet. Then let it dry. Some people like to do  or  layers of this Ive found  does the job. Then hit it again real quick before your first print and youll be good for months. And cleaning it off is a breeze. Just get it wet and the old hairspray comes right off. Dry and reapply.,makerbot,cgceh8c,2,t5_2rm4h
987686,0,t3_22moh5,Here is my first piece I want a makerbot but the build size is atrocious. Hopefully the new z will be better. However the larger the build the more problems you will have with warping and uneven melting.,makerbot,chgk2wn,1,t5_2rm4h
999056,0,t3_25ieyx,Minor correction you cant just use CMYK as there is no white substrate so you need at least CMYKW feed material.  It makes way more sense to just print in a highly absorptive white material and inkjet on colors after each layer of extrusion. You only need color on the perimeters so why bother having mixing capabilities?,makerbot,chhumdi,1,t5_2rm4h

1191682,0,t1_ci3kgb9,I have a rep  which prints wonderfully. First off Ive had zero problems with pla not sticking to the surface. In fact I can hardly get my print off of the bed. Rep  doesnt use a heated bed. What I find is that the closer you are the the bed the better. I typically stick a piece of paper when leveling And try to find that spot that gives me nice resistance. It should scratch a bit when you move the paper side to side.,makerbot,ci3oliq,1,t5_2rm4h

2253848,0,t3_2l0gjr,Ive had my Makerbot Rep  for six months and dont mind it at all. Granted Ive never had any experiences with other D printers but I think its really user friendly.  However I really dislike Makerbot filament. It jams upgets kinked up FAR more than my rdparty filaments do. ,makerbot,clqaq8l,4,t5_2rm4h
2857275,0,t3_2ssp81,Its not a bug. Makerware just chokes if the geometry gets to complex. One solution is to decimate the mesh to reduce the poly count. I did a video of a technique for this with blenderBut like uclustertruck said simplifyd  is in my mind a mandatory upgrade. Not only is it lightning fast on most slices and gives you previews of every one because of their lightweight preview option but the few supercomplex prints Ive done that choke Makerware sd handles like a champ. The only thing Makerware still has going for it in my mind is dual color prints and single wall thick areas or spurs that I realy on for many of my fine detail work. ,makerbot,cnsvf6j,1,t5_2rm4h

6186661,0,t3_4082tb,What z axis issues are you having? MB are launching a new extruder soon and having already used it I can assure you it will fix a lot of your problems with clogging so see if theyll swap your existing ones for the new ones in a week or twos time.If youre confident opening components up and having a play the clogged extruder is fixable. Everything is fixable. Just be aware it will void your warranty so they wont replace it.This extruder problem is costing MB a lot of money in replacements so its absolutely in their interest to fix the problems which I believe they very nearly have done.,makerbot,cysux7x,1,t5_2rm4h

8532021,0,t1_d681nqp,Yeah that little dent at the top means youre sanding a hole in the filament and definitely proves the extruders grip is strong enough.How old is that filament by chance? are you printing PLA or ABS?also have you leveled the build plate and made sure the spacing for the first layer is good  layers of paper i think? i had mine do something similar though sooner in the print because the spacing was way to small for the first layer and there was too much resistance small gap between plate and nozzle,makerbot,d682fec,1,t5_2rm4h
9646924,0,t3_5d4z5y,Ive always wondered if these are as bad as people say. Has anyone with a lot of experience building and using repraps also had experience with these? They tend to be exclusive...,makerbot,da26m2v,1,t5_2rm4h
9789208,0,t1_dajof6d,This isnt exactly the case with consumer level D printers. D printing has been around for  years. FDM printers as we see them in the sub  USD space are already decades old technology. One of the biggest advancement factors is expiration of patents. I personally own a Rep  and a Monoprice Dual Extrusion.  While I have a a Printrbot Metal Plus and a Rostock Max and a Printrbot Simple owned by my business.  All of them purchased over the last  years.  The real differences between them all are trade offs but not necessarily generational.  FDM has not advanced considerably on the consumer level since the first Makerbot Replicator  and most of the real advancement can be upgraded in to just about any printer. One exception to this is the smart extruder technology that Makerbot put out. If it actually worked the way it is supposed it would be an amazing generational upgrade but in practice it is more pain than it is worth. If they worked well without requiring you needing to buy replacements in  packs for an exorbitant amount of money and replacing them regularly they would be a true advancement for consumer printing. Anyways a new in box D printer from a year ago especially a replicator X is going to go pound for pound with any of the current crop of FDM printers. ,makerbot,dajqdwr,1,t5_2rm4h
11622103,0,t3_65rqlw,Came here to let you know that future versions of Makerbot desktop have consistently had problems connecting to Bots with old firmware. They dont seem to bother with any attempts at backward compatibility even if its just to update the firmware. Its prudent with MB to keep an archive of the current working version of the software each time you update since MB doesnt make it easy to find old versions. ,makerbot,dgddk4n,2,t5_2rm4h
