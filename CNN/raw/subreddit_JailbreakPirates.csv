188220,0,t1_cezuu6z,Alright thanks! At a time when  of content released on Cydia is dependant on iOS  I felt like those who dont have newer devices are being left behind. It makes sense but it doesnt really seem fair. I sunk  into a device just for it to be abandoned a year and a half later in favour of a slightly improved version. I was just looking for an easy way to see what new stuff is available without looking at things on an individual basis. TLDR I understand that iOS  is the new OS and youd be a fool to not support it but not everyone has it. I was looking for an easy way to find any new iOS  compatible tweaks. DEdit I dont mean Add iOS  tweaks! I mean Which of these iOS  tweaks are compatible?,JailbreakPirates,cezvltm,2,t5_2vpmx
