424692,0,t3_1yx8kh,Good news on the multiple accounts.  You have the option for multiple account with this app.If you go to settings through the settings charm and clicktap on Accounts.  You can add as many accounts as you want.Once you add more than one account you can switch them pretty easily.  You can choose who you commentpost as by selecting the username from a drop down.To do a full switch of accounts reload frontpage and subscribed subreddits just use the dropdown from the main screen.  You can always quickly get to the main screen by tapping on your username in the top righthand corner.As far as the private mode.  Can you elaborate on this?  Im not sure what this would entail.Thanks for checking out the app and the feedback.,Redditting,cfos8va,2,t5_2vprx
