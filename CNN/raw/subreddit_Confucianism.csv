5100885,0,t1_cv0lazf,I do its something I learned about in College from professor Hoyt Tillman many years ago. We read Mencius and it was really interesting seeing this philosophy expand from the roots of Confucius to Mencius and ultimately we went over Zhu Xi in another class. I understood the parallels between it and my Christian upbringing and added it as another facet to what I believe in.Read the Analects with a commentary. It can be very hard to understand whats going on in the text without the context provided by either a modern voice explaining the history or another Confucian voice to explain the Chinese context word usage character usage etc. Daniel Gardner has an excellent translation from Zhu Xis commentary. You can also check out Hoyt TIllmans book that we used in class its a back and forth between two scholars debating... pretty much everything Confucian.,Confucianism,cv0uhzg,1,t5_2qihu
