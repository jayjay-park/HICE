146481,0,t3_1vrlk5,Why not pure CSS? I put this together in  minutes do note it uses the HTML figure and figcaption elements so it may be broken in some really old IE versionsEdit ohh I skipread the post assuming the title and link were sufficient. Why do you want the boxes to rescale based on browser sizes? From my experience this rarely results in a good user experience. Either way you could look into vwvh units but theyre pretty unsupported by browsers right now. You can also combine the above solution with a little bit of javascript that changes the default fontsize of the body in the onresize event.Heres an example of that notice the differences from the previous version to learn how to also fix the fontsize for the figcaption ,jquery,cev45nl,4,t5_2qhs4
164465,0,t1_ces89pe,I think its fair to say that its probably NOT a good idea that rd party plugins use GSAP unless it states somewhere that if you want to ever sell whatever youre making you need to also pay a perpetual licensing fee.I would just be pretty pissed if I downloaded a cool opensource plugin only to find out that when it comes time for me to make money off of it that I have to give out a cut for something I didnt even know I implemented.,jquery,cex5y7x,1,t5_2qhs4

3580827,0,t1_cq0fgpd,Well in the first example you cant reuse the json data because you dont actually end up assigning the json data to an outside variable.Alternatively I believe if items.json is a json formatted string you can include the json file and use eval to create an actual json object.  If items.json is already a json object just include it.As for the error... Im not sure what the issue is.  Perhaps theres come kind of scope issue arising from the order in which youre doing things?,jquery,cq0fy4v,1,t5_2qhs4

Probably depends on the engine but Id imagine if you looked in the console youd see the error even though the click handler still works on the anchor.  Note the where and when of the error is javascript nothing to do with jquery.In the first the parser is still working on interpreting the expression looking for a semicolon to terminate it or a dot to continue a chain or anything valid but instead it finds that extra  and doesnt know what to do with it as its not expected there and thus cant complete calling the click function at all.,jquery,cuvyp2l,6,t5_2qhs4

10532492,0,t3_5qs4vj,Youre demonstrating the A in Ajax. When you call .ajax it starts your API request and then allows the application to continue running while that request is inflight. In main understand that your call to count is nonblocking and the callback youve passed as its argument wont be invoked until the Ajax call is complete. The order of execution is. Start the API request. Enqueue the callback to execute when the API request is done. Log jsonData to the console oops ReferenceError    ... some time later when the Ajax call returns  .... Invoke the callback which finally declares jsonDataAnything that needs to wait for the API request to complete also needs to use the Promise object returned by the .ajax call. You can pass that promise all the way up to main by returning it from the intermediate functions private.countCallBack should return RESTClient.invoke ...  CustomerFacadeREST.count should return private.countCallBackcallbackThen in main you can do    CustomerFacadeREST.count ...         .donefunction response             console.logjsonData            console.logresponse  same as jsonData        Once you wrap your head around how promises work it becomes easier to see why the global jsonData variable is a Bad Idea.,jquery,dd1z33x,2,t5_2qhs4
