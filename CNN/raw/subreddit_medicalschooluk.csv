We werent the only ones who got that feeling either my Med school is big on com skills and SJT like scenarios and many of us really struggled with the paper!Im ignoring the stress focusing on the PSA and all the other internal assessments my Med school is making us do is quite distracting. Nothing we can do about it now unfortunately!,medicalschooluk,dck1bey,1,t5_2z1t5
