Just make sure to invest in a decent set of winter clothing and you shouldnt have a problem.

576140,0,t1_cg5kkvh,Almost  of my fares are flags. So YES you can flag a cab in Madison its practical. Union Cab amp Madison Taxi are metered direct and cant share so if someone is inside you cant flag them or if they are on their way to a call. Badger Cab amp Green Cab are zone shared meaning it is a lot easier to flag those down because they take multiple parties.Dane County charges a  fee on every cab leaving the airport for the right to pick up at the airport it pays for maintenance of the airport. If these companies are unregulated DC couldnt charge them because they dont know WHO to charge or HOW much.He means demand isnt there all the time. There is demand most FridaySaturday nights from am. Most of the time there are  cabs on the road. However the city shuts down most of their buses at midnight. Usually if you want to leave at am bar time is a you have no problem flagging a cab.The problem with surge pricing is that you assume everyone that needs a cab during busy times are all at the same place doing the same thing. The city is diverse so when some people are leaving to go home from the bars some are leaving to go to work or getting groceries at the store. I dont think its fair for them to have to pay more andor wait.If you want a cab within  mins leave before everyone else. I go to Milwaukee Brewers games a lot and in my experience if I want to avoid traffic to get out of there as fast as I can I do  of  things. I either leave early around the th inning. Or I sit in my seat and enjoy the view and wait til everyone else leaves. In your scenario there would have to be  cabs on the road to fit your needs. And thats not even considering traffic on Badger Game Days.,madisonwi,cg5rff7,1,t5_2r8rz

692467,0,t3_222eit,My wife and I moved here  years ago.  From the responses on this thread Im just going to warn you that this is what youll find when asking anyone about Madison.  Its either be cool and live near downtown or everything else is suburbia.  Heres my take  If you live downtown youre going to be looking at WAY shittier apartments but youll be close to the scene.  If you live  miles outside of downtown then the quality of apartment goes way up but there arent as many hip places within walking distance.  For us we had a dog.  Pitmix to be exact.  We also moved from the St. Louis area so we wanted to get the most for our money.  So we picked the far west side between Verona and Middleton.  We were in our place Hawks Ridge apartments for  months and had zero complaints.  Underground parking Lots of trails parks bike paths etc  So one thing that you need to know is GET A BIKE.  Everyone bikes here and if you live slightly outside of downtown you can still get anywhere on a bike.  There are trails galore.  TLDR If youre use to Chicago and you need the buzz of the city then get closer to downtown.  If youre a little bit older and you want more for your money get about  miles outside of downtown.  We ended up buying a house in Verona and couldnt be happier.  Its super quiet and I can get anywhere I want by bike or bus.  Im  minutes south of the Beltline walking distance to a couple dog parks and infinite open hiking land.  Edit replaced a word,madisonwi,cgizhjs,11,t5_2r8rz

1781884,0,t1_ck2m3rh,gt where along the valuechain of the food is all this pricedollar going? Why does the food cost this much?The coop is an open organization the budget is not hidden and owners can see it if they want. Why not spend a little bit of time and answer this question yourself?I had the same question as you so I did. So heres the quick and dirty Most of the cost of your food goes to the employees and the farmers that produce your food. Those two items combined are the biggest part of the budget. IIRC the next line was building upkeep and maintenance and then some other smaller  stuff. But I think  of the budget was those three things food employees building.Its not price gouging. Its just that places like WalMart have conditioned people to think that a banana is only worth  cents due to their predatory employment practices.Look at it this way The Coop doesnt have artificially high prices. Its the big box stores that have artificially low prices because they use their power to exploit resources and people in an unfair way.,madisonwi,ck3re04,4,t5_2r8rz

He does ask if the AA community is enabling disparity and suggests there should be accountability within the community to reduce disparity. I think this is where you are drawing your comparison that women are told they should be accountable for their physical safety by not dressing provocatively right? In the case of a scantily dressed woman the conversation is Dont do A or else B will happen If you do A you deserved B or Well B happened because you did A.     I dont see those as equal comparisons with his pleas. Hes not saying that the actions of his community have brought on disparity. Hes not saying that his community deserves disparity. He asked that black people start treating each other better including black women black homosexuals and black intellectuals. He asks that while they try to improve things at the institutional level a new coalition formed after Gees December essay was published that they not enable the disparity by  treating each other poorly as they have been treated.

Anyways the personal experience you shared at the start of this thread has no bearing on the comment regarding why more natural rules for cyclist shouldnt be used at stop signs and traffic lights. An answer of no to that isnt an opinion or a legitimate response to the question. Its a refusal to contribute anything meaningful and relegates most of what youve said to nothing more that mindless bellyaching from yet another motorist that cant cope with the thought of sharing the road with cyclists. Im sorry you had a bad and potentially dangerous experience like this. It sucks when motorists cyclists skateboarders rollerbladders and pedestrians alike selfishly ignore the rules of the road.

6980047,0,t1_d13e4qv,Yknow we actually for real euthanize millions of pets in this country BECAUSE they dont have homes. were lucky in Dane County that DCHS with the hard work of many dedicated people community support and funding does not have to euthanize healthy or treatable animals. A big component of this problem is the extent to which animal rescue has stayed out of poor communities.  This means not only a lack of pet care resources and knowledge but also low spayneuter rates and bad outcomes for pets owned in these communities when they need care or if they need to be rehomed.  We have a lot of poverty in this country and poor people will continue to have pets.  For some of them it may be one of their primary forms of companionship.  Weve got mountains of evidence that owning a pet increases someones quality of life too.  When you are disadvantaged in other ways a pet may make an incredible difference in your quality of life   To just turn our backs on this and say that people under a certain income level shouldnt own pets is irresponsible inhumane and adds to the problem.   It keeps resources and education out of communities that desperately need them.  It is yet another way we marginalize and judge low income people in our country.  And it means that shelters and rescues overlook a huge number of loving homes.  HSUS has had great success with their program called Pets For Life which partners with communities to bring affordable pet care resources education and services into them and also helps low income people to adopt from shelters by providing transportation and reduced or waived adoption fees.I realize Im speaking somewhat outside of the scope of this conversation about a specific person in our community getting a cat.    But I really really feel that this idea that poor people shouldnt have pets is harmful to both people and pets and while I think it comes from a good place where we want to ensure the welfare of companion animals I think its something that we need to reevaluate when we talk about what it means to own a pet and what we can do to increase the welfare of companion animals.  ,madisonwi,d17iz7x,1,t5_2r8rz

8626146,0,t1_d6jntrb,I suspect that any other grocery store would have failed just like Pierces did though.  I agree that the neighborhood needs an affordable option but I think the reason why the Coop has a good chance of surviving in that location is because it attracts people from other neighborhoods who have money to spend.  I imagine that with the larger parking lot larger store and more generic options people who would normally shop at the Willy St location who probably have cars will drive the extra  minutes to the North side.However as others have pointed out the Coop is only an affordable place to shop if you buy a few items there and supplement the rest from normally affordable grocery stores.  The problem with this is that a lot of people on the north side dont have easy access to those other grocery stores  a trip to Woodmans or Aldis would take  bus transfers.

We didnt even have a diverse class but it was immediately obvious how destructive and morally bankrupt the ideas were even after a short open discussion.What if that discussion never happened and the people that got sucked in never had anyone to push back against the idea before it was solidified in their minds?

10753241,0,t3_5ttaj6,I always love data visuals especially ones that end up nice and clean so upvote for that.But I have to wonder how useful it is when there are so few real considerations like grocery stores restaurants parks yard size whether homes are single family or multi etc. ,madisonwi,ddp455e,4,t5_2r8rz
10754415,0,t1_ddp455e,Thanks and I agree this is really more of a starting point to find some areas to focus on and then compare individual listings to the average. For example is the higherthanaverage price justified by when it was renovatedproximity to other amenitieslow crime rateetc.? I included all residential properties to maximize the number of listings per ward but I could do by single family homes instead. Id love to factor in more things though if you know of good data sets! I might be able to map the latlong of Madison parks to their wards but the police incident reports has a really messy address field that would furthermore need to be geocoded. I heard about some multiple plotting capabilities for Tableaus maps scheduled for release sometime in the future which will be cool. ,madisonwi,ddp8iu3,2,t5_2r8rz

10921799,0,t1_de6hizl,Im done with this conversation their isnt anything to glean from people like you and the other guy. You guys have your Im sure it happened exactly like officer kenny said You dont know if Tony attacked kenny only that kenny claims that Tony did. You dont know if it went down the way that kenny said it did you only have kennys word that it did. If you dont see how kenny has a whole world of incentive to tell his story a certain way and lie I dont know what to tell you people. There is evidence of the engagement NOT going the way kenny said it did. I think that he is lying not misremembering or whatever. You and the other guy are proving the whole believe what you want the facts say otherwise. The neighbors said it didnt happen that way the video shows that it didnt happen that way and some of the physical evidence shows that it didnt happen kennys way. If that isnt enough to prove my point well. I guess you have your facts and I have mine.There is real evil in the world like people who shoot unarmed people when they possibly didnt have to. I think people that support the power structure remaining in place to allow this type of behavior to continue unchecked and unabated is wrong and evil.If that puts me outta line so be it I dont want those types of people as allies. ,madisonwi,de6i9y4,2,t5_2r8rz
