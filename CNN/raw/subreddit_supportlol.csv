5761108,0,t3_3twyef,Some thoughts Aphromoo types the minimum required for Summoner spell timers champion initial  f h etc. while the team relys on the chat time for the actual timer. Darshan would occasionally contribute in this area with the timer typed out instead. Really interesting how watching a match in this way has the feel of playing a solo queue game while its instead being coordinated at the professional level. Aphro seemed to get caught quite a few times which makes me wonder if being the shotcaller has a big effect on positioning. At  why was Huhis blue timer duplicated in chat? Aside from the sheer quantity of wards their ward coverage is so efficient. There was also a bit of a cat and mouse game were ward patterns where altered just slightly to be out of the range of being swept and itll be interesting to see how the new ward debris in Season  affects this.

7805847,0,t3_4m6sm9,I think the big problem is that the new system really disincentivises playing support as a secondary role. I love playing support but I also like being able to play other roles. Queuing up as support second in the new system reduces your chances to get your main role which really doesnt make the position more appealing. According to the roundtable stats that Riot recently released you have a  chance to get mid however if you queue for MidSupport your chances fall dramatically to only a  chance. ,supportlol,d3tfthd,2,t5_3abd1

So heres what Ive been tryingtheorycraftingStart Spellthief  BiscuitsEarly core should be Sightstone and Mobi Boots.  Ive been experimenting with NOT upgrading Spellthief to Frostfang.Based on your and enemy team comp and lane phase core items and sequence are as follows  Athenes Unholy Grail gt Locket of the Iron Solari OR Banner of Command gt Ardent CenserSightstone can be upgraded to Ruby Sightstone ifwhen you plan to complete activateable items.  Alternatively you can upgrade to Frostfang or swap to Nomads Medallion and purchase an Eye of the OasisWatchers.  Ive yet to try it but I probably will end up swapping to Nomads Medallion and then going for Talisman of Ascension.So in an ideal world...SightstoneMobi Boots gt Chalice of Harmony gt Athenes Unholy Grail gt Ruby Sightstone  Nomads Medallion gt LocketBanner gt Ardent Censer gt Talisman of AscensionObviously youll need to make some difficult choices in the process.  Youll need to use your best judgment to determine when you sell Refillable Potion and if youre going to keep a Pink Ward slot or not.

10166070,0,t1_dbw1ebm,First of all I was only Gold V last season I stop playing after getting to Gold but got placed in SII so Im assuming Im not that much better than you. So I encourage you to take everything I say with a grain of doubt. Not getting angry actually means a great deal. Im personally a quite emotionally balanced player myself though I do tilt hard too when the enemy support plays aggressive supports like Leona and doesnt engage at all or if they play Nami while I have a support that cant really trade back that well and yet they end up with  gold on their Spellthief item at the end of the game... and when I tilt because of stuff like that I do play worse.And thats probably the case for everyone unless youre some viking that needs to fall into berserkers rage to be effective. I dont really have tips on how to get less angry though. I really donT need it but typing mute enemy or mute all might be a good way to go if its your teammates that tilt you. If its simply the stupidity of your enemies Ive heard that consantly commenting like youre a caster helps  youre not supposed to curse on them after all but should instantly see what they were thinking and explain that to the viewers.So basically instead of thinking WHY IS THAT FUCKTATRD GOING IN HE CANT FIGHT THAT  ZED OMFGZZGGGRAAAAGE youd be thinking Having faith in his abilities Draven goes right in his support right behind him now its important to dodge his Q but Zeds having a good run and hits because Draven HAS to get his axe to have enough damage Zeds nearly dead now and... Zed kills him! Draven will now probably think twice about going in against that Zed though it was still important to see and try if you can get that shutdown gold that would help the entire team! or something like that.But in the end you must definitely find your own way to not get angry. Now going to your profile at long last. You seem to have quite the success with junglers later good for you! Especially with Vi. Just a idea of the top of my head but Vi is quite the engaging and teamfighting jungler maybe you would want to pick up similar supports like Leona Alistar? Lets go through your support games though.  First Game Thresh        Vision Wards  wards total PKill .From the scores alone Id say that game definitely wasnt your fault and theres not much you couldve done. Its really impressive that you warded as much as three of them! If you notice the enemy support isnt warding that much you might wanna get some deep wards yourself and get your teammates to set up traps once the laning phase is over. This mostly means spam pimming a stray enemy in their jungle and hoping your teammates get hungry for that juicy enemy jinx though I do not know how well Bronzies react to that.Itemwise a good choice but I cant recommend the Ruby Sightstone upgrade enough! The health it comes with is really really cost efficient and having item actives up more often is really really amazing especially with the long cooldowns of Redemption. Depending on the enemys performance and playstyle Mikaels doesnt seem to be Best in Slot either and mightve been replaced by an Aegs but thats totally dependant on how reliably that Camille was jumping on your Corki and how well Ekko predicted his Stun Zone.Thresh in general in this game mightve been a bit trick for you I can assume? Save for Jinx they were either quite dashy or fast and Jinx probably was the one that stood behind everything until a real fight broke out. Couldve worked though of course. Also I see you have Thunderlords Decree TLD as your mastery. Unless youre aiming for a  CDR build Id say itS safer to take Courage of the Colossus CotC instead since the only reason to go down to TLD really is to have that . Second Game Braum        Vision Ward  wards total PKill .Oh well my beloved Support Braum. I can only really make him work in really really skillshot heavyv environments and struggle so damn much with him if the enemy has lots of dashes... like an Akali a Renekton a Vi and A Leona on top of that. Hell with that matchup gotta go Poppy support if shes open! Or anything that can keep your ADC at a good distance so stuff with knockbacks or Get out of JailDevourTahm Kench. Also Windspeakers Blessing? I guess I dont have to tell you you chose the wrong mastery here.  So I really really really love Braum. But with  dashes and zeor Skillshots but Varus Q and Ult only Varus as ranged... sadly a hard time as Braum at least would be a hard time for myself as Braum. Third Game Janna        Vision Wards  Wards Total PKill  See... you got a hypercarry and the enemy a shit ton of dashes. You picked someone that really peels hard... and suddenly you win. I didnt see the game but even if your Vayne was an godlike ADC she couldnt have become  without a formidable support and peel could she?  Well done.Two really minor thoughts on your item build. I know many pros buy Mobility boots a lot on support very legitimate on Janna too. But with the diminished effect of movementspeed and her really high natural speed thanks to her W I find it hard to believe thats optimal on Janna especially since you get so FREAKISHLY slow once you used your W on an enemy and now lost your passive MS and your boots MS. Thats just a personal feeling though apparently Mobility boots are used on  of the cases Lucidity . Considering how much Pro Supports roam though Im thinking it might be because of that.A Mejais! Very cocky  and I like that. Hrrhrr. Paid off too I guess.  Overall I think youre gonna have to counterpick more. From the looks of it youre a good support and your recent success with junglers shows that youre able to carry. Carrying as a support in my opinion is like being an overprotective mother. If your ADC is half competent and you keep them safe youre carrying the game though your own team rarely notices. EDIT Sometimes keeping them safe is best done by making picks on the enemys biggest threats mind you. Best protection might be aggression! Best defense is offense. Sometimes.I had enemy teams congratulate ME though. By telling me how unfun and annoying I am mostly when I play Janna. So keep it up and have confidence. I think youre gonna make it out of Silver soon enough and if it isnt by playing a classical support  where you are still reliant on the competence of your teammates after all consider playing an damageoriented one. Unless youre like me and think they are a blight upon this world. Me when scanning over the enemy team and I conclude that I should play a damage support.,supportlol,dbwdow2,2,t5_3abd1

10295624,0,t1_dcazs03,There are more things to practice on than just your support champions. If your top is losing roam up there with your jungler and v the enemy top laner. As a support you dont have to sit in one lane. Make things happen around the map. Ward objectives enemy buffs common paths all that. Ive shut down fed junglers just by warding their blue buff all game and killing them every time they came into that part of the jungle. You said you like tanky junglers and not mages. One of the best tank supports Alistair thrives on roaming. Got a kill bot lane? Go mid and combo stun that dude. Just backed to base? Roam top before going to lane maybe get a kill there. TLDR even the pros practice their most played champs. There is always room to improve,supportlol,dcb2cjp,2,t5_3abd1
10301586,0,t3_5nd20g,What it sounds like you are describing is that you know how to win lane but not how to play the macro game at least if you arent just following up on decent macro decisions by your teammates.Ill be the first to admit that I dont exactly know what Im doing here either but I am playing in pretty much exactly that rank in Flex Queue and I do know the feeling you are describing. You have to pay much closer attention to what your teammates are doing and then in every moment you have to make the optimal decision for you based on whatever suboptimal decision your teammates are making. In higher Elo you can generally follow up on any play your teammates make because they tend to actually be thinking about the play at least roughly as much as you are. In low Silver and below your teammates generally dont have any awareness whatsoever. They see a killable enemy and they chase it. So you need to know when to back off when to ping them back and when to leave them to die. And those decisions are actually really hard because your teammates are not often playing according to good logic or game sense so you have to really hone your own game sense to make up for it. You cant just play around what the enemy team is doing you also have to pay careful attention to your teammates as well.Now even if you have perfect decision making sometimes your team will throw the game in ways that you dont know how to make up for. You will lose games and it will feel like no fault of your own. That is a reality of League. But you can effectively ignore those games because you will get an equal amount of games where you get straight up carried because enemies are feeding. If you cant deal with the fact that you are Silver  because you currently deserve to be Silver  and that your play and decision making is whats keeping you Silver  then you should probably quit LoL. Team games are not for you. If you cant see past your teammates mistakes to see your own you will not improve at the game.Playing perfectly around bad teammates will win you games. Playing as if your teammates are better than they are will lose you games. You see an easy play that will get your team a kill. You go for the play. Your team suicides or doesnt follow up. Whose fault is it? Its your fault. That play just put your team behind and you are now more likely to lose the game.Your teammates make an incredibly stupid play and you hang back. But your opponents play super badly and your team just barely loses the engage. If you had followed them up you would have won the fight even though it was a stupid fight. Thats your mistake not your teammates. Im not going to pretend this isnt very hard. And Im not going to pretend that Im good at it or that the answers are always obvious. But blaming your teammates is never acceptable and there is always something you could have done better. So either quit the game or quit worrying about your teammates and get better. You are at the rank you are at because you currently deserve to be there and the only factor that is keeping you there is your own play. If you dont enjoy the challenge of figuring out how to play better theres not really a reason for you to play ranked. ,supportlol,dcbqnxf,3,t5_3abd1

10402365,0,t1_dcmpbgp,Most of the time youll want to empower your ADC during team fights and laning phase as your passive gives them a movespeed bonus and the slow can help them kite. If the ADC isnt in a position to utilize your E during a team fight dead in base whatever then your best bet is to usually empower whoever is most likely to be able to apply it. If you have a tank sitting on top of enemies for example. And if you get the opportunity during laning your auto attacks matter too. Try empowering yourself and getting some AA poke in while the enemy ADC is last hitting minions.TrickNamis E is extremely powerful in the laning phase and can be tricky for enemies to play around if you have voice comms or another method of rapid communication with your ADC. While one of your ADCs auto attacks is traveling Nami can E the ADC and the still traveling auto attack will apply the E slow and bonus magic damage when it lands. As most enemy bot laners will respect the Nami E when its on your ADC this can sometimes be one of the only ways to apply your E during standard laning. ,supportlol,dcn6b3r,1,t5_3abd1

Spellthiefs makes those aggressive zoning trades more worthwhile.I also focus on only trading early when I have a full stack of Spellthiefs procs ready to go.Just my two cents. ,supportlol,dfzr2di,6,t5_3abd1
11609686,0,t3_65oo4f,Ruby Sightstone gives  cooldown reduction on item actives so thats important to keep in mind.I know FoTM and Ruby Sightstone are important to tanks like Leona because at that early in the game they need the health in order to start stacking resistances. Stacking resistances without health would be a waste. If I plan on building Locket and Randuins then Ruby SS is a must for me.I build Eye of the... items whenever I know the laning phase wont last long and my adc has a strong midgame or if Im not going to be running a lot of actives.,supportlol,dgbyv2d,18,t5_3abd1
11667388,0,t1_dgih3x3,I posted d to inform of my rank not the game in general.As with any mechanical champ it can be pretty volatile depending on the player playing it. Im having a decent time in lanes vs poke though high mobility provides a safety net to poke supports but you can get baited into some really harsh karmaesque punishes. Still debating whether coinspell thief is better people still seem pretty mixed on it. Waiting for xpeke to log on so I can get some thoughts. People have been running Greenfathers gift on him too which Ive started to pick up seems so obvious now that I think about it.,supportlol,dgiiib5,1,t5_3abd1
11693583,0,t1_dgl5i6a,Taric with Windspeakers and tank runes is great but Rakan is different.  His ratios are amazing and tank runes kind of waste that.  If you take CoC youre freed up to run some AP in runes instead of tank stats and IMO  AP is better than the  from Windspeakers at least in the early game.The only thing is that  CDR is really hard to give up but I think Tenacity is totally worth it so you can get in and get out more easily.,supportlol,dglhi3n,1,t5_3abd1
