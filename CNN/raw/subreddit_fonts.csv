477843,0,t3_1zkqxx,Besides the usual reasons stated I believe it was created specifically for use on low resolution screens without antialiasing. Now that every major operating system uses good antialiasing on all text and monitors have vastly increased pixel density the design strategies used to make Comic Sans are irrelevant. When I see that font today I see type that could look much better if only a more modern lighthearted handwriting typeface had been used.,fonts,cful0ss,4,t5_2qurp

1850626,0,t3_2frqwg,If you need more information you need to basically read the font license of the font you are going to buy.  The license should not be prohibitively difficult to read.  Desktop licenses tend to all work pretty much the same but its your responsibility to read it and be aware.  Legitimate sites that sell fonts tend to make the license text available readily prior to purchase.,fonts,ckc72fe,3,t5_2qurp

4210003,0,t3_392qmx,There could be a plugin for the software you listed. However I did a quick google search and couldnt find anything. I tend to use Font Book to help me stay organized with the fonts which I personally downloaded. Also wordmark.it is an asset I use to preview a word with all of my fonts. I know that InDesign CC has a favorites feature in which you can checkmark your favorite fonts and theyll always pop up at the top of the font selection window. Other than that I dont know of anything else. Hope this helps. ,fonts,cs04lzu,1,t5_2qurp

7368655,0,t3_4g7ih3,I think the main thing here is to find something easy to read that provides decent contrast to the fancy display faces and offers upper and lower case characters. Having said that what you choose depends on the look youre going for.You might like a classic print serif maybe Garamond I tried Adobe Garamond Pro.Or you might want a modern sans serif to offer more contrast Clear Sans Regular didnt look too shabby when I gave it a quick look.Or you might want a quirkier oldschool print look. Something like  HumaneJenson might work though I usually try not to use overly stylized fonts for body copy.The above were just a few that I tried out on the fly and they werent half bad but everyones tastes are different. Try some different things and see what sticks. Good luck!Edit formatting,fonts,d2frjwe,2,t5_2qurp
