I tend to disagree based on thermodynamics but they seem to have the evidence of history on their side at least up until the last ten years.

From the same Wikipedia pagegtBaseload also base load or baseload demand is the minimum amount of power that a utility or distribution company must make available to its customersDiesendorfs Baseload Myth article argues renewables can meet  baseload demand.  He claims renewables are just as reliable as conventional baseload generation because him and his buddies used computer simulations to come up with a renewable portfolio that performed well over a short time frame. Then he goes btw were still gonna need to use conventional turbines to meet minimum load at night which contradicts all that.  The fact he needs to use conventional gen turbines to meet an offpeak load means renewables cant cover baseload.  The reason he still needs to use conventional turbines is because renewables arent reliable enough to integrate.  In between all this contradiction hes taking digs at what he calls renewable deniers which tells you his real purpose in writing that article was advocacy not science.That linked article is one of many that reference that Diesendorf article like its something legit.  On top of that this article claims Texas with a  renewable penetration rate not annual but on a couple days is game changing.  Its not if you look at the RPSs of other states  penetration on  days is nothing special.Siemens assumption is that for whatever reason injecting all intermittent gen into the grid immediately at the moment of generation will become priority over everything else.  That would leave room for only controllable dispatchable generation to hit peaks which would have to be ramped up and down hourly which means plants with slow ramp rates would not be used.

TEPCO had previous released data in August saying a tank lost  tons of water containing  million becquerels  litre of beta rayemitting radioactive materials such as strontium. Now they quietly announce a revision of the data. It turns out that the water contained  million becquerels  litre. Quite a difference. Their equipment didnt take readings that high so they diluted the sample to get it within range but forgot to reverse the effects of the dilution in the results. On another occasion their measuring equipment went off the scale so they simply gave the maximum the device could measure as the reading.,energy,cgtw2ra,0,t5_2qhkd

The circuit uses PWM to deliver amounts of power between full open and fully closed.When the controller detects the battery is full it leaves the circuit open aka disconnected the majority of time. No current flows  amps  power. Unlike a wind generator that must physically stop the generator or have a power dump to prevent overspeed that can lead to mechanical failure.

That makes investments in related firms and projects that much more risky and Im extremely doubtful that with the way the typical state regulatory scheme works that flat rate hikes could possibly keep up with that.

GW fossil plants which have  predictability in the sense that  of the time they are down unexpectedly not for normal maintenance. This would require .

If wind and solar get to high penetration levels you still need to have all the other types of generation to be there for dark and windless times. Those plants still need to make money. In the end you just have a bigger and more expensive electrical system albeit a little more green.This is a pretty common meme on here however it is not accurate. The biggest expense for a NG backstop is fuel costs which run about twice the combined levelized capital cost  Fixed OampM together.So when you arent running your NG plants its not as big a deal as say when youre not running your nuclear plant at full capacity which has a x greater levelized fixed capital cost than variable OampM.gtElectricity prices in most places are incredibly low. Its hard to beat. Adding batteries to a system is an extra cost. Wind and solar are already plenty expensive.Nuclear can be only slightly more expensive than coal about  more expensive than the cheapest coal systems but without the raft of other problems coal creates. If we set up a tax structure than internalizes the externalities of cost nuclear becomes cheaper. And NG for that matter.

If everyone has  day worth of battery power   they can sell electricity quite often therefore prices wont be impacted by much. If everyone has a lot of storage e.g. a week they may only be able to sell power a  days a year so a  fold price increase would be justified.So the question comes  how much battery backup is actually worth investing in? depending on your location between a couple of weeks and a few months might be required to realistically protect you against the once in a decade scenarios especially since they dont charge up to full with large enough battery banks from a day of sun. But at what point do you stop? at once a year events?  year events?  year events?  year events? it will probably depend on the downside of not having enough battery power e.g. if you are on a bit of medical kit requiring power to keep you alive a once in  year event may seem worthwhile. The higher up that list the average person sits the more expensive backup power when batteries run dry become down to the stage when people dont think theyll realistically be able to make their money back in their lifetime and the grid therefore disappears so everyone looses power in the most extreme events.,energy,cqluw6d,1,t5_2qhkd

Buy a beefy shelving unit. The lifespan is probably going to be similar or slightly less than the lithium batteries and worst case you buy one more set. You are still ahead of the cost curve. Want batteries that will outlast the tesla batteries by x? Go hunt down some nickle iron edison batteries. They are even lower power density but they last decades. So make a bigger shelf.

3857413,0,t3_34m5wu,At the risk of being patronizing let me splain. Hydrogens not a primary fuel you dont mine hydrogen or farm it or whatever. You put in energy and get hydrogen out and then you can later put hydrogen in and get energy out. So in that sense its energy storage like a battery. Its a really inefficient battery. If you can electrolyze water at  efficiency Im told thats a little high and run the hydrogen through a combinedcycle turbine at  efficiency youre turning electricity when you get it into electricity when you want it at  efficiency.Existing coal plants are generally around  net efficiency. With hydrogen you wouldnt have to run all the scrubbers on the exhaust side and mills and whatnot on the input side so you might get up to  efficiency on the hydrogentoelectricity side. And in a few years youre going to figure out where the new OampM problems are. Not necessarily worse than the old ones just new. So this might allow you to reuse a twobilliondollar coal plant but at the cost of turning a  efficient storage process into a  efficient storage process. For reference regular batteries are something like  efficient in the roundtrip process. This is an interesting idea but I dont see where its more useful than existing technology.,energy,cqvzazt,5,t5_2qhkd

Theres not much room for productivity and efficiency increases in turbines. As such wind isnt the real solution for decoupling the worlds economy from fossil fuels. It may be part of the solution but it very much can not meet any sizable portion of the energy demand today let alone in  years.

4206355,0,t1_crzn0xx,EDIT Forgot to say that it would be the responsibility of who built the station in the first place. They are making solar plant so they are responsible for all encoring costs to plant new areas or replant old areas after an older faucilities removal.The mechanism to limit solar is the demand for power. Increase power demand means more need for power production. Its a very bad thing to produce more power than is needed. Hawaii actually had this problem awhile ago where they actually produced more power than needed as a result of booming solar. They had to decrease the power production from one of the sources which ended up being less fossil fuel super expensive to import helped with that decision. How we produce more power to meet demand here is either create more solar or create more fossil fuel plants and drill more.As for backups there are other ways to backup solar than just with fossil fuel. We see this with the tesla home battery or similar like inventions. It is energy storage instead of energy production. Then fossil fuel companies will either refuse to backup the source or will demand special deals to compensate themCareful creating these hypothetical situations. They can often be more self serving than helping you understand. It wouldnt make sense for the fuel companies to refuse to meet power demands. They will cause power problems during the time they were suppose to provide it and thus have the problems as a result of their business decisions. Thats a lot of bad PR for them. Other energy productions would take advantage of that bad PR to make it worse as well as meet the energy demand.,energy,crzpotn,2,t5_2qhkd

However simply looking at biophysical indicators its apparent that its somethng that we need to do if wed like to keep the biopshere in a condition which is amenable to our inhabiting it.  Therin lies the rub.Thus far basically every time anywhere in the world has experienced a recession it has been very unpleasant for quite a lot of people although that has been because it was unwanted and not managed very well.  Peter Victor is one economist who is at least looking at this problem and his models do seem to suggest that you could manage a shrinking economy and have positive outcomes.  Though Im not an economist so I cant really comment on the veracity of his models. I think that one way or another were going to have to start dealing with the fact that some sort of physical downsizing of the economy is going to take place whether voluntarily or due to forces that we cant control.  Id rather we did it voluntarily and figured out how to manage it but I suspect that this wont be the case because of how our brains work.  Were basically wired for loss aversion and to take big risks and bad gambles to try and avoid losses this is among the findings of behavioural economics.  So what I think will happen is that well try our hardest to avoid lossdegrowth end up taking big gambles geoengineering?  burning everything we can get out of the ground? and will probably end up fucking up the earth system something chronic.,energy,ctapqgk,1,t5_2qhkd

4698914,0,t1_ctmt58n,We dont have the final version yet. So I am going off the draft version which was released last year and which recieved heavy comments on these issues.The draft CPP treated new nuclear and old nuclear differently. New nuclear gets the same credit as any non carbon resource. If you want to meet the carbon reduction requirements with nuclear you can and it will qualify.  However the CPP makes the statement that this pathway isnt cost effective based on EIA numbers and thus shouldnt be any states primary method.Existing nuclear gets only  credit. That is under the draft CPP if you would take a  MW nuclear plant close it and replace it with MW of wind really MW to equal out cap factor and MW of natgas you meet the CPP requirements. This is due to the CPP guessing that only  of the existing nuclear may close and thus they didnt need to incentivize it very much. What made South Carolina really upset was that the new units at Vogtle and VC summer are being counted as existing nuclear.  This made every other utility even thinking about nuclear to either stop it or make it very clear they hadnt made a decision. The utility wants full credit for new plants and will be willing to wait a few years to ensure they get full credit.As I said nuclear owners made many comments about these issues and Exelons statements of just how much of their nuclear is really at risk should at least increasing this percentage of credit for existing nuclear. That said I wouldnt call the current nuclear plight an issue of renewables or natgas as much as baseload overbuild. A LOT of factories left for China and the Midwest especially now has more baseload than it really needs. Cheap natgas has caused natgas units that use to only run in the summer to want to compete for baseload which just makes the oversupply that much worse. Renewables adding negative prices then turns the whole situation from we need to become more cost effective to we have to give up because we cant make nuclear price go negativeIn that light the CPP can be a really good thing. Its pressure on coal plants will be much greater than nuclear. But whether the effect will be fast enough for the most at risk plants is not known.,energy,ctmu5d9,5,t5_2qhkd

At the time of the Civil War machines and slaves were not models that a society could choose between apart from the facile comparison that both can do mechanical work. Most tasks still could not be automated and there was little prospect of automating them  in particular no mechanical cotton picker was commercially available until . Emancipation meant that the same work was done by free labor not that it was done by machines. An example of a machine that was used in cotton production is the cotton gin and far from reducing slave labor it allowed slavery to spread across the South.

Besides over  of the uranium purchased by US Commercial nuclear reactors is from outside the US.

The bench model is better than  efficient but production models should be better particularly as scale increases. There is a limit due to heat management requirements.The storage cost is pretty cheap. A typical NH transport tank that stores  MWh pregeneration would cost around k so with diesel generation you would need two of them to get MWh. Your storage cost is kWh. This gets better when you use larger refrigerated tanks that store GWhs of energy. For comparison LiIon batteries are kWh trending to kWh and this does not change with installation size.I cant give you the installed cost of the equipment yet. But given the low storage cost of NH it is very cost competitive with other technologies at high capacities.With current technology efficiency youll need a to spread in electricity costs to make money. For wind farms where you frequently overproduce at night this is easy to achieve since you would have thrown that energy away anyway estimated at  of total energy available. You can use less equipment to generate the NH since you can do it over a longer period offpeak while using cheap diesel generators to produce electricity for a few hours at peak.Edit changed kWh capacity to MWh. ,energy,cwt6ext,2,t5_2qhkd

I think there is still tremendous opportunities for wind to offset the many coal plants in the Midwest and if we build more transmission wind built in the central US can reach other places in the Eastern Interconnect. While we have seen some instances of negative pricing and curtailment Id argue that is more the result of a relatively rapid transition in our energy market rather than a market that is fully saturated from wind. Certainly there is more demand in the eastern part of the country for wind but those are also highlypopulated areas that have poor wind resources.

PowerGas systems would take more than  years to get online and as of yet would require gallon gasoline to be equivalently priced.  At some point we are going to have to get it through politics that solar panels displace no oil.Cars could be electrified but they are going to displace a pretty small amount of oil use.  Converting all the  mpg cars to electric leaves all the trucks light duty to Class  haulers tractors mining ships etc.   The latter arent going to electrify because batteries dont have near the energy density needed for those uses. Maybe light duty trucks if batteries see huge improvements. Since lithium tech  years ago batteries have only seen small energy density improvements while order of magnitude improvements are needed.Then you have chemical feedstock. We dont have hydrochemical knowledge to make good plastics and chemicals from bio sources. Corn plastic exists but it sucks. It seems like almost no company is pushing this. Our old chemical champions  Dow Dupont and rements of Union Carbide are slashing RampD. Biofuel has stagnated mostly due to the low cost of oil.  The ethanol plants in the US have stopped advancing and basically become ways to convert natural gas into ethanol. We have hit the blend wall and have not come up with better chemicals to displace any more gasoline. There little to no price advantage to E after reduced economy is factored so the small flex fuel fleet is mostly gasoline usage. Biodiesel cant compete on price and is decreasing output. Oil is cheap because there is a glut of supply. Its vastly much more likely that glut will end than oil is replaced before the glut ends. ,energy,cy3i8z4,12,t5_2qhkd

Wind and other renewable technologies have only recieved a fraction of the research and investment that Nuclear has yet the latest Nuclear projects in Europe are being financed for provisionally the same cost per Kwh as currently installed wind generation is already achieving. There are no fuel or equipment savings with nuclear for running them at less than capacity so nuclear capacity does not compliment other variable power sources it just reduces their value. Nuclear power supply itself begs the use of power caching technology to help it economically supply variable demand.The latest popular support for nuclear power is based on the same commercial fiction as it always sold. It is an expensive and dangerous radioactive industry which we do not benefit from locking ourselves and future generations into. It is a last crazed pitch of the same kind of Industrial forces which got our children and us into this trouble. ,energy,czblwv2,0,t5_2qhkd

TWh to Switzerland a German net export of  TWh is maybe a better number.     It seems reasonable to assume that other countries only import if the German prices are low however windsolar are not the pricesetters but they are pricefollowers the very low price comes about when conventional boiler generators can not ramp down enough and have to sell at lownegative prices to prevent a total longer duration shutdown.      It seems also fairly obvious to me that blaming windsolar or fossil depends on the personal preference of whoever gives hisher opinion.     ,energy,czcrc8h,7,t5_2qhkd
6362101,0,t1_czcrc8h,The transit function is that just electricity moving through Germany from France to Switzerland? Surely that wouldnt be included in the importexport figures as it is purely physical and has no financial implications for Germany? But I agree that the exact number to use will be lower than  for various reasons.Perhaps they will only import when German prices are low but it seems that the more important condition is that they will only import when Germany has excess electricity to sell of course its more complicated than this and producers can ramp updown based on spot prices but broadly speaking I think thats true. Anyway this scenario where thermal stations cant ramp down fast enough will generally be happening when windsolar are in high production.Im just trying to understand the economics of it. You cant say definitively which source caused the exports because its a complicated system. But it seems like a plot of windsolar would have the highest correlation with exports while thermal might even have a negative correlation as producers try to ramp down. So it doesnt seem farfetched to me to claim that the windsolar energy is being exported. And therefore for example for a German consumer to claim that their electricity is x renewable is misleading. But perhaps this is just my bias talking. For what its worth this Agora publication that Im reading that prompted me to think about this a bit more.,energy,czcstji,3,t5_2qhkd

Now that same truck can carry thousands of smart phones all which have more calculating power than an old computer. This is what has made computers cheap.Moores law doesnt work for solar panels because solar is a dilute energy source. Solar panels by definition will be very big. There will never be a day where a phone sized solar panel will be capable of powering your house. This is important because right now when you look at the cost of solar you will find that the solar modules themselves only account for  of the total cost. The rest of the cost is for things like labour the racking the inverter etc.. And those are not costs we can easily reduce. This means we wont see the same cost reduction as we saw with computers.

Just starting from carnot principles Because of the high adiabatic flame temperature you can either get  Carnot efficiency from an ambientcooled airhydrogen turbine or  and this is totally possible because that hydrogen is made from water  use pure oxygen and hydrogen for a  efficient cycle. You cant really use metals for the combustion at that point but boron nitride or other crystalline ceramics could well work. Its a stationary application so it doesnt have to be space or mass efficent. We know a couple hightemperature ceramics that play well with this chemistry as theyre used in hightemperature SOFCs already. Also yes that . figure is turbine only. Its actually surprisingly high and if you look at the turbine crosssection its because theyre doing some neato internal blade cooling which by itself is part of the thermal cycle instead of injecting flame temperature suppressants although they have that too theyre just using air. But you can only go so far with a design that tops out at C. Unfortunately that whole hydrogen cycle thing has been defunded so none of the timelines you see are ever going to be met.

The groundwater aquifier is also at the strongest portion of the wellhead with the least stresses shallower. The highest chance of cement failure is at greater depths and higher temperatures. This study doesnt mention that key fact either.Sustained casing pressure is a phenomena which occurs if you bleed off pressure in the well shut it in and the pressure builds right back up.  This can be dangerous because it would over time erode the structural integrity of the cement bonds.This is also something which basically every company in the US monitors extensively because it would inhibit production it also decreases the pressure differential between the reservoir and wellhead.Furthermore the study also only focuses on Pennsylvania a state which has almost zero experience regulating or even experiencing an oil boom over  years.But we are talking about freaking COLORADO here not PA.Fracing economics?

Thats because the power plants are fairly expensive watt and they still have a fuel cost. I suspect this is a technique for coal companies to lock in a market for their future. If you build  large coal power plant itll require fuel for  years. Thats  years of a consistent customer. They cant build coal plants in the US but they can build them in the third world.The other part about coal is it is a centralized energy source. That means it requires a big plant to be built and the power lines to be ran. Someone has to pay for it and the government in third world countries often doesnt have the money or a way to taxcharge people living in poor conditions.If you contrast this to distributed solar it is exploding in the rd world. Granted it cant provide home heating or cooling but most of the people in the rd world cant afford that anyway living off a few dollars a day.

Of course they do this. Everyone knows they do this.  month every  and a half years compared to  of a day makes solar far far less reliable than nuclear. Against gas you have a point but refueling time does not make nuclear unreliable.I want to point out the graph of capacity factor they include past about  the capacity factor for nuclear plants is better than almost all coal plants who average about . .

It doesnt cost original costs down since even overbudget shit pays itself back quickly.Again saying this for the last time it doesnt matter what cost over runs are if you dont compare them to the actual cost. Nuclear is expensive as fuck as a single term investment but produces such an insane amount of power it pays itself back but this still causes issues when funding runs out or goes poorly. The main reason these fucked up in the past budget wise is poor estimates of the budget if they average x what they expected then they are obviously providing underestimates the same way many industries do with big expenses.And even then Bruce powerplant DID ALSO GO OVERBUDGET by about  billion canadian dollars at the time in total YET STILL beats solar by about x the price.The bet isnt on whether you win the lottery its whether you can be bothered to actually get a good estimate of the price.Since you think Vogltes  and  was nasty lets have a look. Wiki claims the cost at the time was about  billion which if inflated to today is about  billion costly absolutely I can see how it went x the cost... except the plant produces  TWh per year...

Thats their expected price.gtVogtle  ripped a hole in Shaw Brothers bookIt really shouldnt have unless they expected it.

10611913,0,t3_5rvz31,About this bookThis authoritative but highly accessible book presents the reader with a powerful framework for understanding the critical role of the energy return on investment EROI in the survival and wellbeing of individuals ecosystems businesses economies and nations. Growth and development are fundamental and ubiquitous processes at all scales from individuals to food crops to national economies. While we are all familiar with the concepts of economic growth and living standards as measured by gross domestic product GDP we often take for granted the energy use that underpins GDP and our expectations for yearonyear growth. In this book you will learn how these measures of progress are completely dependent on the balance that can be achieved between energy costs inputs and gains. Nothing is made or moved without an energy surplus and it is the EROI of available energy sources more than any other single factor that determines the shape of civilization. Nearly all politics and economics assume that policy and market forces are the levers upon which future outcomes will hinge. However this book presents many examples of historical and current events that can be explained much more clearly from an energetic perspective. In addition a future scenario is developed that gives a central place to EROI in assessing the potential of governmental and private initiatives to substitute socalled renewable energy sources for diminishing stocks of fossil fuels. When cheap fossil fuels are no longer available in the abundance needed to mask economic problems and power business as usual it will be EROI more than the plethora of green technologies that creates the boundary conditions for a sustainable future.,energy,ddajdjb,3,t5_2qhkd

CANDU is far from the only design with a positive void coefficient fast breeders gas cooled reactors and the revised RBMKs are all positive.

CADMWh at all times or only when their grid output is curtailed for surplus grid capacity reasons.I found out that their grid output curtailment was primarily at night in response to wind overgeneration and that Bruce Power was seemingly much more concerned about additional plant stress from steam bypass use than I had expected although they could have been exaggerating things to some extent in their attempt to get the IESO rules on resource curtailment priorities changed which to be fair were originally rather illogical in curtailing nuclear before wind. They do seem to have a very strong emphasis on making their steam bypass operations as lowrisk to the reactors components and core as possible and they operate the entire  MW block of bypass allowed per reactor as an allornothing thing with likely unnecessarily conservative delays between changes in steam bypass that effectively make it a onoff switch for  MW of output per reactor. Realworld operation of the steam bypass systems operation is approximately  hours for set reductionsincreases of a fixed amount of power generally much less than MW in Bruce Bs  MWe net units an average overall ramp rate of only ..min. This is quite slow but from what I understand they are operating under extremely conservative conditions to minimize impact from ramping especially given the older infrastructures limitations and the ramping also usually occurs at two primary rates the faster phase being about .min. The semirecent policy change that reprioritized nuclear curtailment behind wind should have markedly reduced the amount of steam bypass operation while also saving IESO a substantial amount of money in the process due to greater flexibility with curtailing a bunch of small wind turbines tax credits be dammed.Curious about the slow ramp rates seen in this very small snapshot of Bruces curtailment actions I checked the CANDU  plant control documentation to confirm actual ramp rate limitations which are constrained by turbine flange stress during maneuvering to an absolute maximum of approximately min. So min is not an inaccurate ramp rate and appears to be the aimedfor upper ramp rate. Adjustments can actually be made at .sec but thats obviously going to destroy the turbine if sustained. The reactor itself can maneuver output at sec but due to pressure change issues it cant sustain this rate when running the turbines so maneuvering is normally done at a much lower rate.The Xenon poisoning issues are as big of an issue as you suspected with the CANDU  design. You can effectively and quickly maneuver the reactor output down to  and back up without any poison issues. You can also quickly maneuver the reactor down to  ramping only a little bit slower? but subsequent return to full power is much slower and trickier.,energy,de1mate,2,t5_2qhkd

10894750,0,t1_de3p869,My issue is when I talk to people about renewables they discuss wind and not solar more often so the opposite problem you are having. Well that was more true about where I used to live but still. So they would talk renewables as a group and then talk about how they dont like wind for some reason while gliding over solar. Really my complaints about people who dont like renewables is that they tend to either ignore carbon costs which in their defense is true of most governments too or they have a strange sense of entitlement. Ive heard everything from people saying they are poor because they dont have dryers which would make most Europeans poor as well to an energy cost as high as Germanys would completely ruin a first world economy. Please note Germans pay about cents a kWHr. Personally I think Nevada should consider huge solar investment and transmission lines and use their obscene amount of solar irradiation and space to set up a zero carbon output to neighboring States. It would take some investment now but the lifetime costs of solar are likely to be pretty good. Even better though is that neighboring States like California are often without the needed power in the summer and are passing environmental standards for energy that make renewables more attractive. If Nevada subsidizes EVs in the State with a battery buyback program after so many years or a slightly higher repayment they could see themselves with a decent sized battery lot which was cheaper than buying all at once and lower CO emissions.

A nerve racking but fun experience is what I can promise you.Control different powerplants invest in renewable sources and manage your resources.Show me what youve got! I would love to hear your feedback regarding the mechanicgameplay.If you enjoyed the game please follow my channels to get updated and help me grow this communityFacebook Twitter Thanks!,energy,dffksw5,10,t5_2qhkd
11333442,0,t3_61qizn,This article still kindof assumes a successor to take over the AP design. Im not so sure that will happen  as far as incumbents go they all have their own designs they want to market. AP is not a particularly interesting reactor design anymore neither from a financial or technical point of view. IF any company would want to buy it and its associated liabilities it would have to be a large industry partner with deep pockets and no nuclear experience or only exploitation experience. Neither within the US nor Japan would any company be interested  utilities are shedding their nuclear assets and equipment manufacturers are too poor. So whats left? Investment companies governments?From my seat at a distance it seems like AP is very close to death.,energy,dfgmjql,3,t5_2qhkd

11439663,0,t1_dfsmc4y,There are ways to deal with the chicken and egg problem. A lot of which require addressing public perception and getting some political will behind it and some subsidies. CA is doing that on some scale which is why its the only place with a reasonable number of stations. Those only get traction when people have an accurate and reasonable understanding of the technology. Whether FCV and BEV are more like diesel and gasoline or gasoline and natural gas and relative market share is going to depend a lot on just how fast H infrastructure rolls out compared to battery prices dropping.If you really want to know why youve been promised hydrogen for years now but it hasnt materialized Obama killed hydrogen programs for a few years when he took office. There were large scale demonstrations in the planning stage that were totally scrapped for what seem to be political reasons. In any case the the main technical hurdles for hydrogen fuel cell infrastructure investment aside have basically been solved. Whether or not that pans out into actual adoption at this stage remains to be seen.The two biggest opportunities for getting Hydrogen infrastructure will be long haul trucking and large scale grid storage. How far down the tech will cause FCV to reach I dont know. ,energy,dfsobdc,1,t5_2qhkd

11446339,0,t1_dftce2r,Ceiling fans are of course really just propellers. The efficiency of a propeller depends on basically several things The airfoil section used the blade planform chord size vs. radius and twist distribution. Most ceiling fans fail in all three categories  They use a flat section not an airfoil  they have a rectangular planform and  they are untwisted. Theres no doubt that they are quire inefficient.The efficiency also depends on  the solidity basically the number of blades and  the advance ratio basically the speed. I havent though enough about these issues to say whether these are OK for ceiling fans.Here is a patent for a high efficiency ceiling fan with an airfoil section tapered planform and twisted blades. It claims to produce  more flow per watt. ,energy,dftfkvk,44,t5_2qhkd
