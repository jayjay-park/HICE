8001876,0,t1_d4f1ada,I would talk to the owners of that rail and see if it could be added to our network for free. I really just want to make rail systems everywhere the same and avoid for profit rails. As in city would provide the materials for the rails and we would do all of the labor for only a few diamonds  tool costs. I am getting alot of requests for work so we should have plenty of people which decreases tool cost and increases tunneling speed. So I expect that with a crew of  a rail would cost D per mile this is a very rough estimate do not quote me on this.If rails are already built we would acquire them and then make them follow our standard rail model which will be voted on by the community when we come up with good designs.,Civrail,d4fhj60,1,t5_3f3zq
