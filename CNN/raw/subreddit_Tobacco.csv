690089,0,t1_cgip9sy,Obviously reducing frequency is the way to keep the buzz avoid  delay addiction and generally reduce harm but the question is just how much you need to reduce frequency. Presumably there are some pretty distinct diminishing returns as you increase the length of time between uses. I highly doubt that waiting a year between packing lips would offer any tangible benefit compared to waiting six months. Hell I doubt it would offer any tangible benefit compared to waiting one month. On the other hand Id expect that using dip daily would develop a tolerance much faster than using twice a week.Personally twice a week seems like a pretty reasonable number to me. Do you think thats too frequent? Do you think I could push things further without building a tolerance or getting too close to addiction?,Tobacco,cgipr37,2,t5_2qndw

1738279,0,t3_2divhn,I agree that a tobacco product should include tobacco.Although ecigarettes are confusing for newcomers to understand. Even the name ecigarette seems misleading to me. It took me about half a day of research to understand what an ecigarette is and what it does. Its doubtful that a constituency in Michigan or almost anywhere where nonsmokersnonvapers outnumber smokersvapers will take the time know or even care about how ecigarettes operate. The majority of people dont use ecigarettes. The majority of people obviously dont understand ecigarettes. From a politicians perspective it makes more sense to placate the uninformed majority. Perceptions often take precedence facts.Quick tangent Its common to hear that ecigarettes are not  safe or that ecigarettes may be dangerous. Nothing is  safe. Not secondhand smoke. Not my car. Not even the chair Im currently sitting on. The question should not be Are ecigarettes absolutely  safe? The question should be How safe are ecigarettes as opposed to cigarettes?If we can discover the actual detriments of ecigarettes then perhaps we could eliminate or mitigate them. ,Tobacco,cjy9vmo,1,t5_2qndw

2122244,0,t3_2iooks,s are still my standing favorite cigarette but I smoked Spirits for a year. My personal preferences of Spirits are the YellowsgtLight Blue. The rest of them are not going to do you any good if you were a fan of the smoothness of s. Light blue is smoother than yellow but yellow tastes better.,Tobacco,cl9l0lw,2,t5_2qndw

Therefore its the governmental incentive to reduce costs of which tobacco related diseases would account for a sizable proportion. The government is retarded about money usually so they would waste it anyway on entitlement spending or some other boondoggle so Ill keep enjoying myself by puffing away as Mrs Obama keeps bloviating about fruits and veggies.,Tobacco,cm193oi,5,t5_2qndw
