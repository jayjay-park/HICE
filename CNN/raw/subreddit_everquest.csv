274195,0,t1_cf95vaa,This is so what I am hoping for myself.  Im having a lot of fun in Landmark though it makes my machine crap the bed.  Ive played so freaking many MMOs and not one single other game has held my interest even near what EQ has.,everquest,cf96kws,1,t5_2rosz
314820,0,t3_1xnv4a,First of all DO NOT Alt Tab out to box.  It is okay for PLing as the toons are not grouped and your mainly keeping the DS up on your second account using a mage to PL Of course once the mob is down around  heath you can always just melt him with the mage at that point your nd toon will still get the exp.Id recommend using WINEQ which will make your task switching between EQ faster and smoother.  Alt tab in a zone with lag you will be looking at a black screen while your toon is dying.You have a MAGE.... Level him just a couple more levels till you get your first beam This will help tons once your second character is within grouping range as you can gather a few mobs and beam them with mage not really beam kiting but faster exping.For you second toon you need to make a decision if you desire more static STAND and FIGHT grinding with your two accounts than by all means pick something that lends itself to that SK would be my choice With your pet on assist and able to off tank if needed and the SK pet.... well Ive always consider the SKs pet as a mana free dot ltSmilegt.If your desiring more of a stick and move kinda play style Id go with a druid or ranger.  Both add tracking ability to your team the druid offers healing and the ranger adds ranged DPS That is the choiced you would have to make do you desire the head shot ranged dps and additional melee DPS the ranger brings OR do you want the healing and porting abilities the druid brings.What appeals to me is the thought you could be MAGE DRUID WIZZIE MERC WIZZIE MERC  Talk about melting mobs!  The mage pet could be used to Rescue whichever character took agro and the druid to evac you out if the gang was getting overrun.  But with AE snare on the mobs from druid and click up AE burn on the mobs from the mercs and the mage beaming well I see pulls of  mobs just melting. Benny,everquest,cfdef3w,1,t5_2rosz

567168,0,t1_cg2kk9p,I disagree.  The Shaman class is one of the best soloing classes in the game.  With moloing Using mercs many classes that would never dream of soloing now do so using mercs A Shaman could solo before mercs and certainly can solo using them.I easily farm VOA and ROF T zones with my Shaman.  YES lately I have been blasting exp to my boxes and now can relax a bit more and let my level  Ranger and level  Druid do things Which leaves me doing DPS rotations on shammie while the rnage does the pulling and crowd control and druid does the healingtrackingtransporting.I do agree DPS isnt supposed to be Shammies strong suit.  But dont forget Shaman get Necro like dots.  If all Im doing is slowing and Dotting my DPS parse is very respectable.  With  AAs maxed our dots proc pets frequently and it both group and raid setting its not uncommon for my shammie to be cranking enough DPS that I need to pause rotation to avoid taking agro I ignore the agro meter till shammie gets up to around  cause when the DPS gets cranking  to having agro is less than two ticks away.

While nothing compares the to thrill we had when Ice Comet first came in and we went around tossing that spell everywhere and anywhere LOL.Mages and Nercos have caught up in many respects.  With proper foci and such a Dotting Necro is running a burn rotation of dots that does an amazing amount of Sustained DPS Some dots are ticking for k per tick which is impressive.  Mages max AA with foci and adding in Pet damage give Wizzies a run for the money on top parse.  BUT...... After saying all that Wizzies can and do in fact top both the burst caster and sustained DPS However I do believe for LONGER burns the Necro and Mage may be able to catch and beat the wizzie out.

3622765,0,t3_31t4zu,I just started playing again and am  boxing.   I would stay away from melee heavy groups as they are harder to box.  My setup is SKClrEncMagWizBstThey just hit  and melt stuff.  There is a lot of mana regen pet dps and added caster dps synergy with that set up.  I have been nonstop killing blues in the grounds hotzone from  without ever stopping to med.I would avoid shamans and bards in a caster heavy group.  I would avoid Necros as group mobs die to fast.  I would avoid duplicate classes like Wiz x  because I think that is less fun.  Your paladin tank should be fine and fairly easy to box.  You wont need to worry much about splitting pulls as with an enchanter you can ae mez.  Or at the very least you can pacify before the pull to make it smaller.  Either way once you break the camp up you will be killing so fast that you will pull as soon as a mob pops so you wont have multi pulls.If you have any questions shoot me a PM.,everquest,cq57zxu,3,t5_2rosz

3975089,0,t1_cr9ct0l,I dont know.  Its really hard to say which classes will be most in demand for grouping since it depends on how many are playing a given class.The holy trinity in early EQ was tank warskpal cleric heals  and enchanter mez slow haste clarity and were the classes most in demand.  Enchanters fell in demand as expansions went on since content spaced mobs out more so mezzing  at a time was no longer needed.  And the clarity mana regen buff became a long duration so you could grab one in pok or from a friend or something or use a clarity potion.  So shaman often took over the role there as slowerhastemelee buffs.  A druid has its plusses and minuses.  Sure a cleric will get chosen first for the healer role in a group but when the cleric has to go its common for the group to fall apart too.  So at least when I played you were expected to find a replacement and wait until they arrived before leaving.  As a druid if you get the job of snare dps and do some backup heals if things get messy you can leave a lot easier since the group can keep going.  Expect to get lots requests to teleport people.   Druids are good soloers so it attracts people that like that style.  Hard to say what ragefire will be like.  If I play there Ill probably mess around with a few different classes and see if anything sticks.  Im in no rush to get to  though.

You can run multiple instances out of the same install folder but it seems to run better if you just make an additional copy of the whole eq directory.

While most of us are well into leveling our mains a good number of us have alts we are starting and Im sure someone would be more than happy to meet you and play with you.  The method of inviting to our guild is actually the method you described above specifically for people from Reddit.  Im sorry you had a negative experience with that hopefully it wasnt Ubiquitas  With a casualsemicasual guild like us it is hard sometimes to justify spending a half an hour of your one hour window running across Norrath to invite someone.  However I have yet to encounter anyone who wouldnt take the time to guildinvite someone that took the time to run and meet them wherever they are! Especially someone from Reddit.  If youre willing to make your way to any full member I guarantee you will get an invite.  In the rare cases we have no one close by we normally ask a druid or wizard that isnt busy to head your way  but we dont have enough of them online all the time and not in groups to do this right away.  Some of our newest members and lowest level at that have run half way across Norrath for an invite.

No good can come of naming and shaming nor threads discussing such even tangentially that process so no reason to keep them open.If they arent prepared yet as a company to address the other part no number of threads is going to get them to accidentally leak something.I do think they should just come out with a sticky thread that says like We all see what is happening on Ragefire and agree that the self policing is not a real option.  We are discussing where we go from here and ask for everyones patience as we find the best solution.

That isnt to say there isnt more nor that some lesser content may not be doable. Not sure that Firstborn of Daosheen can be boxed possibly  grouped. It depends on the mechanics of the fight.The key part is being somewhat good and the kicker being the flagkey reqs.  The latter isnt so much an issue if youre friends with someone who has access.  The former depends on level.  Youll surpass the gear wicked fast aside from some clickies so farming isnt really viable for pure upgrades. I pause leveling  alts around  for OoW and epics though and run PoTime for Quarm.

7900969,0,t1_d43jibg,They almost did a great release on Ragefire. They instanced zones to help with population which helped a ton almost instantly. Then in typical Everquest fashion decided that raid zones shouldnt be instanced and thus killed the momentum that such steps had taken and created a second server shortly later to mitigate this decision. Then later they went back on this design decision and created secondary instances to raid zones. I am playing on Phinny and am enjoying it. But ive always enjoyed the kneejerk reactions that the dev team has employed over the years.

8718547,0,t1_d6tz4g0,Speaking of Druid tactics Ive been wondering about something.I recently started playing again after a very long gap quit in  or  not too long after Planes of Power came out. My main had been a  Wizard but I didnt want to start playing him again because he wasnt far into  and I didnt want to risk getting killed and losing a level while still rusty as I relearned the game. This was before I found out that death penalties are less severe now rezzes are easier to come by and the existence of that veteran reward that gives  rez once a week.I saw that I had a  Druid alt so gave him a try and have been having a blast. In just a few short weeks of very casual play hes  and my jaw is still on the ground from how fast leveling seems compared to . Ive been mostly playing him the way I recalled seeing Druids play in the old days so a lot of snare  DOTs  run while counting ticks so I can briefly sit every  ticks to get medding mana regen. Reapply DOTs whenever they expire until the mob dies.This made a lot of sense back then because EQ then was all about mana efficiency. There was no distinction between medding in combat and medding out of combat.But nowadays with the insane out of combat sitting mana regen rate Im wondering if it would be better to snare  just one round of DOTs  run and nuke the crap out of the mob even if the nukes arent as mana efficient as the DOTs because the faster the mob dies the faster you get out of combat and get the fast regen.Experimentally this seems so but I havent analyzed logs or crunched numbers to verify this. In less time than I can DOT something to death using maybe  of my mana it seems I can DOT  nuke three of them to death using maybe  of my mana and get a head start on out of combat regen and overall come out ahead.,everquest,d6vgi2g,1,t5_2rosz

They cap out at  IIRC but very easily can carry you further. Plus they can be upgraded with other remnants from tier  House of Thule zones like The Grounds or Erudin Burning. That will give them a max level of  I think. There is a progression in the guide that I wrote that could very easily get you to a full set of Tier  House of Thule armor and gear since you can hunt in House of Thule Lower The Grounds and Fear Itself one right after the other with relative ease.All of this can be bypassed if you play on Firiona Vie since you can just buy the armor or the remnants since nothing is No Drop.,everquest,dax4sxg,2,t5_2rosz

10287181,0,t3_5n6tze,Ok let set the story straight shall we.We ran down to Safehall to see if anyone was down there and upon doing so we had a few of your spawns repoped on us to save training you we ran them back towards the entrance where we unfortunately gathered more of your repops as we ran back where Zoomia died in the process and I evaced out from bedroom once far enough away to save training you I notice you left that part out in your little screen shots there when you were flaming and trolling me for evacing out as a so called epic geared Chanter.Secondly after that you claimed to be camping the entire zone from not only myself but also Traincity and other people in the zone at the time who tried to score any camps in the zone also which evidently you ran most the zone off with your bs tactics.From there we discussed in tells that you simply cannot camp an entire zone and that it was disruptive to peoples gameplay time in doing so and goes against the EULA which isThere will be no first in force or engage rules arbitrated or enforced by a Game Master or Guide on any server. We believe players can resolve disputes about camps and raid bosses between each other. Game Masters and Guides will not help negotiate these disputes between players and guilds.Seeing as though we arent talking about any one camp here or single boss but rather an entire zone of camps and bosses then you are simply breaking the EULA and being disruptive to anyones gameplay that steps in to the zone especially when there is no other picks to be had.After that you slung several verbal retaliations at us and trained us several times along with wiping out any mobs we pulled OR tried to pull mind you we were a  man group in bedroom vs your  box team in Safe Hall at the time.After you found out that we had all reported you for your actions by not only myself but other guilds and groups in the zone you found out that twitchtv was also frapsing you being a doucher and that we had actually made this a vocal issues on the forums with no names or shame involved I might add you just vanished off the server. Funny that when you had total control of the zone to begin with and were fucking over everyone and anyone in the process who tried to get in to a camp in the zone.Sure I could add all the chat logs AND the damage logs of you stealing all our mobs and kills along with you trolling us after doing it and what not but honestly I cant be bothered people know who you are on the server and know what you guys do next time you are going to slander and trash talk someone add the entire chat log AND what you did previously and during people trying to discuss with you on coming out on an even ground so that everyone would be happy with a camp spot before hand.Always easy to cry the victim and shit talk only cherry picking what you want people to see. Food for thought why would I even attempt to train you when you are clearing an entire zone? Like the train will even make a dent.....,everquest,dca3wn6,3,t5_2rosz

10374349,0,t1_dcjwlrr,Id argue if a player wants to create a group then there are alot of people available for the motivated group leader. Most folks dont want to lead the group. So id say you wont fin d alot of LFM shouts but I bet if you created and started the group youd get a lot of tells. Easy mode enhancements? A few pieces got those. Like GEBS and Amulet of Insight. But its not game breaking. You see a lot of folks running around with Mana Preservation III? Not unless they are raiding or dropping k plat on bazaar item. Or Extended Range III for healers? They arent so available that they are flooding the bazaar like GEBS and fungi tunics.  Yes when you die you no longer literally lose all your gear and are forced on a naked corpse run. Only reason to get a corpse now is for XP rez. There are private servers out there for the true EQ masochist. The cash shop has helped keep this game funded so nerds like us can continue to play. Thank you DBG... despite what these fools say. Give it a go OP. EQ is a very good and challenging game. There will be no hand holding except from your guild maybe.

10977400,0,t1_dec8egi,They are both boring and busy on raids.  Leads to high burnout.  Keeping up buffs especially when you are the only Shaman is painfull.  Especially with Avatar needing to be cycled through several people and recast every few minutes.  Mix in the debuffing and its   Its important but not very glamourous work.  Youve got melee nagging you because you were trying to land slow on the boss and their avatar fell off and now the whole cylce just got delayed and everyone is going to be complaining because heaven forbid they go without avatar for  seconds.  Then throw in that as a hybrid dmghealer you are going to be considered after clerics for healing gear and after necros for dot gear and after wizards for nuke gear.

Druids have harmony a similar spell but is only usable outdoors but goes through all spell levels.Worst case at  Paladins get fairly long lasting root spells so pull using root on one of the pair let the other come and hopefully it should be dead by the time root breaks especially if you get the  Mages to burn in down Can also reapply root with Druid to keep it at its spawn location if the first fight goes long.,everquest,df6arq0,1,t5_2rosz
