2173212,0,t3_2jpn6r,UPDATE! The world border has been doubled in size. The boundary found at  is now found at . The same goes for the other direction. Enchants and Dergon armour has been removed from the market. Another use for Dergon bones may be added in the future. Players now drop vials of blood when killed. These vials can be fed to a wolf that you own to track that player. The vial will be consumed even if the player cannot be tracked for various reasons.,RunsafeMinecraft,clg2fo2,3,t5_323u0
