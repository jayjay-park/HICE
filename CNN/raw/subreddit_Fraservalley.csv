219181,0,t1_cf3eohq,Regarding the malls  good question. Im not sure the history behind it but there have always been the two malls in Abby. Both are updated but youll find Seven Oaks to be larger and more trendy. Stop by Purdys Chocolates when youre there and grab some BC gourmet chocolate!I live just outside downtown. It is the original historic district but theres not much historic about it. If you head to Townhall Public House youll be in downtown and you can check out the main street Essendene.Now that I think about it Abbey Road Taphouse is right next to a couple hotels. This could be useful if you plan on getting shitfacedlaid.,Fraservalley,cf3es5b,1,t5_2tfu5

Last I read on the abbotsford news we were supposed to have a needle exchange. Tired of constantly coming accross used needles in our parks.,Fraservalley,d71gcrl,1,t5_2tfu5
