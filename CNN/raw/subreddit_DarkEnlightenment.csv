627057,0,t1_cgbiu6w,You know if whites ever embraced ethnic centrism and violence again they would undoubtedly be far superior at it than other ethnicities.   See colonialism.   Physically and militarily they are very much still capable of asserting dominance.  Only cultural pressure prevents this. The last thing you want to do is deliberately provoke them into this position and to eliminate a peaceful option.  If culture continues to trend in its current direction eventually most whites will realize that they must react or face extinction.  If this turning point isnt managed correctly and groups dont refrain from imagined victim status the blood letting might be worse than world war .

933413,0,t3_24qm8b,gtNonideological. Theories that have an ideological flavor and that call forth strong emotions tend to be pseudoknowledgefor example the theory that behavioral differences between men and women are entirely due to socialization. Reality is unlikely to conform to ideology. Bravo.gtConsider now the claim that democracy is better than dictatorship. This claim fares reasonably well with respect to the above list. It is a reasonably simple idea. Virtually all experts in political theory accept it. It is supported by a good deal of experience with democracies and dictatorships. ch. . And there is little or no counterevidence. Admittedly the claim fares poorly on some items it is a fairly ideological strong general claim. As this case illustrates genuine knowledge does not always exhibit all of the above characteristics nevertheless there is some tendency to find each of those characteristics in a genuine item of knowledge. Sort of dances around the issue without actually considering that maybe democracy doesnt work as well as would be liked...  Considering the tone and topic of the rest of the paper.  I wonder if this accurately reflects his thinking.He is also pretty proimmigration but there are known examples where this can cause a problem.  Restricted immigration is more in line with the overall argument because it is more preserving of the status quo of the area.gtImagine that someone asks you for directions to a local restaurant. If you have no idea where the restaurant is you should not make it up. You should not tell the person some guess that seems sort of plausible to you. You should tell them you dont know and let them get directions from someone more knowledgeable. I have done some traveling abroad and in some countries this is exactly what they do.  They dont want to lose face so they just tell you some BS about where the restaurant is.  It seems so self evident to think this way that unless you have directly experienced another culture that doesnt you dont realize how much of a western way of thinking it is.

1301324,0,t3_28zkxa,Seems like the same ol same ol.  First he argues that the enlightenment was surely a good thing because technology and society improved. Well technology has almost always been improving and I dont think you can definitively argue that the industrial revolution was the result of the enlightenment. Whatever system that was around when the industrial revolution kicked off would surely consider itself automatically better than all other systems. Then there is the presupposition that alternatives to enlightenment wouldnt have experienced any social progress either. In fact many monarchs were reforming their nations when revolutionaries took over. The French Revolution occurred in the face of an enlightened monarch who was actively reforming the country for just one example. I also laughed when north Korea was used as an example of a reactionary system. Marxism is   a child of the enlightenment.  I like how people think that they can win arguments by defining everything bad as against them and their ideals even when the opposite is the case.I could even criticize the fact that the author basically ignores how democracy has led to greater inequality than has ever existed and not just in the US. If your argument is that we need democracy to protect us from aristocrats then you are contradicting yourself. ,DarkEnlightenment,cig0kla,3,t5_2xhxs

1608403,0,t3_2cknw3,Im giving my own personal perspective here so Im not sure how well it matches the ideologically pure ideal of Dark Enlightenment..  On LbertariansOne thing that Ive found in my own observations of humans is that were basically selfish and selfcentered if left to ourselves.  Im Christian so Id call that a sin nature but one of the things that cure me of all the libertariananarchist leanings I had in college was just plain reading the newspaper.  Left to ourselves were going to game every system possible to our own advantage.   .  On RightWingWell it would depend on what you mean by right wing.  In some ways it would be liberal in other ways conservative.   The point is to put the society back on the path of what actually works and what works best for all people.  What works best is to allow the cream to rise to the top meritocracy and at that same time protect the weak not rig the game to hand them things they dont earn for themselves but make sure that they dont starve.  The liberal part is protecting the weak the conservative part is the meritocracy and the dissolution of the setasides and other cheat codes that allow some to go around the need to earn their place in the system.  . DemocracyDemocracy is the worst form of government possible.  The quick version of how Democracy works and in mitigated form republics as well would be the Wikipedia model.  Everyone no matter how well or how poorly they understand the topic gets to edit the Wikipedia page.  Which means that the edit of a janitor is equal to the edit of a nuclear physicist  even when the subject is nuclear physics.  The same is true of democracy.  The vote of a scholar of Middle Eastern history and politics is equal to the vote of some person who thinks that Islam is totes kewl and someone who thinks that all muslims are terrorists.  The same is true of doctors and health care.  Im sure that a room full of doctors and health care providers could figure out whats wrong with healthcare and how to fix it.  Im also pretty sure that the solution would not go over well with voters.  This is the problem with democracy  the solutions that would work are not possible because you couldnt get the proles to vote for them.  There are other negatives.  One is the politicization of amost everything.  Because democracy means that everyone can vote it also means that catering to any sizeable minority can swing the election your way.  Which leads directly to things that the state has no business deciding suddenly becoming highly political.  The choice of words in a document the sex life of a private individual the personal opinions of a CEO a random misused word the name of a football team  all of these things are matters of public debate.  Not because they are of earth shaking importance to the people of the state most of them are not but because someone could make a political issue or a lobby effort and get money for fighting that bad thing.  What this means is that the average citizen is tasked with complying with anything that the loudest voices want.  If you think that some group is poised to lobby their way to power its best to preemptively go along because not doing so can cost you in business or in relationships.  What is done in private is thus a matter for employers among others to watch and preemptively monitor  lest some careless tweet or facebook post say something that later will prove that the company is not PC in some way.  If the average citizen isnt voting a lot of that goes away.  What difference does it make to a lobby what someone who doesnt vote thinks about them?  Why would they get pissed that some one disagrees?  They are not going to make law and the government enforces it.  Another thing to think about is that democracy promotes short term thinking.  If it cant be done and show good results in about half of the shortest parliamentary term the public will turn on the initiative.  In the US thats about a year.  In nations with a recall system the time drops rather dramatically.  You cant take on a  year project and unless its really popular youd have a very hard time taking on a  year project.  So you cant reform the systems that need reforming because it would cause short term pain and the reward would come to late to save those foolish enough to try it.  lawLaws exist to serve several purposes..  To curb behaviors that are bad for the social fabric.  .  To prevent what is commonly called the ruin of the commons  where people abuse public resources for their own benefit while not caring for it and making sure that its available for those who will need it in the future. .  To protect people from abuse by the strong. the stateThe state exists to enforce the laws on the books to protect the people of the state and to push society into the position where it will be able to prosper in future generations.  .  religionI think religion is an important check on the elites as well as government officials.  its also an important preservative on society.  The social mores taught by religion prevent people from becoming selfish..  free speechI think free speech is essential for growth.  unless a wrong view is challenged it wont change.,DarkEnlightenment,cjhwngd,1,t5_2xhxs
1625326,0,t1_cjjxzx3,Personally I despise Mussolini and Hitler and Im also not a fan of socialism at least not any of those forms Im familiar with. The only political movement Im currently curious about is revolutionary syndicalism  protofascism. If you are familiar with Gabriele dAnnunzios reclamation of Fiume thats what Im currently interested in. I find it really fascinating that for a short time it was political laboratory extended into the size of a city and they also harbored home for socialists nationalists anarchists and so on.They actually found fascism and anarchosyndicalism and antifascism too. Their political stance was somewhere between futurism and socialism but the constitution was written by a syndicalist named Alceste de Ambris. Their inspiration was still closely related to antiquity as some of their political activities were identical to what Plato suggested  like bringing monocultural unity through listening same songs city wide through broadcasting. They also hold parades every other day as a ritual to revitalize the minds of the population into the constant realization of a revolution.  This was practically the birth place of the notion which gained its robust imitations later on in the forms of both socialists and fascistnazi regimes. If you are interested to read more about this city Id suggest to start here.What Id really want to happen is a second Fiume but with better management and without the total embargo which would hinder the poitical process.,DarkEnlightenment,cjk1dds,1,t5_2xhxs

If such countries can draw on a world food bank in times of emergency the population cycle of Figure  will be replaced by the population escalator of Figure . The input of food from a food bank acts as the pawl of a ratchet preventing the population from retracing its steps to a lower level.

Governance like fine painting is best performed by experts raised for the role from birth not by popular vote. Democracy is too many cooks in the kitchen. This elimination of participation in governance by the masses what Evola called apoliteia is our goal. In contrast to the Marxistprogressive doctrine which seeks to politicize absolutely everything in daily life we seek to depoliticize life and let natural human social reality take its course.

2158801,0,t1_cldsypj,Except that in practice that isnt true.  One of the reasons that people can be left alone not programmed in a monarchy or a fascist system is that since theyre not voting theres no reason to worry about what you think outside of the broad outlines of loyalty to the state and the big ideas of the state.  Would it matter to the King of Saudi exactly what your position was on various points of Islamic Jurisprudence  it doesnt matter.  You are not choosing your leaders or voting on judges so theres no reason to indoctrinate you to the same degree to prevent degenerate thinking as defined by the state.  They would insist probably on you being a Muslim more than likely a Sunni but beyond the official Sunni Islam allegence and loyalty to the king its not important that you agree with the state that women should not drive.  Its enough that you obey.  In a democracy not only do you have to assent to the laws as decreed but its important that your opinion be in line with the laws that society is based on.  If the majority were to change their mind about a major tenet of Western Demotism for example the equality of the sexes this matters for the state as well as those who benefit from having that idea accepted by the culture.  If youre benefiting from female equality you have every reason to use any hammer at your disposal to make sure that only people on the margins of the society can hold to such thoughts.  One way to do this is through media culture  if you see that in all the music and all the TV shows and all the movies its normal to you.  Another way to do it is to enforce that opinion in all the high power positions of society.  In other words punish people who have desirable positions and commit crimethink.  Once it becomes an economic necessity that people who want high wages toe the official lines the possibility of dissent is much less.  After all since all the winners who thought a given crimethink are fired only losers will crimethink.  Only losers are openly religious because anyone too Baptist to toe the line has been dummed out.  Thus only losers are fundementalists.  Not because you cannot be a high powered lawyer or doctor or businessman and be fundementalist but because if youre too public about your crimethinks youre made economically unviable.  I think homosexuality has honestly won most of its acceptance this way  not by actually changing minds and definitely not in the south but by essentially making it economically impossible to hold the wrong opinion and at the same time hold a high profile opinion.  I personally expect trans issues to go the same way.  Once it reaches critical mass youll see the first transphobe removed from a high profile position.  After that acceptance will be the norm because the UpperMiddle class will have gotten the message  namely you cant publicly oppose this because its going to cost you your nice middle class job and the respectability that comes with it.  Once that and the media get in line theres no escape from the brainwashing.  But such a thing isnt needed in authoritarian societies.  Since power doesnt come by the ballot simple obedience is good enough.  Its good enough that we are forbidden to withhold services from gays or that trans folk be allowed to use the restroom they prefer.  My opinion unless Im either going to disobey or rebel is of no consequnce.  ISIS doesnt care if the proles or the lumpen proles in its lands agree with their interpretation of Islam.  They care that they OBEY.  They dont care much what you think.  They dont care if you think that the Kalif is legit or not.  They are going to make you obey the rules.  Its the mentality that your boss has.  He could give a fuck less how much you agree with his decisions he isnt going to indoctrinate you on them.  He insists on your obedience and as long as you obey youre fine.  ,DarkEnlightenment,cle8ejg,3,t5_2xhxs

3451513,0,t3_2zrots,I am not sure how much CO actually affects the climate it very well may cause an increase in temperature.The problem I have with climate environmentalists is the claim that it is going to cause some sort of destruction of the whole world and everyone is probably going to die. Read that againgtClimate change is going to cause some sort of destruction of the whole world and everyone is probably going to dieDoesnt that just sound crazy to you? Havent we always been hearing doomsday prophecies of one sort or another?  came and went with no problems.I agree totally that CO concentrations in the atmosphere are increasing and the burning of fossil fuels causes some or most of it. However I dont necessarily think anything bad will come of it. CO is a natural part of the life cycle. Plants fixate CO from the atmosphere. RuBisCo is the enzyme which fixes gaseous carbon into simple sugars in plants. This is arguably the single most important enzyme in existence. All animals and fungi and most bacteria are dependent on this enzyme working. It creates the food for those organisms. It also happens to be one of the least efficient enzymes. That is it doesnt work very well at doing its job surprisingly. It is very slow and it also catalyses oxygenation of its substrate rather than fixing a carbon dioxide molecule at fairly high rates. When oxygenation occurs the energy is completely wasted. Some plants have even evolved special CO concentrating mechanisms to try to combat this problem. Increasing the carbon dioxide concentration of the air should make plants better able to use this enzyme. In other words the expected result of increased carbon concentrations should be bigger plants. Agriculture could be expected to benefit from this as well.On another note there seems to be a positive correlation to warm periods and biological diversity Overall more warmth seems to be better for life not worse.So from what I understand about life past and present suggests carbon dioxide should not cause that much of a problem. It may even be expected to improve certain things.,DarkEnlightenment,cplp6q6,2,t5_2xhxs

The peak oil crisis can no longer be ignored the problems of price deflation and civilizational collapse are on our fingertips.But lets imagine youre not as cynical as me and think that the problems will be solved how would you solve the immigrant problem? Stop putting up with nogo zones and Sharia bs your country your rules Start allowing for gun access of lawabiding citizens Reduce welfare significantly stop giving free housing health care food and education to people who hate you. A good way to tell is if they commit a crime against a native Swede for example give them the boot or give them zero benefits. Or if they commit a felony like murder rape or arson kick them out. Ive argued and believe the more welfare a country gives to immigrants the less likely they are to assimilate. Its no surprise that the countries with the worst assimilation rate like Sweden have some of the most generous welfare programs imaginable.  All politicians who vote proimmigration should be forced to live in an area that is at least  immigrant neighborhood. I remember reading that many of the top Swedish politicians for example  live in areas which are almost exclusively white. The only person in this fascinating  minute documentary to tell the truth is a Kurdish immigrant.  For the love of God stop feeling shame for your heritage start voting out anyone that does.

Reason of course being defined narrowly around the concept of human equality and harboring a deep resentment towards people who regard other methods of decision making as superior. All power structures must be torn down in a Foucaultian whirlwind of deconstruction leaving in its wake a leveled playing ground for humankind.To me thats the central tenet of Liberalism.

6256174,0,t1_cz0dz3e,I think your reasoning can be reconciled with the point below that women were more conservative than men up until the s or so.Specifically women are herd creatures to a much greater degree than men. Historically  of women reproduced compared to about  of men this obviously created great differences in their respective psychologies. Moreover women are completely defenseless without their social group. Because of these factors women are wired to pursue lowrisk strategies and stick with the social group. This means that they will say do and believe whatever it takes to ensure that they maintain social status within the tribe to the female hindbrain ostracism is literally death.When being married to the father of your children maintaining the household going to church etc. were the only acceptable avenues to social status and access to men and material wealth this is exactly what women did. Nowadays women can achieve social status by progressive virtuesignaling and they can achieve wealth independently of men. As a result women are more leftwing than men in the present day.I agree with you at the object level women nowadays are more leftleaning than men. But I disagree that this is strictly innate on the contrary it is an artifact of the female inclination to pursue social standing uber alles combined with the powerful social value that modern progressive signaling provides.,DarkEnlightenment,cz0rbkv,7,t5_2xhxs

There is no other way to bake that mythos into the American psyche and not have it come to this logical conclusion without the nation suffering a severe case of collective cognitive dissonance.Leftist in its very conception it was always doomed to Brazilification. The only reason it lasted this long is that most people subconsciously suffixed enlightenment amp revolutionary rhetoric with applies only to other European people. Once they stopped doing this the nation changed dramatically.My point here is that what the founders did was amazing. What the settlers did was amazing.

9293858,0,t3_57njz7,While the author of this article makes an interesting if flawed case its clear that his view can have little to do with conservatism in general and nothing whatever to do with reaction in particular. This is why I regard Land and other technofuturists as nonreactionaries and it seems Im not the only oneTo start lets look at the terms for these positions because theyre instructive. The author of this article is a technoprogressive holding a position whose roots lie in Enlightenment thought. The contrary position against which he argues is called bioconservatism Note here the pejorative manner in which conservatism is used the technoprogressive wishes us to understand bioconservatism as backwards holding fast to outdated ideas and retarding progress. Where have we heard this before? This is of course not damning evidence but merely instructive and should tip us off to the essential nature of these positions and their relationship to political positions.Now I havent seen the movie Gattaca and can only give the author the benefit of the doubt that his analysis of its content and implications are accurate. His description of the movie certainly seems typical of Hollywood productions. So the first part of his thesis Gattaca is wrong probably holds true. But from this does not follow the subtitled thesis that a case can be made for technoprogressivism and he fails to make the case. Part of this failure is due to misunderstanding the contrary position.The bioconservative position is misunderstood as often as the conservative position itself Ill get to the reactionary position shortly. The conservative position is not that old is good nor that new is bad as it is often strawmanned by its opponents. The essence of conservatism is simply that there are no accidents in history. The bioconservative merely extends this thesis to the scope of biological history. There are no accidents in history means that broadly speaking things are the way they are for a reason and so caution is paramount when it comes to change. Radical change is almost never a good idea Chestertons fence is relevant here. Whereas the technoprogressive wants to push boldly forward in manipulating human essence the bioconservative says quite simply in response tens of millions of years of natural selection are probably a better guide and his recompense for this painfully obvious remark is to receive all over again the slings and arrows that the conservative receives except tragically in this case from conservatives and even reactionaries.The reactionary position is a stronger version of the conservatives. I know of no bioreactionaries but the reactionary above all is concerned with the human nature that the technoprogressive is desperate to overcome. Any reactionary worth their salt recognizes something like teleology that all things have an essential nature which impels them toward certain goals and which grounds our normative statements. The conservative may or may not accept teleology but the reactionary does and furthermore recognizes that we have long ago bypassed our essential nature and move toward or further into degeneracy. The author explicitly addresses teleology in so many words in the articlegt Behind the philosophical and sociological arguments advocating genetic selection is an additional evolutionary argument stating that human nature and what it means to be human is dynamic and continuously in fluxThe author seems to mean something closer to human physiology here and no doubt makes no distinction between human physiology and human nature. But the thesis is the same we not essentially anything and there is no telos toward which we ought to or even can aim. Whatever the merits of this idea however plausible or implausible it can have nothing to do with reaction.But of course it is not plausible. Nature does have a telosall living beings doand it is survival. In several places the author makes it clear that he andor his sources have completely misunderstood natural selection and have imparted to it progressive mythology. It is clearly evident heregt The survival of the species is in effect the story of adaptation of betterment of improvement Capalan . What we consider to be essential traits are continually being selected and deselected depending on the needs and pressures of the environment.Adaptation to the environment yes. Improvement no. Anyone who knows anything of the biological history of the Kiwi bird will tell you that adaptation to the environment  improvement at least if by improvement we mean enhanced survival capabilities. The Kiwi bird went from flighted to perfectly adapted to an evironment that saw no need for its previous adaptations which proved disastrous in the fulness of time. And this is what the bioconservative is saying we are in about as good of a position to direct our adaptation as the Kiwi except we intend to put the pedal to the metal and redline the act of clipping our wings.Adaptation is simply adaptation. It is not progress. It is not improvement. It carries no normative import. This is what makes progressives who use the word evolve so insufferable they appropriate a concept they know nothing about to push a dubious agenda. Adapation is not progress. Bears that feed on garbage have adapted to their environment. This does not make them better suited to survive and when the novelty food source suddenly runs out they are in fact much worse off than before. What the technoprogressive wants is for us to throw tens of millions of years of adaptation to the wind and start playing Russian roulette. Whatever can be said about this position it is not conservative and it is certainly not reactionary.In the middle ages intelligence was thought of much differently than it is now. A person who was considered to have a firstrate mind was not the sort of person who could solve a problem in a new way. They were not the sort of person who could create an original work. They were not the sort of person who could look at a situation and see something nobody else had seen before. These are hallmarks of intelligence as conceived by moderns. No the genius of the middle ages was the walking textbook. They had a perfect memory and anything else was a secondary consideration. Now today we call these people idiotsavants and while we may look at them as interesting specimens we would not put them in charge of say designing a foreign policy. Yet at one point this single trait was considered of paramount importance and no doubt had medieval European peasants been able to genetically engineer themselves we would all be idiotsavants today. Humans have little more understanding of what constitutes a welladapted person than does the Kiwi. The bioconservative pokes his head above the welter surveys biological history and says nature probably knows better than we. The technoprogressive says step on the gas. What this view is doing in the constellation of conservatism and reaction is utterly beyond me.,DarkEnlightenment,d8u2a0v,2,t5_2xhxs

10728806,0,t3_5thjrc,This article is basically character assassination on Trumps administration and then making wild speculations about what his picks are potentially going to do.  Which is fine but there are more simple explanations.  Trump promised to pick businesspeople and the author seems surprised that those businesspeople happen to be successful and consequently wealthy.  Additionally with the exception of the killing of Iraqi people which was blown out of proportion by the media Blackwater did good work.  Blackwater mercenaries just sounds too good for idiots not to latch onto even though they were basically armed taxi drivers for diplomats.  And the idea that the Ku Klux Klan is an influence in the administration shouldnt need to be addressed from an author who cant differentiate between Richard Spencer and a neoNazi.  ,DarkEnlightenment,ddmlh2x,12,t5_2xhxs

10786188,0,t3_5u7cw2,I think antipoverty programs fuel poverty. In the same way as thirdworld donations do the exact opposite of what they are supposed to do. The people start do depend on the money instead of actually changing something  like lowering their birth rates building infrastructure themselves instead of having other countries do it building a business and so forth. Africa itself is to blame for its poverty no one else. The west has zero obligation and zero responsibility for what happens to the african people. Corruption laziness poor education and backwards beliefs are to blame for their misery. They could change all that other countries have changed and adapted quickly. Welfare is in itself cancerous. The more welfare there is the more people start to depend on it and take advantage of the system. And others have to pay for it. And the whole system just keeps growing and growing until it implodes. Able bodied people need to fend for themselves they need to learn to get by on their own.,DarkEnlightenment,ddsimil,8,t5_2xhxs

11740773,0,t1_dgq67rr,Differences in race are not inconsequential nor simply superficial.  There are relatively large differences between races concerning neurologybrain chemistry development and physiology.  Overall adjusted for ingroup variance genetic variance between the races is comparable to that observed for animals we designate as subspecies.  Controversial The races are different subspecies of homo sapiens or if not something close to that.  Genetic variance is largest between subsaharan africans and any other race than say between whites and asians or any other comparison of the other races.  I did not see Australian aboriginals mentioned in the studies Im citing.  I dont have them on hand right now but can update.  Some things changed about those who left Africa and some things changed to those who stayed.  That said I stand with your position towards racism but we cannot ignore the differences beyond mere superficial traits like hair and skin.EDIT  Another user reminded me to link the sources.  A TON of sources are compiled on this site here ,DarkEnlightenment,dgquhfk,8,t5_2xhxs
