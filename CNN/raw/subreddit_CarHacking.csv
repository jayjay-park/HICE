4275541,0,t1_cs75psd,I do appreciate you reminding me of this it keeps slipping my mind because I have no experience with it but a couple moreknowledgeable friends have brought up the MegaSquirt a few times while discussing this or similar issues. A quick look at eBay makes me think itll still be on the expensive side but maybe itll be worth it especially if the RasPiArduino path does turn out bust.,CarHacking,cs7klfj,1,t5_376ij
4539659,0,t3_3d5738,Daydreaming side of it Any car with a fully documented CAN network.As of right now I will be completely honest and say something like a BMW made in the last  years is definitely a good one. VERY large community that has hacked away on them and documented a lot of stuff. With not much work you could go to town on these.On the flipside I am a diehard Tesla fan. But the carhacking side of me is just horribly disappointed because of them wanting to lock it down so much. I can understand WHY especially with everything being so distinctly interconnected and them pushing towards driverless tech but this would ultimately be one hell of a dream car for hacking if it was even a little bit open.,CarHacking,ct2uqbl,3,t5_376ij
8235319,0,t1_d559jo2,Another noob question data should be coming out of the CAN constantly when the car is idle or on right? How do I actually see that data when I have my obd cable connected to the serial port of an arduino then the arduino connected via usb to my computer?I imagine I just use the serial monitor built into the arduino software.Never really messed with serial things before.,CarHacking,d56yxv5,1,t5_376ij
8340864,0,t1_d5jlayr,Its very interesting but the blog post reads like an ad. How about some technical details RE techniques that were used what functions did you get working etc. Why are three transceivers used? You would think only two would be sufficient. Does your company sell these gateways to people who want to do the same kind of project? How much?,CarHacking,d5k5ufs,1,t5_376ij
