747593,0,t1_cgp8djq,Yes.  They insisted on rubbing their faces across concrete until it came off and gravel burn set in...........  I tried again walking just one and he figured he can just run sideways or backwards without much distress.  facepalm   I tried a  harness that strap around  both front legs like  a bra and has the lead in the front so if they pull or lunge they get jerked to the side...nope they run backwards while turning their head to bark.  I wish i was joking.  They are a bit too smart regarding if they want to do something they will figure out how to do it.  Inside they are extremely obedient.  If i pick up my dinner plate they put themselves in their crate and remain there until i pick my dish back up and bring it to the sink.  They sit and wait to be invited.  They sit and wait to be fed and given the ok to eat.  Its just leashes.  The second we step outside my good dogs turn into little jerks.  ,MiniaturePinscher,cgp9aer,3,t5_2uktv

3584782,0,t1_cq0v3yk,Have that exact problem with my dog and my parents cat. I snuck up on him one day and scared the crap out of him. That somewhat worked. But we just put the food on the counter when my dog and I come over. ,MiniaturePinscher,cq0w69f,2,t5_2uktv
