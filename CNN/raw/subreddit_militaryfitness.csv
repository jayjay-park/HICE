492587,0,t1_cfw7oq8,Ive noticed that too  I dont know how anyone could come to that conclusion though. The beauty of the Olympic lifts is that they promote lifting in the manner that the human body has evolved to lift shit for thousands of years.  Doing isolation exercises is great and all for accessory and supplementary lifting but without incorporating all groups you are wasting energy and time. ,militaryfitness,cfw9e94,4,t5_2zm8p
1421467,0,t3_2a105n,I took the test. Just do  sets of say  pushups  situps  pullups or however many you can do and practice sprints and the mile afterwards. I dont know a single person who practices the basketball throw other than to know how to do it. Its really unnecessary and not that hard to beat average. But pullups shuttle run and mile are the things that set cadets apart. ,militaryfitness,ciugimb,1,t5_2zm8p
3678831,0,t3_2ykz3p,Your best bet is to start mixing in high intensity short sprint intervals... That stuff will translate to longer duration running without really getting in the way of your other training.,militaryfitness,cqbm093,2,t5_2zm8p

11498121,0,t3_644348,I wouldnt worry about it too much. Itll come back surprisingly quickly if you use the right strategies. If I were in your shoes Id do a  week base building block nothing but slow steady state x week in the bpm zone or use the talk test if you dont want to use a HR monitor. Minimum  minutes at a time. After Base Building drop the longerslower stuff and do some tempo amp speed work when youre a month or so out from PFT. ,militaryfitness,dfzb8cs,8,t5_2zm8p
