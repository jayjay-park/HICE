6633631,0,t1_d05ft26,My doctor called it nonobstructive  and my geneticchromosomal screen was normal although I have suspicions about the chromosomal bits. I did have sperm in the ejaculate  if only a few  about  a year before we decided to have a go at having a baby  but I never did again. Im curious to how it evolved over time  but I never tested before .,maleinfertility,d05h3n7,2,t5_2yy9e
7307771,0,t1_d28gzht,I was reading your other posts  given that you have a varicocele as well you are dealing with a double whammy. I agree with Dad. I havent seen it in actual practice but I think it is a good idea.I would also recommend that you try snowballs underwear. They are designed to keep the man parts cool. Cooling can be very effective when you have a varicocele because they can cause extra heat and icing would likely help to improve motility. Feel free to reach out any time. I have a pretty big network of doctor friends and resources and Im happy to help however I can.,maleinfertility,d28udxd,1,t5_2yy9e

Did you get a break down of the types of defects?Viscosity is not typically an issue.I agree that OB wont be very helpful discussing SA results. They dont know very much about male reproduction beyond the basics and typically will refer to RE who also dont know a ton about male reproduction but have pretty strong opinions on both sides of the fence about sperm and chances of conception,maleinfertility,d4rhkgh,2,t5_2yy9e

10004741,0,t1_dbawj4a,All good points.  I also called and requested copies of the test results after each SA my husband did.  I liked seeing the numbers for myself and it helped having something to reference later.,maleinfertility,dbbnacg,2,t5_2yy9e
11035412,0,t3_5xidet,If your testosterone comes back low they will put you on  months of clomid which could boost your numbers high enough to do iui. Its good to see that other then your count everything looks ok so maybe with the clomid and a few lifestyle changes you could significantly increase your numbers. ,maleinfertility,deiua50,3,t5_2yy9e
11193971,0,t3_5zt6sd,This research supports the idea that we have some level of control over our fertility through lifestyle factors.Link to the research Its a systematic review so no new study but compiled and examined what research has been done in order to draw stronger conclusions.,maleinfertility,df0tndw,3,t5_2yy9e
