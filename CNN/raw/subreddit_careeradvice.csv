That doesnt happen without effort so whatever youve been doing you should keep it up!gtMy dilemma is that this company is in the process of acquiring another companyA  person company is acquiring another company?  Thats really unusual.  Where are they getting the money to do so? Is the extra  people per department in addition to the acquisition or the result of it?  If its in addition thats even more money.  If youre hiring  new people and currently only have  in the company thats  growth.  Is the company doing so well that they can afford the growth?  Since youve been basically running the place you should have a pretty good idea of the financial situation.  Does the current sales and expected sales growth justify a  increase in the work force?  Secondly If they are doing so well why havent you been seeing any bonuses?  If the owners are not very competent are they overextending themselves?  That type of thing can lead to going out of business.gtand they offer  paid vacations paid time off flexible schedule casual dress health insurance and untimed bonuses.You didnt say which of these are offered at your current position.  It would be helpful to know what your current benefits are to make a comparison.  Also your current commute time and any retirement benefits k match percentage etcgtbut theres the real chance they will attempt to string me along forever never paying me for what Im worth.Youve been out of school for  months have you spent the entire time with Company A?

6083026,0,t3_3yu02n,I have had office type cube jobs for pretty much my entire adult life. For the most part Mid November to after new years is really slow and the expectation is that you take vacation work from home or have lighter days it helps balance out the times when it is really busy and you wish you had  minutes to look at Reddit. Once you are more established at your job this time of year is great for doing those projects that just never get done  updating contact lists revising training materiels finally setting up rules in your outlook and getting rid of old emails documents. I also like to clean my desk really well. Obviously if you just started none of this really helps you. The other thing that is good to do during dead times is to have some time to spend with my coworkers see if somebody wants to grab a coffee or get lunch  or just pop my head in and chat a little  a lot of office work is working well with other people it is invaluable to have a good working relationship with your peers and can give you good insight into a lot of things. you could also work on setting your goals for next year and starting an outline for your self review  look into some trainings you might want to take  if your company does them. Basically you are going to have down time as you keep working you will have a better idea of what to do when nothing else is going on I also find it useful to write myself notes about projects I want to do when I have some downtime  so then when that happens I have my list of things to do.

7229439,0,t1_d1zdv43,Apologies in advance for the wall of text.  I can literally talk for hours about this sort of thing.  I tried to organize everything to be readable but let me know where it doesnt make sense.For my skills Im similar to you in that Im a generalist and can do pretty much anything except WAN networking.  At one of my previous gigs me and one other guy were tasked with reloading an entire infrastructure.  This consisted of installing a new HA VMware cluster storagebackup solution AD antivirus HIDSHIPS network monitoring ticketing solution along with a Hot DR site for everything while keeping the existing infrastructure humming during buildmigration.  I can do sysadmin on Windows or Linux and program in Java C python and php.  Honestly being a generalist with expertise in a subset of your portfolio is the best way to go.  Theyre really the only type of people that Im interested in hiring since they can see beyond their sandbox understand the larger picture and talk cognizantly with other teams inside the organization.  gtThats interesting and you belong to the Infosec team?Hrm that really depends on how you define the team.  So I work as an implementer for an IT security product.  My customers are the IS groups at whatever organization Im supporting but Im not monitoring the SIEM or responding to alerts.  The tool that we deploy does two things tracks compliance of information systems against various standards and policies PCI HIPAA FISMA and serves as a vulnerability management database to prioritize remediation efforts.  Daytoday is basically  Figure out what the customer wants.  Integrate various data sources required to do .  Build reports to support .  Im more of a systems integrator than an IS guy I just happen to be supporting an IS product right now and work with a lot of IS people.gtAre you on MS mgmt studio or Oracle?Ive worked with MySQL Oracle MSSQL Postgres DB and Sybase.  Im pretty sure thats all of the major and nonmajor DB vendors as well as a few BI tools like SSRS Cognos JasperServer and BIRT.  Databases and BI tool skills translate really well across applications.  If you know one of them you can get around pretty easily in any of them.Going back to your earlier commentgtI feel that most of my beginning analysis work will be working on remediation of the infected machines  so incident response instead.Thats pretty much describes entry level IS.  You spend your time in a fish tank watching a giant screen and responding to alerts.  Its not very fun nor glamorous but its a stepping stone.  But if you come into the job with SQL experience youll almost certainly be able to find a way to use it.  Theres a metric ton of data coming into the tools every second and having the ability to parse it normalize it and make sense out of it is very valuable.  My original response to you assumed that you were interested in going into infosec but it sounds like youre more interested in the analytics portion of the work and see IS as a possible data source.  In the fish tank youll also get familiarity with a whole new set of technologies which will be more potential data sources.  If you have the ability to integrate those disparate systems and build useful and actionable reports from them I think youll find an employer who is happy to allow you do to so.,careeradvice,d1zxm6r,2,t5_2rfvj

This is excluding oncampus recruiting events where any student is allowed to participate.In regards to your interests of web developer or an IT analyst I would say based on my friends working in those fields that it does matter. One of my friends is working at a bulge bracket bank in their IT department and they only hire techrelated majors. Web design doesnt require a techrelated major per se. I would recommend networking your way into a company that specialized in either of these two areas. If you can do this you dont really need to worry about your major.

Theyre basically just there as a metric for HR to weed candidates out or make them easier to choose. I dont have a CBET but Ive thought about taking it and know many that do. It does help especially if you are looking to go in house. It sounds like you work as a field tech now so you should know what youre getting into if you want to go in house. I did field work for quiet a few years and honestly I could never go back to working from an office. Luckily these companies I think I know which one you are talking about I work for one of the other big four imaging companies like having a distributed work force even for managers. If I were you I would go back and get a BS in business  and maybe an MBA and start looking for forward mobility up thats what I did. I miss being in the field but its still nice working from home.Now if you are going to go back in house youre probably going to take a sever pay cut. One thing to consider since you have a  is look at going in house for the VA as a BMET I think they call it Biomedical Equipment Support Specialist so try searching on USAJOBS for that. Most are GS and Ive even seen some GS and once a GS. Again the pay wont be as great but you get really good benefits. Honestly this is the only way I would go in house. Ive looked into it even though it would give me almost a  cut in pay due to the fact that you will have no stress almost infallible job security although this may be changing very soon watch the news and good benefits and PTO.Again if I were you I would not be looking sideways or down but looking up.

Small personal example  I wanted to study Entrepreneurship and Finance in college dualmajor.

Once I received a C in Financial Accounting after my first year in the business program I quickly realized I do not enjoy numbers and mastering this craft is not worth stressing over.  I switched my Finance major to Supply ChainLogistics. I currently have a job in the supply chain field and couldnt be happier!

11786869,0,t3_681kxu,Id start by asking did you enjoy your engineering classes?  If no then that plus your bad work experience together makes a decent argument that you should look for something else go straight to Something New below.  If you did enjoy your classes then Id ask did you go above and beyond in any of your classes?  As in did more than was necessary to get a good grade?  Did you obsess about some aspect of engineering outside of class or took an assignment and got so into it that you did more than was necessary?  If yes then thats a good indicator that you have some strong interest in engineering.  You should definitely not give up on it in this case.  Go to Give Engineering A Chance.  If no you never did anything above and beyond then explore both branches below in parallel.  The answer is not clear until you learned more. Give Engineering A Chance  Its completely possible that you just didnt like those two particular internships.  Companies dont always bother designing the most stimulating internship experiences.  You shouldnt give up based on so small a sample.  Maybe you just didnt like HOW the work was done.  Maybe you are extroverted and at both internships you were among oldies and no one fun to hang out with and thats why the internship felt miserable.  Go explore different types of engineering jobs.  Go read everything you can find on what engineers actually do.  And go do some information interviews with actual engineers.  Ask them what they love most about their work.  See if anything resonates with you.  All this said you may still end up leaving engineering.  The point is dont give up just yet before you explore options.Something New  You may want to start with career testing.  Its hard to make a decision on your career when you have no work experience to go on.  Yet every college student is faced with that problem.  Career testing in a way allows you to bootstrap a little knowledge when you have none.  It tells you people with your temperament  interest profile generally likes xyz jobs.  So they make some good starting points for exploration.  They generally give you a big list of jobs anyways so you have lots to experiment with.  Pick out some that seem interesting and find out more about those.  An engineering education is one of the best you can get to build critical thinking skills and prepare you for success in whatever it is you do in the future provided that you have decent EQ.  So its definitely not time wasted even if you end up making a change. In either case you may want to find out more about careers related to engineering such as engineering project management computer science product management etc etc.  Finally you voiced the concern that you might be preoccupied with lookingfeeling successful.  Sure thats certainly possible.  All the more reason to start looking for something that suite you better.  Because you have tons of time to experiment and pivot.  If you dont like engineering and end up stuck there just remember you will be competing against people who are just as smart as you but they are OBSESSED with engineering which gives them a HUGE competitive advantage.  Even if your scores are the same in school in a few years they are likely to be much better engineers than you are.  Youd be in a situation where you dont like what you do and its wearing on you daily its harder to make a change AND you dont feel as successful when you compare yourself to your peers your peers then would be the engineers straight out of school who was hired around the same time you were.  In short there is nothing wrong with wanting to lookfeel successful youd just want to be longterm greedy about success and not shortterm greedy.  There are tons of other careers that are successful and prestigious that isnt engineering.  The cool thing is that longterm greediness tend to line up pretty well with natural interest so you are doing yourself a favor by asking these questions now and exploring alternatives now rather than five years from now   Good luck!,careeradvice,dgw2x5t,2,t5_2rfvj
