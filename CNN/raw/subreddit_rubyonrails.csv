6073145,0,t1_cy6tha0,Ive used codementor.io not free unfortunately and it has helped me immensely on my first projects. I basically reserved a few hours a week to meet with a mentor with a set of questionsbugs that I couldnt find or understand. If I had none of those I would discuss the feature with him and we would find a way to get me started on it.Ive also found that by doing that you optimize your time and dont end up feeling overwhelmed.,rubyonrails,cyfocty,1,t5_2qi04
6542649,0,t3_458py8,I think umenges first answer is spoton. Ruby on Rails is super useful to get a web app up and running quickly and iterate rapidly. Theres a huge market for folks who can do RoR development and plenty of startups shelling out good money for people who can go souptonuts with putting together an RoR application. More than diversifying your skillset though learning Ruby is a real treat. Its a fun and rewarding language that encourages thinking in interesting ways about problems. Its much less rigid and restrictive than Java I was a Java developer in a past life. Its playful it reads easy and its easy to translate the thing in your head into useful code really quickly. I forgot how much fun programming could be until I shifted from the worlds of Java and PHP to Ruby and RoR. So is it worth it? Id say absolutely. Apart from being worth it to learn pretty much anything new this is a particularly fun thing to learn. ,rubyonrails,czw29xh,5,t5_2qi04
6721334,0,t1_d0dbge9,I am still working through.  I managed to get it working for small inline images by monkeypatching the Messagesanitize method to use a different HTML Sanitizer configuration  but it silently fails if the message is too large i.e. picture is too large .  Will continue testing to see if i can change the WYSISWYG editor to send the images as uploads and have the img tag rewritten to use an upload target path for the src tag,rubyonrails,d0ejlb3,1,t5_2qi04

8609468,0,t1_d6hr40r,Because usually whether someone should be allowed to do something has to do with their workflow not with the preferences of the owner. The software should be designed to make specific workflows useful and easy. The users should not be designing the software so they dont need to configure what people can and cant do.When you let the user decide you allow the user to decide that the workflow isnt useful by disallowing necessary privileges or decide that the workflow isnt simple by allowing unnecessary privileges. ,rubyonrails,d6hs2ok,1,t5_2qi04

10757732,0,t1_ddp0nz4,Ive gone through the book before its a pretty decent guide to learning the basics. Id even go as far to say it is part of the industrial standard to recommend this book for anyone to learn the basics of rails. It covers a large set of topics testing remote actions json and various other topics.,rubyonrails,ddpkvuu,2,t5_2qi04
11075852,0,t3_5y5vq3,Ill answer your question first but youre asking the wrong question and I will explain why.Generally all you need to do to access a remote database is put the URL of that database along with the user and password in place of wherever you are putting localhost.With that being said... when youre developing an application typically you want each developer to have the entire stack running on their machine. This means that you have your own web server any job queues and the database all running on your machine. This development setup should be as close as possible to the production version typically only adding things such as hot reloading and or auto restarting the server on changes. There are a lot of good reasons for this but you should look at the  factor app for the full details. Typically you dont want a shared remote database for development Im sure there are cases but generally no. So Id suggest looking into how to setup a MySQL database locally and developing off of that then have your real database off on some server in the cloud when youre ready to go into production and only have your production application deal with that. ,rubyonrails,denfrst,17,t5_2qi04
11777690,0,t3_67yw8e,Im close to being done with the Hartl tutorial myself and I feel pretty much the same way. I plan to do one of  things. Ive been giving it a lot of thought because I dont want to be adrift and dabbling and not knowing what to do next.   Ill redo the Hartl tutorial but with a different project so I have to stretch quite a bit more to get it to work  Ill continue Launch School I havent finished up all the prerequisites for LS yet but they are very in depth. Its mastery based learning and you have to actually learn and understand before you progress in the program. They say that it is painfully slow and tedious but that you will learn and understand fully when you are done. Ive done the free portions and the teaching style really clicked with me. The prerequisites are very thorough it is definitely not the be a web dev in  weeks! BS that I see everywhere else. The prerequisites require reading quite a few books The Chris Pine Ruby book is one of them and I was halfway through it when I jumped ship for the Hartl tutorial.,rubyonrails,dgv1ebp,1,t5_2qi04
