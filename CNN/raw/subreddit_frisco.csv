My bf and I are pretty social and active but live in the burbs not together because its much easier and convenient to just Uber down to Dallas  days a week than to commute over an hour  days a week. But that might be personal preference. But if you do choose to live in the burbs and be closer to work getting out and having fun is just an Uber ride away! ,frisco,dddactv,3,t5_2txxb
