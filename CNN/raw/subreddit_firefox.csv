13357,0,t3_1u8hul,I agree that memory usage isnt overly important but as an anecdotal finding there seems to be a threshold of windows  tabs where Firefoxs performance drops off rapidly. I have  windows open each with about  tabs some have  some have  I know its pointless but someday maybe I will refer back to some of those tabs. This normally runs fine but it seems that if I open another couple of windows each with there own set of a few tabs the whole browser becomes nigh unusable as it freezes continually. This applies particularly to video playback which becomes unbearable.Not sure if anyone else has found this or if Im just making up conspiracy theories here?,firefox,cefye10,1,t5_2qh4p

Trust me a lot of people went and tried to reason with the developers on Bugzilla in blog comments in Firefoxdev mailing list but all they ever reply with is sorry the removal of this feature has been a deliberate decision by our UX team and they will stay removed. Why? Oh we asked ten people on Craiglist who dont know jack shit about how to use their computer never used Firefox and probably dont know the difference between a web browservand a search engine and they said they didnt needuse those features.Well guess what. They were confused because you didnt educate them. Do you seriously expect someone over sixty to just plop their ass at their computer crack their knuckles and start typing like a hacker? Do you seriously think these people represent Firefoxs user base in the slightest or at all?The UX team along with the developers seem to think so. So they are removing the features Craiglist people have no clue about but different people make a great use of them. And when said people complain about their lack the devs simply reply with there is CTR use it if you disagree with us. Thats like breaking someones leg and offering a bandaid or a onesecond glue to put it back together.

Yes now it is faster than chrome see the article I linked above. This is because of all the work on asm.js.

However maybe it is just me but Ive noticed a not insignificant cpu usage increase by firefox with Request Policy enabled that I dont see when enabling just NoScript. Request Policy obviosly has to do a lot more work because it is literally disabling every data request you havent whitelisted not just scripts like NoScript does but Im not sure if the cpu hit is worth this for me unless I were to only use it sometimes when I really dont want unknown connections coming through my browser.,firefox,cia8vbr,1,t5_2qh4p

1712179,0,t3_2dyycv,Yeah talk about hiding chrome in Firefox If they wanted to accomplish a bigger screen space for content then instead of removing the addon bar and making the tabs and navigation toolbar fatter they shouldve kept the addon bar and made the tabs and nav bar slimmer.Not to mention how bad the v gt v update was. Of course I migrated to Pale Moon before it actually happened but then I cloned my profile and experimentally tried to update Firefox just to see how my setup would look like. The resulting interface was horrid  the address bar shrunk to almost nothing due to a sudden influx of addon buttons from the deceased murdered addon bar may it rest in peace some addons started to misbehave or stopped working completely and most of my userChrome.css tweaks were turned into a worthless pile of text.The whole idea behind the new hamburger button by God isnt that a retarded term was only half thought out  it may look nice if you leave it alone but once you start adding the colorful addon icons it looks cluttered and generally like a threeyearsold kids first play with wax crayons.No its not always possible to make everyone happy but instead of simply stating so and releasing a half assed piece of s product you should do as much as you can to please as many people as possible.Australis could have been a step in the right direction. Its not..But of course there are more things and projects on the web that hide their chrome in a mad rush after either more content space or tabletfriendliness a.k.a. convenience for sausage fingers. Everybody wants to hide as many of the UI controls as possible just to maximize the viewing space by a few pixels and only to make the navigating through the siteapp harder and less intuitive.And the thing I absolutely hate is how everything is so fing big and fat especially buttons. Apparently Windows s standard button height of px is too small so in the Nightly version of Firefox the buttons on the new aboutpreferences page are px. Yes its a game of pixels where one button doesnt matter but once you have like  buttons on a single page stacked vertically  pixels   buttons is far more compact and less scroll heavy than  pixels   buttons currently Firefoxs buttons height is px but that is still better than px. Now add fatter paddings margins and minheights into the equation and its even more clear.,firefox,cjuzdh8,8,t5_2qh4p
1731857,0,t3_2e58bs,I came by this comment in another thread. Reposting it hereFolks. Heres the deal  you get Chrome and youre presented with a fast minimal browser that you cant do much with but oozes raw performance in terms of speed. You get Firefox and you basically get a sandbox to play with and you can do whatever the hell you want with it. It might not be the fastest but it gives you way more control over the browser itself. So theres your compromise. When you boil it down to the bare bones thats the argument youll get. Speed over control.My personal advice I noticed that Adblock Plus slows down FF like a mofo. Consider disabling Adblock Plus and install NoScript instead. It will block ads and you will notice a significant speed improvement.,firefox,cjxgr88,1,t5_2qh4p

Id hope that it wouldnt take very long but it very well might.I also anecdotally know that every single person that Ive ever spoken to about using Chrome vs. Firefox says that they use Chrome because of the performanceresponsiveness.At the end of the day Firefox has been consistently losing market share to Chrome since Chrome came out.

The only way to stop it according to the boss of security at mozzila is to create automated systems that can ensure the code has not changed as far as I am aware no one has done that and I tried finding more about it.Go to the first big quote on this next page for the quote I originally referencedHe said as much as he legally could but thankfully because he cares about the community the message was received loud and clear.,firefox,codpdjd,1,t5_2qh4p

3094581,0,t3_2vfvxv,To enable fps html playback again in Firefox just go to aboutconfig and change the setting media.mediasource.enabled from false to true About the odd switching between flash and html on youtube. That has to do with the ads system youtube has on the videos. Some ads arent compatible with html so youtube switches to flash. That happened to me on Chrome a few times so it wasnt a Firefox thing that had to do with the MSE disabled because the MSE disabled just removed the fps support and on the video quality you only could chose up to  fps on HTML since with the media.mediasource.enabled setting disabled it disabled the Media Source Extensions MSE amp H. and MSE amp WebM VP support for youtube.If go to  and check what HTML features Firefox supports for youtube you will see that only HTMLVideoElement H. and WebM VP have the checkmark with blue background while Media Source Extensions MSE amp H. and MSE amp WebM VP have the x with red background meaning theyre unsupported by Firefox.

3680515,0,t1_cqbswmi,ampampamp Who Owns the Future? sfw gtIn Who Owns the Future? Jaron Lanier posits that the middle class is increasingly disenfranchised from online economies. By convincing users to give away valuable information about themselves in exchange for free services firms can accrue large amounts of data at virtually no cost. Lanier calls these firms Siren Servers alluding to the Sirens of Ulysses. Instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool the Siren Servers concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data centers. For example he points to Googles translation algorithm which amalgamates previous translations uploaded by people online giving the user its best guess. The people behind the source translations receive no payment for their work while Google profits from increased ad visibility as a powerful Siren Server. As a solution to this problem Lanier puts forth an alternative structure to the web based on Ted Nelsons Project Xanadu. He proposes a twoway linking system that would point to the source of any piece of information creating an economy of micropayments that compensates people for original material they post to the web.gtgtImage iInteresting Commodity broker | Futures exchange | Futures contract | Aman Futures Group Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcqbswq oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecqbswq.

4275688,0,t1_cs7jepq,... Its a long confusing at at the time drama filled story. For the purposes of this explanation block is equivalent to ublock. Theres no real difference beyond meaningless changes to the u over time.Basically Gorhill current developer of uBlock Origin was the original developer of uBlock for about a year.On April st  he apparently became frustrated with feature requests and filter list related issues submitted to him rather than the list maintainers and decided he didnt want to maintain the project anymore. He publicly asked other contributors to the project if someone wanted to take it over. Chris Aljoudi took over the uBlock project.About a week later if memory serves Gorhill created a fork of uBlock from the version he had just given away. It took a while but eventually it came out that he had some disagreements with Aljoudi about the direction the project had taken re donations attribution. His fork went on to eventually acquire the name uBlock Origin.So basically were left with a uBlock Origin by the original creator Now technically a fork of the original project though by the original developer AND uBlock the original version but no longer coded by the original developer.As for which one is currently better... its probably a matter of contention. Gorhills Origin version seems to receive more frequent updates and feature enhancements despite the fact that not long ago he felt it was feature complete...ShrugHonestly they both utilize the same original codebase  and havent diverged too much. For the time being either one is probably essentially okay though if youre a stickler for the details youd have to go to their respective github pages and look at the changelogs since April  .uBlock Origin uBlock ,firefox,cs7l6wo,13,t5_2qh4p

Downloading and installing a MB driver could take an hour. On other hand if you want to quickly determine whether its HWAgraphics related you would only have to disable HWA to find out.Obviously the next step would be to update graphics if disabling HWA helped and that is what I would tell OP after his confirmation but like I said you and I have different methods of troubleshooting. You prefer to apply a possible fixdownloading and installing drivers first and hope that it would fix the issue.

4347582,0,t1_csfo7yq,OK so lets say that again. Pocket allows you to add an article to your reading list while youre on PC sync your reading list with your smartphone and then your smartphone downloads the whole list for offline reading stripping the clutter so youve got all the articles in reading mode if you want to. you dont need to click Save As... on each and every article and you dont have to repeat the whole process if you say replace your phone or buy a tablet. and you dont have to figure out how to install IE on your Android smartphone. I get you people you dont have use for Pocket because you dont like reading on a phone. or you prefer saving the whole websites one by one on each of your devices. or youve got only one device that connects to the internet. or you just prefer sending yourself an email with an article you want to read later on a phone or at home. or youve set up your own server and a small herd of highly intelligent hamsters allows you to handle the whole issue much better. I get it and respect your opinions and really admire you for the hamster part. but some of us just like Pocket. I still think it was not OK to force feed Firefox users with it and the builtin service is much worse than the extension and I beat myself for having uninstalled the latter. but I still love Pocket as an idea. ,firefox,csfpdjd,3,t5_2qh4p

A proof by contradictionConsider a hypothetical world in which advertising is ineffective.  Ad agencies advertise their services.  Because advertising is ineffective their service is not valuable.  Because advertising is ineffective they cannot trick anyone into believing their service is valuable.  Therefore no one hires ad agencies.  If advertising is ineffective the massive amounts of money being spent on advertising make no fucking sense.  Even if advertising does work much of it serves to counteract competitors advertising so is pure waste  a further reason why ads should be massively scaled back.,firefox,csr5cps,-1,t5_2qh4p

4739274,0,t3_363n3w,I got tired of dealing with the abysmal load times of amazon.com pages and decided to run some tests and utilize some measurement tools in the browsers to see what going on namely using Developer Tools Network in IE and Web Developer Network in Firefox . which provide similar information namely both detailed graphs of every request and response made for a page in real time. To set the stage I have Comcast highspeed networking which DSL Reports Speedtest typically shows  Mbps download and . Mbps upload speeds. My PC is a highlyoptimized Panasonic CF Intel i running Windows  Pro with  GB RAM and a TB Samsung EVO  SSD.The browsers I tested are Firefox . and Internet Explorer  with Java . and the latest version of Flash  I actually ran these tests a few months ago.The tests I ran all involved an amazon.com link for Polk bookshelf speakers. I ran two basic sets of tests one set of tests were run with an emptied cache and one set was run by reloading the Polk tab after the cache had been written so as to compare amazon tab loading with and without cached results. The Firefox tests were further broken down into three groups Safe Mode with no extensions with Adblock Plus standard filters and with Adblock Plus standard filters plus additional custom filters to filter out additional ads and other amazon garbage. This resulted in eight sets of tests two in IE and six in FF.Finally I repeated all eight sets of tests for the Polk link but using amazons mobile version of their web site by first accessing amazon.commobile to set the mobile site cookie. Thus I ran  different test scenarios running each scenario about a dozen times each and taking averages of the results.For each test in the table below I show the number of objectload requests the web page makes back to the amazon servers the number of seconds the pages take to load and the number of megabytes loaded. However note that these numbers cant be taken absolutes as there was a certain amount of variation from test to test and I ran only about a dozen tab reloads for each of the sixteen cases.I had initially assumed that Firefox was the culprit and also that disabling javascript on amazon was the bandaid fix for Firefox. I had also assumed that IE did a better job in caching than FF. All three assumptions were incorrect. As can be seen from the numbers below IE is every bit as slow as FF its just that the FF tab progress throbber is more honest in showing the progress of web pages loading so it just SEEMS  like the pages load slower in FF than in IE. Also turning off javascript in FF simply reduces the number of load requests for various page objects which of course would speed up the page loads though of course with the loss of important functionality as well. It can also be seen that FF does a significantly better job in caching than IE significantly reducing tab reload times. One final caveat is that for some reason the last request in the IE pages was a POST request that occurred a few seconds after all other objects had loaded. If the time for this POST to occur is ignored IE actually loads the pages faster than FF at least for the noncached case because FF beat the pants off of IE in the cached case as IE apparently does not do a good job of caching the amazon pages.Another surprising result was that the IE page loads produced SIGNIFICANTLY more object load requests back to the server than did FF I have no explanation for this at all. Another interesting result is that Adblock Plus did a very good job in reducing object load requests back to the amazon servers for FF but did not have a significant impact on the overall performance. Same with my custom Adblock Plus filters on FF that is they reduced requests by a small amount but didnt improve performance.Finally I ran all eight tests again by starting with amazon.commobile. And this is where we see really interesting results AND finally see why the amazon.com pages are so horribly slow in loading namely for the Polk bookshelf speakers the amazon.com nonmobile site makes  to  times as many objectload requests as their mobile site takes almost  times longer to load and loads  times as much data as their mobile site!The bottom line is that nonmobile amazon.com web pages are gross pigs on both IE and FF loading massive amounts of ads and objects never actually used. For example I looked at some of the objects being loaded and was astounded to see that most images being loaded never actually appeared on the page. Also there were numerous ads being loaded that contributed to the slowdown.My advice to amazon is to clean up their act if selling stuff is really their primary purpose in life. And my advice to customers is to use Firefox with Adblock Plus andor simply to switch to using the mobile web site from their PCs and see if they find the mobile functionality sufficient.The test results......................................Amazon Full Site..........Number Requests....................|...........Seconds..................|.........Megabytes.............IE...FFsafe.FFadblk.FFcust.|.IE..FFsafe..FFadblk.FFcust.|.IE..FFsafe..FFadblk.FFcustNoCache. ....................|............................|........................Cached... ..................|................................|.............................                                              ......................................Amazon Mobile Site..........Number Requests....................|...........Seconds...................|.........Megabytes............IE...FFsafe..FFadblk..FFcust.|.IE..FFsafe..FFadblk.FFcust.|.IE..FFsafe..FFadblk.FFcustNoCache............................|..............................|..........................Cached..............................|..............................|..........................I dont have any real solutions other than the mobile suggestion but do know that blocking all js scripts from imagesamazon.com  removes significant functionality besides removing a few pics.,firefox,ctrxh5n,1,t5_2qh4p

Later on it always asks you to enter your oneandonly password into a dialog controlled by a remote site.  This allows at least a workaround for deleting an account wo giving your former oneandonly password to any remote site Trigger a password reset use the reset link with a different browser amp assign a new onetime password and use this to i.e. fully delete the account. Your encrypted classa data will be already deleted on the any password change.

5476738,0,t1_cwbm3s7,gt edit I was able to fix the issue by stopping ESET NOD from scanning SSL connections. I believe it was replacing the security certificates with its own. Would you happen to know if this is a valid solution? Am I opening myself up to any attacks by disabling this scan?No that would be a valid solution. The only downside is that NOD now cannot longer scan the website before you load it.The problem with this feature is that in order for NOD to scan encrypted HTTPS websites it needs to intercept and decode them. It does this using a ManintheMiddle approach. This means that NOD will be the endpoint for the SSL connection to the server instead of the browser. It then wraps it inside a TLS connection again and presents it to the browser. The browser has NODs root certificate installed for this.I would be hesitant to use such a feature because of the MitMing that has to be done. Im not familiar with NODs specific implementation for this feature but I wonder how it handles invalid certificates and other security issues.,firefox,cwbpdib,3,t5_2qh4p

5787733,0,t1_cxe9eht,Once again the lazy argument of copying chrome. What features do you think that Firefox has actually copied from Chrome? Mozilla does have some issues in that they responded slowly to the change in market caused by the entry of chrome partly due to mistakes partly due to lack of resources and partly due to the enormous legacy of code they inherited which makes it difficult to make these massive transitions however copying Chrome is not an argument you can easily make. To blame Netscapes decline on a nebulous bloat rather than the bundling of IE in Windows during a time when downloads and the net were much more difficult than now is an act of revisionist history to suit your argument there is almost universal agreement that this comes from Microsofts anticompetitive actions at that time.Your main argument by analogy completely ignores the fact that Google bundles chrome in all of its software Google Earth etc. requires Chrome to get certain features or acceptable performance in other google products Inbox Beta Youtube Chromecast Google Mobile and advertises its browser heavily on some of the most used sites on the internet as a better browser for using Google. This is why Google Chrome is so popular although initially Chrome did have a performance advantage and introduced its now standard tabsontop paradigm which helped it gain massively in user share among the power user crowd. Today however many of those gains have been clawed back with Javascript performance as good or better than Chrome comparable standards support and es just a few releases away. In making the argument that they are wasting time implementing all of these features you are ignoring the fact that these features that you blame for Mozillas decline are actually extremely minor projects led by a few developers who dont work in the platform areas anyway.,firefox,cxeitzf,14,t5_2qh4p
5792961,0,t3_3ui404,As with its desktop version Firefoxs true power lies in its extensibility. Most of its less polished or unexisting features can be resolved with a simple AMO search. Sadly its android repository is still in its infancy but that will change very quickly im sure. Navigation and UI arent the best thing youve ever experienced? Install an addon to enable gestures and choose from a dozen others that will add all the stuff you may be missing from the interface.Google search results not showing custom search options? Blame google. But go ahead and install Phony to spoof your user agent and get that sorted out.The only thing i find FF to be objectively inferior on android is the reloading of previously visited pages. Unless FF isnt caching those pages for some mysterious reason or there is a horrible problem with the actual rendering of cached pages its baffling to me how it can be so incompetent at this when compared to Opera for example where the process is near instantaneous. But im pretty new to the android experience and have yet to explore all of FFs configuration possibilities that too may be an easy kink to iron out.In all other regards its equivallent or better than the alternatives and all else aside its a browser that deserves your support.EDIT But you can make your own decision using Appcrawlr to compare them. Note CM Browser like the main CM app comes highly recommended... I personally think CM is a horrible app and would advise everyone against it. If their browser follows in those steps the old tradition of bundling a bunch of tiny crappy unprofitable tools into a cumbersome master suite that tries to do more than it should and does none of it as well as it ought to id stay away from it aswell. Just the fact that it comes with a builtin excuse for a godknowswhatpassesforanantivirusthesedays should be enough to inform you that this isnt a browser its a oneclick doitallwanabe welcometotheinternet androidstarterkit.,firefox,cxf66ni,3,t5_2qh4p

I answer questions here because it helps me learn more.Even though the standard Windows driver should be okay for something like an optical drive with Win you never know.

6404387,0,t1_czhc4fe,What theyre actually looking to do is have Chromiumlike addons with welldefined APIs that are easier to keep from breaking between versions make it easier to define and control what addons need access to and reduce review times on AMO a great deal. They dont aim to only allow Chromiums addon capabilities but also more powerful ones.In fact they want to retain XULXPCOMlike addon capabilities but in a more organized way that dont have the severe performance penalties that many addons have in the multiprocess version of Firefox. With this approach new users would know the addon can do anything more clearly reviewers could focus more energy on these addons and addon devs could modularize their addons. Those addon modules which are commonly used could eventually be integrated as inbrowser APIs with the benefits of the Chromiumlike addons.Servo will probably never get this advanced capability but then its highly unlikely that Servo is going to replace Firefox anytime in the foreseeable future all signs point to it remaining a standalone browser at this rate even if some code is shared between Firefox and Servo.As for your thoughts on pay to use addons youre being terribly alarmist. Even the Google Play store has tons of free apps that are of high quality so its very unlikely that the most popular Firefox addons will suddenly jump to a paidonly model just because they can. A freemium model is probably the worst we would have to deal with IMHO.,firefox,czhm3k2,2,t5_2qh4p

Most users simply dont care and dont realize that extensions need to be signed since v. There are a lot of vocal users that complain about this thing but when I asked them to give me extensions to sign or to show them how to sign them themselves I only got  repliesThe only issue I think with future versions of Firefox is that they will stop support for plugins. All except Flash player. I dont use Flash Player but I do use Google Hangouts.... for work But when v will hit stable in march  Hangouts will work without a pluginSorry if I seemed arrogant but having the latest software seems like the best choice in general not with Firefox.,firefox,d8z7qs9,1,t5_2qh4p

10007357,0,t1_dbbwmk1,Lets not act like our powerful addons relying on unstable internal code are magically stable software which needs to be placed on a pedestal above all other addons and Firefox itself. We all know they arent we still see those addons breaking all the time despite some addon makers and Firefox devs doing their best to prevent it.Its time to recognize that and let the stable Firefox work towards being actually stable. Its time to let less powerful addons be more stable too. If that means more users have to switch to a build thats honest about how stable it is so be it. Were not the only important stakeholders here.And who really cares if they remove an unstable API that breaks some Embedded WE or WE Experiment? If it was truly necessary to do anything in Firefox they will have to replace it with a new one and youll be able to rewrite your Experiment. And if it wasnt truly necessary for Firefox does it really belong there in the first place?I mean surely all addon authors who are relying on unstable internal codeAPIs knew they were signing up for this possibility from the start. Why cry now that its finally breaking and pretend that we couldnt possibly end up with a better situation? Besides Mozilla could just as easily uplift your Embedded WE API into a stable one if it proves to be in heavy enough demand.On top of that it will now be possible for multiple addons to rely on the same Experiment API. Along with other possible benefits that brings it also puts pressure on Mozilla to keep tabs on whether they will break such WEEs.

11100721,0,t1_deq82je,gt Think of it in another context. If Firefox were a video game series its as if the developers Mozilla are complaining that the modding community didnt provide modding tools for the new iteration of the game. WTF!?To be clear they arent complaining about that. Im complaining about it because I havent seen the addon community offer up much help.gtIts really really confusing to me that apparently it isnt painfully obvious that its Mozilla that needs to come up with a newbetter way to let addon creaters do the things they were able to do beforeI just dont see where you get this idea. Thats what WebExtensions are. The two problems here are simple the time frame that Mozilla is sticking to before they break compatibility with the old addons and the fact that some people want the modding on the final release builds to go deeper than Mozilla is comfortable with on those builds.gtIf Firefox were a video game series its as if the developers Mozilla are complaining that the modding community didnt provide modding tools for the new iteration of the game. WTF!?Thats nonsense. Theyre providing tools people are just waiting for them to do the work without offering much help or insight.
