6450211,0,t1_czmgxn3,Thank you and yeah I am just starting out too. Selftaught.  Started getting really into it last spring so I can build a game review site for myself. I built my profile from scratch but used Bootstrap foundation for the navbar footer and containment.  I just figured it would be cool to have that on there then a standard PDF. ,webdevcareerquestions,czmhqmz,1,t5_3c5h8
