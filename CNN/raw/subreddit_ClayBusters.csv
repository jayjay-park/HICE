1435070,0,t1_civxhnu,Since you dont need fine motor controls from your hands movement should come from between your groin and your nipples shooting off hand is not nearly as difficult as with a pistol or rifle. Just remember to hold it firmly in the shoulder pocket and keep your face smushed down on the comb.,ClayBusters,ciw5v5h,1,t5_2tu4q

3900341,0,t1_cr0uifz,Do you want to be the one to spend your money and not a small amount of it to establish that track record?Remember its not just the cost of the gun.  What happens if it takes a dump in the middle of a tournament.  Ive seen it happen.  I mean I really have no horse in this race.  Not to be flip but I really dont care what gun you buy.  I know that I would buy the gun that I know will work for a very long time without trouble.Im NOT saying the FABARM will be a bust.  But I dont KNOW that it will serve you well for many years.  No one knows at this point.  The Browning on the other hand as I said before is a gun your kids will shoot throughout their lives after youre done with it.,ClayBusters,cr0vfwp,3,t5_2tu4q

7221215,0,t3_4eclrh,gtDo I have to shoot the prelim to shoot the  bird main?No.gtWhat is the prelim?A  bird course thats separate from the main course that allows you to shoot more and if youre good win more money. Its typically held the day before the main event starts. gtWould I need to shoot multiple days or could I shoot just Saturday?Based on this youd have to shoot both days Saturday and Sunday. That being said you can call and ask if you can shoot both your rotations on Saturday. They may or may not allow you to do so.,ClayBusters,d1yzwro,2,t5_2tu4q

8203475,0,t3_4rk1w4,Hey there  I am the proud owner of a Citori . I received mine about  months ago and I will never forget the initial cleaning. While I didnt remove the buttstock I cleaned and cleaned and cleaned and still there was antirust compound all over the receiver and barrels. After about an hour of using a variation of Hoppes and other cleaning agents I lubed the usual areas where metal grinds against metal and took it out for a spin. Havent had a problem since. The fact that your gun wont fire doesnt have to do with an initial cleaning. Whoever you talked to is not properly addressing your issue  it sounds like a mechanical issue. I would ask them to either replace the gun or to direct you to the nearest Browning certified gunsmith for a repair under warranty. ,ClayBusters,d52zlh6,1,t5_2tu4q
9034536,0,t3_52qye8,I shoot a minimum of twice a week in a league. I run a bore snake through it after each shoot and wipe it down with a oil cloth. About once every two months Ill DeWalt clean it attaching a rod to a drill and using a brush attachment to thoroughly clean residue from the barrel after letting Q Maxx cleaner sit in the barrel for  minutes. Same with the chokes. Then I put a few patches through it again using the drill. I treat the wood with Snake Oil. ,ClayBusters,d7xt3q3,1,t5_2tu4q
9408629,0,t3_59i6uf,I say pull the trigger. Hold for applauseIn all seriousness if the gun feels good buy it. I have an I think  barrel that I started using for skeet originally but now do clays and  stand. Works just fine. ,ClayBusters,d98lyjs,3,t5_2tu4q

10951480,0,t3_5wcib8,Oh man that does look like a tiny pad. I typically recommend the Limbsaver Aircell slipon pads to get an individual started mine has resided on  or  different firearms in the short time that Ive had it to verify one portion or another before I purchased a prefit model or to correct a fitment deficiency. The beautiful thing about that particular unit is that the price can be almost half of what the prefit units cost and when you have stopped using it on one firearm you just move it over to the next one  ,ClayBusters,de9kfto,2,t5_2tu4q
