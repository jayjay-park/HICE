9997458,0,t1_dbaddwl,I agree with everything being said about the trade but we cant veto this and have let the whiteside trade through.. we set the precedent that trades must be basically collusion to not go throughSure the trade is definitely one sided but the owner gave reason just like the whiteside owner so i think i unfortunately vote that it should be a fair trade.
