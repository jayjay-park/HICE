Confidence cant be taught but it can be learned through repeated actions of faking it til you make it in my experience. Its hard not to be discouraged in your situation I get it. But you are not gaining confidence by laying in bed. Get up. Practice your skills. Tell yourself that you can do this negative selftalk is cyclical and you will just convince yourself that you cant. Convince yourself that you can. ,NursingStudents,dekadek,2,t5_2txlf

11659750,0,t3_66di1i,She doesnt have to get an associates before a BSN both can sit for the NCLEX at the end.  I would search any colleges in your area and see what classes she needs for each program prereqs that she has to complete BEFORE applying to the program which she will need to have near perfect grades in to be considered.  You may most likely will find that each program requires something different.  In all honesty her associates in liberal arts might not be helpful at all with the exception of filling gened requirements.  Keep in mind hospitals ARE trying gear towards BSN grads.  However in many places ADNs dont have an issue getting a job and at most they just have to sign a contract upon hire that within the next  months they have to start their RN to BSN program many different options here including online only AND the facility may pay for it or some of it.  If money is an issue I would suggest going the ADN route.  Expect extreme competitiveness waitlists etc.  Its not always easy to get into a program I had to move out of state.  If all else fails consider LPN to RN to BSN.  Make sure everything is accredited and encourage her to get a job as a PCTCNA this will do two things it will solidify that nursing is for her and it will help immensely in classes amp clinical.,NursingStudents,dghnbh6,1,t5_2txlf
