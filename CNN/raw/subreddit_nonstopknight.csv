8819390,0,t3_4zztuk,Dont see how shifting a decimal one place is mental gymnastics. You seem to have worked it out just fine.But to answer one of your points. The numbers are displayed with the trailing zeros because in the software the number is stored as a decimal value float double etc so that it can be used as either an integer or decimal.,nonstopknight,d77yxu7,1,t5_3evq6

9594135,0,t3_5c4rb0,From what Ive noticed the knight upgrades barely helped me in progression only allows me to easily get back to floor  but beyond that nothing else at my current state What I know though is progression is gained with Grande Baron and not moving to deeper floors unless you kill mobs with a single hit.It also seems like if I upgrade my knight the mobs also scale with the upgrades,nonstopknight,d9vo98d,1,t5_3evq6
9627171,0,t3_5cu7wd,Having the game pick a card after  minutes or something so active players dont have to hope inactive teammates log back in eventually. Sorting people based on past performance. The people completing  floors deserve to be grouped together so we can quickly clear. I thought boss hunt was going to be more cooperative when it was announced. I thought the groups would be working on the same bosses at the same time. I realize this is totally different but it would be nice to cooperate with teammates more than compete. The card packs are ridiculously overpriced i would rather spend  gems on gold to upgrade myself and push for first place than on a card pack that half of my group wont use. My suggestion It would be nice if we could donate some our gold to a group member so that people on lower floors could upgrade more quickly. ,nonstopknight,d9zqw9r,6,t5_3evq6
9790168,0,t3_5ff3lu,Its a bit harder to time but I like using whirl for high smashable bounties. When timed right I use Huge Whirl and sail through an area cutting down mobs and smashables. I do use Dag over the crab whos name escapes me just because he leaps alot and lots of times somewhere I am not aimed.,nonstopknight,dajunap,2,t5_3evq6

10122722,0,t3_5kqdjo,I think I was on your team! I was elver and I also noticed how awesome fast my team was. Gj everyone! I normally get teams where Im the most active but this team I had a very hard time even staying at bronze. It of course helped being holidays and all so I could farm allmost all day I noticed that changing getting the right item stats really helped in the beginning like getting  damage on weapon was   damage to my  clones. ,nonstopknight,dbqzwzo,1,t5_3evq6

10689165,0,t1_ddi5cmx,Can confirm that closing the app when you have bounties up does wipe them out. Just had my second wipe today. First when I entered the boss hunt and then when I rebooted my phone when the new batch came up. ,nonstopknight,ddiibg9,1,t5_3evq6

10794255,0,t3_5t268i,You have a certain time to kill the Boss otherwise this one will escape.Similarly if you were to die the Boss will escape instead of killing you.,nonstopknight,ddtcmz4,1,t5_3evq6
10929787,0,t3_5w534p,Ditto. No store no rankings and no boss hunt. Theyve been slow and impossible the last few times anyway. I should quit. ,nonstopknight,de7bwxy,1,t5_3evq6
11476073,0,t3_63o9tp,If its any consolation theres a silver lining to your cloud.I have found that there wasis a single advantage to it boss hunts.Thats really about it for me.  If you are pretty good on pet shards the money it equates to allows you to really fly up the ranks when doing boss hunts and thats a big plus for me.  Its annoying when you are NOT in a boss hunt because Id rather get shards that I need instead of money for ones I already have.  If anyone would be looking for a strategy this is one to use save your Megaboxes in between boss hunts while you are in adventure mode.  When the boss hunt starts transfer to boss hunt then open all of them and grab all your money for the shards you already maxed out which is always a gamble of course giving you massive amounts of dollars.  It definitely works its a strategy I employ every boss hunt.,nonstopknight,dfwt4a9,3,t5_3evq6
11614278,0,t1_dgc9gqo,Hi I tried reinstalling the game and unfortunately it deleted all the progress I had made up to about floor  but thats of no concern to me right now as im sure thats just a drop in the water of what i will be playing eventually. The only issue is that the ad crashing problem is still ongoing. I have tried looking around but unfortunately could not find where nor how on how to contact flaregames directly. Would it possible for yourself or anyone else watching to send me a link or point me in the right direction? Thankyou very much.,nonstopknight,dgchld1,1,t5_3evq6
