4212962,0,t3_394wgu,Have you ever been to rpolandball? Countryballs should be drawn by hand not the circle tool.I suggest you crop out countryballs from existing comics. They will look much more authentic.,TelegramStickersShare,cs0gokx,2,t5_38aqs
4232501,0,t1_crxjfzh,So basically this is exactly what I would have done.The only thing I could do is to look up some chibi versions of the Steins Gate characters via Google images and make another pack.I let op decide whether this is necessary or not.,TelegramStickersShare,cs2own6,1,t5_38aqs

5466172,0,t1_cwa5yd9,When I made a Telegram sticker pack from an existing Facebook sticker pack I noticed that you can change the resolution in the Facebook URL for every image to get a more highres image. The max possible size for the sticker packs I checked two or three was x but it seems to be  for Prickly PearCacti.ampnbspFor example the first image in this sticker pack can be found at this link    Its a x res image. But if we change those numbers in the URL to something like x x x or x then the image size will change to a resolution where at least one side is that numbers length only some numbers work anything else like x will result in an error page.  By guessing numbers I was able to figure out that when you use x on this sticker you get the largest resolution for that image  using any higher numbers in the URL will not make the image larger beyond this point. Note x might not work for all Facebook stickers. Finding a high enough number that Facebook accepts in the URL that will give you the max sized sticker might take some guesswork.  Thus the link to the largest possible size of this first sticker is this  I checked the next sticker as well and its max size is x... Kind of weird the sticker packs I had looked at previously always had the same size for all containing stickers.ampnbspJust felt like sharing this knowledge somewhere. It makes getting the Facebook sticker images in their max size a hell of a lot harder but it shows that it IS possible to make nicer looking Telegram stickers this way. An example is my sticker pack Opi for which I was able to download every image from Facebook in x resolution unfortunately the creator didnt crop those images very well....,TelegramStickersShare,cwacsjb,2,t5_38aqs
