9974303,0,t3_5ibm4e,Super Mario Bros. Was Made By A Pair Of Directors Who Wanted To Make An RRated Cyberpunk MovieWalt DisneyAs we have previously discussed Super Mario Bros. is easily one of the most baffling films ever produced. Rather than follow any of the source material from the popular series of video games the filmmakers instead chose to release a PG version of Blade Runner which as you may have noticed is a movie that absolutely no one would enjoy. And no one did.The Moment It All Went WrongAfter winning the rights to make the film from Nintendo a small studio hired Rocky Morton and Annabel Jankel the team behind Max Headroom to direct. The problem was that Morton and Jankel didnt seem to want to make a Super Mario Bros. movie so much as they wanted to make an Rrated version of Max Headroom full of vague Super Mario references.Warner Bros. Television Walt DisneyAnd now you cant unsee this.For starters their concept was that the video game we all know and love was actually a botched attempt at telling the real history of an alternate dimension. This real history according to Morton had been discovered by the Japanese who had interpreted it into the Super Mario Bros. series of video games but had gotten a bunch of details wrong in their translation. Basically their movie would be what the games were supposed to be about because thats the story all the eightyearold Mario fans were dying to see.Also the directors felt that their Mario film should be for adults  as in drugs hookers strippers and street crime  because they didnt want to hold back. Versions of the script even had scenes lifted straight from Mad Max and Die Hard featuring a wildly optimistic cameo of Bruce Willis as John McClane. They didnt even want Mario and Luigi to appear in their trademark costumes. This movie was made for no one.Walt DisneyThe score should have been this on a loop.When the studio execs who it seems hadnt read any of the memos about strippers and drugs finally visited the set and discovered that the people theyd hired to make their Mario movie were inexplicably churning out a sexedup cyberpunk action movie they naturally freaked out and brought in a new writer to overhaul the script forbidding the directors to contact that writer in any way lest they contaminate his mind with whatever dark magic had afflicted them. Since they already spent a ton of money on the sets and costumes the best the new screenwriter could do was try to write as close a version of Super Mario Bros. as possible that still used all the insane artifacts from Morton and Jankels neon fever dream.Working on the film was reportedly so miserable that Bob Hoskins and John Leguizamo who played Mario and Luigi coped with the situation by being constantly hammered which lead to Leguizamo crashing the Mario Bros. plumbing van and breaking Bob Hoskins fingers. Leguizamo We were drinking too much because we were all miserable ... And the door came flying out smashed his fingers. Hoskins was cursing and Cockney rhyming. This anecdote is semiterrifying when you consider people wanted Hoskins to play Wolverine in the s.,underratedmovies,db7ogbq,3,t5_2u4tq
