2837839,0,t3_2kgnag,Having read every Drizzt book that Im aware of. I cant think of a single mention of him being able to do so. In fact Drizzt often seems oblivious of Guens actual actions and no more aware of what she is doing than any of his other close companions.For example how many times are we left with Drizzt in peril before Salvatore changes scenes. Then upon return to the scene Drizzt is saved by  pounds of insert descriptiveThere is also the origin story for Guenhwyvar in the Collected stories I think? I dont recall this being a feature at that time either.,forgottenrealms,cnqnqar,2,t5_2rxtk
