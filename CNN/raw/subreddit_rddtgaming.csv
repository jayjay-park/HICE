127445,0,t3_1vird5,My reply on the postI think its a good idea but there are major downsides. For exampleLast night you zombies were on lookout for me while we raided the randoms house. There was a sleeper in there. I killed him because I did not want him to get on and kill me when I was looting his crib. If we had this then he could do just that and I would have no idea he was there.I think a good idea would be if you could see sleepers just like you can now but they can take no damage. I dont know if that is possible but I think its the best option. That way they cant ambush people but they cant be killed.,rddtgaming,cesy05c,2,t5_2zkw4
