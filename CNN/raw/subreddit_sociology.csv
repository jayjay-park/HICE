250830,0,t1_cf6bh8u,What about really unusual misunderstandings where the situation should be obviously defined and accepted by all parties but for some reasons both actors have no idea what to do because of factors unknown to them. For examplegt One time I was second in line at the checkout counter. Without either me or the cashier noticing the costumer in front of me whose turn it was had ran back into the store to bring some item he had forgotten. Without me noticing the cashier scanned the guys item and since it happened to be only one small item like a packet of gum the cashier placed it on the side of the register machine which was out of my sight rather than letting it go down the conveyer belt. gt So now the cashier expects me to pay for what he thinks is my gum but neither of us had even noticed the guy who was going to buy it. Im standing there thinking its my turn but have no idea why the cashier is just looking at me. Now I suppose according to Goffman that in this situation me and the cashier would instantly put on an act fitting this situation trying to save it from collapsing and such. However none of us knew what was going on and both were completely confident in our expectations of how the other person was supposed to act him expecting me to pay for the gum and me expecting him to scan my groceries. gt After a few seconds of silence the cashier just says I have no idea whats going on. And I feel the same. It just didnt feel like we were trying to understand the situation or able to save it by any acting cues. The stage was there but none of us had any knowledge of the third actor I had no idea of the props the gum and we lacked a script for such a situation.gt Soon the other costumer comes back and after a few seconds it all started making sense. And yeah I felt like an idiot.This was not just a common understanding in the line of oh I think those were actually . and not . in which I can understand that both actors put on roles where you act the way you should during such a misunderstanding. But in the example above? What am I missing?,sociology,cf6r485,1,t5_2qhbo
385205,0,t3_1yhe3y,Feminism is the main framework used to understand the family in sociology most of the time. It is widely used in the literature and it isnt just her ideological standpoint. Feminism and the theories associated with it are influenced by rigorous empirical research. Because the family is one of the main sites where gender is enacted and reproduced throughout our day to day interactions and through the course of our lives it is incredibly appropriate to use a feminist lens. No course is going to cover everything you want it to cover and every professor has their pet topics that they are most comfortable with discussing and teaching. If that is her area then listen to closely to her as an expert and draw connections for yourself. The thing you gain from a class is a framework to approach the topic and some examples helping you to build that way of thinking. Not definitive and impartial answers. Those dont exist. I think her focusing on a single example is a little more problematic and full lectures on eating disorders might be out of place depending on the context. That said all the topics youve listed as interesting are directly linked to feminist theory and the lens you areshould be developing in the class should be applicable to them with some work. The fact that the course happens to focus on only womens experiences in the family does not immediately make it bad. Generally these problems that effect women are intimately connected to mens experiences of oppression and inequality as well and you should think about how something like say the marginalization of women to domestic roles relates directly to stayathome dads. Plenty of feminists do talk about such things but this one decided not to structure her class that way. Check the literature on such topics out for your final paper perhaps?,sociology,cfkox3t,20,t5_2qhbo

2553287,0,t3_2ov505,I know youve mentioned how its an off the top of your head blog post but still it really feels like a caricature of Sociology I mean it passes comments such as how gt Quite a few of the early big names in sociology leaned a little conservativeWhen as far as I understand it the Sociological canon of Durkheim Marx and Weber werent conservative in their political beliefs. Durkheim is often portrayed as this conservative functionalist due to his work being imported by Parsons into the US but actually he was quite heavily socialist. As for the antipositivist sentiment ... For me I think there is a real underlying distrust of science especially within certain European traditionssociologists against providing distinct objective understandings of the way in which individualssociety operates. I imagine this view is quite heavily found in those influenced by Foucault for example but surely there is a difference here between antiscience as a distrust of reducing something to a universal claim to truth and antiscientific as in against establishing scientific methods and ways of investigating the world?You only have to look at the desire for impact that dominates a lot of Sociology particularly in the UK Im not sure what its like elsewhere the need to prove what your research and work is doing socially economically and politically to see that there isnt an antiscientific bias  there are established methodologies and established ways of conducting research. I can agree that it can be viewed as antiscience insofar as Sociologists would have an incredibly difficult time saying that without a shadow of a doubt objectively factually speaking this is what society is this is how it operates and this is what you need to do to achieve X because such a stance is ignorant of the very complexities of a living breathing world filled with humans.

2616896,0,t1_cn05ivu,The book is titled racisms in reference to its thesis being that there arent clear definitions of the term racism and there are in fact multiple different forms of racebased discrimination that fall under the term depending on who is doing the defining.  For instance some believe that only socalled insititutional racism is true racism that unless a discriminatory act is backed by larger societal structures of oppression and power imbalance the act is not actually racist.  Others deny institutional racism and instead argue that only racism from an individual to another individual is really racism.  Many other opinions fall on a spectrum between beyond and parallel to those two examples.  The racisms is attempting to capture that all of those definitions contain merit but fail to adequately capture the complexity of the topic.   ,sociology,cn060l8,2,t5_2qhbo

Also rationalisation is not only about how we mentally form arguments and verify beliefs in addition Weber writes about rationalization as a societywide process on the macro level that affects our daily lives regardless of what we individually believe.Are you familiar with the terms GemeinschaftGesellschaft? In essence as modernity progresses and populations grow and centralize we move away from the closeknit communities geographically and socially where everyone is socially related to everyone else and has the entire community to rely upon in times of crisis. Instead we create societies in which people do not know each other do not help each other and where your function as a wage laborer means you are replaceable by anyone with the same skill set. The increasing demand for rationalized businesses and government rational in the sense of cost efficiency has such unfortunate side effects for society. Weber feared that without religion and myth to give meaning to reality and without a social community to rely upon man would become trapped in the iron cage of bureaucratic and costefficient social structures.  ,sociology,cq3agcf,23,t5_2qhbo

The reality is unless youre looking for a specific field that requires a specific set of skills engineering medicine programming etc most of the knowledge you accumulate through a major will not be directly applied to your work. Others may disagree and thats fair. Thats not to say studying sosh is useless. The unique aspect of the discipline that it is both qualitative and quantitative in inquiry. Sociologists identify social patterns with statistics and they observe social interactions via interviews and field studies. To top it off sociologists are always concerned with the big picture which means they think conceptually. What are the parts of society? How do they relate and what are the consequences?These are soft skills that would serve you well in just about any profession. A business leader needs to understand where hisher business fits into its industry and where its heading. A policy maker needs to understand the social problems hisher constituents are facing. Hell an engineer needs to understand why his code matters and the impact it will have on its users. I could go on. The point is you should select a major based on the skills youre looking to acquire not on related job paths. Only a minority of college grads find careers directly related to their majors. Now if you want to talk about making yourself appealing to employers thats where internships and extracurriculars come into play.

But if you find interest in him you can find some of his work on the political field enlightening. For instance he goes are far as saying when we construct political surveys and use of them on people it is a form of symbolic violence by forcing individuals without the capital to participate in such dialogue by narrating questions and constructing socially acceptable answers.

11076008,0,t3_5y1rf0,Right wing politics relies heavily on ideology and black and white good vs bad absolutist thinking.  There is nothing inherently wrong with that although it doesnt often result in the most utilitarian outcomes to a situation.  This is antithetical to sociology what tries to explain connections between social phenomenon as a means to understanding the origins of behavior.  The right tends to be more interested in reacting to behavior not understanding it and they are more interested in prescribing a particular course of action that they deem to be correct rather then finding the most utilitarian solution that maybe compromises but minimizes harm.A simple example would be the typical right vs left political opinion on criminal justice.  A stereotypical right wing politician would argue for a tougher anti crime stance harsher penalties and longer prison sentences.  The viewpoint of this politicians constituents is that people who commit crimes are bad and need to be punished.  You wont hear many right wing politicians making the argument that society should analyze the origins of crime poverty inequality oppression to try to find a better utilitarian approach to combatting crime.On the other hand a left wing politician would be much more likely to at least give lip service to the underlying causes of crime because left wingers like sociologists tend to believe that these issues have complex causes and are not due strictly to the inherent goodnessbadness of the people doing the acting.Sociology undermines the world view of right wing ideology so is therefore quite threatening to it.,sociology,dengep4,2,t5_2qhbo
11124057,0,t3_5ypbgl,My reply will be mildly biased because I see myself as a social constructionist. Having said that I appreciate you having done some research to try to make sense of something but I would argue that the weakness of the argument may stem from not following the core premises of the constructionist movement in sociology.Constructionism as youre talking about which I am connecting more directly to symbolic interactionism is actually based in a pragmatist philosophy. It comes from the Chicago school where Mead established an argument for how social interaction begins to be shaped and Blumer formed it into a real theoretical movement. Since you have a philosophical bent may I recommend first reading the Blue and Brown Books by Wittgenstein? Then read Blumer. Finally to understand how a constructionist argument can apply to real life context read Goffmans Presentation of Self in Everyday Life.My point Your argument seems to be that qualitative research cannot give a scientific truefalse hypothesis test. The response to that is  yes you are absolutely right. If you want that constructionists arent relevant to you. But heres the counter argument. When dealing with people and social groups  object qualities as we like to look at them become complicated. Commonly used examples are certain mental illnesses. Are sad people depressed and is that an illness? What is ADHD and how much of it comes from people wanting their children being categorized as such and how much of comes a real biochemical change? Now Szasz for instance would say there is no such thing as mental illness and thats the extreme constructionist view youre talking about. He goes too far sure but at the same time to say all mental illness is a truth or reality cant be viable either because otherwise homosexuality both is and is not a mental illness.,sociology,deswi5b,2,t5_2qhbo
11222684,0,t3_6078n9,This may be contentious to some but it doesnt overly matter where you do a BA its typically the grad degree if you do one where the school matters a good deal more. For the BA UofT is Ontarios world class university Queens is smaller and considered more selective by many though this isnt as strict nowadays and UOttawa is the perfect school if you intend to go into public service.It really depends on what youre looking for. If you plan on only a BA then Id say UOttawa public sector has many opportunities or UofT if willing to commute for a job due to rapidly increasing living prices.If you plan on going on to graduate studies... whichever BA school looks most funoffers the best deal. Just make sure to work hard enough to get the grades and recommendations for grad school.,sociology,df42snd,3,t5_2qhbo

11497736,0,t1_dfz8yvg,Okay youre getting away from my point. Im not disagreeing with you. In terms of the world outside of a friend group in college we are on the same page. Im saying that the thread was about being jealous of people buying clothes and going on vacation in their college community. Im saying you can still be friends with those people because you have common ground in college areas to interactcaf lounges dorm that doesnt require excess wealth. Once you leave college yes the real world takes over and everything you said happens. Im saying dont be salty and block out your classmates because you see a post of them on vacation you can still be friends. ,sociology,dfz9nnr,1,t5_2qhbo
11597912,0,t3_65i5vk,A shocking case of marketing even to me as a man was moist wipes branded as dude wipes lol. Until I turned  and moved out I used any shampoo soap toothpaste my mom bought me. Suddenly Im a bachelor buying my own toiletries. What the hell am I doing? Thats when marketers strike and make the choice easier. There really arent any products exclusive to males so when they are marketed as such its silly and obvious although effective. Razors body wash deodorant comes to mind. These are products used by both sexes surely. But what about other products that are used by both sexes but are given masculine branding? What about trucks tires and oil? These seem exclusively marketed towards men just look at any f ad but must be used by both sexes. Are women persuaded to buy the most masculine truck? Are men persuaded to buy the laundry detergent that appears most feminine? Sorry about the rant but your article did get me thinking.Edit the fear of being feminineor homosexual is definitely real and Im afraid it keeps talented boys from writing singing admiring art and fashionthings I wouldnt consider feminine anyway. Instead hopelessly clinging on to dreams of being an athlete or navy seal. Its a shame masculinity can be commodified but its just so easy!!,sociology,dgamr7n,3,t5_2qhbo
