7909798,0,t3_4kyqpf,I liked the Taking of Deborah logan. Wont say too much about it but I found it different than other horror movies. The last  minutes may be a let down but its worth watching. ,Scarymovies,d454wug,1,t5_2ro2w
8129965,0,t3_4ptyl0,There are a few aspects to consider when answering this question.Horror classics I can watch over and over my horror classics so to speak and horror classics who shaped the modern horror genre as it is right now. Those are  completely different things.My own horror classics are A Nightmare on Elmstreet  Scream  Halloween  Dawn of the Dead  Shaun of the Dead  Freddys Nightmares  Friday the th Part VI Jason Lives  Texas Chainsaw MassacreBoth The Silence of the Lambs The ShiningAs in classics to the genre in generalOBV Friday the th franchise Nightmare franchise Halloween franchise  Night of the living Dead and Of the dead series in general  The RingOriginal  Scream franchise  The Shining The Silence of the Lambs Evil Dead  Rosemarys baby  Hellraiser  Texas Chainsaw MassacreI think both  It  Zombieland.I may even have forgotten a few as the list of influential horror movies is quite long.,Scarymovies,d4tvqaz,1,t5_2ro2w
8146117,0,t3_4qa7d5,Ive probably seen every movie in this thread. Most movies dont scare me even a little but I have to say The Houses That October Built did make me a little scared. Probably because haunted houses always made me uneasy as a kid. But I would recommend it because it seems more plausible than your average horror movie. ,Scarymovies,d4vt7lx,1,t5_2ro2w
8146960,0,t1_d4vwoz6,Agreed! And I dont even necessarily mean twist in the M. Night Shamawhatever way but in waiting for some ultimate scary reveal. I think modern mainstream horror moviegoers expect that sort of thing and arent used to a movie like this.,Scarymovies,d4vx0jm,5,t5_2ro2w
8352571,0,t3_4rshfa,Id recommend turning all lights off late at night and watching The Grudge series original not American.That usually does a number on me. with John Cusack is a good one. The Strangers too.,Scarymovies,d5lmhkc,1,t5_2ro2w

8706655,0,t1_d6q3gsp,I cant agree more.  In my opinion this movie is way better than it had to be.  Even the sequel was enjoyable.  I walked into this movie was expectations lower than a snails back sack and was frankly enthralled with it.  If anyone hasnt seen this Id recommend it.,Scarymovies,d6tytb6,3,t5_2ro2w

9184370,0,t3_4r7woa,I loved this one. A truly epic movie. You get the sense that the whole community is affected by the strange occurrences even though most of the films running time is focused on one family. I had some trouble grasping some plot points toward the end due to cultural ignorance but it didnt diminish my appreciation of the movie or make it any less creepy. A few minutes of research afterward and I appreciated it even more.,Scarymovies,d8g6ptg,1,t5_2ro2w

9814542,0,t3_5fsh16,The Babadook really stuck with me. Especially since I watched it during a time when I was living with someone who had some pretty severe mental illnesses. I watched it once and I dont think I can watch it again. ,Scarymovies,damup4a,15,t5_2ro2w

10676863,0,t1_dddq03i,Thats the point of the show though its a satirical comedy spin on a classic horror storyline. Its supposed to be ridiculous and obvious. You can only enjoy it if you go into it knowing that it wasnt ever supposed to be a horror show or anything along those lines. ,Scarymovies,ddh8knd,1,t5_2ro2w

11723448,0,t3_679n4b,I wish there could be an objective rating system for horror movies. Like some criteria everyone could agree on. Unfortunately what makes something scary is too subjective to provide a top X list. That said its still interesting to see.,Scarymovies,dgovstd,5,t5_2ro2w
