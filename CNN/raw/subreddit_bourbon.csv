147138,0,t3_1vrp4n,Cliff notes versionBefore bourboncorn whiskey American whiskey was primarily rye whiskey and it was mostly made in western PA. Alexander Hamilton US secretary of the treasury under Washington gets his whiskey tax through western PA distillers get pissed Whiskey Rebellion happens. Note at this point you shouldnt be picturing distillers as big distilling operations. Think personal stills people making whiskey for their families to drink amp for bartering purposes. Making grain into whiskey also made it easier to get to market and sell  per pound dragged down to market whiskey was worth wayyyy more than the equivalent weight of its source grain. In the meantime Thomas Jefferson had been the governor of VA which at the time included the land that would later become Kentucky and wanted to encourage people to come visit settle down and generally expand things so he offered any pioneer  acres of land on the provision that they would come down to VAKY and grow corn.Lots of people took him up on this including many of the folks who had been distilling rye in PA the Beam family of Jim Beam fame among them.Like rye whiskey corn whiskey was more valuable per unit weight than the comparable weight of corn rye by itself which made it easier to get to market and sell. So if you took advantage of Jeffersons offer and moved to the land that later became Kentucky chances are you were making corn whiskey. Worth noting too that every time I have said whiskey so far in this story you should be picturing clear unaged whiskey.As for bourbon differentiated from corn whiskey by the whole charred barrel aging thing that comes into play later... like midlate s. Corn whiskey was getting put in charred oak barrels and shipped down the Ohio gt Mississippi river to New Orleans major port. Point of origin? Often a region of KY known as Bourbon County. Inevitably it ended up in barrels for quite a while... weeks months... the trip to New Orleans was a nice leisurely float and it was an even longer trip to get the stuff to foreign ports. Barrel aging thus occurred incidentally rather than on purpose but people eventually pieced together that this whiskey tasted differently than the clear stuff and asked for it explicitly. News gets back to KY they start aging it on purpose and bourbon was born.edited to nix the barrel aging bit until I do a bit more research to shore that part of the story up a bit...,bourbon,cev6unn,3,t5_2rgos

221613,0,t1_cf3oesn,So your critique then is directed to the patent system and contract law and not GMOs or Monsanto.The fact is that the overwhelming majority of farmers these days buy seeds yearly anyway for consistency of crop and product rather than planting the seeds from each years crop regardless of whether or not the seeds are GMO.  This is because farmers want to know the characteristics of what theyre planting and what will be produced.  Even the scumbag farmer Bowmans counsel admitted this in oral arguments in Bowman v. MonsantoIt also doesnt follow that a measured halflife of days to months even if accurate at the longer end of that range which is exaggerated would preclude anybody who thought even slightly in advance.  Farmers typically dont make snap decisions  and I think next season is a stretch.  But that a farmer may be in some sense locked in by the consequences of his own decision is not the fault of Monsanto or GMOs nor is it unique to them.Loss of historically important plants is no more Monsantos fault or the fault of GMOs nor any more a concern than loss of historically important modes of transportations is due to Ford or loss of historically important modes of communications is to the internet.  Heritage is not a value in and of itself its value is based on utility.Theres been a clear demonstrated preference for the GMO crops and they clearly have market advantages.  If they didnt the luddites in europe wouldnt have had to ban and restrict them.The US patent system also doesnt apply in developing countries for what its worth.  They each have their own if they have any at all and most other countries with their unfortunate luddite strains in agriculture have been extremely reluctant to allow patent protection for GMO crops even if Monsanto were to enforce it which they dont.  So the saved seeds and contractpatent issues in the US simply dont apply to nearly this extent elsewhere.While youve identified Golden Rice youre also missing other areas where GMO is helpful  for example with tolerating more saline water or different soil conditions.  Anything that increases yield reduces growing time increases tolerance of marginal growing conditions or reduces the overall pesticideherbicide impact is going to be all else being equal a net benefit.,bourbon,cf3oqvx,4,t5_2rgos

243654,0,t3_1ww95f,from what i understand when I spoke to them at the packaging facility four roses filters basically to remove oils and fat from the bourbon. Chilling helps it flocculate out.

Color Golden brownNose Mint chocolate chip pine oakTaste Rye spice cinnamon sweet corn sweet pickle brine cocoa that opens up into a light lingering vanilla fresh oak woodFinish A flash of rye spice a lingering woody vanilla sweetness gets thin pretty quick but what remains is quite pleasantOverall Tasty stuff! I picked this up to see how it compared to Wild Turkey Forgiven which Ive been enjoying lately. The right blend of rye and bourbon can really bring out interesting notes in both I think. This is good. Im probably going to drink this bottle slow so that I can enjoy it for a long time. I dont know if Ill be looking to replace it when its done but Ill definitely enjoy it while its here. Try a pour if you see it at your bar. If youre really into Forgiven and want another take on this style Id pick up a bottle if you see it. ,bourbon,cfsw49e,5,t5_2rgos

589021,0,t3_20vv80,Rowans Creek Straight Kentucky Bourbon . Proof Batch QBC No.  minute glass restFirst review here Ive been lurking around for a couple months and have been doing reviews on my own but havent posted any yet so here it goes. This is a bourbon I wasnt too impressed with at first but after not having it for a while I tried it again and have started to really enjoy it. Anyways heres a congragulatory dram for doing my taxes in record time.APPEARANCE Light coppery looks kinda orangey red like a light amberNOSE Lots of cinnamon and vanilla some citrus and maple sweetness and a little bit of green smell not sure what that is. The cinammon spice really stands out to me in this one my favorite part about this whiskey.TEXTURE Very thin body not much bite an easy drinker for the proofTASTE Delicate flavors in this one having trouble getting too much out of it but some light oakiness vanilla and more cinnamon.FINISH Again I get a lot of cinnamon I remember the finish almost like a cinnamon Altoid but Im not getting as much of that this time.I really like the nose on this one but the taste is kind of a let down for me. I still look forward to the rest of the bottle though and hopefully getting a little more out of it.,bourbon,cg784y9,3,t5_2rgos

590767,0,t3_20wixt,I dont get the argument. JD is big because its JD not because its called Tennessee Whiskey. If Diageo damages the  appellation by sacrificing Dickel does this actually hurt JD brand worldwide? I dont think so because JD will continue being JD and the people who are supposedly so brand focused will never know about the other Tennessee Whiskey brands. And if they do happen to pick up a crappy Dickel will that hurt JD? No because its not JD.Im actually not sure what Diageo wants to do here. Do they want to reuse barrels once and then send them over for Scotch? Thats the only angle I can think of. Other than maybe simply annoying BrownForman and loosening their grip on state legislation.,bourbon,cg7f9yg,21,t5_2rgos

How easy is to to get an exemption? Why do they get to sully Tennessee Whiskey if others cant?gtIn a perfect world I actually want more truth in labeling laws.

I paid  for this bottle but I have since found it for  and it has been pointed out to me that I definitely overpaid for the first bottle.  I said upon finding out that this was only supposed to be  a bottle that if I could find it for that I would drink it all the time.

It really only shines when it is drank properly with a few mL of water and time to breath drank in any of the other formats I test did not really show it to be particularly better than significantly less expensive offerings.  I dont regret paying  for the first bottle because it opened up a whole new world of aged Bourbons and is so much different than anything else I have on my shelf but I would not spend more than  again.  I will probably pick up another bottle for  when I have a chance I really want to have it around for the holidays. Notes on use of ice soda etc and pairingsI included this just because I have found that buy trying bourbons in these different ways it brings out different aspects to the flavor and it can improve or diminish a bourbons rating.  Im not sure if I will continue doing this.  I also like to pair alocohols with each other if you havnt tried be careful it can lead to wicked hangovers.Notes on my palate  I really only like sweeter style whiskeys and cannot drink anything with much smoke or peat if you will.  As such on many reviews I might have smoke written as a flavor and that may not be obvious to others.  Obviously smoke isnt a primary flavor in most Bourbons.Edit  I meant to include this in future reviews for context,bourbon,cj2z1br,3,t5_2rgos

1952557,0,t1_ckohd2k,Yes. While the difference between batch  and  are not that noticeable in the photos I can assure you that batch  is a little lighter. Batch  is just significantly darker than the rest. Honestly dont know why since there are all  years. My guess? They put in some older stock maybe? into the first batch when they were blending them.

1959734,0,t1_ckpcao4,Yeah I get what youre saying. I think store owners have to be better marketers though and really own their product. When the BTAC starts coming out get out there and find something that compares to it. So when someone comes in ask them have you had the BTAC before? No then I would reserve bottles for st timers. Maybe keep a list of people that havent had it before? IDK. I think being educated on PVW amp BTAC you could make great recommendations of similar products to try and get someone on the hook for a bottle anyway. I mean theyre already there and wanting to buy. What one of my stores did was they put all of their PVW out and let you take little samples and then they had other bourbons sitting out that were similar. It promoted to the regular release stuff and helped break down the idea that this PVW was the greatest thing ever created. It definitely helped their sales of Weller  most difficult to find now. It even prompted them getting a couple of their choice barrels of Blantons which they burn through like crazy.,bourbon,ckpcm2k,1,t5_2rgos

1963449,0,t3_2h6fin,Rittenhouse rye is Heaven Hills rye whiskey. As this is Bottled in Bond that means its  proof at least four years old and all from the same distilling season.This is a DSPKY distilled version Bernheim distillery  bottled at DSPKY which is Heaven Hills Bardstown facility. A fire in  destroyed the Bardstown distillery  actual rye distillation for Heaven Hill shifted to BrownForman for a time. Those versions will have DSPKY on the label. It wasnt until about  that Heaven Hill had their own rye distillation going on at the distillery formerly known as Bernheim which is the DSPKY version. I stole all that info from red white amp bourbon btw.Nose  Very nice oaky richness with a good amount of rye spice. Charred wood lots of vanilla and caramel Dijon mustard cider vinegar clove nutmeg black pepper.Taste  Nice honey and vanilla entry developing in to some richer caramel and spice flavors and some honey mustarda sweeter mustard as opposed to pickle juice or in my case sour apple candy is how the rye seems to come across to me with this one. Id give the body about a  on a  scale  being fullbodied with a somewhat creamy feel.Finish  Some caramel and vanilla sweetness with a little bit of clove and pepper. Spiciness is a bit less than I anticipated with this being a straight rye.This is very very tasty in my opinion although the finish is a bit lacking  it holds up well to the best LDI ryes Ive head read Willett. I am aware this isnt an LDI rye but as theyre so ubiquitous I thought it could be helpful to include that as a reference point. This is a bit less aggressive than the  yr Willett but more balanced and nuanced in my opinion  I have a hard time saying which is better though as my preference would likely depend on my mood. I do think this is the best value rye Ive come across. I cant help but think Handy would have a competitor if some honey barrels were bottled unfiltered and at cask strength.,bourbon,ckpspwg,9,t5_2rgos

2034514,0,t3_2i3for,I first tried  a few years ago when I first started dipping my toes into the whisky world. I knew I didnt like it but couldnt tell you why therefore I have always passed over it whenever I was shopping for a new bottle. Two things convinced me to buy this bottle recently  A trip to  and a taste straight from the barrel. It was an amazing experience one I was completely unprepared for since the taste was shockingly good and  The fact that this single barrel offering from Coxs Spirits was only . a solid  to  under what I have seen  at before. Sold.. Proof . ABV. Tasted neat in a citation glass while listening to some Eric Whitacre Sleep Lux Aurumque Cloudburst...Color Medium to light amber from core to edge. The tears are thick and grasping but turn spotty after a few minutes of trailing.Nose Theres an immediate rush of the classic aromas like toffee butterscotch and citrus however the more I nosed this mint grass and tobacco leaf slowly began seeping out. Not punchy and weighty but not simple either. The longer it sat the aromas became more specific Peppermint orange peel grapefruit juice pipe tobacco tupelo honey. There is a slight artificial plastic note just swimming around discreetly though. Mouthfeel Velvety but not too weighty. Not thin but a mediumlight feel. Slightly parching and grasping at the cheeks through the chew. Creamy after a minute or so chewing.Palate Cool citrus and cucumber notes on the front of the tongue quickly turn to spice and sourdough bread while sweet butter seems to infiltrate the rest of the palate. The rye is very noticeable high in the gums and cheeks presenting not as spice and nuts like in other highrye bourbons but more as a peppermint candy. The taste is fairly simple though and there isnt a ton of flavormorphing through the chew.Finish Butterscotch and peppermint really strive on after the swallow with a nice dash of nutmeg and cinnamon and even a bit of tobacco leaf in the back of the throat. But theres more of a finish of texture than of flavor as the creamed butter just continues to coat the palate. Really enjoyable even if a little short.Overall The nose on this is nice and complex especially the longer it sat unfortunately the palate just didnt live up to the nosehype new favorite term! and the finish was a bit short. The honey and butter flavor as well as the buttery finish really made this dram for me but points taken off for the plastic undertone on the nose. I cant wait until theres a caskstrength offering of this. The straight from the barrel taste I had at the distillery forced me to look at this bourbon with new eyes and I am a fan.

I wouldnt believe that the flavor differences are very drastic particularly for bartenders to notice such an impact when preparing mixed drinks.  That having been said I havent done a side by side myself and even if I did maybe my palate is not sophisticated enough.  I think the concept of nostalgia or assuming that the older one is better or just bragging about your bar having sought out the old bottles high and low for some kind of street cred or hipster cred may be just as likely as actual flavor differences.,bourbon,cl94itl,2,t5_2rgos

So I did.I also did a companion post that shows how theyve changed their site to reflect the video at the bottom of the post. If you care to check it out the post has links to the internet archives of the old site where they are blatantly lying about pretty much everything so you can compare it to the story theyre telling now on their site which is quite a bit different. I think its pretty shady that in the video he says Weve never tried to hide the fact that we have a distilling partner and they changed the site to reflect that.

Its got a good strong burn and a more potent version of OGDs aftertaste.I dont find OGD in general to be nearly as sweet as the other higher quality cheap bourbons which can be nice.  To my palate its got a taste somewhere between a rye and a bourbon bourbon flavors but rye levels of sweetness without tasting like rye.  It makes no sense just go with it.,bourbon,clf1w30,1,t5_2rgos

The prices can be ridiculously high especially for anything Pappy but theyre only that high because people are willing to pay them so to the buyer they are not outrageous.

Slight touch of acetone but not a major detractor.Palate Almond buttery with a medium body. Coats the mouth nicely. Slight toasttobacco. Many of the nose characters associated with sweetness are here too but overall it is fairly dry.Finish Warmth develops into heat and lingers in the finish. Doesnt hang around too long except for the warmth. SummaryI really like the nose on this one and it follows through in the palate and finish. A really nice sipper with good complexity. The balance of the caramel characters and some pit fruits is a nice combination. Definitely will continue to purchase this one.Score ,bourbon,cnn93t4,3,t5_2rgos

2816489,0,t3_2scmtf,Good evening everyone! Ive made a resolution to avoid liquor stores like the plague until Ive made a sizable dent in my collection. This bottle was the product of bopping into a store I always drive by and never go in. Needless to say I snatched it without a moments hesitation! Ive read many reviews that praise each offering in the Parkers Heritage Collection and with me loving everything that comes out of Heaven Hill I just couldnt resist. So far Ive made it  days into the year! Im hoping to go at the very least through the month and if I can I think Ill be totally happy with that. Regardless I have a glass of beautiful whiskey in front of me...Parkers Heritage Collection Wheat Whiskey  years old . ABV . in CTNose Very warm and cozy butterscotch vanilla oak sweet tea brown sugar. Deliciously sweet nothing overpowering the nose is even mouthwatering! Taste Caramel plum lots of vanilla some raw honey pecan. Lots of nice flavors that are all well balanced and give the spirit enough complexity to be interesting while not overstating its bounds. Body A tad thinner than Ive come to expect from barrel proofers and leaves a little oiliness that helps the flavors linger without getting in their way. Finish A nice wave of warmth wafts over you and lingers for quite a while. I find that the pecan note lingers along with a nice amount of Vanilla. Value At  I got a tasty barrel proof  year old wheat whiskey from my favorite distillery Im not upset with my purchase one bit. I can find other great whiskies for less money than this bottle but I dont think I would pass up another bottle if I were to come across it in the wild! Overall Holy cow this whiskey is great! Im very glad that I broke a promise I made to myself and went into this store. I found a new and spectacular whiskey which was also my first foray into wheat whiskey. Ive got my eyes peeled looking for more but Im pessimistic at best that Ill find any in the near future...If you get the chance to get this dont pass it up youll regret it! Total All of my reviews can be found here!,bourbon,cno87gv,11,t5_2rgos

2995128,0,t3_2uhfn8,So the superbowl is over and Im switching from the pregame scotch to bourbon before bed.  Had a little bit of work to do  when you are in the sports industry you work on superbowl night!  and poured myself a nice healthy slightly more than  oz dram of this one to rest on the desk beside me.The story with Bookers and myself is that uwmarsh sent me to the store to pick one up for him as part of a swap.  It was a month or three back and Bookers was on sale   off as I recall.  As almost an aside he said to keep an eye out for the Roundtable batches and passed me a few batch numbers.  I walked into a store I dont normally go to and the first two bottles on the shelf were the roundtable batch.  I bought them both in hopes of using the second as trade fodder  but wound up opening it myself.  Im more than half way through between drinking and sampling so its high time a review gets posted.  Here we go! Price  on sale Nose Spicy oak where spices are cinnamon cloves pepper and other spices similar to what one gets from a nice rye like MWND. A lot of oak. There is a strong sour scent that I know as sour mash. If you can power through the sour scent followed by a layer of lemon a hidden sweetness of vanilla caramel can be found. Mouthfeel Lush and creamy but dry what Id imagine it would feel like to direct a fire extinguisher at your face. Taste Brown sugar cinnamon on entry and then its hot! like fire burn. Once Ive muscled through the proof weve got some sour mash some rye bread a touch more brown sugarbutterscotchvanillacaramel charcoal and oak with maybe a hint of some orange zest. Finish Aftertaste of charred oak with a touch of something sour and this one burns the whole way down.I like this bourbon and am grateful to uwmarsh for exposing me to it.  Not sure Id have ever paid much attention to the little wooden boxes wo his prodding.  I used to go for Laphroaig when I wanted a good swift kick in the teeth these days Im as likely to reach for this bottle.Score Would I buy it again?  Yes Ill keep an eye out for it to go on sale again.  Always nice to have something to look in on when visiting the stores.,bourbon,co8fybu,7,t5_2rgos

3463946,0,t3_2zx9dl,As many in these parts know High West is a distillerNDP honest blender in this case in Park City Utah. Their Campfire brand is a blend of straight bourbon straight rye and blended malt Scotch Whisky  which for it to be a Campfire blend has a bit of smokepeat to it. Per the back label the main flavor is sweet honey from a ripe bourbon with the rye adding floral fruity spice and the accent coming from a peated Scotch whisky. Unlike Compass Box High West is keeping the proportions a secret not that I blame them. This blend of whiskies is then finished in heavily toasted wine barrels made from French and Hungarian Oak.So with all that that goes in to it it adds up to abv. Non chill filtered. Batch HB bottle .Nose  Caramel plenty of rye spiciness toasted breadsomething biscuity or malty honey hints of green jolly ranchers I get those a lot with rye esp. MGP rye a light smokiness and a bit of vanilla. Not a blend of aromas Ive come across before but I cant say thats a surprise because any other whisky blended like this one would be done in someones home not sold as a widely available commercial product.Taste  Starts with the honeycaramelgreen apple candy notes then getting the toasted rye bread light smoke butterscotch and some spices  caraway and black pepper especially  to complement on the development. Less spicy than the nose would suggest. Finish  Rye spices black pepper and caraway especially with a rye whiskey bite really coming in here. I also get the green jolly ranchers in a big way here toasted bread and a honeylike sweetness with the rye spice and green jolly ranchers going for quite a while here. The smoke is mostly gone by this point.This one is definitely unique and Im glad theres someone out there like High West to step out there and make some blends like this that otherwise wouldnt be available. While the mix of flavors is certainly different High West has really nailed the balance of what the different whiskies bring to the table with this one  everything seems to complement each other rather than compete against each other. While it is interesting tasty and balanced I dont get anything here that really makes me crave it or makes it stand out that much compared to other whiskey. Its still quite good and definitely worth buying at least once but theres nothing here that I would say excites me about it or that would dethrone MWND as the King of the High West lineup.,bourbon,cpn44ww,7,t5_2rgos

When I went the first  minutes of the tour was them showing a video. Only half of their operation is at Lawrenceburg where you take the main tour the distillery. The warehouse and bottling are at Coxs Creek. I havent been on that portion of the tour before. The tasting was actually not bad for the  you pay for the tour you get a souvenir glass and  samples of Four Roses. Your choices will most likely be Yellow Label Small Batch and Single Barrel.Ive heard great things about the Jim Beam tour especially since they revamped it in the past couple of years.

3775458,0,t3_33nopo,Im blessed to live in an area that seems to get a fair amount of ECBP. It goes fairly quickly but Im usually able to snag a bottle or two of each release if I pay attention. Im glad rbourbon brought it to my attention!Elijah Craig Barrel Proof Batch  Aged  years ABV . Paid .. for most bottles grabbed the first for way more than that.. Sampled from a Glencairn glass over multiple occasions Color I dont care about color and neither should you Nose Strong oak out of the gate. Very strong its quite pleasant. After some time in the glass or drinking! the corn  reminiscent of Evan Williams Black  begins to assert itself but I was about halfway through the glass before I really noticed it behind the wood. Vanilla notes are present but not overpowering. Pine needles make an appearance as well. Palate Oaky bourbon goodness. A lot of oak. The corn is fairly subdued actually. Theres sweetness certainly but its so well fused with the alcohol that its not at all cloying and your attention is easily diverted by the wood. Vanilla is present here too. A little water helps amplify the rye notes. Theyre quite nice! I did some googling and assuming it has the same mashbill as EC thats only  rye? Can anyone confirm? It tastes like more! Theres a very slight nuttiness after watering down that reminds me slightly of Beam yeast but thankfully it feels meatier and doesnt bother me too much. Finish Sorry if I said oak too often? But yeah theres a bit of that here too. And by a bit I mean its like licking a tree. Not as long as youd think actually. Leaves your mouth feeling warm but more from the alcohol than anything else. The oak persists a bit so its a bit dry. I found big sips left overpowering amounts of oak so I went with smaller ones mostly. Wisps of caramel and corn custard as well. Overall I like this! Its an oak monster but it hits the spot if thats what Im in the mood for. Thankfully I can avoid most of the unpleasant elements vaguely nutty yeast for example by being careful about how much water I add.rbourbon review  whisky review ,bourbon,cqmmoym,4,t5_2rgos

From what I gather I dont think there would be any difference between this and the  Rare Breed.Nose  Cinnamon amp nutmeg honey molasses ginger and old oakMouthfeel Watery with a little oilPalate Damp decaying oak with raisins figs and a savory creamed cornFinish Very dry full of rich oak and currantsBalance Little dry amp oaky for me on palate and finish  Ive noticed some of these older Turkeys can be like desiccants on the palate and just sap away all moisture.Rating   A good pour  we tried this next to the  rare breed and I think it slightly edged it out. The palate and finish arent super exciting to me but the nose is quite delectable.Value for the money I think these go around  on the secondary and I dont think it commands that price for drinking so a pass for me.,bourbon,cr066pp,6,t5_2rgos

Honestly it is really hard to even find eagle rare in the Total Wines of the world across the border in Jersey.

4025666,0,t3_36mcox,To start off Id like to thank uDevoz unormallyimonimgur and ukilrathi for the swaps.If you read the bottom of any of the bottles of Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr that Im reviewing today youll find out his illustrious history. And I dont think I could do it justice with selfdeprecating jokes and wisecracks nor with odd writing about dragons andor dungeons.What I will say is this Without Colonel Edmund Hayes Taylor Jr. we wouldnt have half the bourbon methods or techniques. Or rather we would we just wouldnt have had as long with all of them. Hes like if Da Vinci was actually listened to in his time. Or Aristarchus of Samos being listened to in the middle ages. Or even if I uTOModera had been listened to in these days as... some guy who makes dick jokes on the Internet about whiskey.Oh well we cant all be misguided geniuses.None the less I wasnt able to swap for Cured Oak Warehouse C Tornado or Sour Mash. Guess Ill have to review them in the future. But lets see how Buffalo Trace has honoured the legacy of the Colonel.And better yet how the whiskey tastes.  Up first we have Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Single Barrel. This whiskey is aged only in Warehouse C which was built by the Colonel himself in . It is a climate controlled aging house and is well known as a great place to still age whiskey. Now the age may not seem like a long time to nonColonialist however take my word for it. Its old to us.This is Buffalo Traces mash bill  like all save for the Rye Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. whiskeys.Price Not currently available at the LCBORegion KentuckyAbv Colour YR Nose Roasted corn sea air orange oak peach jam caramel cassia budsInitially it has this flavour of a BBQ corn that smells amazing. It takes some time however eventually theres fruit caramel and just a hint of cinnamon thats the cassia buds.Less caramel than the Small batch more unique and stronger notes overall. Theres also just a wisp of iodine that means a little. Not as beefy as the Barrel Proof and less floralcitrusy than the Straight Rye.Taste Orange brown sugar hard candy wood clotted cream plum peachThe orange really comes through on this one yet its less hot than the others. More like liking a freshly polished table dont do this.Less nutty than the Small Batch however stronger flavours than it. Completely different from the Barrel Proof its hard to say they are even the same juice. Shares the citrus aspects with the Straight Rye however not as earthy or earthy at allFinish Butter raspberry carrot oak hot dry pear aniseSo buttery. Now its hot and dry yet that works in the finish. Theres spice a good amount of sweetness and even some nice oak elements.Similar again to the Small Batch yet this has more tartness and is dryer. Its more put together. The Barrel Proof and this are two different beasts. This is more of a cake with fruit in it or a Chardonnay finish. Same with the Straight Rye the Single Barrel is its own whiskey again.Conclusion This ends up being the odd ball of the group and I enjoyed it. They were able to tame some of the more troublesome parts of the dram while making a very unique sipper. I wish there was more spice personally however otherwise its quite tasty.  For my second trick Ill be reviewing Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Small Batch. Again these are aged in Warehouse C according to the website. After it was fixed from the tornado.Small Batch has no legal definition. It typically means a Small Amount of barrels however what the amount is up to you. This is launched each year without a numbering system so it could just be fluff.Granted it is Bottled in Bond like all of the whiskeys save one which means that it does follow some standards. So lets see how it stacks up shall we?Granted Ill be writing this after my cat just farted in my face so please excuse me if Im having trouble.Price Not currently available at the LCBORegion KentuckyAbv Colour YR Nose Caramel honey pine nuts Wheetabix cashew rosemaryVery caramel and sweet liquid forward. I almost said Cheerios over Wheetabix however the HoneyCaramel notes never really combine with the cereal notes to make that jump. So... sorry to you Cheerio fans.Less interesting than the other three whiskies. At its heart this has a nutty sweet and cereal note with some rosemary thrown in for you people who put herbs on your cereal.Nut jobs.Taste Peanuts molasses hot orange toffee walnut oilAgain nutty some sweet liquid and hot. The Orange notes are back again. Bastards.The Orange is somewhat reminiscent of the Single Barrel however its a little duller here which I prefer. Doesnt come close to the Barrel Strength in terms of uniqueness or flavour strength. The Straight Rye seems more put together than this dram.Still tasty though and the toffee aspect is a nice addition here.Finish Smoke tangerine papaya mint oak butterSmooth finish with mostly fruit and oak in it. Theres a little butter and mint as time goes one. Both are nice though the mint doesnt seem to work as well here as others.Shorter than both the Single Barrel and Barrel Proof. It has the minty aspect of the Barrel Proof and Straight Rye which while I mock it it does has some nice aspects. It just didnt work as well in the Small Batch as othersConclusion Probably not my favourite of the bunch this is still a nice dram. Its a little too hot and just misses some of the nice aspects that the other drams have. Overall Id pass on this one for the others though it was still nice to sip.  Colonel E.H. Taylor Jr. Barrel Proof is the grand daddy of them all. So powerful I actually stopped at this one waited a day punched myself in the gonad and then reviewed the Straight Rye after. Why? Because thats how you review whiskey like a man dammit!Wait I meant to say idiot there. Oh well. Too late now.This whiskey is suppose to be the way whiskey was made before the days of Prohibition. And if thats the case I can see why there were alcoholics. Im pretty sure this stuff sent me to the moon. I woke up happy dizzy and at least  other dwarves that are pornographic in nature and now possibly banned by the rules of reddit.Suffice to say its strong stuff. So lets see how it tastes shall we?Price Not currently available at the LCBORegion KentuckyAbv .Colour R Nose Cherry oak ginger peach toast vanilla ice cream varnish butterSo this is different. Its big cherry flavours mixed with spice cream vanilla and butter. Like a Cornish Sunday not a Sex Move this smells amazing. Bigger flavours than the Single Barrel and Small Batch. Gone are the acidic citrus notes and replacing them are bready almost complete notes. Really tasty.  Its less earthy and citrusy than the Straight Rye as well.Taste Cherry oak caramel cocoa salt habaneroRight so the others are cirtus and this goes nuts with cherry and oak. Thats where they compare.It also takes the heat of the alcohol and changes it into a nice peppery flavour which is a first amongst these. The earthiness of the Straight Rye is mixed with sweet notes to make cocoa.Amazing.Finish Wheat icing hot caramel eucalyptus chocolate melon cranberry oakUnique is a double edged sword. I like and dont like some of the big notes. Its herbal and wheat mixed with icing and chocolate. So basically a Quaker granola bar. Parts I like parts I dont.The mint is now more eucalyptus the fruit is more pronounced and the oak is less present than the others. This really does end up amping up the other drams.Conclusion My favourite of the bunch this takes a really nice mixture of flavours and blends them together better than the rest. I love it. Id say buy this one before the rest as its that big beefy whiskey that wont let you down.,bourbon,crf5lzv,8,t5_2rgos

Well its about time and Master Distillers have listened to our requests and are recently starting to respond with these awesome cask strength releases! Details. proof Batch  Wheated mash billNose This is definitely an amped up Makers Mark! Sweet wheat on the nose with heavy hints of creamy vanilla caramel butter cinnamon and nutmeg. Taste Candied red hots with a slight yet sharp burn. The chewy mouthfeel is great with wheat sweetness up front followed by bold notes of vanilla butter and cinnamon sticks. There is plenty of sweet spice to keep things interesting on the mid palate.Finish Long and warming with a spicy cask strength kick.Conclusion The first time I tried Makers Mark Cask Strength bourbon was during my trip to KY for the bourbon trail. We visited Loretta and the beautiful MM Distillery back in October . I remember it being just as sweet spicy and delicious. If you are a Makers fan this is a must buy bourbon!

Proof remember that the casual drinker is not used to drinking  proof whiskey like the Willett. Especially if youre letting people pour it themselves. We deliberately stuck to  proof or less.  . Serving self pour? Self mix? Bartender? Our venue would not allow guests to self serve. So the bourbon bar was set up as a decorative display next to the regular bar and the bartenders would grab the bottle. Self serving leads to Uncle Harry pouring half a bottle of expensive whiskey into his glass in one serving...  . Backup whiskey as mentioned I had a nicer bottle tucked under the bar.

Now the store is placed in a position of matching price and paying the tax out of their own revenue instead of passing it through to the consumer.

Some people like High West and Smooth Ambler have shown just how good MGP whiskey is. The other nice thing about MGP is they sell all their stuff and dont bottle their own.  If a NDP wants to buy barrels from somewhere else like Barton they probably arent letting their honey barrels leave to be put under another label.  That doesnt mean it will be bad whiskey but that it probably wont be great or outstanding.The problem with people using MGP distillate or otherwise buying barrels is when they make up a BS marketing story and hide that they dont actually make it themselves.,bourbon,cxu5i7v,2,t5_2rgos

6088750,0,t3_3yyh2o,As a quick caveat this is my first review.  Also I had a brain tumor a few years ago the swelling after the surgery to remove it gave me aphasia or trouble thinking of the words I want to use.  Its especially bad when trying to relay sensory information like taste and smell so please bear with me a little bit.Recently user uxpentakx was kind enough to swap a number of samples of his whiskies for a bottle.  He also included a mystery sample with the caveat that I dont get to know what it is until I review it and thus I dont quite know what Im drinking.  I should also specify that I drank it neat. Color An auburnamber color it reminds me of looking at a jar of good dark honey. Nose A sweet grain smell comes with the sort of antiseptic smell of the alcohol its gentle but lingers after you move it away from your nose. Taste It has a nice burn but that doesnt detract at all from its smoothness.  The grain from the nose comes through and theres a mellow sweetness.  I pick up some honey flavor woody and it has a nice thick texture when I run it around my mouth. Finish A lingering warmth as the sweetness ebbs really great on a cold and dreary day like today.  If I close my mouth and inhale it blurs nicely into my sinuses.Id prefer not to give it a hard grade for a couple reasons namely that I dont think Ive had nearly enough whiskies to make a conclusive judgment and because I feel assigning it one divorces me from it a bit like a photograph compared to a memory.  Needless to say I enjoyed it quite a bit.,bourbon,cyhpojy,5,t5_2rgos

The consumer is told one thing its the labels product while in reality its simple white labeling and the labels distiller had no to minimal part in it outside of picking a recipe.Im one of those silly folks that kinda wants to taste the expression and art of the distiller in their middle to premium bottles.

And there is simply demand because of rarity despite them being overoaked? Or would you say that people are just uninformed?

6243059,0,t3_413khp,Review  Elijah Craig Barrel Proof Batch  Hailing from Heaven Hill Distillery is the iconic Elijah Craig bottled at Barrel Proof and unfiltered with at least  years under its belt. Ive been working through this bottle for some time and it seemed like a good time to get notes down over a few nights. This is  mashbill cornryebarley same as Evan Williams and a few other brands. This is Batch  weighing in with a proof of .. I tasted this both neat and with a splash of water in a Riedel malt glass. Nose nutmeg and vanilla caramel creams almost like a Cows Tail if youve ever had one. Beneath that a bit of dark honey graham cracker dried apricot  pineapple and finally a hint of burnt marshmallow. A bit of alcohol and OAK OAK OAK come out as the pour warms up. Water reveals the earlier notes without really opening the door to anything new. This would be a much higher score without the oak dominance.. Taste full lots of expected burn alongside spices and black pepper. Water really helps this shine making it much more oily and full with the aforementioned flavors much more perceivable. Finish sweet caramel and vanilla cream those Cow Tails!. Apricot dried cherry and burnt orange peel lingers very lightly. A bit of bitter honey lingers in the back of the palate for some time. Not nearly as much burn as youd expect. Water again really helps sweetness emerges and the finish lengthens considerably. . Intangibles for a limited release is more available than mostand at good price point particular given the  year age statement. Lets start with the obvious Elijah Craig is known as a strong oaky bourbon. That is nowhere more clear than in its barrel proof offering.There are some nights that this is just fabulous there are others where I cant handle the punch of oak it presents. Its probably one of the more variable pours Ive ever had  one moment it is all oak the next its a graham cracker and honey delight. The shift from night to night is even more variable. Ive enjoyed drinking this bottlebut its one that has taken nearly  years to wind down because of its intensity. At any rate this score fairly well on my scale showing up as a solidly good whisky. I would rate it as must buy if you can handle a stronger oak forward bourbon. Make no mistake this one demands attention and care while you drink it or else youll miss the fireworks. OverAll .

6529738,0,t3_452t98,Thanks to ulvldramacenter for this sample.Whiskey. Single Malt. These things usually dont go together. Because of that e which tells off the royal family or something.Also it takes awhile to become good at something. Bourbon as in the style not the collective term we use here takes well to hotter areas virgin oak and aging quicker than its single malt frenemies from across the pond.So when I hear of an American Single Malt from a company that is in Washington the state not the capital and from what I can tell has had their Facebook page since before  Cant tell how long the whiskey has been made but that Facebook page is impressive.... shit lost my train of thought... Oh Im skeptical. Thats what I was writing. My bad.Joking aside this distillery looks quite interesting. Going the single malt route. And thus Im trying their entry level malt I think Westland American Single Malt. I can find that it was aged in new American oak casks and uses  different types of barley malts. All from the Washington area.Sounds tasty. And worth being my th review not so humble brag of American whiskey. Or it could fall on its face and Ive wasted a number that can be divided by  and .Oh the humanity end sarcasm.Wish I had a sample of the peated one however Ill have to wait until I visit out West and pick it up.Lets see how this one tastes first shall we?Price NA at the LCBORegion WashingtonMinimum Age  yearsCask Type Heavy Char New American OakAbv Colour YR Nose Orange lemon caramel wood nutmeg perfumeThis is an odd duck. First of all its liquid and usually ducks are flesh and bone.Oh. Wait. This isnt a duck review. My bad.This whiskey got it right this time is odd. It reminds me more of a Lowland however theres these hard woody notes from the New American Oak Im guessing they could be from something else. Nice deep caramel notes here.Its light though I ascribe that to the age versus anything else. Good start.Taste Buttered popcorn peach burn fennelIll admit it up front here Theres some youth to this. And like most youths it doesnt know what to do with its mouthfeel.What? Im on a list somewhere now arent I?While its simple and young I do love the buttered popcorn note and eventually the peach and fennel notes. Again good start.Finish Oak pepper sugarcane eucalyptus smokeSo Ive been giving this one some slack while reviewing it. Mostly because theres things I like or I understand its new. That doesnt mean itll get a high mark or anything but Im being nice.The finish is disjoint to the rest and where the real work is going to be needed. I dont hate it I just wish it was on a different dram.Conclusion Fruity for  good start and not close to the roughest nearly new make dram Ive ever had. I can see where they are going with some of this. I was to try others. Is it amazing? No. It needs some time. Some tweaking. More depth more... really just more to it. I want more. I want them to release a  year malt. I love the fermentation time and rain bill is on the website. This is a distillery I want to see make it.So Im going to be patient and wait.

Its also hypocritical for so many people to rail against such stores and the secondary but expect secondary values to trade their bottles.Ive never traded and Ive never bought a Ferrari.  Most businesses operate off of a certain amount of mark up.  Shopping around allows you to figure out what the usual mark up is and cars have a sticker price on the windshield.  Maybe Ferraris also have some surcharge the dealership does because youre buying a luxury car but at least in car buying and trading certain things are negotiable.

Basically think a much lower scale version of Silk Road.  Its not so much a user risk thats always been a low scale risk.  The issue with profiting from something relatively unavailable goes hand in hand with the unavailability of it.  The often pointed to figure for this is the pure flipper.  The guy wholl buy up all of the somewhat rare stuff they can find just to sell it for profit.  Theyre often characterized as having no particular interest in the whiskey itself but just to make that money.  Theyre viewed as clearing the shelves that causes those things to be rare.  If people were to leave stuff on the shelves unless they actually wanted it for themselves some of these things wouldnt be so rare.

I dont really do any hunting for BTAC because the  sq. mile area around me gets maybe  bottles but I had to ask. She politely tells me its for another customer but asks if I was looking for anything else because she knows tis the season! Coming off  years of Michters  being amazing and no one really knowingcaring about it I ask if she might be able to get me a bottle. She goes in the back brings out a case and says I can take as much as I want. I offer to buy the case  bottles because its been my absolute favorite the past  years and she gives me the  case discount off the already low retail price. M now sucks ended up trading two bottles for the Four Roses small batch LE and filling an old BMH bottle with the open bottle because I like the label betterThen she says Hey let me get your number juuuuust in case the woman doesnt want this bottle. Sure enough a week later she called me and said the Handy was mine if I wanted it because the lady didnt know it was  and she only wanted to spend . Since then I somehow have become the first person she calls when they get anything new or allocated even though I rarely buy any of the high dollar stuff. When I come in shell chat with me about new releases which she doesnt know about and I kind of do so I think Ive become her stores probono whisky buyer.

Rich cake mixed with toasted oak profile.Palate Oddly sweet with gingerbread rye crackers a dash of salt and some oak tannins which lend to a great oily mouthfeel.Finish Rye lingers for a bit with the toasted oak note but relatively short and mild all around.Rating   The rye seems quite muted to me throughout  wouldve liked it to be a bit stronger.Value for the money Guesssing this retailed for around  or so which is an ok price.Link to blogpost ,bourbon,d37fwcd,3,t5_2rgos

I keep a separate file where I attempt to score all these numerically but Im never happy with how Im using the numbers and am constantly reevaluating and tweaking them. When I took the time to consult that list the bigger drop off actually happened after the ECBP. But in my memory the WTRB seemed higher and I find myself coveting it from time to time. Truth is though I probably shouldve left it off this specific list. But youre getting a great pour regardless. ,bourbon,d38grbn,1,t5_2rgos

7644266,0,t3_4k0d57,Review   Jim Beam Signature Craft Brandy Finish A small batch offering of JB finished with rare Spanish Brandy meaning the brandy was actually added to the bourbon.Price   mlMashbill   corn  rye  barley Nose   Rich fruits and floral notes. Some grass. Spices  cinnamon and cloves. Vanilla oak. Very strong influence from the brandy here  I had to really search through the fruit and floral to find bourbon scents.Palate  Warm and fruity. Its like a young rye without any of the burn or grain forward notes. A bit of cinnamon with vanilla notes coming in at the very end. Medium body that spreads well and sticks to the tongue.Finish  The finish is the most bourbony part of it classic caramel and oak notes fading over several seconds. Cinnamon burn starts once the rest of the flavor is gone and continues for the better part of a minute.Ive drank about half this bottle over the last few months and just now found that its brandy added to the bourbon and not just bourbon finished in brandy casks. I might have to try some brandy now. Im interested to know the ratio of bourbon to brandy in the blend but I couldnt find that information anywhere. Its definitely an interesting pour but I probably wont be buying it again.Overall  ,bourbon,d3b41cv,8,t5_2rgos

Although I heard that George Dickle may release a  year old version at their gift shop. I found the label interesting. It states hand crafted in small batches which I assume means distilled? It also states on the label that it is a hand selected barrel. Usually when I see small batch on a label it means it is a blend of various aged whiskey barrels. Also based on research online I believe the bottle no. on the label is actually the barrel number. When I initially read the label it gave me a moment of pause to understand it.Nose Rich caramel. Peanut. Cinnamon. Oak. Spice. Clove.Palate Very nice thick and oily mouth feel. That rich caramel and peanut on the nose is at the forefront on the palate. Also like a caramel corn with nuts in the mix. Boiled cherries. Pepper. Cinnamon. Spice. Oak.Finish Medium. That rich caramel and spice stay on the finish. Little cinnamon and oak.Grade    B  Great Always want to have a bottleGrades ExplainedI really enjoyed this bottle of George Dickel  year old whiskey.

7892809,0,t3_4neiss,Considered one of High Wests Limited Releases this is an intentional blend of bourbon and rye not some accident hence bourye. According to their website another  release review the secret blend consists of the following whiskies  year old bourbon  rye  barley from Indiana  year old rye  barley from MGP  year old rye  barley from MGP  year old rye  corn  barley from Barton DistilleryHigh West Bourye   ABVBatch BNeat in a glencairnNose  Sweet vanilla butterscotch sweet corn brown sugar simple syrup faint hint of sweet mint.Taste  Spiced dark chocolate dark caramel cinnamon spice cracked black pepper an herbaly sweet mint very stubtle dill and a very buttery mouthfeel.Finish  Lingering warmth of cinnamon spice turns lightly bitter like if you were trying to strip the bark off of a young green tree branch.Purchased December of   mL   USD after WA state taxes of .  .literSo the very first time I tried this was at a bar in Seattle and not knowing which batch it came from that one was a lot more complex than my current bottle and what convinced me to get the bottle I have. It had a lot more pronounced fruity floral and dill note and in general seemed a lot more interesting. This batch seems to be more dominated by the bourbon and the herbalfruity notes I previously got seem to be a lot more muted or not even present. I think if this bottle tasted more like the one I had at the bar I would probably rate it a bit higher but this particular batch just doesnt do it for me especially at the price I paid for it my reviews always ignore the price and are of the whiskey itself.,bourbon,d4384gp,1,t5_2rgos

This is a big issue that a few people find with forged oak it comes across as an oak bomb which is not a problem for the oak fans. The problem comes that with other oak bombs like barterhouse or ec you still get other nuance besides wood. Caramels and toffee hints of dried fruit and baking spice those bourbon hallmarks are still there to some extent or another. Forged oak doesnt have these this could be a result of proof or just an unfortunate result of Rick house location. ,bourbon,d4c41rg,1,t5_2rgos

By playing with the ratio one could get close to  or adjust in either direction to personal taste.   Some dipshits riding the Pappy! hype train seized on the above vatting as Poor Mans Pappy because Weller and Pappy are wheaters from Buffalo Trace.  Given that Pappy is   or  years old its ridiculous to pretend that some vatting of  yr and  yr will end up with the profile of much older juice.  That WSR is now being used with Antique shows just how far off the rails Pappy mania has gone.Vat your Wellers as you see fit.  Find a vatting that you enjoy and be happy.

8295659,0,t3_4t3cdo,It most certainly is whisky by the definition of the term but I am speaking more from a taste perspective. If you are expecting a whiskylike experience when you sit down with it it will be very different.  It tastes very different from most things and it is more cocktail like.  I like liquorliqueur cocktails like scotchamaretto and YKY reminds me of that.  You need to be in the mood for that and if you arent sure what you are about to drink it could be a shock.

Since I am a scientist it is my duty to vanquish mystery wherever it may lay. Time to get down to this one. Color Amber maple  nice reddish hue. Nose Fruity creamy spicey. Probably rye I think. Not a lot of metal or dill but its got punch and bite. Oddly fruity though.Taste Moderately thick mouth feel and no alcohol at all. Spicy and a lot like cleaning chemical though  astringency is a big player here. Minor lemon some pine some dough. Mostly astringent despite the lack of ethanol     Finish Medium length. Oddly prickly and hot ethanol spiking in. Mellow at the same time. Definitely rye I think but its really mellow. Very dark so Im guessing  years but maybe a hair more.  Guess A moderately aged rye probably craft although I dont know of any craft producers that could produce a yr or older rye without using MGP sourced juice. So all I got is moderately aged nonMGP rye. Real head scratcher.  Reveal Collingwood yr Rye  ABVOverall There is a reason this is a yr rye selling for  or so here. Its good  I dont actively dislike it but its all over the place. Fruity hot astringent spicy. My hunch was sort of correct  Collingwood yr is  malted candian? rye. It hits some of the right notes and boy did it take me for a run but in the end Id rather save a few bucks and have a solid SAOS yr Rye with a free proof upgrade. Im scoring this dram a   it has flaws and I wouldnt reach for this on a table full of ryes. At rank  Collingwood yr Rye sits with other almosts like Elijah Craig NAS Alberta Dark Horse Rye and High West Double Rye. So close little buddy. Thanks for the mystery Ethan no wonder this is a misfit.

8799713,0,t1_d74w0p0,There iswas havent seen one in a while a guy who reviewed the penultimate pour of the bottle he was working with. I think this is a good idea. Were I doing reviews I would make review notes from a minimum of three pours about two weeks after the bottle was opened at about half of the bottle then again at about th left. This will give a good look at the progression of the liquid as its drawn down. In the same vein I would make notes from not fewer than three sips of the glass at the beginning and again each time the predominant tastes change. This will give a look at how the pour changes over time. For example take a typical experience of mine with a pour of Knob Creek . It starts like a full flavored Beam bourbon. As time passes flavors fade and rise and fade again until at the end maybe an hour plus later it is nearly flavorless. I do realize this is a lot of work but to me drinking bourbon brings an ever changing kaleidoscope of flavors. This is definitely not a bad thing.I think how a bottle changes after opening is an important aspect of the overall quality of the bourbon as are the changes it undergoes while sipping.I wish I could trust my palate the way some here do but when Im the only one who gets a slight flavor of tomato juice in my MWRR and really cant taste the rye for  mins or so into the pour I hesitate to put that out there. I dont think my palate or my imagination fits most others. That said I really like RR and for that matter the KC regardless of the fact the last fifteen minutes are not that different than drinking a glass of water.,bourbon,d75ltbq,2,t5_2rgos

Im ready to sit down at the movies from the smell. Surprisingly little alcohol smell for . ABV. Taste An oily buttered popcorn covers my tongue followed by candy corn and vanilla. I recognize the unaged base of buffalo trace distinctly.Finish Now the alcohol shows up to bite the tongue with some heat and warm the throat as it goes down. A feel of powdery corn remains for a few seconds.Comments A interesting drink to be sure and much better than I excepted. I found that mixing with a half can of vanilla coke a few mint leaves and a splash of lime juice and ice makes and excellent summer beverage.

9456144,0,t3_5a969a,Over the years Ive been fortunate enough to make internet friends with some really nice people in the whiskey hobby. Some of those friends happen to be members of a whiskey group known as the Bourbon Crusaders who do some private single barrel selections. Their most recent selection was a ridiculously high proofed Charbay and one of my connections there was generous enough to send me a sample. I also happened to have another high proof Charbay sample on hand so I thought it would be fun to do a little side by side.  Charbay Release IIIDistilled from a barley beer that had hops added before it was distilled. It was aged for  years in charred oak and then left to mingle for an additional  years in netural vessels before being bottled. The release was very limited at  cases bottled at . proof and currently retails for  ouch.On the nose it smells like high proof high IBU stout beer. Imagine a  proof Goose Island Bourbon County IPA  APA  stout as it has characteristics of all those types of beers with the syrupy richness I usually only find in the Goose Island limited editions. On the palate it tastes a lot like the nose but the hoppy funk is more amped up than the stout notes. Intense would be an understatement to describe the flavors here. For all intents and purposes this tastes like barrel proof weed. Its so dank and funky but underneath all that is the deep sweet rich backbone of freshly charred oak notes that come from a cask strength American whiskey. Its incredibly wild and bizarre. I wouldnt want to drink this very often and the retail cost is many times beyond my comfort zone but it gets an A for uniqueness and A for taste. Bourbon Crusaders Charbay Single BarrelDistilled from rye beer IPA beer and stout beer that was aged  years in glass then combined with more stout beer distillate and malt distillate and aged  years in charred oak. It was bottled at  !!! proof. No word on cost but who cares because you cant buy it anyway.On the nose there is a lot of fruity citrus and American Pale Ale beer notes. The ethanol content is undeniably strong but its  million proof so no surprises there. The taste is absolutely fucking mental. Its really hot but Ive had lower proof whiskeys that were harder to drink. Once you get past the heat theres a crazy density of fresh charred oak sweet notes followed by skunky hops and intense citrus. Its still pretty dank but this one is less of a skunk weed bomb and more like a barrel proof Ballast Point Grapefruit Sculpin beer.Again not something you would want to drink very often and I still cant justify retail Charbay pricing here but this is one of the craziest things I have ever drank in my life. Ill give it an A for uniqueness and A for taste. ampnbspNote that price is not considered when assigning a rating. You can find more of my reviews on my blog signde drinks,bourbon,d9emtdq,9,t5_2rgos

9686108,0,t1_da70ng3,Weller     Aged  years  ABV     Weller.  Oh sweet Weller how taters doth adore ye.I learned early on that asking store owners Do you have any Weller? or Do you have any BTAC? would receive an immediate glassedover judgmental look accompanied by a disdainful no.  I didnt know any better!  I was just a bourbon newb...Im pretty sure I wont ever own a bottle of BTAC and Im OK with that.  I thought Weller  was on that list too  I had consigned myself to never being able to own a bottle or taste what others think is liquid gold.  Thats OK theres plenty out there to taste  right?  One random stop in a local ABC store and an odd conversation later and I walked out with a bottle of Weller .  Seriously?  Me?  Things like this never happen to me...  Nose    Wow.  A gentle sweet embrace wafts out of this glass.  Ripe melon hay caramel vanilla and a faint hint of tea.  Palate    If I had to pick only one bourbon to drink from here on this would be a serious contender.  Its simple but its really good  nice balance of sweet and tannic.  A touch hot on entry my tongue is quickly enveloped by caramels and vanillas soft sweets and heavy oaks.  Mouthfeel is creamy and rich.Finish    This doesnt exactly disappear when it hits the back of the mouth but it gets pretty darn shy  no hug going down just a nice playful hint.  Less warm more flirty.Aftertaste    Very nice  slightly bitter very sweet.  Mouth isnt dry at all. Overall    One of my favorite things about Weller  is alignment  nothing is out of place from nose to aftertaste.  The nose advertises what Im going to taste the palate is scrumptious and matches what I smelled and the finish and aftertaste are pleasant memories that leave me wanting more.  Nothing out of place no odd notes  nothing complex but perfect execution of a sweet oaky wheated bourbon.  Lipsmacking good.Rating Comparisons This is usually where I offer a rating of what Im reviewing.  This is only my second side by side review and the first one a wheated roundup included a rating for each glass.  Since writing that review Ive been thinking  its kind of unfair to rate something when Im doing a side by side  really what Im doing is comparing things against one another and that doesnt lend itself to an independent rating for each item.  So Im going to try something different for my SbS reviews.  Ill start with  as the best and work my way down the list in order of how much I like each one as compared to the rest.  Ill use gaps between numbers to indicate how much of a difference there is in how much I like each SbS entry.  The larger the number the less I liked that one in comparison with the rest.  Ill also include a rough estimation of what I would rate the top and bottom bourbons just to add a little context to the side by side. Well see how this goes...Bottle | Side by Side Rating | Rough Rating||Elijah Craig Barrel Proof |  most favorite | Weller  | . | Smooth Ambler Old Scout Rye |  | Noahs Mill |  | Willett Pot Still |  least favorite | My Rating Scale not used on side by side reviews      Transcendent.  A chorus of angels sing sweet nothings as they cascade down my throat.  Maybe not angelic but still phenomenal.  I will pay a lot of money for another one.  I really like this.  If its expensive I have no regrets buying it.  If its cheap Ill probably get another one when this ones empty.  Solidly decent.  Ill miss it when its gone and might buy another in the future some time.  Good option at a bar when theres a wall of mediocrity.  Meh not bad not great.

9813214,0,t1_damkqdq,Its difficult to conclude theyve proven anything from that press release.  Leaving aside what exactly is meant by  and  sunlight BT says the barrels were subject to exceptionally wide swings of temperature and pressure never before encountered in bourbon aging  which means that both the controls and experimental barrels are poor simulations for what happens in a real rickhouse.  This would be fine if the experiment were designed to test the effect of wide temperature swings but it wasnt.  Hell even keeping all the barrels at a constant temperature and humidity would have been preferable because at least that would totally isolate the effect of light exposure. The correlation of PSI to sunlight exposure is unsurprising and almost certainly due to the faster heating of air compared to the liquid whose temperature they were monitoringcontrolling and in any case it does not require  years to demonstrate this nor do you need two years to demonstrate that high temperatures cause greater water evaporation.If you have limited time and resources why not start by testing something reasonable and impactful?  Like honey barrels and windows the divorce rate in Maine has a very close correlation to the per capita consumption of margarine  If I wanted to study the psychosocial causes of failed marriages and had limited time and resources to do so do you think I should start with margarine or perhaps something more plausible?,bourbon,damosmb,2,t5_2rgos

9892696,0,t3_5h2yh7,For a long time wooden barrels were used to store a bunch of shit so it wasnt an uncommon practice in a broad sense. Being misers whiskey producers in the US reused barrels that once stored fish to then store whiskey. In order to avoid fishy notes the barrels were burned before the whiskey entered. There was little thought about how it might affect the flavor of the whiskey. As barrels traveled down the Mississippi or whatever route the whiskey changed in profile and color and people started specifically asking for that whiskey from Bourbon County. Meanwhile in Scotland they were also misers and reused wine sherry and port casks to store their whiskey simply to save money. They began to discover how the profiles changed depending on the type of barrel used. After prohibition and once regulations were put in place in the US regulating the use of virgin charred oak barrels the Scottish again to save money capitalized on a bunch of cheap onceused barrels. At least thats how I remember it. But feel free to correct me Im usually drinking while I learn about this stuff and Im sure a good part of it is romanticized. ,bourbon,dax1i8s,31,t5_2rgos

9930554,0,t3_5hpqdn,Wild Turkey Vertical TastingI am of the opinion that Wild Turkey has gotten worse over the years. There are three possible reasons for this change i the increase in barrel entry proof ii the bottling of younger bourbon because of shortages of aged whiskey and iii distillation or bottling of inferior whiskey. Admittedly iii is rather broad. My theory was that this perceived decline in quality was due to the increase in barrel entry proof. I decided to test this by doing a blind sidebyside tasting of four bottles of Wild Turkey  Year that had entered the barrel at different proofs. All would be about  years old and distilled at the old Wild Turkey Distillery. This would hone in on the effect of increased barrel entry proofs. The dates on when the barrel entry proof increased are fuzzy. Originally Wild Turkey entered the barrel at  proof. This was raised to  sometime in the s. Sometime after  the barrel entry proof was raised to . Around  the barrel entry proof was raised to . For this tasting I purchased four bottles of WT bottled in    and  respectively. The  distilled in or before  entered the barrel at  proof. The  distilled in or before  likely entered the barrel at  proof. The  distilled in or before  likely entered the barrel at  proof. The  distilled in or before  likely entered the barrel at  proof. These are my best guesses. Like I said the barrel entry proof timeline is fuzzy. There were three other participants of this tasting all of which were familiar with the Wild Turkey profile. I was the only one that had tasted all of these bottles prior to the tasting.  We tasted the four bourbons sidebyside. Below are the three other participants rankings of the bourbon. I have not included my own rankings because I was suffering from allergies at the time of the tasting and because I was already familiar with these four bottles which would somewhat color my tasting. Participant||||||||A||||B||||C||||As you can see the  was the clear loser. This disproved my theory that the decrease in barrel entry proof is the culprit in declining quality. The corollary to this is that recent Wild Turkey has gotten much better. As you can see from the tasting notes below however the current bottlings struck the participants as being very different from the classic Wild Turkey profile. I think this is a result of the increased barrel entry proof. This bourbon tasted cleaner than the other bottlings which I hypothesize is a result of the higher proofed whiskey dissolving fewer of the woody elements of the barrel. Participant B thought this was an improvement while the other two thought it was worse. Unsurprisingly the  Wild Turkey was the favorite. While there was not noticeable difference in the color of the WT from the s the  WT was noticeably darker. The  however had some strong vegetal notes that Participant B found unappealing.As you might expect the  Wild Turkey tasted like classic Wild Turkey. While the tasting notes below are positive dont interpret these to mean that you should seek out this whiskey. Any bottling of Wild Turkey  for example blows this bottling out of the water.  This tasting showed that there was no clear correlation between barrel entry proof and perceived quality. Nevertheless I think there was a clear relationship between barrel entry proof and flavor. The higher the barrel entry proof the less vegetal flavors some people might call this funk and the cleaner the bourbon tasted. Ive synthesized tasting notes below based on the notes of all of the participants. I may post more detailed reviews at a later date. Wild Turkey  Year Wow. Great nose with very sweet cakelike notes that are contrasted by notes of lemon. The flavor is very round with honey grass and vegetal notes. A long finish but without any burn. Wild Turkey  Year Classic Wild Turkey. Good round nose with notes of apple brown sugar and vanilla. A little bit of burn on the palate with a nice sweet caramel and vanilla flavor. The finish is dry and a little short. Wild Turkey  Year This is a train wreck. A very weak nose with notes of apples and peanuts. The palate is acrid with a thin mouthfeel. There is some sweetness as the flavors progress but the whiskey is not complicated. The finish is long but is unpleasantly bitter and astringent. Wild Turkey  Year This doesnt taste like Wild Turkey. The nose has notes of green apple and acetone. The mouthfeel is very clean and the flavor is sweet and fruity. There are slight notes of vanilla. Overall the palate is very sweet creamy and round. ,bourbon,db1z5tm,10,t5_2rgos
9950595,0,t1_db4f4c5,An honest answer is something along the lines of I appreciate that recent upturns in the bourbon market have found your product undervalued. I do not think its prudent in terms of your long time and loyal fans to double the MSRP on your product. I would think that slowly increasing MSRP over time in order to align with the current  market would be more in line with your adherence to customer retention. And I fully support that business model.  But frankly I see this as nothing but a cash grab. I wish you the best in your upcoming financial success but know youve not only lost a customer but an outspoken advocate. For the rest of his life.

I believe this is the current batchoffering of RT on the market.  Available for ish USD in most markets. Tasted neat.Nose Cooked caramelized corn vanilla rye spice a little peanut brittle a sharp pop of fruity alcohol. Really nice.Taste Sizzling rye spice is very prominent for me followed by corn vanilla caramel candy mint small amount of oak. Some heat with well rounded fruity alcohol. Very tasty.Finish Long spice caramel vanilla sweet peanutness that covers the tongue with a dry oaky mouthfeel sticking around.This is really good. The sweetness is well paired with the heat. Not overly complex but I can kick back and really enjoy the sweet and spicy flavors. I find a high amount of enjoyment to price ratio here and this has really opened my eyes to WTs higher end after not loving WT .

10334558,0,t1_dcfh4j8,uJOHNON  It all depends on the labeling. A the TTB seems to be applying their regulations you can finish a straight bourbon in a cask that once contained sherry but you can no longer label it simply Straight Bourbon but you can label it Straight Bourbon Whiskey Finished in Sherry Casks. Being altered after the fact doesnt negate the fact that it went in to the process as a straight bourbon. You cant add the finishing time in the sherry cask to the overall age of the whiskey though. So you could say  year old straight bourbon finished for  months in a sherry cask but you cant say  year old straight bourbon finished in a sherry cask if it was only in the new charred barrel for  of those years.,bourbon,dcfhabo,2,t5_2rgos

WTRB.  Some words to describe were complex rich vanilla caramel funk peanut.WT  from  smelled like Wild Turkey.  Brought back memories from one guy who remembered the smell from hunting with his family and smelling the bottle that was passed.WT  current is so light and young compared to the s version.RR SiB is so much better after airing out we tried this same bottle immediately after opening it this past fall and it was gassy after a member drank half the bottle it settled and was the easiest of all of the drinks drinking far below its proof.After this tasting I poured a  year split label  that I received in a swap.   Older richer funkier smooooooth.As the host the last drink of the night is the hosts choice  I stayed on the theme of the Turkey and we tasted a WT Kentucky Spirit I have from .   Vanilla Caramel Light oak and beautiful.   Such a fine drink.One member stayed to the end of the hockey game that was on and we ended the night with an ounce each of WT Forgiven.   A nice light touch to the end of the night with a completely different profile of the WT line.  A forgettable bourbon if we began with it but perfect as a cap to the night.Thanks to those who I traded with to get me the samples I mentioned one of my New Years promises to myself is to keep better track of who sent me samples so I can mention their generosity.

It may make more sense for you to buy smaller portions of different whiskies rather than full bottles.Youre going to get the most flavoraroma drinking it neat in a tulipshaped glass like a Glencairn but most new drinkers prefer to water down their whisky a bit. If you do end up adding water Id recommend adding just enough to make it tolerable and take small sips. But really theres no right or wrong way to drink so as long as youre enjoying it youre doing it right.Searching rbourbon may yield some additional insights as well.

I was loving a lot of what this guy was about for a minute and after that thought what are you TALKING ABOUT!? Its not the end of good bourbon. Its still great everywhere you go.

10659893,0,t3_5sj7fd,DetailsProof Age Aged  yrs or more whatever that meansBackground Traverse City Whiskey Co hails from the great state of Michigan in what the company calls the quaint and authentic town of Traverse City. The company claims that its brewing and more importantly its distilling tradition has been passed down for generations. The actual creation of the whiskey is a little bit unclear. They mention aging the barrels and planting crops at the family farm but no mention of actually distilling anything.Honestly this seems like a relatively new whiskey company and Im not an expert marketer Im not even an amateur marketer but I think these tales of grandpops secret family recipe a bit played out. But being from the Midwest myself I was happy to pick up a bottle and support a somewhat local business. I paid  for this whiskey for ml. ReviewColorAppearance Amber with a yelloworange glow. Slightly oily leaving long streaks on my glass. Nose This bourbon punched in the face with me orange peel and cherry followed more deeply by caramel and hints vanilla. Quite pleasant smelling. Unlike a lot of bourbons I didnt get any spice which is something I expect so I was surprised by the lack thereof.Given the low proof you arent overpowered with ethanol and can really appreciate the scent. Palate Interestingly although this bourbon smells quite nice it didnt seem to contain much flavor. There wasnt anything particularly distinctive at all which while not unenjoyable wasnt particularly enjoyable either. The mouthfeel was somewhere in between thick and buttery and dry and thin. I picked up some flavor of corn and wheat and it I did taste a bit minerally almost as if it was poured through a stone funnel directly into the bottle. Finish There isnt a distinctive finish on this bourbon either. It was a little bit bready almost like stale grocery store wheat bread and a little bit nutty. That said to tell the truth any flavor was gone almost as soon as I had swallowed it. Leaving a slight burning and sensation of warmth but not much else. Overall Overall there isnt a lot to say for this bourbon. Its sort of like a trip to Oklahoma. Its not bad but you probably arent going to bring it up in conversation. When I Would Recommend If youre having a party and you want a fancy looking bottle and an inoffensive whiskey to mix drinks with this would be a good match for you. It has a fun if not clich story and would be a fun gift for someone in or near the MI area. Also on the plus side its low proof so no one is going to be throwing up on your new carpet.

10922607,0,t1_de51xcl,Until I found a private selection at the FR gift shop I had only had OBSV. I picked up an OBSK and its by far my favorite Bourbon ever to touch my lips  particularly among rye based recipes. I dont really like comparing Pappy  to it because of the differences in wheat vs rye but I tend to prefer rye and given the option between the two I would take the OBSK in the bottle I have. Unfortunately I dont have much of it left. Interestingly I put on an introduction to bourbon class for a local restaurants wait and bar staff recently that had a tasting component. I let them taste same recipe with different age or barrel handling Buffalo Trace vs Eagle Rare and same mash bill with different yeast FR SiB OBSV vs FR SiB OBSK. The entire staff was amazed at the difference between the two FR tastings. Pretty much everyone involved thought the OBSK was superior. Part of that is probably the fact that it was an Elliott Select but I really like what the K yeast is doing.,bourbon,de6la5n,1,t5_2rgos

11528041,0,t3_64hw3k,Despite all the negativity in this thread I think this is an interesting question. Dont mind the other guys they generally knock down new people for some reason. If you stick around theyll warm up to you.Koval  As others have mentioned. I think this is a distiller that may not be around forever. But what they are doing is interesting with the way they develop their whiskey. There could be a real run on these earlyish bottles whether they en up being successful or not. Think Buffalo Trace Experimental Collection and the crazy prices of those.Hudson Baby Bourbon  As bourbon becomes more sarce like with age statements I think well see more producers go to ml bottles as standard. These guys will have a claim at the original ml full priced bottle they may not actually have been the first but that generally doesnt matter in the bourbon world. Additionally the link with Sully and the miracle on the Hudson like EHT Tornado survivor HH Fire survivor etc. will drive up prices.Stranahans Snowflake  This one isnt as much under the radar as the others and is a little harder to find. Mainly due to the rise in popularity of the snowflake insult for someone that got their feelings hurt when they are offended by someone or some group.Finally Rye is really the next big thing so get on that early. Head on over to rrye to learn more about specific gold mines.,bourbon,dg2peim,8,t5_2rgos
11528116,0,t1_dg2pdqb,Smooth Ambler is lauded as one of the best NDP in the game and now becoming a very solid producer. Sure they cant compete with Hudson Corsair Koval etc but they are still nothing to sneeze at. ,bourbon,dg2ppjx,6,t5_2rgos

11584106,0,t1_dg5ehml,The restricted distribution is a fairly recent decision. So there will be bottles lingering in other states until those stocks run out. I see plenty north of the river. But I believe you are correct that HH as limited this to KY only now. ,bourbon,dg92d3l,2,t5_2rgos
11599135,0,t3_65gp2n,Can Bourbon be finished in a used cask?Just asking but I thought it couldnt be called Bourbon if it is flavored.,bourbon,dgarr1w,1,t5_2rgos
11602127,0,t1_dgb3u6y,OOhhhh.  I dont know how I so frequently forget about Whistlepig.  Ive had it and its clearly good but its been long enough that Ive forgotten its taste.  The only store pick Ive had was finished in a sherry or madeira cask or something and I definitely wasnt in love with it.  I did pick up a couple bottles for gifts  trades though but Ive since shipped them away. ,bourbon,dgb3z78,1,t5_2rgos

11636397,0,t1_dgdeupe,Interesting looking product.  But  for a  mL bottle?  Since only a little is used in a Manhattan this screams bottle share even more than bottle sharing of expensive  or rare bourbons.,bourbon,dgezycc,1,t5_2rgos
11659647,0,t1_dgeavgw,Yes I believe the mash bill is  malted rye. I suspect it is the malted grain that gives it the earthy flavor at least to me. Havent had Springbank but all malted barley whiskies Ive had come across as earthy to me.Also the Old Pogues Distillery is worth checking out. Super small setup basically the back half of a two car garage. The old house on site is really cool to check out as well. Lots of history.,bourbon,dghmwb6,2,t5_2rgos

11666691,0,t3_66ha6g,The charity bottles averaged  with the biggest pull at  highlighting why an average is a crappy metric.  Curious what this will mean for the retail price will they take the BTAC price strategy or actually use this as a line to cash in.  I assume this will be a hard pass once MSRP is released.  Ill put my wager  in at .  Kinda seems like an expensive Single Oak Project crapshoot as each vintage will have different mash bills and ages.  Seems the retail release will start with  and later vintages per the OFC website  Given the variety and assumed price I doubt this will even be a consideration for me. ,bourbon,dgifnpu,3,t5_2rgos

11673734,0,t1_dgj3uvv,So how old do these need to be to be really good stuff rather than sourced MGP?  How can you really tell?  I feel like I need a guide. ,bourbon,dgj8fm1,1,t5_2rgos
11683142,0,t1_dgk2u2q,Good review.  Ive tried it at a friends house a couple of times and my recollection is similar.  Its pretty decent.  If the price was low  range it could be a buy.  In the  range its a pass for me.  ,bourbon,dgkaupc,3,t5_2rgos

11735468,0,t1_dgq7ykv,I would say more of the common bourbons so not super allocated or limited releases.  Similar to say  RR Bookers etc.,bourbon,dgq8tx6,0,t5_2rgos
11737988,0,t1_dgqd64n,Let me try this one more time...We can have a differing opinion on weather something is getting better or worse based on its age.However quality control is process that is either occurring or not occurring. Removing a previous requirement is removing a quality control from that product.Therefore removing an age statement is removing a quality control...,bourbon,dgqj4c4,4,t5_2rgos

11753054,0,t3_67prg3,gt A point or  higher than the current stuff but nothing beyond a very solid bottommid shelf bottle though. Dont expect to encounter an untapped source for amazing dusty Wild Turkey juice like the agedstated bottles that go for big . This is more of a fun and interesting trip back in time when Wild Turkey did things a little differently.,bourbon,dgs8l13,1,t5_2rgos

11784500,0,t1_dgvo382,Excellent review and I agree with almost every point. The only thing Ill add is that Ive found a RRSiB select or two that Ive enjoyed equally  arguably more so. For all those unwilling to pay this much for another WT LE find a nice select of RRSiB and youll be just as happy with a fair chunk of change left too.,bourbon,dgvt8ag,4,t5_2rgos
