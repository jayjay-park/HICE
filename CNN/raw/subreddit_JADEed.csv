3662994,0,t1_cq9okab,Hey totally agree. This could have easily been resolved had it been approached differently in a number of ways the easiest of which would have been talking to me not with a baseless accusation but with a friendly hey youre taking up too much mindshare here we need more of that to go to support threads. This would have been resolved in a day.           The public theater also gets to me but only in the context of everyone else. A lot of my friends and fellow posters have crippling anxiety. Are they really going to post in a place where the moderators will publicly call them out for really nasty behavior thats all in the mods head? These people are trying to escape persecution.    The irony here if theres any to be had at all is that I used to always read RBN in New mode. Thats why there are so many posts where I am one of the only comments and why most of the top posts dont have a peep from me as unless it was posted when I was actively reading RBN I didnt see it. ,JADEed,cq9t1ct,9,t5_37sih
3728154,0,t1_cqgc9tg,I agree. Especially since Brancheros posts were compared to TalesFromRetail and thus bad. I would hate for someone from TalesFromRetail to go to RBN and get the same treatment Branchero and I received.,JADEed,cqh8g7a,4,t5_37sih
3934799,0,t1_cr4siak,gt other than insulating yourself from post repliesOr make sure all the moderators have access to the post replies?  Or that you can make sure you dont miss anything that is not in a stickied post?  The other thing is that so far those posts have hundreds of comments as the stickied posts tend to do.  Is it your opinion that a moderator has to respond to every top level comment?  I get the impression that they make an effort to respond to people who havent gotten a response from anyone else but that would require waiting a little bit of time to see who is and isnt getting responses to their comments.  Meanwhile your inbox is constantly in the red and you cant save comments youd like to keep an eye on.  And Id guess that moderators want to be able to respond in other parts of RBN.I would absolutely not be okay if the RBNMod were to start being used to ban people or make comments but using the account to set up RBN posts just doesnt seem unreasonable to me.,JADEed,cr4svzb,0,t5_37sih
