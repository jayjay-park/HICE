I read some interviews over and over but now its sometimes hard to find specific quotes.I dont think we know anything else.

10671841,0,t1_ddgcbe6,I think the first book works on a simpler more childlike logic. So what seems illogical andor strange to happen in DH is perfectly logical and normal in PS.Before the main plot starts there is not yet a Horcrux hunt in the works Voldemort is still in Albania and he could be forever so theres no reason for Dumbledore to worry about the bit of Voldemorts soul in this childs head... yet anyway... so theres no specific plan regarding Harry. The plan Dumbledore later refers to in OotP is I think a general plan about Harry needing to die if Voldemort were to ever return. Dying requires no effort on Harrys part so there is no training Harry needs to go through to prepare to be some superlovepower hero or anything. The plan is just that he must die therefore Dumbledore cannot get emotionally attached to Harry. End of plan as it currently stands.What could go wrong? sI reckon Dumbledore knew Quirrell was working with Voldemort and made Quirrell DADA professor to smoke Voldemort out and get rid of Quirrell in one go. But Voldemort gets the message and just says fuck it I cant die anyway may as well possess Quirrell and try to get the stone worth a shot. So Dumbledore knew Voldemort was there and Voldemort knew Dumbledore knew. That means they are in a stalemate of sorts  Dumbledore who still has the community and Ministry on his side could expose Voldemort which Voldemort doesnt want because this is his CHANCE. Therefore Voldemort doesnt cause trouble and Dumbledore knows that Voldemort is not going to cause trouble which is why hes perfectly fine having a mass murdering Dark Lord amongst children....This lack of immediate danger means that Dumbledore and Voldemort can push each others buttons in different ways to see who theyre dealing with.Meanwhile Harry Potter happens to be entering school that year. I dont think Dumbledore intended Harry to do anything that year about the mirror or the Stone but I do think he wanted Harry to use the information about the mirror eventually. During Harrys first year Dumbledore would slowly and safely introduce Harry to the concept of Voldemort and how he Dumbledore was keeping the Dark Lord at bay. Voldemort would undoubtedly make more attempts to steal the stone down the road some other way and when that time came Harry might be ready to help Dumbledore protect it. But by then the mirror would be floors and floors below the school when can Dumbledore show Harry the mirror? So he showed him before its moved. But while Im positive the plan didnt go how Dumbledore imagined I still have questions. For example I do actually think that Dumbledore was capable of being cruel enough that year to set up a meet between Harry and Voldemort because I think Dumbledore might be curious to see what would happen and if the prophecy had any truth to it. But did he intend them to meet that day and in those circumstances? Was he actually surprised that Harry knew who Flamel was? If he did intend them to meet why did he leave the school that night when the school year is so close to ending surely he should be at the school and watchful each night just in case? Is his leaving the school that night another sign that he honestly and truly did not expect anything to happen that year? Or if he is for some reason hiding in the depths of the chamber spying on Harry Quirrell and Voldemort why did he take so long to jump out to Harrys rescue? If he did wait until the final moments because of some strange rationalizing I dont yet understand why does he sound so desperate as he shouts Harrys name when Harrys not conscious enough to understand it? I mean what level of manipution do we have to accept for that to make sense?If I had to choose I would say that Dumbledore trusted Snape to have Quirrell under control and Quirrellmort fooled Snape and thus fooled Dumbledore and they did not realize how close Quirrellmort was to the Stone because only Harry amp co knew that Voldemort knew how to get past Fluffy. And nobody noticed how close Harry was either. I think Dumbledore and co legitimately meant to protect the Stone and Harry messed up their plan. The plan would have worked if Harry hadnt played the hero.Dumbledore gave Harry an inch and Harry took a mile. And thats when Dumbledores original general plan of not caring for Harry starts to break. Imagine being Dumbledore knowing what you know and seeing this small child clinging onto Quirrell to stop Voldemort from getting this stone. And you know that the only way to prevent exactly what Harry was trying to prevent is for that same child to die that Harrys very existence prevents the very thing Harry wants most  and Dumbledore knows what Harry wants because thats the only way Harry could have gotten the stone out of the mirror in the first place his deepest most desperate desire. And for three days this kid is unconsious in the hospital wing while you ponder all this while talking to Flamel about destroying the stone once and for all... Any heart would break.But I have no proof except to appeal to emotions and what I can extrapolate from this one quotegt I should have recognized the danger signs then. I should have asked myself why I did not feel more disturbed that you had already asked me the question to which I knew one day I must give a terrible answer. I should have recognized that I was too happy to think that I did not have to do it on that particular day. . . . You were too young. Book  U.S. p. .,hprankdown2,ddgpww3,2,t5_3ebqw
