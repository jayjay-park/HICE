2846121,0,t3_2k0zc1,Nope. Skywind doesnt belong to bethesda and the people working to create the mod probably wont spent even more time just to pay to make game for a platform they dont use,skywind,cnrlq9g,1,t5_2v5g5
4305560,0,t1_csax6fv,They are. Its not assets its intellectual property. Its the same difference as doing a Morrowind movie for example youd have to own the rights. So to participate you have to have paid for the Morrowind experience.,skywind,csaymw0,1,t5_2v5g5

4855097,0,t1_cu5e9vj,because quests and combat are a tiny part of development compared to everything else weve had to do. Some new combat systems have been made but not sure its workable yet.,skywind,cu6is1y,3,t5_2v5g5

5882677,0,t3_3vtyu4,This should run it fine with a nice ENB to add.All of our assets are quite heavy compared to Skyrim since we are developing this in  and not  so we add around  onto the base requirements for Skywind since we are working with nicer assets all round.,skywind,cxqr2tu,13,t5_2v5g5

7068376,0,t3_4cf0a0,Hard to tell if its an improvement without seeing it ingame but in these pics it looks a bit too shiny for my tastes. This shader would seem more appropriate for a lame corprus or some such.Previous iteration of the Ogrim ingame ,skywind,d1hk9wy,3,t5_2v5g5

9420394,0,t3_59o138,This is fantastic! I imagine a decent amount of people are going to move from OG Skyrim to SE especially when it gets SKSE. Its good to see that we probably wont have to revert back to OG Skyrim when Skywind releases. ,skywind,d9a3lvz,1,t5_2v5g5

10025881,0,t1_db6i8ox,... Also Zaric Zhakarons stuff in general is pretty good. Hes got videos on the goods and bads of Skyrim and doesnt just say this game sucks. Hes a bit odd and wears a suit every video but damn is he deep in the lore.,skywind,dbeeer7,1,t5_2v5g5

10067683,0,t1_dbgkrum,Oscuros Mod is interesting but for most of the time I just killed everyone with a few hits even being low level... It was often way too easy. Still better than Vanilla though... I dont level behind level  on purpous to not completely break the game. ,skywind,dbjubti,1,t5_2v5g5

10988829,0,t3_5wwegz,I cant imagine theyd do Skywind with Skyrims system of failsafes. Skyrim did dilute things a bit to appeal to a wider audience.,skywind,dedjrsv,1,t5_2v5g5
11048397,0,t3_5xq95f,I think Morrowinds original caves tend to be flat and samey by todays standards and the addition of more interesting light sources like this is a justifiable deviation from canon.,skywind,dekbf0b,44,t5_2v5g5
