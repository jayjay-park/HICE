8706309,0,t3_4w4oe2,Im pretty new to civ.  Ive been playing civ  for less than a year.  I know the story about how ghandi was supposed to be the most peaceful person but they set him so peaceful that it rolled over to being the most hostile.Did they just leave that in as a joke or has it been fixed?    Ive never played against Gandhi despite having random opponent leaders on every game.,CivVI,d6tx93f,1,t5_346b8

9367032,0,t1_d92bvzi,I have had no bugs so far and Im about halfway through a campaign on Epic. It feels very complete. All the systems for religion and government are actualized. This has got to be the most complete Civ game on release that I have experienced I started with IV. The only DLC I see them releasing is more civs.,CivVI,d93c6tc,3,t5_346b8
9373933,0,t1_d947gw9,Multiplayer isnt half the game. Thats just a ludicrous statement. We got hours and hours of near complete Civ VI content long before the game was released. Thats far more than what you get with most other games. ,CivVI,d947ns4,9,t5_346b8

9399802,0,t3_59ctpr,Well first of all I would say that this game is the best starting point for anyone who wants to try a civ game. My advice would be that you should wait for a little while. Civ games cost almost nothing a few months after their release.  monthsMaybe you could have a discount up to  by the next steam sales.But of course if you enjoy the game and notice that you have spent a lot of hours playing it you should consider buying it as soon as you can. It is worth its cost ,CivVI,d97hoet,1,t5_346b8

9437852,0,t1_d99sees,I think it was an unmet civilization.  I just found it pretty funny.  It happened right after I met England.  Who by the way only had a scout near my.  So I took out their Scout.  Been working too much this week hopefully will find time this weekend to see who wins!,CivVI,d9cbbim,1,t5_346b8
9488480,0,t1_d9ilfdr,Ye but when you just want to build your own great emprie until the lategame with some challenges. Isnt it then way cooler with defined characters. One very big warmongerer one who likes to trade with everyone all the time one who concentrates on wonders and only gets mad when you build wonders...  Now on higher difficulties dont bother with any AI. After a short time all will be mad at you anyway. I want to have really a hard challenge or a cool experience throughout history. For me the AIs is not delivering on both aspects. Which is sad because the base game seems to be really greatI like the districts and co.,CivVI,d9inpd8,3,t5_346b8
9519534,0,t3_5b7fo7,Of course a lot depends on who you pick and your starting location. Some devs talked about forcing you to not follow one strategy but rather making you adapt to your surroundings as you play. Having gotten that caveat out of the way I in my admittedly limited play have generally stated with ScoutSlingerSettler especially if there are other civs nearby and lands I want to grab before them by then I have explored some of the map and can start thinking about specializations for the capital and future cities.I usually buy my first builderFor tech look at whats nearby. That can help you pick pottery or mining or animal husbandry.For civics I usually go  vs barbarians and one production in every city. Unless I really want a certain pantheon. Then I go  faith and gold for a while.You should beeline to political philosophy and do the  research and switch method and complete them with the inspiration boosts the four civics that lead to political philosophy have easy boosts to obtainTry to get archery quickly since archers are great. Two archers and two warriors should handle most early wars.Try to get three cities up by turn  if possible. Pay attention to amenities and housing. Build farms in a triangle if possible and districts in a diamond to maximize adjacency bonuses. That should get you going.,CivVI,d9mhhby,9,t5_346b8
9522091,0,t3_5b577s,Yeah I know that feeling doesnt necessarily have to do with screwing things up I mostly try early rushes but even if if I get them right f.e.  cities at T standard speed against deity I feel like starting over. ,CivVI,d9msss9,1,t5_346b8

9539021,0,t1_d9i13r3,Part of whether to pass or to take is knowing which Great Person is next on the list and what they can do for you.  With Writers in particular though and generally with any of the Great Artist types its not going to hurt you to take them and either use them or delete them.  Yes it does mean youre effectively ceding the next WriterArtistsetc to whoever is next on the list and maybe even one more besides that but those particular Great People dont do anything other than make Works.  If youre going for the Culture Victory that may seem like a mistake but the AIs really bad when it comes to Wonders a lot of the time and other than Stonehenge you can probably beat the AI to any Wonder in the game for the boost to your tourism on top of Great Works People.With the other Great People until we have a definitive list of all the Great People and what they do or unless you know whos next off the top of your head its generally safer to grab them then either use them or delete them yourself rather than risking giving the bonus they provide to another Civ.,CivVI,d9ovsm5,1,t5_346b8
9567856,0,t1_d9s6qsf,Especially not if the canal acts as an improvement which takes a tile.  If the canal reduced the value of the tile thatd make it an even more interesting decision as a canal city would have to give up even more resources in order to function.,CivVI,d9sfmi4,2,t5_346b8
