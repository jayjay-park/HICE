7708903,0,t3_4j6rtz,Well admittedly both times he was shooting someone else. I guess the one back at the church was you? Shino said addressing Kaede with the last part. And teaming up against Archer huh?... Saber your thoughts?It might be for the best she responded a few seconds later a thoughtful expression obsecured by the poncho hood. If Archer is going to snipe at anyone within his range of sight it would be difficult to continue our operations.Thought so. I dont wanna have to keep hiding in the sewers dammit he grumbled. You have yourselves a deal. And thanks for the concern Shino nodded at Aegis.If no one minds Saber spoke up Ill be back. I think I feel the presence of someone nearby...Again? Geez... atcha Saber Shino sighed as Saber astralised silently moving toward the general direction of the presence  that is to say toward Rider.So any details that we should know?,FateNovus,d3ig8jm,1,t5_3dzca
7745483,0,t3_4j6rtz,The question of the reason behind this war is one better asked to Lance Falk of the Blackstone Foundation headquartered in Chicago Illinois. All I can offer is speculation. If you wish to be civil before I eject you from this realm then I will oblige. After all Im a gentleman not a savage lout Ruler moved over and sat at the edge of the nearest pew keeping his axe at the ready but removing his widebrimmed hat out of respect exposing his neat black hair to the night air. He tipped his head back a bit cracking his neck before aiming his gaze directly at Avenger. If you will explain how you wormed your way into the CADOR system effectively invading on this war then I will share my theories with you as to the reason behind the Blackstone Holy Grail War.,FateNovus,d3mlsmi,1,t5_3dzca
8072874,0,t3_4lyikd,All valid points Saber replied to Aegis frowning a bit in thought. It appears were caught between a rock and a hard place right now.Unless... hey Shino addressed the stakesummon. If you can relay messages to Caster could you check in with him if he has any visual on Archer and his Master?,FateNovus,d4ngtt3,1,t5_3dzca
8624908,0,t3_4ragf9,... while I wont say I actually know any better that felt entirely uncalled for especially when she was the one that brought up Berserker looked like she was considering that it might have been a good idea to go after Berserker now too and especially when she even suggested that splitting up to handle them might be a good idea as well Shino finally managed to blandly state when Assassin left managing to remain fairly calm although he gave a sigh regardless.I wont say I dont see her point Saber admitted frowning as well nonetheless. And considering her past experience Assassin going for Archer is possibly understandable if hard to tolerate. That degree of hostility however... I think I must reevaluate her.Dammit. Getting hard to trust the Master getting hard to trust the Servant... whats the point of an alliance if were going to just snipe at each other like that? Granted my remark about Ledger was probably not a great idea either. Anyways try to calm down Aegissan deep breaths he addressed the shorter girl giving her a few pats on the shoulder. Getting angry over this isnt going to get us anywhere and will only drain us of energy when we could do something more productive. As for what should be done were still all for handling Berserker unless you wanna change your mind. As to how though... its whether we risk it and all dive into CADOR to track her down or I could always make arrangements to get down to where she is or close to at least he added biting his lip in thought. Either arrangement has its drawbacks ultimately though so honestly? At this point Im game for any of those though Ill admit that facing her in CADOR is probably going to be more preferable now that our best damage containment measures up and left.,FateNovus,d6jps9u,1,t5_3dzca
