1469815,0,t3_2b07td,That method looks fine to me.  You drop that formula in column C as written drop it in C copydrag it up and down beside your data then you will have a new list in C which omits items found in A.  Copy that new list pastespecialgtvalues over column B and you are done.The formula that I would useoff the bat is probably this time written for C      IFCOUNTIFAABgtBThis countif formula isnt any better than your vlookup in fact it is more resource intensive and slower but it looks cleaner to me.   Also I reference the entire column rather than the designated range again because it looks cleaner to me.  This less efficient method doesnt really matter unless you have a very large dataset.  Another formula that would work for this same sort of create a helper column then Ill paste special values is      IFISERRORMATCHBAABThis third one is probably the most efficient of the three but for small datasets under k lines it doesnt really matter at all.  If you want to skip the copypaste special values step and directly modify column B you could drop a lookup formula in C then filter on it and delete the B cells manually.

I know a total and would like to work backwards to find out which combination of numbers from the data set would equal the total that is given. Im in the process at work to try to minimize some manual work for our Accounts receivable dept. Many times they will receive a lump sum payment with little information as to which invoices the cash should be applied. So they go through large sets of data to manually match which invoices make up the lump sum. I was hoping there was a way excel could help. I have had little luck with the solver tool in excel but in some cases it gives an estimated match its rarely spot on. ,excel,cm8frm1,1,t5_2qur2

2492791,0,t1_cmjwzch,Well notice that in your first formula there are single quotes around the sheet name. You definitely need those whenever there is a space in the sheet name ie Data Sheet! does not work Data Sheet! does. Excel needs to know that space is part of the name otherwise its not sure what the first word is doing there.In your case it is probably because of the  that you need the single quotes to let Excel know this is a sheet name. I cant test it right now whether that is why but this error comes up a lot when using formulas to reference another sheet so I figured that was it. Its always good practice to write these types of formulas with the   because of this even if it works without them you never know if someone will add a sheet later that requires it.,excel,cmjy21c,1,t5_2qur2

2590217,0,t1_cmuszqm,Avoiding website blockers  Btw I just realized the original question was to use VBA to get past heavy internet blocks at work... well this wont help you at all.  ExcelVBA will still be blocked by any network firewallfilter as those types of blocks are usually done through the networks backend not just through your browser if that were the case you could just install a different browser to evade them!  In many ways using the IE object in VBA is similar to browsing those yourself but having a computer replicate the humans interaction.  Probably better to use a personal smart phone that isnt on the companys network.  For the academics of it and for others though Ive gone through with the post showing how to use VBA to interact with amp scrape websites.WALKTHROUGHHeres a very detail walkthrough that should give you more than enough to get started.  Especially important is the bit about the Reference you need to configure and how to read through HTML source code if you are unfamiliar.  If you arent familiar with HTML source code or using advanced object models like the IE object this is a good learning opportunity but note it will take a bit of time to familiarize yourself with it all.  In other words there is a learning curve if you dont know HTML or havent used slightly complicated VBA object models.  Understanding the concept of tags nodes parentchild nodes etc... helps a lot.There are plenty of other resourcesexmaples that Google pulled up for me any one of which should help you outEXAMPLEBelow is an example of my code that logs into a website and grabs a file for me.  I have redacted a lot for confidentiality and to simplify the concept.  In any case this example will give you a sense of common uses of the object model to interact with a webpage.  Note some of the edits I made probably left out some variable declarations or wont compile perfectly but overall this is how you use the IE object to do what you are asking about.  Finally the website you seek to scrape from will also figure heavily into how complicated it will be to accomplish your task.  Poorly written HTML code complicated designs or advanced technologies e.g. AJAX can be a true obstacle.  Some websites might even be designed to prevent scraping.Feel free to ask any followup questions.

2867394,0,t1_cnu0brp,Ahhh!  As suspected Okay so what you need to do here is create a specific columns that are only used to filter.Example and I am going to pretend your table starts at B to give some room at the top of the page for the following. I will also assume the header for the column from your above example is classification.Enter EP into cell B no quotes.Next add a column to your table at one of the ends headed xFilterThis column will contain the following formula    classificationBNow filter the xFilter column for TRUE values. Rinse and repeat. Do you see where Im going with this?Without actually seeing your data this is my best recommendation.EDIT After you get the above all set up let me know and I can provide you a short bit of code so that you do not have to manually reapply filters every time you change criteria.EDIT Omg!

2943717,0,t3_2tvl2i,I have no idea what the things you are referring to looks like or are supposed to look like so keep that in mind lol. But ideally youd make a matching list like this True GL code | Comp  | Comp  | Comp  | Comp  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | Depending on the layout of quickbooks output you should then be able to use that list to indexmatch into your PampL COMP     sheets. So for your overall GL you have  and you want the corresponding code for COMP so you can do     INDEXMatchinglist!BEMATCHMatchinglist!AAYou can then insert this into an indexmatch that looks into the comp sheet to find the relevant value e.g.     INDEXComp!BBMATCHINDEXMatchinglist!BEMATCHMatchinglist!AAComp!AAWhich would return the value in the comp sheet column B that corresponds with comp sheet of the relevant code. I hope this is somewhat understandable it might not work with your datalayout or whatever but in general that would be the venue Id look at first. ,excel,co2ppma,1,t5_2qur2

3540889,0,t1_cpvnuq3,ya so a couple of things come to mind and more questions  I have a bunch of tools in excel that draw from Access  about  people update the access DB and about  read it.  In the beginning it was clean...but as more people starting using it on both ends things like this happened.  Usually though there was an error message.  Sometimes it updates very quickly and it doesnt look like it updated but it did...sometimes it is slow and you can see the update happening in the green bar on the bottom of excel.Also I havent done any of this in dropbox either.  I would try the following if I were youSAVE A BACKUP FIRST. On the data tab on connections...refresh each connection  by  rather than refreshall.  This may pinpoint an issue to a specific connection if you have multiples.. On the datagtconnectionsgtworkbook connectionsclick on one of your connections and click on properties.  In the connection string section you may see something in the beginningmiddle that says ModeReadWritechange this to ModeRead  sometimes if you have write selected and someone has refreshed the sheet on the excel side it can block everyone else out until they close out.. Try to move the file to another directory on a network out of dropbox if that is feasible.  I am worried that something with the loginauthentication is messing you up....is it possible to try it somewhere else?Tell me if any of these give you any luck,excel,cpvvtug,1,t5_2qur2
3553707,0,t1_cpxb7dp,Exactly! In Excel prior to  there was only SUMIF and as youve discovered theres some limitations to its capability so it was SUMPRODUCT or nothing. I tend to use it a lot even for a normal SUMIF.Excel doesnt natively feature an END as suchThere are tricks workarounds you can use  dynamic named ranges work really well.I have created a file which counts the number of entries in the date column to dynamically expand the range which they cover Ive called them Date Category and Amount and you can then use these names in your formula as Ive done in H.This is by far my preferred technique and places far less calculation burden on ExcelThe file is available on dropbox if you want to have a look at it.

3584910,0,t3_31c878,Just to clarify you create a new old number of plays column each time you update? So you have many of these columns?Anyway as others have said a quick vlookup would work.. Create a new worksheet called import and copy the data to it. For the example I assume band name will be in col A and number of plays in col B.. On the main sheet insert your new plays column.. use the formula VLOOKUPband nameimport!ABfalse where band name is a reference to the adjacent cell in the main sheet.Having said that a better way to do this would be to import all the data along with date column and just paste it at the end of the existing data. Then you can use filters etc to find the data for a particular period or do proper changethroughtime tracking. The difficulty in this case would be processing the data for analysisvisualization.

3894356,0,t1_cr04b14,As for doing things manually a couple of things. Are you sure youre making a scatter chart and that youre giving Excel values for the x axis? Because if the x coordinate field of a scatter chart is empty Excel just assumes you want to plot the first y value at an x value of  the second y value at a x value of  etc. And if youre doing a Line chart instead of a Scatter chart which is easy to confuse you dont get an option to even pick x values.Second you generally dont want to make your series name more than a single cell it will just concatenate all the entries in each cell together into a single string of text. There are some situations where that can be useful but you definitely dont want to select a whole column of cells the same length as your data.

Yup Built by a player.The materials used to build the ship ammo etc?  mined by a player.The volatile chemicals used to build the whatever?   Extracted by a player..Theres random drops from killing NPCs but they tend to be vendor trash.Almost everything in the game is player built... that creates a slew of meta games within Eve.    There are players that all they do is accept contracts to take an item from location A to location B and drop it off.    There are players that stare at rocks mining and sell the raw materials they get.There are players that just play the market itself.  The EVE universe is big. So if you found something that was underpriced in one market and overpriced in another just a random product not a good example you could purchase them from System A pay someone to ship them to System B offer them for sale in System B slightly undercutting the current offers and potentially reap a reward..Thats where the spreadsheets come in.

But we will need to add another row to your source data. Something that identifies each occurrence of the identifier as a separate entity.You can just use COUNTIF for this.If we assume the following layoutID|Date|Metric|Qual|Number|||| |  | . | ED | then we add a column in column F in cell C with this formula COUNTIFAAA  And copy that downWhat youll end up with is thisID|Date|Metric|Qual|Number|Count||||| |  | . | ED | | |  | . | ED | | |  | . | ED | | |  | . | ED | | |  | . | ED | |Once thats ready create a pivot table Click anywhere inside your data and go to InsertgtPivot Table let it place it in a new sheet thats fine.Youll end up with a mostly empty box on the left and a new screen on the right. The screen on the right has all of your columns and  panels underneath. Drag the Identifier Qual and Number and whatever other columns you need into the Rows panel bottom left. Drag the Count into the Columns panel top right. Drag the Metric into the Values panel bottom right. Make sure its set to Sum left click on the name go to Value Field Settings select Sum.This should pivot all of your data points out like you needed. You will probably want to rearrange things but in the pivot table the values are always to the right.

From there divide by  to get the daily usage multiply by  for the average monthly usage and multiply the daily value by  to get the yearly value. If you are lazy download this prepared excel sheet I have already filled in your values. Feel free to tweak it around The daily usage is higher from MO to FR.

4177921,0,t3_38nw5w,Ive written a couple of these. Start with having a good file structure.   Have summary sheets have a changelog and have Data Sheets which contain all the data plus calculated columns which you will use for the metrics  Write the macros to dynamically update each report based on this structureYour macros will need to  Merge your daily data sheet into an existing Master workbook with the file structure above. This data compounds on the previous days data.  Add calculated columns. Adding calculated columns is most easily achieved by carrying out the process while recording a macro then editing the macro to suit.  Update the calculated and helper cells based on this new data. This might be as simple as dragging formulas down I.e. EndXlUp and EndXlDown and cleaning out blank entries and refreshing pivot tables.Google searches will get you  of the way  you can phrase questions as questions someone has probably already asked StackOverflow you can then learn while doing.

If there is no value in column D then the value will show as etc.Second SheetYoull generate the same set of keys on sheet . To make it prettier you can insert  columns before your table and put them in the new column A. The difference will be that while on the previous sheet we put blanks in division  here its just counting up. Id hardcode the first one as   is the header. You should be able to just drag it down and it will come out as   etc. then hardcode  in the next section and repeat. You might be able to find a faster way the only important part is that the values are there.Now in a new column on sheet  use the match formulaMatchASheet!JJNow in any of the other columns you can draw from the first sheet using an index formula like thisINDEXSheet!AA BYou can wrap the index function in an IFERROR statement to deal with blanks.

For an entry level job opportunities to learn and develop is just as if not more important than salary. Its reasonable to expect them to move on in about  year. You may have to give up on trying to find anyone with decent Excel experience but problem solving and abilitywillingness to learn are not unreasonable to expect.You should expect to do your share of selling the job to potential candidates regardless of what the salary is. You should also expect the candidates to know that there are skill requirements for any job regardless of what the salary is.Anyone isnt willing to perform an assessment because of the k pay is most likely not going to take the job because of the k pay not because you made them do an assessment. For entry level candidates with little work experience if you give them a choice between taking a test and answering behavioural interview questions they will mostly prefer the test. You may have to tell them to use indexmatch sumproduct pivots ahead of time so they know what to google and assess them on how they use that information.

Ive worked in finance for the last decade or so and there were certainly pockets that coded everything but the majority could barely use Excel let alone know that you could automate their jobs with it.  Ive redesigned certain processes and automated a vast amount of things for big companies too.  The upside is that my department was really efficient.  The downside was that no one else knew we were doing it that way. When that department was shut down and I moved to another one doing a similar job I basically started over recoding their job into chunks of automated tasks.  If it goes to corporate IT then they have to recodeQAcreate documentation etc etc.  All I had to do was make it and show the team how to use it so my overhead was massively lower.  ,excel,cti8yth,32,t5_2qur2

For exampleIn Cell X enterBrand or whatever filter you are looking to sum copypasting the word from the data is optimal to avoid any issues with trailing spaces etc.In Cell Y enterSUMIFAA X DDIn this example  AA is the column you filtercontaining Brand. X should contain Brand. DD is the column you want to sum. Note You can now enter any other categories you want to sum as well by putting them in X X etc. And dragging the formula in Y down.or selecting Y shift  down arrow to the last adjacent column and CTRLD.,excel,cvbsqrj,1,t5_2qur2

So to make sure you understand everything in the formula this is whats going on which is probably what you really need.  A refers to the cell where their birthday is.YearA just gets the year of their birthday and thenYearAltSheet!A just checks to see if their birth year is less than the year you have in A on Sheet .  The  makes sure that no matter where you copy and paste the formula it always refers to that cell.Anyway if it is less than the year on Sheet  in A it adds how many months are in cell B on Sheet .Then it checks to see if the year is greater than your second highest year and if so it gets the max value.Then it looks up anything in the middle.  The INDEX part returns the amount of months you want the MATCH part matches their birth year with the range of birth years.Thus you just gotta make sure the ranges are correct in there.,excel,cve3ae5,2,t5_2qur2

In the first step of the Convert Text to Columns Wizard select Delimited. In the second step select comma and space only and select Treat consecutive delimiters as one.Once each time is in its own cell you can count the values you want by using the COUNTIF formula. The syntax should be roughly as follows    COUNTIFWholeRangewithvaluesTime,excel,cwww7i2,2,t5_2qur2

These columns would contain the index and match formulas to look up values from the hourly tabs.  It would look for the operator name in the name column and return the desired value from a different column on that hourly tab.You could encase the INDEXMATCH functions inside an IFERRORNULL if you want so if that operator isnt in one of the hourly tabs i.e. there was no match it will show NULL for that hour.,excel,cxsiv3o,1,t5_2qur2

If someone I interviewed said they were a master with Excel they better know how to pull data from my SQL servers with the query tools create Pivot Tables from our data from our multiple Sharepoint sites and know DAX functions and the PowerPivotQueryView tools insideout.

Computers are very fast but very dumb. Theyre essentially the opposite of humans which is why theyre great at some things figuring out taxes and terrible at others is that piece of art pretty?.To turn this into a more computerfriendly problem I would download a list of the top  male and female names.

Like this will look at all the names and then only report back a full match the junk character of  is there to prevent finding Joe more than once for example.

The VBA to transfer the data should be fairly straight forward so long as the data to be merged stays in a consistent format.

6555568,0,t1_czxe30n,It would not as the first line of code should be as follows    Function getLastRowByVal wkshTarget As Worksheet As LongWhich specifies that this function returns a Long data type. I think what you are confused at is how to use external logic with a simplified function. So heres a simple demonstration of what you should be doingPrivate Sub ClearSheetIf getLastRow gt  ThenCode to do stuff if there are more than just headers in the mentioned worksheetElseCode to do stuff if there are ONLY headers in the mentioned worksheetEnd IfEnd SubPublic Function GetLastRowByVal WorksheetIndex As Long As LongGetLastRow  Application.WorksheetsWorksheetIndex.UsedRange.Rows.CountEnd FunctionIn this example you are applying the logic of if getLastRow returns a value greater than  we know that there is obviously more than just the column headers within that worksheet. If it only returns  then there are just column headers. I hope this clarifies how to use Functions They MUST return a value that is what a function does and how to apply logic to them when using them within a conditional.,excel,czxedon,2,t5_2qur2

7159710,0,t1_d1rz324,Lol ok. You can convert any sheet to a new temporary csv file. Just save as close Excell and then open the sheet that needs enlighting and the csv file. When you copy the sheet to your new file you can be sure there are no ridulous values hidden anywhere could also check the csv file before importing in notepad. But actually I think the problem should not be those values. Im working with  columns and I only have to wait for like  seconds sometimes. Try finding all of your vlookups with ctrl f search for vlookup and if necessary change that box to search formula or vice versa also search in whole workbook. Then you know where they are and you can change them to index match functions. Best thing to do probably i guess is start up a brand new file copy paste the csv files and build the formulas or copy paste them ONLY FORNULAS  also no vlookups. Goodluck! ,excel,d1rzmwi,1,t5_2qur2

7310452,0,t3_4fifco,Amortization tables are straightforward. You need to convert the interest rate to the monthly effective rate. If your interest rate is an APR divide it by  to get the monthly effective rate. That rate times your principle balance at the beginning of period t is the interest paid for period t. The standard monthly payment less interest paid for period t is principal paid for period t in the standard monthly payment. If you pay additional principle in period t that reduces the principle balance at the beginning of period t so reduces the interest paid and increases principal paid in period t.Name the cell containing the effective monthly interest rate i. Name the cell containing the standard monthly loan payment MP. Then create a table say in AE for a  year mortgage with monthly payments. Enter  through  in AA. Enter the original loan amount in E. Enter the following formulas in row .    B  iE    C  MPB    E  ECDCopy BE down into BE. DD are for additional principle payment amounts by month.

In a new worksheet separate all the names using texttocolumns with space delimiter then transpose all fields into one column and remove duplicates. Now you have a word list and we can start to use things like COUNTIFS etc. Youll probably want to remove candidates like the  and etc as they will almost certainly be the most frequent words in any decade at all.Granted this will force you to jump through several hoops in succession but  if youre working with a large variable dataset  it would still be less effort than trying to engineer a single bit of magic code that does it all.,excel,d2vs26l,2,t5_2qur2

7904860,0,t1_d43doik,The best suggestion I have is to set this up differently. The example sheet looks like it has at least two distinct things going on data entry and summarization. You might find it advantageous to split these up put all data entry on one sheet and make one or more separate sheets for summaries. Regarding data I do not recommend splitting up transactional data by month. Using dates in the data the summary can show whatever month or many months of information all derived from the same data set. On the other hand data that represents different things e.g. sales vs. accounts payable should always be split up. If there is a use case for combining them for analysis or summarization as I am sure there is that can and should be done elsewhere in the workbook. Hope this helps.,excel,d44kydc,1,t5_2qur2

8067180,0,t3_4pnr6r,I had to do something similar and the solution I used had two parts.Part  create a mapping table. Create a list of the columns your company uses and assign the list a name.. Use a small macro that opens the import file and just fetches the column header list paste into a range and assign it a name.. Create a mapping table where each column header in your companys sheet can be mapped to the other companys manually. In the mapping table use data validation referring to the imported list. Then you can go through each item and use the drop down to select the appropriate column.Part  import the dataThe import macro will then loop through each item in the first list get the corresponding import column number grab the data and paste it in the correct destination column.The reason for doing it this way is that you wont need to touch the code if the columns change on either the import or the destination files. Youd just go to the mapping table run the first macro to refetch the headers and then map the columns again.,excel,d4mtsk4,3,t5_2qur2

I also have a release helper in Sheet B that concanetates the same things. Where it gets trick is that the exact artist name and track name can be featured on multiple releases and is often so the first time the value is found I need it to pick the first found Q Column value the second time it needs to find the second Q value and so on.What I did originally was this uh faux formula since Im using a different language excel    INDEXSheet A!QQMATCHE Sheet A!CCwhich works just fine except when it finds the same concateted artist and track name it will always return the first found value.If I could get the formula to check on what it has already found and find the next in case of duplicates that would be what I want.,excel,d4sds31,1,t5_2qur2

8394451,0,t3_4ujpco,I dont use that specific source but if Im understanding your description correctly I think k do something similar.  Check out this pageFor some workbooks with data connections that I set to refresh in the options you can choose when you want it to refresh  manual when the workbook is opened every xminutes etc whenever the work book is opened.  You need to be able access the data and know where its stored and have credentials. Theres a query wizard or you can just write it yourself but set it up to pull whatever you need and then the connection will query the source you set up sounds like you just need the tables from the DB but cubes can be pretty cool and powerful and return that info where you specify.  Set it up as a table actual data table not just table format and the pivot table will automatically expand its data sources range as rows are added.   Once you connect to the source and set up your query and refresh settings structure your data table and add the formulas and create your pivot table. Now every time you open the files it adds the new rows since its a data table will automatically expand and the formulas will fill down nice perk of using data tables and your pivot tables data source will expand accordingly.   All the user of the workbook has to do is click refresh on the data tab to refresh the pivot table and it will update and display the new data.  Im on my phone now but if this sounds helpfulreading the link sounds like it will do what you need I can help you if you have more questions just ask.,excel,d5quqbh,2,t5_2qur2

8425713,0,t1_d5uqhgo,Yes but not the way youre thinking. In VBA cell isnt a defined object it doesnt actually mean anything special. In VBA all the things we normally think of as cells are Range objects. When people sometimes write something like    For Each cell in rngChangeTheyve actually created a variable that is called cell. They could have very well written    For Each SomeBlockThing in rngChangeand the code would still work. IMO I dont use the word cell as a variable because it can cause this very confusion.

8427452,0,t3_4v2rnr,Some guidance on this type of error in VBA.Im guessing you are getting this error because you call the GroupAndBorderRecursive within the IF statement. This means you are reopening another IF statement within the one from the previous iteration. Essentially you are repeatedly nesting IF statements without closing. Eventually you run out of memory to continue nesting works to this point then fails.Try adding a loop to step to the next IF statement iteration instead of calling the GroupAndBorderRecursive sub again.         For whatever   to TotalRows     TotalRows will have to be defined locally    IF     ltyour existing code heregt    ...

By default the data label will show just value but well change that. Select the label then go to formula bar and type a formula linking to cell with string you want to display. Now that data label will move as chart data changes and text will change automatically.

8774060,0,t1_d72e7vq,There shouldnt be anything in a dataset that would break this. It identifies unique pieces of information based on every single cell in their rows. As long as each row is exactly like it should be Old data is identical to old data and new data is not then it should identify new from old.It works because to create the hash of each row I literally concatenated the cell contents together and generated a hash out of that. If any of the cells change that concatenated string would be different thereby generating a different hash and the code treating it as a different entry.All the code is in there for generating hashes. In the case of this instance the hash used is just simple MD which is generally an obsolete hashing algorithm. But the Hash class is able to use a variety of other hashing algorithms to do things for you such as MD MD MD SHA SHA SHA and SHA. It even allows you to generate hashes from passed strings or files on your computer.Not getting too technical or in depth about how hashing works That requires a mathematician or a cryptologist which I am neither but the basis behind hashing is you pass data to it and it spits out a unique number for the data. You can pass the exact same data and it should always return the exact same hash. Change just one bit of data in the passed info and the entire hash will be different. Hashing is great for verifying data integrity to ensure it doesnt get tampered with.The relevant code within your document is this    Dim Hasher As New clsHash        Hasher.Algorithm  MD    Hasher.HashStringRawStringYou declare a new instance of the Hashing class then set the hashing algorithm you will be using. Then you pass a string of data to to the HashString method which outputs the generated hash. You can learn about how hashing works by watching this informative video Your macro uses MD just because it isnt using it for security and its a fast algorithm,excel,d72fa3h,2,t5_2qur2

8802148,0,t1_d75u4v7,For every dollar a customer spends they earn a point... Basically they have a very weird requirement that I feel is excessive and the wrong way of viewing it. The ownerfranchise owners are concerned that customers will earn points at one store and redeem at another store and want to have a report showing where points were earned vs redeemed. This is far too complicated and can cause issues anyway because even if looked at on a monthly basis it doesnt account for a customer earning points the previous month then spending twice that amount at a later time. It also doesnt account for the fact that a single customer could earn a lot of points at one store and the next month spend them at a store but maybe it happens this store also had a lot of redemptions compared to other stores and is now asking money from another store they technically do not owe.On top of that it cannot really be done. We can tell what store issued how many points over a time period and what store redeemed how many points over a time period ... but theres no way to say that of the  points earned at store A   were spent at store c and  were spent at store b  unless we create a report that starts cross referencing every individual customer.However if I had  shops how would you account for it? ,excel,d75wcvx,1,t5_2qur2

That being said I would have loved a more dynamic way of dealing with stale records however the scope of the problem was solved using a native Excel function and returned the results I wanted.

9030406,0,t3_53y0yf,So Ive done something like this with VBA and it can be kinda redundant and repetitive but Ill show you how I got this to work. So essentially to access the data you have to reference the cell that the information is contained in. So there are multiple ways to do this but the way I found to be the most effective for me is something like this    Private Sub ButtonClick    dim res as variant    res  Application.IndexRangeSheet!AB     Application.MatchListBox.value Range     Sheet!AA       Textbox.value  resThis accesses the rd sheet and searches for the content based on what was selected in a listbox which could be changed to textbox or whatever. Then I specify the range that it will find it in and what specific cell in that row that I want.  Now this is a pretty tedious way to do it as youre forced to reference each cells data to the correct textbox that you want it to appear. This is just one of many ways Im sure this could be accomplished but I thought Id share in case it helps.To edit data that is already there I first use this data to load it. Then I edit the boxes that I want and resubmit the data. The code is different though as it finds the already existing data and replaces the corresponding textboxes with the right data for that cell. Example of posting changes to data that has been retrieved    Private Sub ButtonClick    Dim nrow As Long    nrow  Me.ListBox.ListIndex      SheetsSheet.Cellsnrow .value  TextBox.valueThis takes the value in the sheet that matches the listbox selection and replaces it with textboxs value.Again this is just one way and its entirely possible this isnt the best way to do it its just how I got it to work. If anything I hope this leads you in the right direction. ,excel,d7xb8wo,1,t5_2qur2

I actually did it a few years back for extra credit in a linear algebra course. No prize except the satisfaction of solving it and perhaps solving it in a slick way. There have been plenty of challenges in the past but Ill have to get with the mod team to figure out the challenge search issue. I did this using VBA because I really like to use it. You can solve this problem using any language but part of what made this interesting to me is no one would really think to use VBA for it it also made an easy visual as I could see the matrices and solutions in the workbook. Inspiration was I did it a while ago and thought I might get a few bites here.

You can turn those off. But you cant fill in the bars.The other way of faking it is making a normal bar chart note all widths have to be equal and faking the axis by just pasting an image over the builtin axis labels. ,excel,dayghf8,2,t5_2qur2

10105223,0,t3_5kl9q6,Note you only need to do that for the SUMCOUNTAVERAGEIFs functions. The why is something Excel developers will know the best answer to. The help saysgtcriteria   Required. The criteria in the form of a number expression a cell reference text or a function that defines which cells will be added. For example criteria can be expressed as  gt B  apples or TODAY.gtImportant Any text criteria or any criteria that includes logical or mathematical symbols must be enclosed in double quotation marks . If the criteria is numeric double quotation marks are not required.I think its because Excel is coded to always evaluate expressions on either side of a logical expression. Note gt evaluates first to gt and not FALSE so I think ever since the early days of Excel it was coded to always evaluate expressions then compare the expressions. No expression on either side of the logical operator was a cause for error. So then they come up with stuff like SUMIFS which separates the expression CC from the logical operator lt because they dont want to type the same expression multiple times. So now they have a choice to make  futz with all the code to tell Excel to not need expressions on either side or just make a rule that says it needs to be text and then throw in a quick piece of code to treat the very first lt like less than rather than the actual character of lt. They already had the functions working with text I bet SUMIFSAABeer e.g so it was probably easier to just say it always had to be text.I think they chose wrongly and I personally hate all those functions for that reason. Its inconsistent with the rest of Excel and Id bet is part of the reason you can next functions  like countifleftAAA wont work. So its all a pile of dog squeeze as far as Im concerned.,excel,dboq0gj,6,t5_2qur2

10466862,0,t1_dcss5lc,If I do it this way C will  the answer that the formula in A calculates which is very close but not what I want because cell locations matter.I have this  tab budget. In each tab is a series of categories on every row. Equipment connections software etc..Further down the row is the amount of money spent on these categories separated by every month of the year.So on Row  lets say I can see that in January we spent . Now the spending is dynamically allocated to every tab and every row. I have a fairly large SUMIF formula that pulls all this information from a table on another tab.In this table I enter every purchase we made and reference on which tab which month column and which row the money spent is allocated. All I have to do is pop in a purchase say how much we paid for it and in which bucket of the budget the money is coming out of and the budget will update itself.Example without the vendorsgt SUMIFSSpendTableAllNRC SpendTableAllTabSHEETSpendTableAllNrowROWSpendTableAllMonthMONTHDATEVALUEINDIRECTADDRESSCOLUMNamp Now there are two problems.A. I have to copypaste this formula in every cell of every tab for every item and month covered. Its a lot of copy pasting.B. Some purchases are monthly recurring costs so I have a second formula to work with where this formula will add the items cost to every month after the first where it was summoned.It all works very well its just a bit clunky. Meaning that there is a lot of validation to do before I can say that everything is working properly.  is here and I have to redo the  budget so heres my chance to optimize everything.It would make my life easier if I could tell cells Take the Monthly formula or Take the nonrecurring formula instead of doing some back and forth and copy pasting everything everywhere.,excel,dcuixhk,1,t5_2qur2

Again this sounds a little unusual but since the company can use the funds from both Alex and Bob to balance things out it can take  from Alexs  balance pay off Bobs deficit of . This then leaves an overall surplus of  which is credited to Alex.I say theres a surplus as in this scenario the company has taken in more contributions than it needs to cover business deficit defined as income  expenses. Might be easier to say if we took it to extreme. Lets say A and B are the owners and business comes up short  in a month. If A pays  and B pays  then the business has received WAAAAY more contributions than it needs. Either needs to refund A  and B  or hold the money in reserve.

10933806,0,t1_ddybcyj,IFERROR has two parameters the value you are analyzing and the value you want to return in case of error. So if you have a function that returns an error in the form of NA for example and you want it to return a blank value every time the error occurs then you would basically say IFERRORInsert original formula without equal sign   and its literally just saying that if that formula returns an error then instead of the result being an error you want it to be blank. Very useful when using IndexMatch combinations in my experience. I might drag a formula down  rows and not want to deal with a bunch of error results so i prefer blanks that way later on its easier to copy and paste values. If you dont understand any particular formula try typing it in and looking at what parameters it is asking for. Those are the inputs and the result in the cell is the output. Then realize that you can take the result of another formula and use it as the parameter for another. Thats when you get into nesting formulas. I am not very good at explaining this kind of stuff but if you need help with any particular formula there is probably tons of information on reddit or any other forum. Probably even entire blogs explaining INDEXMATCH example since its quite popular. ,excel,de7qu79,2,t5_2qur2

Care needs to be taken here however to ensure that all the potential users of the file can equally access the data perhaps a Network Drive?.If you take this approach it lends itself nicely to what might have to be phase  anyway which is to use Excel only as the presentation layer with something else Access is the perfect candidate but ironically not everyone has access to Access as the datastore.,excel,deayfw2,1,t5_2qur2

Unfortunately I dont know anything about OLE automation. Im reading an Excel book right now which covers OLE automation but Im not there yet. Currently working my way through userforms atm.Presumably though once you connected to Excel through OLE automation youd have access to its object model. So you could create a module with your Outlook macro that connects to Excel and then calls another macro in the same module once Excel is connected. But again this is a subject Im not too familiar with. If you Google Excel Outlook OLE automation you should find some good resources. ,excel,dewtd2g,2,t5_2qur2

I have been using R for about  months now and can crank out insightful visualizations in a few lines of ggplot that would take much longer to do well in Excel.  I especially love facetgrid to clean up what otherwise can seem really messy in a single Excel chart.Ive also created an app for a customer on Shiny that is much more smooth and useful than what I had built in Excel with PowerPivot.  The client loved that its webbased and anybody can access the same version at any time.  Seemed much more professional too.,excel,df8f91q,2,t5_2qur2

The range in this case is AA which means the entirety of column A. The INDEX function returns the nth element of column A. n is the evaluated result of expression ROW.  ROW is a simple function that returns the row number in which the function resides. So in G ROW returns . In G ROW returns . So ROW when in G evaluates to  and when in G evaluates to  etc. So if you want G to refer to A and G to refer to A and so on simply tweak the expression to ROW.,excel,dgm5ep7,2,t5_2qur2
