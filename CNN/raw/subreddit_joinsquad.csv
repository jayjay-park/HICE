With early acces you buy acces to games you are dedicated to so you can help the development of said game. The price you have to pay for this is totally up to the developers if you are not willing to pay for that experience you should just wait for the game to release and buy the finished product for a price that represents the finished product. So dont buy early acces games if you are not willing to waste or invest money.

6134202,0,t3_3zknrn,Im coming from CSGO and I havent had a moment yet in this game where I was like I totally hit that guy! except for with one of the RPGs. I dont think that accuracy is that bad but the way some of the guns feel is gross. I hate the M with optic sight because I feel like my view is more limited with that gun than the svd. Its probably meant to be close Im sure but it just feels a bit wrong to me. Hitdetection with trees rocks fences rounded corners of any home or wall all seem pretty bad at the moment enough that if Im at a wall for example that is somewhat oddly shaped Ill move to a different spot because Im sure my bullets are going to clip.

When you have YouTube personalities trying out a new game they have heard about that their subs dont know about do you want them to describe is as what Id is what now or what it might be in the future? Because heres the thing YouTube personalities that drift from game to game might not know what the whole PR thing is and what the plan for squad is. Do you want them making promises to people while not having any idea?Because I would rather have them describe the game as it is. People can get into it if they like it. Maybe they stay along for the ride and maybe they dont. But if you describe it as a realistic combined arms game complete with helicopters and IEDs etc etc....

I think my issue is a unique one as Im using an AM Crosshair IV Formula which has a creative XFI on board chip which is not supported by windows  or asus at this point.  Its currently using a VIA driver.  To voice my opinion I believe the enemy should be able to hear local voice.  I would just like to yell at the other team either to troll and also be trolled.  Trash talking opposition and being trash talked is something that has been fun in competitive multiplayer in a long time.  It would even make tactics more in depth by a small notch IMO.

Theres two options to go for first before shooting back  make yourself obvious and lean from side to side dayz friendly dance  works  of the time.  take cover press Enter and hover over his dot on the map so you can see his name and squad. Then either or both type in Team chat and tell him hes shooting at friendlies or ask your SL to tell his SL to get him to stop shooting at you.Shooting back should only be the last resort  it only makes the problem worse. If the two other options fails then shoot him but make sure you make him aware that you shot him  and why  in Team chat or local voice.

7223425,0,t3_4ecxu4,gtminimapIm going to say no. A map is something that you should check for references or maneuvers not something thats always open so you can look at how your squad is moving. You should learn to use your eyes for that.Now something like STHUD or BlueHUD for Arma  I could see a similar system working in Squad as a replacement for the current compass. Ideally something closer to BlueHUD as its much less obstructive and still blocks the players view behind them.gtspottingAgain the map isnt something people should be checking constantly. Periodically yes frequently sure but not constantly. If something needs to be marked tell the SL and hell decide whether or not its worth a map marker. This is how many SLs Ive played with have done it if someone in the squad calls out something at a certain grid square the SL might mark it on the map for the rest of the squad to use as a reference. Thus the decision still lies with the SL but it keeps the rest of the squad from using their maps too often and paying more attention to their actual vision.gtaim and press a button spottingNo. You have a compass you can estimate range with practice you can give landmarks and references and you have a map and map grids. If you cant effectively tell the rest of your squad where something is using all of those the problem is with you not the game.And this would promote not using a mic since its easier to just point and press a button than it is to press the mic key and call out targets verbally. And we want to discourage not using a mic in every possible way.gtmapUse N to zoom in and color will be readded to the maps at some point in the future. I dont know how much more detail you need. The maps and map grids are both being reworked to be more accurate as well including standardized xm map grids.

So Ill include that in my time spent as there are many parallels.Prior to working in UE for WaWSquad I had time to spend with my children I had time to work on lots of fun software projects my own business website Raspberry Pi MIDI etc..  Now I work two jobs day job  hours and Squad  hours per week and I try to spend at least  hours a day with family so my sleep is lacking.  Im doing great if I can get  hours but during the week I sometimes only get  hours.My health has degraded a bit so Im trying to make more time to take care of that in other words Im increasing the priority of it on my list of tasks and duties.  I used to lift weights everyday prior to WaWSquad and now I need to make it a daily priority instead of weekly.My wife suffers through me working all of the time because she knows the extra money coming in will help to eventually buy a modest house yes less than k.  My first daughter puts up with me always being busy but I still try to find time to watch Andy Griffith or play Minecraft with her.  Before the gamedev stuff I used to read to her daily for about an hour every day.Because I make a high salary at my day job Squad is unable to offset my income enough for me to work exclusively on Squad.  In a few years that may change but no one can read the future so it is best for me to keep both the day job and the fun nightweekend hobby of working on Squad.  I hope Squad will be successful enough that everyone working on it can make a decent salary.I enjoy working on Squad it is by far the best endeavor I have pursued and so far the most rewarding.Working on video games doesnt always come up in conversations but when it does people get excited.

8853053,0,t1_d7bfqb4,There will be a bottleneck regardless stat unit is just the devs Standard Operating procedure.  The game thread is inhibited by the audio thread when using AMD FX CPUs pushed through the same serialized thread as designated by the engine in order to be pushed through a single core for the most part.  What happens is our CPU line Current gen AMD FX CPUs processes the audio x slower than Intel due to the low IPC of the bulldozer family which will result in the game thread needing to wait till the audio is processed.  Overall this will bring down the experience across most UE titles however things are in the works to get the audio thread separated and change the way UE handles audio.  There is not much OWI can do until theyre able to tie up the loose ends to DX which should happen in the next  months hopefully.   Even then expect to see bottlenecks from the CPU. Set your audio channel to  bit .k Hz your audio quality in game to low and then try overclocking your CPU these are the only things that can make any bit of difference currently and unfortunately.  v will provide a ton of optimizations apparently eventually overhauled animations will help a lot and beyond that we have DX and Vulkan coming eventually. ,joinsquad,d7c0fak,3,t5_33zyg

9614875,0,t1_d9wdsa2,I for the life of me dont understand how a lot of engine and game devs are focussing more on Dx first rather than making getting Vulkan working first a higher priority. I mean Dx forces an arbitrary update to another OS Win for no good reason and the installbase for Win is far far bigger than Win or any other consumer OS really. Not only that but Vulkan is also supported by more than just consumer PCs  phones and tablets could make use of it also allowing for stuff like UE engine games to push graphics and gameplay much further on portable devices.So Vulkan could be used by a buttload more devices than Dx could meaning that if you get Vulkan working in your game engine you could get a far larger amount of games using your game engine as you allow more than just devs of PC games to bump up their performance using Vulkan  devs on other platforms can also benefit. Also considering devs of PC titles  the people making those games want as big a potential installbase as possible of course and want their game running at its highest performance potential across as many devices as possible. Using Dx tremendously limits the amount of consumers that can take advantage of a lowlevel API when playing your game especially as compared to the amount of people that could bump their performance in your game using Vulkan.,joinsquad,d9y8bv6,1,t5_33zyg

9632068,0,t1_da0bak4,Sorry to be a dick but just have to clear something up. Rallys are not destroyed if an enemy comes within  metres they have to get much closer like  metres to destroy one. A Squad leader cant PLACE a rally point if enemies are within  metres. This is to ensure you think about where you place them you cant just run into a heavily fortified area and drop a spawn point. If the SL tries to drop a rally within m of an enemy the cool down timer rests to  minutes before another one can be placed. As an addition to destroy an enemy FOB you must RIGHT click on it with your shovel to begin deconstructing it you only have to walk up to an enemy rally point to destroy it. You can do this alone as long as there are no enemies immediately next to the FOB but you should bear in mind it takes about  seconds of uninterrupted digging to bring it down alone enemies can spawn on it whilst youre digging and it will turn red on the map so enemies will be aware its being taken down. Its advisable to have at least  soldiers take down an enemy FOB one to dig one to cover. If you have  or more enemies near an FOB there is no need to dig although it will be destroyed faster if you do. Simply having  soldiers next to it with no enemies around will automatically compromise the FOB preventing enemies from spawning and deconstruct it the time it takes depends on how many soldiers but within about  seconds full squad next to it to  seconds  squad members next to it. ,joinsquad,da0cmj9,4,t5_33zyg

Not sure how many Snipers and Spotters would be allowed but I can imagine  Snipers Spotter and Squad Lead in a Sniper Squad. Something like that.Thing is Snipers will throw things off balance unless things like Artillery tanks and Helis are in place I think. You get sniped not much you can do. Going to find him in a Humvee you might get ambushed by others but if you find the general areahill hes at you might get an insertion by Heli or something.. a lot more ways to counter a Sniper this way.Also this way the Sniper himself will have more ways of relocating. They get compromised they call in a transport heli and just try to hold until it arrives. Maybe an attack chopper can assist them in the mean time or mortars..TLDR Squad has vehicles in it but its still completely focused on Infantry right now so a Sniper would throw the balance off.

What is the enemy team score and your teams score? Where are the squads located? FOBrally points which squad can you join that has an SL not too far from a possible spawn location?Then once you picked your squad and kit before spawning look at map and try to envision where the bulk of enemy forces might be. Identify this with possible landmarks etc etcThis sort of spatial awareness prior to spawning will help you get your bearings and be more mentally prepared for engagement once on the field!And when you are learning to play its a good idea to act as SLs personal medic or guardian he will be thankful and you will learn about the meta mechanics of creating spawns capturingdefending approaches ambushes etc...Have fun!!,joinsquad,dag6d4n,1,t5_33zyg

Dont get me wrong... I do sometimes say can someone from the marksman kit please at any point in the mission but that is usually very selective due to the nature of the role that can equally be filled with a squads worth of people with more directly important roles.Throughout the mission if I see anyone separate from our squad unless otherwise ordered to be or if there is a valid reason like he had to escape contact and lost us I end up kicking.People think a marksman means sitting on a hill snipping people. Wrong.Tho a marksman iscan be used for extended ranged targets he is also used  by role  to provide a close protection role involing overwatch within proextimty due to his limited combat nature related to the role.

You can be loud to suppress voices.Volume control doesnt solve this issue. The variance is too high. If footsteps can be heard normally but then certain weapon sounds are painfully loud this is an issue. If you then are told that your volume is too loud and you should turn it down but lose the sound of footsteps or other minor audio queues that are important far away vehicles approaching bandaging sounds why have those in the first place.Audio levels at the upper extreme end need to be looked at mostly BTR and HMG weapons firing while being near the front of the barrel and exposed to the highest volume.The balance of the remaining audio feels comfortable and fine if you exclude that extreme.,joinsquad,dcvwo83,4,t5_33zyg

I understand the drivers might fuck up and all but it should hurt your game performance right?It doesnt necessarily have to be bad to not reinstall Windows but it is highly recommended indeed because of driver leftovers controllers for devices etc. It could be that you are fine and you get maximum performance. But if stuff doesnt perform as is expected it may very well be some old stuff that is not necessary anymore or some code that is still left optimized for AMD while you now have Intel very bluntly put but its the gist of my story. Especially if you switch platforms from AMD to Intel reinstall is just good practice especially if you run into trouble. Then again maybe your problems are solved by deleting everything in CUsers yourusernameAppDataLocalSquadSaved If not at least try to reinstall your videocard drivers I still recommend reinstalling Windows all together but hey if squad runs fine after the above mentioned and you are satisfied and dont run into strange problems you could be fine without reinstalling .,joinsquad,ddd69mz,1,t5_33zyg

Im not any more or less effective if I lower or raise foliage or view distance or shadows.That being said you still assume that this blur will be optional which I guarantee it wont especially when it comes to scopes. The current scopes are unrealistic and give an unfair advantage in that there is no blur outside the scope itself  the entire screen zooms in and theres no pictureinpicture or blur effect to negate that  so you can still see things at the same detail outside the scope. Ridiculous of course. Theres literally no reason for the devs to make it optional and thats pretty low if youre the kind of person that would disable such an effect to gain an unfair advantage.,joinsquad,ddnum0z,0,t5_33zyg

As a long time PR player I have a very good idea of how to defend and why its so important but despite this I often intentionally choose to either go on offense or a semioffense stance simply because randoms are so unreliable and even in a ENG MIC INF squad theres usually one or two guys then tend to wander. Having had it happen before Im afraid that if I try to get me squad on defense theyll all just wander off and decide to do their own thing because defense is boring.In my experience the only way to get randoms to defend randoms with the potential to go solo if you ask the to defend is to FOB. Just fucking FOB that shit right up. Place a FOB by the flag and start building. Randoms may not love defending but they sure love building shit and sitting on . emplacements.

Youll still be able to see your body it just means we can move things round a bit for first person view. A good example is weapon aiming. When aiming at the moment we cant pull the weapon closer than now as the buttstock starts clipping into the shoulder.

Furthermore Ive actually worked on the team that does support for VBS and its entire purpose is to help simulate the battlespace so tactics and scenarios can be run through by soldiers.

11443749,0,t3_63brvc,the AKM has really weird damage drop off in this game which is paradoxical since in real life the heavier round actually retains more momentum and energy as it flies compared to the lighter rounds of the AK and M.this may be why youre having to hit enemies multiple times.  for some reason in this game the guns with the smaller bullets are better for picking off distant enemies.,joinsquad,dft5015,1,t5_33zyg

Its only worth a few tickets anyway so obviously losing them isnt supposed to be too punishing. If anything their fragility makes them more likely to be used inappropriately because their destruction is rewarded with another technical rather quickly as you pointed out. This seems counterintuitive to me.I agree that they should be used as mobile emplacements but hardly anyone uses them this way because keeping them far from the fight opens up the possibility of losing them permanently in a really difficult spot to reach without another risking another technical. Furthermore the gun shield is terrible and the enemy has optics so youre as likely to die as you are to kill on the mounted gun.,joinsquad,dgu184p,2,t5_33zyg
