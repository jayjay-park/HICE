208974,0,t3_1whhgp,My two cents Stay out of your room as much as possible. Theres too much to do on the ship to waste your time there. I have done the balconies and quite frankly I dont find the hiked price worth it. I just didnt feel like I was getting my moneys worth. And if I stay out of my room I wont even need the balcony. There are plenty of public balconies to take pictures and such.,Cruise,cf28ur9,4,t5_2qm8s

567438,0,t3_20mqig,Gratuity is usually under  per person per day. It should say on the website. Our on our last cruise was . per person per day. But we were also in a minisuite on Princess. You can also tip more if you feel like your room steward or dining room server did an extraordinary job. If you get room service if it doesnt list a price you dont pay. Although we do tip a dollar generally. I recommend doing breakfast in bed once lox!! Yummmm and once in the sit down restaurant. You dont always have to do buffet!Youll pay for drinks. Drinks will always cost you money unless its drip coffee tea or juice. We usually get some rum runners from amazon filled them up with whiskey vodka and rum. And buy the soda package. We still pick up a couple more adult beverages per day too. Shore excursions will cost you. I recommend being adventurous. Taking a tour is so zzzzzz! We go zip lining cave tubing kayaking etc! Its all super fun!And I know you didnt ask this but to have the best time wash your hands as often as possible. I dont care how far away the bathroom is hand sanitizer is only good for so much.

When we were there it was the off season and the park was closed except for weekends. You can get taxis but I think theyre a bit on the expensive side. Closer than El Yunque is Luquillo Beach.

1266876,0,t1_cic4o9g,Im sorry! I will not reveal which department.  I have been in several but I dont want anything I say to possibly get me into trouble.RCCL as employer is great!  There are certainly frustrations we all have but there will always be frustrations with any employer.  We have the opportunity to work a lot of overtime if we like and many perks when doing so.  The benefits are quite good we have a gym and a cafeteria on site which is really neat and theyre working on a medical clinic and the employee discounts we get at different vendors is nice.  We can also cruise relatively cheaply a little difficult for the Oregon teams.  The ability to grow in the company is great.  Some of those in higher positions are in their earlymid twenties including myself so having the opportunity to advance despite my age has been very rewarding to me personally.I worked in the post cruise department by far one of the most difficult departments to work in so there are all kinds of stories I have.  The first terrible call I ever took was from a guest who was absolutely FURIOUS we had kicked her off the ship for bringing marijuana on board and she was debarked in Mexico without a passport.  She was having a very hard time getting home because of this and felt that it was up to us to pay her expenses.  Not our problem!Another good one... when a guest came on board he had worn a full suit with pockets sewn in and had one of those tube connected from which he was drinking vodka from.  By the time he got on board he was absolutely wasted but we didnt turn him away.  He didnt fight with anyone or do anything bad however he was found in a maids closet taking a dump.  Afterwards he wrote a very sincere apology letter for his actions though he was never kicked off the ship or anything.Worst calls?  The ones where guests began So Im not racist but I didnt get on your ship from San Juan just to listen to people speak Spanish the entire time.  Peurto Rican are smelly and.... or How dare you subject my family members to all the gays you had on board!  My worst call ever was a call from a man demanding we refund him for everything associated with his cruise because he was against homosexuality and stated we PROMISED him there would be no gay people on board.  That was two whole hours of nothing but bad.  Please note cruise companies will never tell you similar to hotels what large groups might have rented out parts of the ship.  Its proprietary and is not necessary.  Youll enjoy your cruise.  Just chill out and relax on your vacation.,Cruise,cic51dp,5,t5_2qm8s

1291822,0,t1_cie99yp,Im certainly sorry if you are offended. That is not at all my intention. In regards to the information provided about the information given to me by a guest I did say I didnt know if it was true so thank you for taking the time to let me know that was not the case. I was genuinely baffled when I heard that and couldnt believe that would happen. I never said RCCL was infallible. Everyone every company makes mistakes sometimes. And there will always be those who can not be pleased or can not be helped. I dont know what happened in your experience and I certainly apologize that my post has so greatly upset you because of your past experience. If it happened on board and didnt get handled properly always call the corporate line to get a fix. Corporate guest relations will do whatever they can. Though I do wonder why you continue to recommend a brand that you disapprove of? Celebrity is owned by RCCL and I have actually been trained by celebrity trainers. Not every has. And every company has people who are lazy and not as good as others. Im happy to remove the post as it has upset others   I havent any intentions to misrepresent or offend. As I stated its hard to really give a hard statement as to why one company is better than anothers when you havent traveled with them and you dont work with them. I can only go off statements said directly to me about it so that is hearsay and I can understand why it would upset others who are very loyal to NCL or Carnival. ,Cruise,ciey36l,2,t5_2qm8s

Geographically speaking Bermuda isnt a tropical islandit lies at roughly the same latitude as Charleston South Carolina and the average daytime temperature in January is in the s.  Cruises to Bermuda offer you more time ashore than do cruises to just about any other single destination.  So if you can book soon and get in for a October cruise date youd be golden.

1859380,0,t1_ckcvfdd,Most people will tell you about all of these MacGyveresque ways to sneak it on using plastic bladders empty suntan lotion bottles or reshrink wrapping packs of water bottles but honestly I have just packed a  or .L bottle into the middle of all my clothes in my suitcase and it has really never failed...That said I am  for successfully sneaking booze on board. I actually got caught once but I was being pretty egregious and had a handle that was jutting out of the side of my suitcase. I knew there was a problem when my friends bag arrived to the stateroom and mine didnt. My attendant said You must have brought on something bad and may want to go down to security.. Sure enough there was my bag along with a line about  deep who were also naughty. They try to make it kind of a demeaning process but it was too comical for anyone to take seriously...They make you take whatever it is out people with irons were getting busted too on a table in front of them and gave you a look and a youre not supposed to have.... talk. What was cool was that they actually offer to give it back to you on the last night of the cruise BUT because we started the party before we got on the ship and the bottle was opened they said they cannot hold an opened bottle for safety reasons and that they were going to toss it. I asked if they all wanted a shot on me everyone laughed and I went on my way with my bag a bit lighter. TLDR Just pack the bottles in the middle of your crap in your luggage and even if you get caught no big deal. ,Cruise,ckd90k1,2,t5_2qm8s

2259894,0,t3_2l34c0,Id probably start with CruiseCritic.com as they have many forums and blogs about cruising.  Doing my best to give you a rough idea Ill mention a couple things below.  Do you mind telling us what is making cruising an attractive option to you?  Where youre looking to go?  What you want to get out of the experience?  I ask because cruising can be so many different things depending on the itinerary line time of year length etc.  Picking the right cruise for your tastes is critical.For mass market and premium lines your cruise fare generally includes your stateroom entertainment on board and meals.  Alcohol is generally not included.  Most ships have additional dining venues that are more upscale or unique for which they may charge a premium  to .  Shore excursions can be booked through the cruise line or independent of the line.  Booking independently can be cheaper but with less quality assurance than booking through the line and without the assurance of the ship leaving without you in the event of a delay.   While on board youll find you can do as much or as little as you want.  Depending on the line there are a multitude of activities lectures shows etc but plenty of quiet places to relax as well.Again see if you can provide a bit more info and Im sure that myself and others will be glad to help.  Cruise addicts like myself love talking to others about cruising.  edit since agents came up heres a link to a comment I wrote a while back about using agents ,Cruise,clr1l5r,7,t5_2qm8s

2556188,0,t1_cms7kfw,Ive enjoyed all of them Ive been on but if its just you and your girlfriend you may enjoy someone like Norwegian or Royal Carribean more than Carnival or Disney which tend to be more family oriented. Or look up the other brands that I havent used personally. Youll likely go to either Nassau Freeport or both especially with  days harder to get to other places and back in that timeframe. Nassau is a pretty cool town where you step off the boat and youre right in the middle of it all. You can walk to some beaches as well. In Freeport you pretty much have to take a cab from the port which is in an industrial area. Thats a good place to do one of the offered excursions. Finally theres generally an expectation to dress up for dinner which I think is fun. You dont have to go all out but I aim for business casual with maybe a couple of ties just in case. A cruise is a good way to get professional looking photos done because the ships have dedicated photographers. ,Cruise,cms8c1l,2,t5_2qm8s

2725440,0,t3_2ra07u,....CONTINUED FROM ABOVE....Nothing comes to mind no.How about if I swear on the soul of my father Ted Bundy?See you think youre funny but youre not. This is serious.Cmon that was hilarious! But if you want to get serious fine. Youre getting a little heavy. OK if we change positions again? Do you think doggy style is a good position for anal rape?Did you REALLY just call me fat? Im beginning to understand why you have to resort to rape to get laid.As I began to roll her off of me she again lunged to get away this time catching me off guard. My surprised cock was suddenly exposed to the relatively cool room temperature air and she made it all the way to the cabin door determined to actually run out into the corridor nakedprobably screaming RAPE at the top of her lungsbefore I caught her and wrapped an arm around her waist prying her fingers from the doorknob.NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! she wailed as I flung her back onto the bed facedown mounting her again from behind. My hand pressed tightly over her mouth again as I rammed my cock as violently as I could back into her traumatized asshole. As punishment for her escape attempt for the next minute or two I assraped her with all the brutality I could muster. She was screaming her head off now into my hand and again I began to feel bad for what I was doing. So I returned to a slow gentle pace and both of our breathing returned to normal. Her screaming had stopped now and she once again tapped my hand. Youve got to stop. I cant take this anymore. I looked at the clock. There was still  minutes of ass rape left for her and I told her so.Just another  minutes then Ill be done. It must have seemed like an odd arbitrary time frame to her but she didnt question it. Of course I hadnt really given her any choice.OK but can you please just continue to be gentle? I was glad my gentleness hadnt gone unnoticed and answered her with a maybe. After all I knew from experience that when it came time to unload I had a tendency to behave with utter disregard for my partners wellbeing. More than a few women had given me oneand no more than oneblow job.I explained to her that I was planning to be done raping her and back to my cabin in time for last call from room service. She stared at the clock while I continued to plunder her ass. I dont think I can take it that much longer. It hurts. Im sore. I feel sick.Well I suggested Maybe we can make a deal. Ill cum as quickly as I can if you promise not to report me. She didnt even take a moment to consider that. No deal. There is no way you can keep me from reporting this. Hung for a penny hung for a pound. Fuck last call then. Maybe Ill just keep fucking your ass all night until the bars reopen tomorrow morning! What? Thats crazy. Nobody can fuck all night!You willing to bet your ass on that sweetheart? I dared. Suddenly she started to buck her hips. At first I thought she was trying to escape again but that definitely wasnt going to happen with all my weight on her. But she was also clenching and unclenching her ass and rotating her hips. She was trying to make me cum! I quit thrusting and just enjoyed the ride. Fortunately I have great stamina so her wicked plan didnt work and eventually she tired herself out and once again relaxed. Then I got back to work the hard work of anal rape.The time for last call came and went with my cock still pumping in and out of her bowels. So are you really going to keep raping my ass all night?Thats my plan unless we can come to some sort of an agreement.OK so if I agree not to report you youll make it be over soon? The movement of her left hand above her head caught my eye. She was actually crossing her fingers. How cute! Yes I nodded.OK OK fine I wont report you. Please hurry and end this?I began thrusting faster harder finally burying myself as deep as I could in her colon. Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! Uh! I jerked and spasmed several times then collapsed my deadweight onto her back. So. Youre not going to report me right?Yeah RIGHT! Im gonna report you the minute you get off of me! SUCKER! She was waving her left hand around as much as her position would permit to show me her crossed fingers.Well I guess we dont have a deal then! I informed her as I began pulling my cock out. And then to her surprise I shoved it back in. And began fucking her again.What are you doing? How can you get it up again so soon after you came?I didnt cum.You didnt?No I faked it.What? What man fakes an orgasm?I was testing you. Besides what kind of grown up crosses their fingers to get out of keeping a promise? Now I AM going to fuck your ass until daybreak maybe even until noon. Hung for a penny hung for a pound. And now theres nothing you can say to get me to stop. As if resigned to her fate she managed to reach and retrieve a pillow that had fallen on the floor and positioned it under her face with her arms folded on it too over her head. And she sighed and relaxed completely as if this were nothing more than a massage. Which in a way it was.CONTINUED IN PART .....,Cruise,cndvdkq,-1,t5_2qm8s

3260689,0,t3_2xfsz0,You sound like my wife and I. We arent into the nightlife anymore but we do like the occasional alcoholic beverage. We like to have fun but we dont enjoy the college frat party atmosphere any more.We were early s when we did our first cruise in . Okay thats a lie I did a cruise on a very old  passenger ship in the lates with my first wife but I dont count that. We went with Princess. We chose them based on recommendations from online strangers.Princess and I imagine their mirror image competitor  Celebrity  was a little too uppity for us. We just could not find our comfort zone. Everything was beautiful and elegant and the fellow passengers were nice for the most part it just seemed off if that makes any sense. I could make a long post out of my thoughts on our Princess cruise but Ill stop right there.Our next cruise was on Norwegian. BINGO. Almost instantly we found OUR cruise line. Their Freestyle Cruising was designed for people like us. We dont have to dress up if we dont want to and we can eat whenever and wherever we like. It just suits us to a T.Other lines are now copying the Freestyle concept to a certain degree but you cant halfass it for it to work properly. Its either ALL Freestyle or it just doesnt work.On NCL your fellow passengers run the gamut between twentysomethings and the elderly. On a  day cruise the average age is probably midtolate s. On the longer cruises like the  day MiamitoLA Panama Canal cruise we just did a couple months ago the average age was probably close to  which put us right smack dab in the middle.We also sail in Suites on NCL and agree about the Haven experience. However the Haven on the newer ships is much different from the Haven they added on to their Jewelclass ships. I personally would NOT pay extra for the Haven on the JewelPearlJadeGem. But I WOULD pay for the Haven on the EpicBreakawayGetaway. FYI  There ARE nonHaven Suites on the JewelPearlJadeGem. They are less expensive than the Haven Suites yet still retain the suite perks that NCL is famous for. All youll miss is the Haven private pool and deck area. We personally prefer the Dawn and the Star.  pax is about the perfect size plenty of suites spacious ships that never feel crowded and both have the best crew in the fleet imho.With that in mind we do not enjoy the larger megaships. Its hard to explain but the cliche and overused excuse of you arent in touch with the sea holds true to us. I really dont know how to explain it in words. It just didnt feel like a cruise it felt more like a large hotelresort.We enjoyed our time on the Epic and Oasis but we would never do a megaship again unless we got a whale of a deal and it went to different and interesting ports.All that being said whichever cruise line you do choose Im certain youll have fun and enjoy the experience and will retain many great memories.,Cruise,cozzcpm,5,t5_2qm8s

The driver waited outside the caves while we went on the tour  minutes. Then we had him take us to the Curaao liquor distillery where he once again waited while we did the tour and shop in the store a bit. I would not bother with the distillery again. It was lame. Our driver was good. He stopped the van at this spot at the top of the island looking down over the city with our cruise ship in the background so we can take some pictures. After that we had him drop us downtown where we looked in some stores took pictures and got drinks. From there it was about a  minute walk back to the ship. The total for the taxi was  split between the  of us. Not too bad considering we had the driver wait for us at each stop and we had him with us for about  hours. Not having to worry about getting a ride back to the ship was nice since we did not see any other taxis hanging out at the caves so we would have needed to call for a pickup otherwise. Best thing to do is to know where you want to go and talk about the total round trip pice for everyone in your group up front.  Also I would not worry too much about scams.

4479124,0,t3_3cairq,You dont go on a cruise to enjoy a specific stateroom and the linens or to strictly admire the layout or decor of the ship.  You go to make memories. So just focus on making memories first.  The ship is just window dressing and the backdrop to those memories really.  The entertainment staff and crew work super hard to make sure that you dont have to waste your time on mundane travel details while on vacation so you can  just relax with your family amp friends and all you come away with are memories of a great time.I see a lot of people who treat a cruise vacation itinerary like a todo list.  Dont try to cram every experience the ship amp ports offer into your cruise.  Trying to do it all and get a taste of everything will run you ragged trying to stay on a tight schedule rushing from venue to venue and other guests will quickly become annoyed with you as you push past herding your family and friends because youre going to be late for your next activity.

We did our Honeymoon Cruise on the Glory so I may be a bit biased.I think you will find better specialty dining and possibly amenities on the Escape by virtue of it being a bigger ship. I would focus on that and if there are things on that list that would make the difference for you. As for minisuite vs. Balcony there is virtually no difference.If not I would go with the Glory. They have a lot of great features such as the Alchemy Bar. Carnival has an unlimited drinks package too.If  is not that big of a deal I would personally go with the NCL cruise. The things on that ship would be worth it for me.

5978778,0,t3_3xamw8,Cruise lines staterooms with the exception of some fancy high end suites all have a setup with twin beds that can be connected as a queen.  The stateroom attendant does the changes which Im guessing involves moving the nightstands fastening the beds together putting some sort of filler in between the mattresses and putting queen sized linens on the beds.   I say Im guessing because Ive never actually seen them do the change.  You can request they are set up one way or the other on your reservation.If it is set up incorrectly when you get to your room just ask the stateroom attendant to change it and theyll change it while youre at dinner.

Ive been on well over  and with the exception of a few that fit the above criteria and which we still enjoyed immensely and there are alwats plenty of people your age Im  btw.You didnt give me too much to go off of regarding your normal activities but Ill grant you that youre unlikely to find spectacular music on board.  You might it happens but usually the music is just okay.  Now meeting women?  Dude youre going on an NCL cruise to the Western Caribbean  there will be so many women your age.  Where?  Well the Star has  bars and lounges so you can start there.  Then there are the pool areas walking around ports of call interesting in seeing new places at all?  there is more out there than just the US. restaurants singles mixers trivia gets people talking etc.Take a gander at some of the past daily programs link below and youll see there is a lot going on while onboard and even if none of the entries strike your fancy realize its not a bunch of  your olds falling asleep on deck chairs with blankets.Again realize that I get it.  While I am really into cruising and you may or may never be one day I spend plenty of time dwelling on stuff Im about to do that I think is going to suck Im doing that right now actually...yay holidays  but please try and get past that as much as you can as there is likely at least some time you can enjoy on the trip.

No. Typically youll just link a credit card to your account when you do the online checkin which you should be doing now if youre  weeks out. If you havent prepaid the gratuities and you dont buy anything on the ship then on the last day theyll just charge your gratuities ppday to your credit card. If you received any onboard credit as a promotion when you booked that will be applied first then the balance charged to your CC.  Do you need to connect a credit card to your account? You really should. Makes your life a million times easier. If you dont the alternative is a cash deposit there is a minimum here and then youll have to pursue getting a refund or paying the difference before disembarking on the last day.

Several people noted the port area had gone down hill over the past few years.  Do not waste your time touring on foot get away from the port area all together.  Do not listen to any review that says the portshopping area is worth your time.  I now regret that we did not get out and tour what is likely a beautiful island.

Dont recall seeing pullup bars but there might be the handles you see on a large universal set or the assisteddippullup combo machine. If there are pullup bars they would likely either be lowheight due to the generally low ceilings in the spas Ive seen or outdoors on the weather decks of theres an exterior sport court area.You can try Googling for images and videos of the spa and fitness center interior for the Freedom or its sister ships Independence and Liberty of the Seas and see what you can pick out.Hope you can keep close to your normal regimen and...

7785383,0,t3_4lx4on,As others said those are two very different vacations in terms of cultureweatherareaentertainment.Ive never been to these islands but some research these islands have some Irish cultureinfluence Barbados St. Kitts St. Nevis and possibly Puerto Rico. If you want to get general British influence Id add the British Virgin Islands and the Cayman Islands. In general there are always exceptions. generally cruising is more budget friendly for the same quality of accommodations activities and quality of food. All meals and entertainment is provided. Its much easier going with everything planned out and easy to arrange safe reputable toursshore excursions. You get to wake up in a new place every day but have the same hotel. You get to have a taste of a lot of places so perhaps later you can come back to do a more extensive land trip of places you actually liked. For the Caribbean specifically a cruise is a great way to travel. Some of the smaller islands are only reachable by boat so you have to be on a boat anyways. Some islands and ports are tiny say only  miles wide and so you get a good feeling of everything in one day. If you want a lot of white sandy beaches with bathwater and a change of scenery each day that is one way of going about it. Some islands have a lot of jungle so there is a lot of variety from island to island depending on the itinerary.  Airfare to the Caribbean can be really expensive especially if you want to go from one island to another. Most the travel and flights is USAand other countries tofrom the Caribbean. Id cruise to islands in the Caribbean first as some I was really fond of and others I probably wouldnt go back to. The Caribbean is an ideal place for a first cruise as well. As far as safety cruises are really safe these days and have a great track history. Weve learned a lot engineering wise about the Titanic incident. Crusie ships have sophisticated radar systems that can detect icebergs and other vessels even in complete fog. Cruises have in place enough spots for every passenger and crew aboard a life boat. There is much better training to prevent panic behavior. All passengers must do a practice emergency drill known as a muster drill before every embarkation. In this drill the crew will teach you what to do in case of an emergency onboard that ship. Dont worry about it cruises are incredibly safe. ,Cruise,d3r4shn,1,t5_2qm8s

7897991,0,t1_d43rk5h,Thats unfortunate about the Summit being expensive the weeks youre looking. I know depending on the week it swings between  and .  And you are right about San Juan being a stretch  because flying in will certainly be more expensive than going to MIAFLL as well as those loaded itineraries tend to be more expensive as you spend more  on land on more islands. Yeah not a fan of Carnival. I have not been on an NCL ship yet but going in December and I hear its a good blend of the youthful party atmosphere from Carnival but with a little more order and somewhat better food. Bonus points if you guys drink is they are running a promo where you get a Free ultimate beverage package first  people to a room pay  additional gratuity per person. Thats what I booked for my next cruise  straight up booze cruise. The flip side is that NCLs itineraries are not very good typically.

You should also note that there is a limit of  drinks per day. If you are a steady drinker its pretty easy to get there on sea days. They do cut you off after you reach your  drink limit meaning you cant pay for any more drinks either even if you arent visibly intoxicated.Anyway I always get it and find it to be worthwhile just make sure you read all the rules and feel free to ask any questions about how others that like the program use it.,Cruise,d4ii17x,7,t5_2qm8s

For most of us on the mainstream more affordable ships  NCL has a promotion right now where you get the unlimited drink package for free with just about any booking few exclusions apply also you do pay an extra  in gratuities on a  day cruise to pick that promotion. Likewise Celebrity offers a promotion where you book an oceanview or higher you also get the beverage package.

8041442,0,t3_4pcx2x,All inclusive beverages.  Beverages included.  Free beverages.  The beverage thing really depends on what you are looking for.  Traditionally cruise lines included nonalcoholic beverages that were not carbonated and were not individually bottled in your regular cruise fares.  They charged extra for alcoholic beverages soda pop bottled water espresso type coffee and other premium beverages but included tap water juices coffee tea fruit punch milk lemonaide and a few other beverages.  In the past few years most lines have started adding beverage packages which include unlimited amounts of some or all extra cost items and sometimes including these for no extra charge as parts of promotions.Room service has traditionally been included by manymost cruise lines as long as you are ordering beverages and food which is no extra cost.

There was a small secure area around the ship our free shuttle took us out of the industrial zone to a cruise terminal it was not safe to walk. At the terminal we found numerous taxis parked waiting they were expensive and the drivers were very aggressive. When told you were not interested they became pushy and angry. Just beyond the taxis you will find a group of tour buses. Their prices are much more reasonable. Pompeii and Sorrento are your  main options.

But yes this is the most correct answer. So OP  in ELI  You dont have to tip on the ship at all unless you REALLY want to. They will automatically charge you personday which will cover your tips. This option is simply to pay that personday right now instead of when you actually travel. Nothing more. The argument for doing so is that you dont have to worry about it later if that helps you budget. The argument against is the same as paying a bill way way too early  the lost interest on that cash if you were just to keep it in your account. ,Cruise,d7t2wwp,0,t5_2qm8s

10382269,0,t3_5ompuh,On Carnival it depends on the ship. Some ships have the fast unlimited internet for somewhat reasonable prices although the latency is still slow because its of course satellite.

10402592,0,t3_5oz7aj,Yes an no  a lot of the cities arent actually on the coast and can be up to several hours bustrain ride from the ship. Not always the case of course and works a lot better in the Mediterranean than it does in the north. You also have to give yourself credit that you cant see all of Paris in one day  you can spend weeks there and still not have seen everything same for other cities. So the answer is  it depends. It depends on what experience you want out of it. It depends on the itinerary  some things work in a day a port format better than others. ,Cruise,dcn78k9,3,t5_2qm8s

10575034,0,t1_dd6g8uy,This was in  it couldve changed I guess because ive seen some one mention there were no beggars but last time I went I was hit with a swarm of them right off the boat. Once I settled on an excursion and cab driver I was taken to the beach at Atlantis. The excursion we chose was a banana boat ride to oprahs coral reef where we snorkeled. They keep your bags on the boat that pulls the banana boat to keep them dry. I brought  cash on the island and my wallet was taken out of a bag while we we were in the water where they took exactly  out. And left  I guess so i didnt notice right away because it worked.Maybe youre thinking thats a heavy assumption you couldve lost the money. Not possible. Literally minutes before getting on the banana boat I was getting a beer at a bar at atlantis. This is where i did a recount of my money to make sure i knew exactly how much i had.  twenty dollar bills. Fast forward to right when we got off the boat. I left my wallet in my step moms bag. We laid on the beach a little grabbed a taxi. I get my wallet back in the taxi and while im trying to determine how much i want to spend at senior frogs i realize i now only have  twenty dollar bills. One of the guys operating the boat definitely got himself a nice tip. I never felt threatened or intimidated but even being robbed aside i was highly unimpressed with the bahamas. It is a dilapidated island with very little to do. I personally will never be returning. If i wanted to go to an over crowded over rated poverty ridden tourist trap beach then maybe Id enjoy it. I say beach because there was only a small area of beach that we could relax on. Most the beaches are owned by a resort or some water sport activity area. So even when you find a strip of free beach you may have water skis flying by you. Overall this was one of the most shitty experiences in my life. There are a ton of other tropical places I rather go. panama city costa rica belize cozumel grand caymen. All beautiful places to visit and explore. Not the bahamas. A lot of people seem to like it for some reason so i feel like the outlier here.,Cruise,dd6qcz3,-2,t5_2qm8s

11021587,0,t1_deh6xde,No one is fighting Im not sure what fight youre referring to.  Im not trying to convince anyone to do or not do anything.  I honestly feel like I missed something here.  In fact I said Im not necessarily trying to discourage you only providing some clarity.Im a bit surprised at myself that Im even responding as I usually dont respond at all if its not relating directly to the OPs topic.  I havent any interest in arguing with strangers on the internet so I hope you recognize that this is not an argument Im just striving to understand your viewpoint and perhaps shed some light on mine.In this thread Im just communicating and trying to be helpful as I do on this and other subreddits that I enjoy chatting in.  I actually completely agree with your observation about people commenting on their interests to those outside of their interests is perfectly valid.  This leads to people also tending to feel their overall significance in the world is somehow greater than it actually is.  Its the same reason that for example people on websites for smartphone enthusiasts may complain about an app not being able to transfer settings between their six devices forgetting that theyre the slim minority  those devices are made the for average consumer  not specifically them.This in mind I cant help but feel that your tone is suggestive of a commitment to go  degrees and be completely dismissive of any input from those who have a different perspective on a matter.  As people we do have the ability to hear out multiple pieces of information and then make an informed decision after weighing said information and options.If you listened to people like me youd never leave the house?  Im not clear on exactly the group youve bundled me in with but I cant help but feel like people like me is referring to people telling you to do or not do something.  Again Ive made no effort to tell anyone to  or not do anything.  Out of a multifaceted response trying to help the OP find the most effective method of communicating on hisher cruise a decision ultimately to be made by the OP you picked our two or three sentences where I mentioned it not technically being legal to use a GMRS radio outside the US focused only on that even going so far as to take my later mention about potentially causing interference and deciding that I said if you use a GMRS radio overseas a plane will crash.  What?I actually wouldnt pass judgement on someone for taking the radios on the trip  but when pressed by someone who seems to feel that my comments are myopic and indicative of a narrow range of interest lacking perspective then Im inclined to point out that a human life being lost because of unintentional interference is not something I even mentioned in my comment. I once built a fm transmitter from a kit! A whole plane went down.  As best as I can tell my responses were in no way alarmist and by most measures at least more cordial in tone than your comment.  In fact Ill point out again that most of my response was around whether or not the radios would function adequately whether that was the best solution to the OPs challenge.  Really only  or three short sentences had anything to do with licensing or legality.I hope to continue to contribute meaningfully to discussions and itd be cool if you did too  if we all did.,Cruise,deh9lvc,2,t5_2qm8s

11647272,0,t1_dgfu9tj,A busy mall is a good point of reference for us.  You definitely want to avoid the shops on the ship especially during an advertised sale.  It will be a madhouse and my wife and I routinely avoid that area.  That should be only one part of one deck so you should be able to avoid it without too much trouble.I want to caution you that embarkation day is going to be rough for you.  Most people will be out in the public areas and not in their rooms.  Theyre exploring the ship and full of energy when later on some of those people will be in their rooms napping.  The rest of your cruise is not going to be as bad as embarkation day!  You probably want to stay in your room most of that day but dont think that the rest of the cruise will be like that.You will have to go to a Muster Drill along with everyone else on the ship so that could also be difficult for you but as other people have suggested go talk to disability services and see if they can accommodate you.  Maybe they can change your Muster station so that you dont have to be in a big crowd with the rest of us.I hope you have a great time.
