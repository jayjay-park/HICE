952854,0,t1_chcipfp,I cannot prove a negative as they do not exist. Scripts change all the time. At no point does any one mention them and an experienced team of Marines would know how to recce the planet.Ripley says in the drop ship thats the atmosphere processor which is then replied to with thats it a remarkable piece of machinery by Burke. It is singular one machine not a series. That is clearly a concious decision form the intended script.Also when the marines are trapped and they talk about plans if there were more at least one person would say what about the other processors? One must have an emergency beacon? This absence is why there is poor transport only tractors and no winged transport  surely they would have mentioned that when they need to escape a massive atomic fireball in...  hours...There have also never been mentions of the other processors in any other literature  granted that is expanded universe  but so is an unused portion of a script. It is never used as people do not generally think there was more than one.As for being fully automated  I work with automated equipment  it is automated until it breaks  that is why the colony is there. Automated does not mean self repairing. The whole processor is clearly built for human access and interaction.,LV426,chcliu4,1,t5_2s5sk

2036676,0,t3_2hea5t,I really dont think it was Deacons chestbursters facehuggers xenos or anything of the sort. I think the goo is a chemical compound that the Engineers can use to serve all kinds of specific purposes. In the beginning that particular sample was used to break down DNA and reassemble it based on the planet they leave it on. The jars or vases in the ship contained a weaponized version of it. It was designed to make any organic life it came into contact with reassemble the DNA without breaking it down first. It made its hosts far more aggressive adaptable to any environment Fifield could breathe outside without his mask after his initial mutation and reconfigures muscle density to make them a lot stronger therefore an even more effective killer. I think that the goo must have somehow gotten onto or into one of the engineers or another creature on board They had worms living on the ship which became the demoncobras and mutated for a little while unchecked. Then it got out. I assume it escaped onto the planed and went to just crawl off and die. They were going to drop these on earth to mutate some of us to kill the rest of us. Then we die out. BUT before Holloway can mutate fully he puts some alien spunk inside of Shaw. Now THAT was the game changer. Adding sex or natural life creation to the mutation process is what made it all possible. The deacon was made from mixing the Human DNA with Engineer DNA mixed all with the mutation goo.Somewhere along the way i think the engineers discover the right process to produce a Xenomorph. Probably somewhere down the line some sort of reptilian and insect DNA were introduced as the Xenos carry traits of both.Sorry my idea just kind of took control here but as for the question i agree somewhat. It was definitely not a chestburster. I think it was something we have yet to see. Or just simply a mutated engineer. ,LV426,ckypg2r,3,t5_2s5sk

2065001,0,t1_cl2axeo,So far Im impressed and disappointed at the same time. The atmosphere is terrific. They really captured the look and feel of the Nostromo. The lighting and shadows are all great and thats really enough for you to feel unsafe well before you see the alien. Youre already familiar with this place and know the dangers. That said the alien is disappointing. Im playing on the hardest difficulty which the game recommends and theres zero sense of the alien could be anywhere be careful!  Instead the alien will just be walking a set routine in the area immediately around you. There is a sense or suggestion of dynamic AI but it feels too much like the rubber band AI you get in Mario Kart and the like. Feels a little cheap. Ill keep playing and posting impressions.

As the xenos were climbing on the platform before boarding the Torrens I felt genuine fear like Oh shit I have to get this done before they kill me and then I found it strange that I couldnt take off my EVA suit once I got back there so I halfassumed something was up. The QTE when the alien showed up made me furious and the ending was cheap and did no justice to how awesome the game was whatsoever.

2582806,0,t1_cmv8jqk,First Id recommend giving it poster dimensions  I.e rectangular not square. Second font choice and sizing  the credits are a bit large. Third taking a promotional image and repurposing it as a poster is a little...unimaginative. The two approaches I think of when it comes to posters are either a go minimalist like the word ALIENS with the blue glow on the black background or b something a little more artistic the blending of images with filters effects etc.. Those arent the only options but theyre common ones. I wasnt trying to be mean just honest criticism. Keep working on designs. Even I have had times where I had what I thought was a great idea in my head but then upon execution it wasnt so hot.Fan art is fun to look at and discuss but graphic design is hard to explain and even harder to execute  its sort of something you have to feel. And it takes practice. Off the top of my head a more evocative image with that specific tag line might MIGHT be just a shot of a steel floor littered with spent shell casings blood and acid scarring and maybe a fan favorite dog tag thrown in for good measure. It doesnt give much away but youd recognize the key elements of a marine vs Xeno firefight and it would show an escalation in action from what happened in the first movie.,LV426,cmvpkno,1,t5_2s5sk

6508362,0,t3_44qeyz,Ripley is estranged from Newt having been taken to live with grandparents in Europe and with the US European cold war she has no way to see her. She and Hicks are apart unable to get over the events of Aliens.A man appears asking for help to find the derelict saying he can reunite her with Newt as he us a representative of the European conglomerates fighting for control of Weyland Yutani against the Americans. They talk of duristiction and how there were British crew on the Nostromo and their bioethics and quarantine procedures. She is soon on her way on board a ship in hypersleep.Hicks is however just awaking travelling to LV on board the Conrad a Weyland ship similar to the Sullacco on a search and destroy mission to see if any specimens have been taken from the Derelict. Preparations are under way as the ship enters orbit. Hicks is wary of peoples motives especially the science team of  androids that keep themselves to themselves.The mercenary team gets into a larger drop ship than in Aliens in bay . A few armoured suits are loaded and the ship drops with Hicks communicating through coms on the Conrad. The team enter the Derelict but coms is disrupted with the structure and weather. Hicks slightly bonds with one of the Android as he tries to calm Hicks obvious fears. minutes pass with frantic distress calls as it emerges some of the mercenaries are infected by face huggers. The drop ship approaches with quarantine procedures starting. The captain sends Hicks the friendly android and the Hyperdynes to help casualties. The androids seem tense and twitchy going to the drop bay as they start to help casualties. The friendly android grabs Hicks and pushes him violently through a door. The doorway locks as he sees one of the Hyperdynes grab a pulse rifle from an injured mercenary and starts to execute them. Hicks watches as the two other Hyperdynes rip the friendly android to pieces who was obviously aware of what was going to happen.Hicks heads back to the bridge to see the fire fight happening over the monitors as the androids fight the mercs. One face huggers victim is shot spraying acid breaching the hull suckingly many into space. Some scramble to safety with bulkheads closing and the drop ship Bay now separating the communications and flight deck from the one remaining Hyperdyne with the victims.Days pass as Hicks and the remaining crew plan with the Hyperdyne taunting them as he is only mission now is to get the specimens back. A queen and warriors erupt.A few weeks pass with a few aborted attempts by the crew to get to other side of the Conrad. The Android becoming more abusive and zealotry as they do.On the monitors in Bay  movement can be seen. The remaining crew scramble with weapons one getting into a remaining reserve armoured exo suite. They fire at the Queen but she is seemingly invulnerable to small arms she grabs the exo suit and systematically disables and dismantles it. A few warriors grab crew and pull them away. One warrior is eviscerated by the suite in its last moments as bay  violently depresurises with only a few making it out alive.Ripley awakes from hypersleep as they begin to search for the derelict and any other ships. They can see but not communicate with the Conrad so must investigate.Rumbling and scrabbling Awakens the Conrad crew as the Android taunts them as he approaches in zero G outside damaged but functional. He can be seen travelling along the hull with the juvenile Queen close by stalking they enter the drop empty lifeless bay. The crew beg for him not to open airlocks as he approaches but to no avail. As the Android advances them closer and closer the Queen becomes more excited until they are blocked. The Queen merely rips the Android apart tossing the milky body away then with brute force opens hatches and solves obstacles to help the warriors through working as a team. The Queen as muscle and brains the warriors niple and alert.The crew fight off the warriors but a few crew are grabbed and the Queen drags them back through zero G with them suffering horrific injuries but still alive. The remaining warriors are ejected into space not as lucky as the Queen as they retreat.The Queen instinctively nests in the generators safe. Hicks and the few remaining crew holed up in cramped conditions.Ripleys ship arrives and surveys the crippled Conrad. A scout crew board ti see who was there or if there was an Alien aboard. They establish contact with the crew and details emerge. Hicks tells Ripley they must destroy the ship as a rendezvous will happen with another Company science vessel that cannot be far away. Time is running out as they can see the new ship approaching.The Europeans refuse to destroy the Conrad seemingly reneging on their deal with Ripley though no one is sure as they say they need the crew as evidence and a bargaining chip against the Weyland ship. Hicks frantically tries to destroy the Conrad with a self destruct as he and Ripley talk for a final time talking openly for the first time in years. Apologetic upset honest.The Conrad is destroyed as the other ship gets into range. A game of brinkmanship between the two ship happens and eventually the Europeans nuke the derelict leaving no trace of the Alien as a show of force... There remains nothing left of the Alien... Unless they got a sample or stow away earlier.Fade to black credits.,LV426,czsiilu,5,t5_2s5sk

But they the Engineers a species that have mastered bioengineering still looks the exact same as billions of years back in time? Both of our species technologies presents a few similarities although at different level. We both know cryogenics interstellar travel hologram display. It proves that theres maybe just a few thousands years between our technology capacities and their not a billion years. Thus theyre not Gods but just very advanced. Then why any species with this level of civilization would launch such gigantic project of create life then lay back for billions of years waiting the process to end. They were using the black goo substance with almost instant effectiveness Does the Engineer of the beginning drank black goo?.It doesnt compute. What I think happened is that somehow the Engineer of the beginning was held responsible for something terribly bad he did or good? then sentenced to death in a ceremonial way.EDIT After thinking about it it could be a bit possible. That would explain their hatred toward humanity its because we are born from the DNA of an individual they hate. And as far as we know the incidents occurred on LV could have been just local or entirely global to their civilization. Thus the Engineer who died in the movie was maybe the last of his kind that would explain the lack of technology improvement despite such a humongous lapse of time.,LV426,dac67sx,1,t5_2s5sk

Allowed the Alien to get in there and stopped their first attempt at leaving the planet.But yeah... all the colonists together in a sublevel of the atmospheric processor after what was apparently a pitched battle with aliens should have rung some alarm bells in Gormans head and he should have ordered them to pull out immediately and come up with a better solution.

There is no way that you have watched every movie for every trailer youve ever seen because its premature to judge something before you even know what the final result will be. Dont get me wrong trailers can be misleading. But the whole point of trailers is to judgedetermine what the final result will be.gtI think it foolish to let  minutes of footage tarnish and taint ones perceptions of what the finished product will be. youre acting like this is a bad thing. I never said that the trailer is bad or that the film looks bad so you can calm down. Im saying that the trailer comes across as misleading because of its tone. It doesnt look or feel like its selling an Alien film unlike the first teaser for Prometheus despite all the Alien its trying to show off. I think that it will be more of a sequel to Prometheus than it lets off. gtPersonally Im excited to see what happens and how the story will unfold.Okay thats good to know but that doesnt detract from the oddness of the trailer.

11047063,0,t3_5xm9c0,Its an excellent movie. As a movie I cant have any complaint.As a sequel to Alien I have some complaints and its the loss of continuity in creature behavior and overall feeling.I understand the explanation about a different kind of creature the warriors and the presence of the queen and hive thus the different behavior shown in the movie. But still I dont feel comfortable with the change of the slow and sexually creepy alien to the warriors. Alien the first one had a very interesting feeling Im not talking about one being a horror movie and the other one being an action movie Im talking about the feeling given by the behavior of the alien.The sexual and hidden subtopics of the first movie are lost in Aliens. The creature is different and despite having an explanation for that different kind of xenos the warriors I dont entirely like it.Kanes son was the perfect organism that Ash described. But it wasnt just slow and seemed more intelligent it seemed evil in a way its purposes were a mystery it was more of an Eldritch entity it was beyond creepy even in the way it kills... just look at Lamberts death its implied even by Ridley Scott later that she was actually raped by the alien. I dont know it was something different... The warriors from Aliens lose their inidivudal perfection in favor of a colective survival of the hive and the queen less humans more insects. And I dont like that. I cant like that.Despite all that I like the movie as that as a movie. I think its an excellent movie one of the best scifi movies ever. But thats one thing and another one is to judge it as an Alien sequel.I hope I wont be downvoted to hell for this I understand Aliens is a beloved movie among the fandom but its just my opinion.,LV426,dek5yvf,13,t5_2s5sk

11061352,0,t1_delq2qb,Personally I would say not. In Alien it is ambiguous Aliens expands it and Alien  was clearly meant to be a deposited egg by Queen most likely. Even in Resurrection it is said that the queen has the classic eggsack until the mutation kicks in and the womb and birth occurs. All share a commonality through further development or explanation. Nothing is retconned.It is only Prometheus with the goo then cuddles the squid and now spore parasites that things really change. It also seems to have orogound effects on the narrative too. The back buster victim looks bewildered as is affected mentally. It also seems to suggest no embryo extraction that Bishop  hoped for stopping embryo implantation as they managed in Aliens. The backbursters looks integrated into the morphology of the host and is not just a parasite using a host but actively transforming biologically similar to Fifield.   ,LV426,delsbf7,1,t5_2s5sk

11337854,0,t3_61r785,I loved Prometheus. Ive seen the regular version twice and the extended cut just recently which I greatly preferred and think is both better as a film and for the lore. Definitely not an expert as Prometheus is pretty confusing rather it just refuses to answer some questions. Scott wrote it definitely knowing hed make a sequel. Ill answer your questions to my understanding though. Is the first scene earth? Im not sure. Its ambiguous I think it could be earth but it could also not be earth and thats the whole point. It may be the covenant planet as well or it may remain ambiguous. A note on that first scene I think people miss is the ship is not the typical Engineer ship weve seen. Its something else.What does the black goo do? That is a complicated answer and I dont think we  know yet. We do know what weve seen it do. It rapidly interacts with and changes in some cases recombining in other cases destroying DNA of any carbon based life we assume. Some people have speculated it is somehow mechanical in nature. I dont like this but its possible. I think its more biological it may be both though. Idris Elbas dialogue about the chem factory leak explosion to Vickers might be extended edition only really hints at bioweapon. Why does it affect different people? I think the dose and perhaps the organism matter here a lot. With Fifield I think its notable that really only his face was exposed. It morphed the rest of his body into a monster. The exteded edition monster is quite different and looks much more Xenoesque. Either way it turns him into a vicious hard to kill SOB. Holloway we see just a drop makes him incredibly ill and he is flamed to death. We never see what he is being transformed into which is what David was planning. We only see his DNA was so warped already when he had sex with Shaw that his sperm was heavily mutated enough to create life in shaws womb giving us the trilobite. We dont know why these things happen but we do know these are at least some of the effects of the goo.Why does David dose Holloway? I dont know. Curiosity I think. An overlooked scene is at the beginning of the film where David is basically isolated and patrolling the ship the whole journey all the while viewing the dreams of the passengers and occasionally talking with Weyland. I think he begins to despise humanity and realize his superiority. Despise is the wrong word though I dont think hes malicious but humanity is expendable. Hes testing the goos ability on life to see if it could help Weyland possibly. When it doesnt I think hes then just curious as to what it does.Is Vickers a robot? I dont think so. I think thats just her acting haha. She has sex with Janek in the ext edition. I think the pushups and are supposed to show us her humanity.Why does he save Shaw? David you mean? I think his experiment has ended I think he doesnt want to be alone again I think without Weyland hes free in a way still very curious. He also kind of needs her hes just a head. Why cave drawings? I think the moon Prometheus planet was a threat to humanity possibly perhaps something humanity was supposed to revere? I think there is a religious significance to the goo the xeno looking statue and the murals hint this is not simply a weapon. Its something more to the engineers. The create sometimes you must destroy. To be the creators of life they either battle with the destruction of life or they use it very carefully. Perhaps its something theyve battled long ago and kept it around to serve their purposes. I dont really know. Why did they try to destroy earth suddenly? Im not sure. I think either humanity committed a sin against engineers maybe by coming to that moon a place they were never supposed to be maybe Earth was scheduled for destruction and it never happened. We dont know. We know that Shaws hypothesis about them being the gods and showing us the path is wrong. She still wants answers I think we as viewers are very much the same. How? Black goo presumably. High doses probably annihilate life. ,LV426,dfh4jrv,1,t5_2s5sk

11371220,0,t3_626p19,Ive had lots of dreams about them but a few months ago I had a very vivid dream and its stuck.ampnbspAt first my dream seemed to be civilians vs the military I distinctly remember a wireframe cal sniper rifle I was trying to use I dont know why it was wireframe think graphicsrendering but very quickly it ended up being a very walking dead style survival where we were moving from safe place to safe place.ampnbspWhen I say we I mean my fiancee and my kids we ended up at an old heavily oak decorated house with high ceilings. We walked in thinking it was abandoned where a voice said something to my right I stopped and spun my weapon round at it now I had an assault rifle. In the corner a man sat in a chair with two aliens either side of him now I think about it they must have been similar to the aliens from film  as they were sat down much like a dog does. He told me there was no need to shoot them and that we were perfectly safe as they were just holograms. I instantly relaxed.ampnbspI remember we spent a few days at the house with these holograms around the place the rest were normaldrone style aliens some were crawling around the outside of the building others just lurking. They were entirely silent. He was using them as a deterrent almost like they were there to signal that other aliens need not check the area out that this place was occupied.ampnbspNot a lot else happened at that point and we packed up to leave to find somewhere of our own just as I was walking out the door as the last person I heard the distinct slime dripping on the floor sound from high above me at this instant it dawned on my that I hadnt seen any trademark giveaways that these holograms were in fact holograms. There was no flickering no blueish hue. I just didnt question it. I remember feeling very angry with this man that hed allowed us to stay allowed my children to stay in the house with these killing machines all along! I turned around and mid turn I woke up. Im not sure what my intention would have been perhaps Id have killed the alien or him or both!ampnbspI woke up angry for the next few minutes until my brain wrapped itself around what had happened. It was very real at the time!ampnbspI love any kind of nightmare as most of the time I know its not real so I just go along with it most of the time I can influence the dreams Im having or at least realise I dont really need to be afraid.,LV426,dfkwnbs,1,t5_2s5sk

Parker and Brett never got along with anyone and since they were the only two hands on mechanics they probably thought someone like Ash was a bit of a wuss. In the sitcom Frasier Niles did the exact thing but that was because he was so OCD.  EDIT I also just wanted to add that the relationship between the Nostromo crew is what makes the original great. Theyre not friends nor are they tolerable co workers to each other. You can tell theyre so sick of each other and just want to get home. Its easy to imagine that as soon as they were processed and debriefed they would go their separate ways without saying a word to one another at least until the next job that is. ,LV426,dfu48gi,22,t5_2s5sk
