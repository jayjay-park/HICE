544260,0,t3_20bjad,When it comes to developing trees five years can go by really fast.  I would consider all of my options before committing to trees.  For instance you can have an abundance of vegetables starting from year one assuming the conditions are right.  Berries as well especially by year two.  Just my personal opinion from experience thats taught me that some things take longer to establish than others and if you have limited time you might find yourself finally up and running full steam ahead only to be at the end of your opportunity.  Good luck and have fun with it!  ,BackyardOrchard,cg250fo,1,t5_2xuc5
1151314,0,t1_chz3d5o,Heeh welcome to growing fruit  .  As for the bud direction if you choose the bud to cut to under the branch the new shoot will typically come out flat if you cut to a top side bud the new shoot will go up and if you prune to the buds on the sides the new shoots will usually grow in that direction.I try to make most of my cuts to an underside bud as flat branches with a slight upward curve are almost always the best producers.We just got hit with a huge rain and wind storm last night and my table grapes are in very bad shape.  The wind ripped many of the new canes.  We lost nearly  of the nice new growth.,BackyardOrchard,chz4y3s,2,t5_2xuc5

3973761,0,t1_cr985mg,Yeah its more of a think positive thing.Some of those trees arent selffertile unless theyre grafted with multiplevarieties. Grafted trees are a pain. Read up on how each one likes being pruned and make sure you do. Mark the important branches just loosen the tags so you know which branches are rootstock and should get cut off.,BackyardOrchard,cr98q1h,1,t5_2xuc5
4005772,0,t1_crcpqfy,Or if you have an outdoor cat.  I have peaches and no nets and no problems with birds.  Oriental fruit moths and japanese beetles however...,BackyardOrchard,crcvzye,2,t5_2xuc5
4753394,0,t3_3g09rw,Spacing and sunlight. Make sure you have enough of both. Also make sure that you have the crosspollinator if the tree needs one.,BackyardOrchard,cttplen,1,t5_2xuc5
7479205,0,t3_4hkqw2,It is a cherry for sure though unless you have the taginfo you will never know what kind just from the leaves though you can narrow it down to a few over time.,BackyardOrchard,d2sccpq,1,t5_2xuc5
7685512,0,t1_d3fsdel,Well I am not going to argue as it is impossible to tell from a picture but I have been commercial fruit farming for my entire life  years and am th gen commercial fruit farmer and that is a classic very bad case of mildew on apple. ,BackyardOrchard,d3fsmvn,3,t5_2xuc5
7740958,0,t1_d3lzgny,Thanks.it took me  times to realize what were you saying about shirts...I need some coffee..The tree is tall but Im not sure if the neighbours would like to see some fireshow or if is even allowed.,BackyardOrchard,d3m3a4q,1,t5_2xuc5
7877769,0,t1_d41fk2e,I see  viewable though that happens to me on occasion as well.  I do not know why.  And as far as asking the question it is a legitimate question as to planting a tree through seeds I do not know the science behind it others may but I just know it will not work with most fruits if at all for any.,BackyardOrchard,d41j8dt,2,t5_2xuc5
8061565,0,t1_d4lv0i5,I just searched it up and muscadine isnt the grapes I saw. They look like regular green grapes but the texture and taste isnt the same as regular grapes. They look dry from the outside but after you take a bite  the inside of the grape feels like jello but its also hard in away that it takes a while to chew because the whole grape is still intact. Sorry Im making this sound so complicated lol ,BackyardOrchard,d4m71m5,1,t5_2xuc5
8120438,0,t1_d4srvbm,I posted this back in February.  I asked some others off Reddit and they said it looked like it was healing and should be alright.  And the tree started out looking great for a little while.  Then in May I posted this after it had a few sections that looked sick.  Besides the first set of pictures I havent seen any visible damage to the trunk Ill give it an extra look over tonight.  There has been a chipmunk hanging around my flower beds but Im assuming it wouldnt be him burrowing that far over?I think all the things Ive sprayed on it and the other  should be safe dormant oil LiquiCop copper Surround WP Bonide Fruit Tree Spray Sulfur Immunox and Serenade.,BackyardOrchard,d4st68b,2,t5_2xuc5
8941095,0,t1_d7mjzg9,Not so much a question of how old as much as how big.  I dont really have a definite answer to that question but yours is still so small that my best answer is not yet.,BackyardOrchard,d7ml658,3,t5_2xuc5
10510910,0,t3_5qd0rz,It common practice in commercial orchards to have a crab apple every so often for pollination.The only disadvantage is that you need to be wary of the relative vigour of the crab when pruning.,BackyardOrchard,dcziuk7,1,t5_2xuc5
10717280,0,t1_ddjxb4f,True. No growth yet. My similarly aged lemon tree is sprouting little leaf growth but nothing on this guy. Ill give it a little more time ,BackyardOrchard,ddlep6e,1,t5_2xuc5
11053315,0,t3_5sayiu,Thats not normal.Id dig it up before it comes out of dormancy check the roots are free and spreading and replant in a nice big deep hole with lots of organic matter.,BackyardOrchard,dekvhlp,1,t5_2xuc5
