839980,0,t3_23e5ux,I plan out my meals to a crazy degree. Im a student so maybe not everybody else has the time but it works wonders my budget is  a week for food I make porridge jars for breakfast at a cost of . per serve leaving me . per serve for lunches and dinners. I usually cook meals with four or six portions and either eat it over a few days or freeze for later so its actually pretty easy to keep to this.I head to the Queen Vic Market in Melbourne most weekends to pick up extremely cheap vegetables and beef mince  a kg sometimes! and stock up on things like bolognese freeze most of it in tubsbags alone but a few with pasta precooked and burgers make a huge bowl of mince mixture I use this recipe doubled or tripled usually and freeze them in individual balls or pattie shapes.I also keep receipts for everything and plug it into an ugly spreadsheet so I can see just where the money is going and how I can trim it down for next time. Also writing down each ingredient lets me know if I can get it cheaper at a different place  theres an Aldi right near the market and a Woolworths near my house so wherever its cheapest its not far out of my way.I know Ill break and order fast food occasionally so I try to keep it around  when I do to not break my budget too badly. Dominos has a lot of orders for cheap pizzas especially with the coupons posted on OzBargain constantly. KFC and Hungry Jacks both do cheap student meals for lunch although theyre pretty small. Theres also places like Shanghai Dumpling House in Melbourne where you can get a plate of  pork dumplings for !I dont have a lot of money saving tips outside of food though! Trying to get into the habit of turning my computer and other devices off overnight but its hard to break the routine after this many years.,AUfrugal,cgzrb6s,8,t5_2xjsb
