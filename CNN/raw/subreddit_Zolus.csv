I also want to get rid of all the hackers in the server to make the community fun. I plan to be playing for quite a while till about AU players get on so around  AM to catch all the hackers I can. Also I think I would bring a big game of Screen Sharing and such since I am really experienced with it! Anyways I would love to become a staff member on Zolus to be a friendly staff help and get some Ezpz Bans. I am going to be recording a staff series if I have permission and a regular hcf series on Zolus. But anyways I would help out the staff and do anything and I mean anything to help out the server and I want to be staff so I can get that rush when I get to talk with the staff members discussing things like bans reports and other things. That was my favorite part having a group discussion of it I dont know if that is allowed it here but it is a big deal to me.First reason I want to become staff is because I can do a lot of support rooms and help everyone that needs help. I know the support rooms fill up time to time and having me on team could help the support rooms get helped quicker because I will be willing to help everyone I can assist. Second reason is because On other servers Ive seen recently that little staff are on during the night time and having me could help watch out for the people abusing the chat violations exploiting glitches or even hacking their butts off. I feel having me on the team could help remove all the toxicity from the server IF ANY and make it a family friendly environment.Last reason is because Im wanting to help out this community and help it in the future for it to strive as a community and stay on top of HCF servers!!Experience Yes I was Mod on AuraHCF I resigned to the plugins having backdoors then I was Helper on HydraHCF Resigned on map  due to other toxic helpers I Was Admin on The ConaxPvP Network  Was demoted for not paying them money to help with the hostingPracticePots Shutdown due to no moneyZentoHQ  Changed from hcf to prison and skyblock so resigned and DakroHCF Resigned Due To Server Dying.Are you currently staff on any other server No Why do you want to become a staff member on Zolus  I want to become a staff member on Zolus because I want to enforce rules that a lot of players will hopefully not be breaking.

I am  years old and I love being on my computer. I am probably on my computer  the day. Even though thats a little nerdy I would still take time out of my day to do other things. I look into hackers and provide sufficient evidence every time. I record them and If it is not blatant then I do SS them! I love the way that this server looks and I will hope to dedicate a lot of time into it. I do also help a lot of players in game if they dont need like help from staff. For example What is the Map Kit? and then I just reply with P S.,Zolus,d5akg7t,1,t5_3e4h0
