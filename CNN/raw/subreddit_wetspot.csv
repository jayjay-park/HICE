6702205,0,t1_d0ck422,Thank you!This subreddit is night mode compatible now! The newer new CSS that I put in today allows full night mode with the exception of a small bit of whitespace in comment threads on RES. Try it out and let me know if you see any bugs. Thanks again  ,wetspot,d0ckdw3,1,t5_2tgjo
