1345274,0,t1_cikxk7b,Im not familiar with kerosene I havent used it.Ive used liquid paraffin lamp oil and white gas those are the only fuels Ive spun with on my staff so far.  I like white gas because its very volatile which means that you can get big fireballs if you dont spin off completely before lighting up.  I also like it because you can pretty easily get the vapors to light up with a flash when you sort of throw the wick at something like the ground or a wall or your hand and then suddenly stop.  Its super fun and people seem impressed by it.Liquid paraffin is definitely safer because its not volatile at room temperature so theres no danger of lighting up the vapors off a pool of it.  That means you cant do ground flashes or ground trails or any of that cool stuff but it also means its probably not going to keep burning if it transfers onto your skin.The reason that I like white gas so much though is that its really really not smokey compared to other less volatile fuels.  It burns fast and hot and bright and clean and you can breathe easily the whole time.  DThere is a big long thread at Home of Poi on the merits of different fuels if you like  ,firearts,cikyjk7,1,t5_2qmrv
