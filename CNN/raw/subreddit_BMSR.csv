I dont know if this is unique to me but I get a sort of metallic or iron like taste in my mouth when I take some LSD. Also the chemicals of the drug lighting up the lemonade idk. He becomes so high with his friends the lemonade washed his friends and face away. I was tripping really hard when I heard this album for the first time and these were the connections I was making lol.,BMSR,d5bcbjb,1,t5_2ui4l
