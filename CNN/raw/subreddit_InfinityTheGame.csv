548005,0,t1_cg0f03b,I think the new Tomcat is pretty sharp though Id have preferred a pose that was a little more differentiated from the current Engineer. Im also not sure about the new CombiFlamer design compared to the old ones not a fan of the new Nomad guns in general especially with them packed into the same box.I dont think Tomcats are really box set material either but it sorta follows my theory that most units will eventually be switched to box sets aside from various Personalities and special weapon blisters. However good on CB for offering the new model and zondcat as a separate blister for a few months.As for the Zondcat... Yeah that to be one of the worst unit designs in Infinity. Maybe its supposed to be a childs halloween costume rather than an actual Zondcat  Almost as tall as other infantry rather than other servants female body disproportionate arms and shoulderpads head that looks like a cheap party mask and crazy large turbine pack compared to Tomcats lack of jump packs cause only combat jumpers need them.,InfinityTheGame,cg2kc0y,3,t5_2ur7w

They are probably not the automatic powergamer choice in N because of the TO camo balancing and the HMG balancing.Jotums have a flamethrower too but have a D.E.P. instead of a hypermag cannon and ridic. armor.I got a Cutter because I liked how it looked the most and have a thing for TO camouflage.

4543149,0,t1_ct37718,If youre intending to play the two factions included in Icestorm then that is definitely the way to go. You get two Starter Boxes  extra miniature not available outside of Icestorm for each starter plus terrain dice tokens a template a good set of introduction missions and a short measuring stick. All of these components are paper except the dice but are still worthwhile when starting out.If PanOceania and Nomads arent what you want to play then youre probably better off skipping Icestorm and buying army starters separately. Then you can buy  packs of the terrain packs which also come in the Hephaestus style instead of the Mototronica if you prefer. Note that outside of Icestorm the starter packs arent meant to be balanced but proxyinglistbuilding will help with that. ,InfinityTheGame,ct3ahlp,2,t5_2ur7w
4656819,0,t1_cthj6vm,Any of the starters should work but it definitely helps to follow the same progression in learning that Icestorm does not that thats possible to know without its book. Basically start out with the  basic line infantry for core mechanics and then add one additional troop to your arsenal with each game so you can slowly learn all the abilities individually while strengthening on the usage of those introduced previously.Definitely not a game to just dive right in with everything unlocked all at once.the various faction starters should however be seeing resculpts in the next year  at least according to the primary rules writer at last years Nova Open.

6131385,0,t3_3zcxs7,My favourite thing about the Knights of Santiago is how easy it is to convert them into Hospitallers. I kid I kid But seriously though they seem to be struggling to find a place to be within the MO sectorial not to mention PanO as a whole. In comparison to the other knights they dont have much to help them stand out Hospitallers have a diverse set of loadouts including the highest wip doctor in PanO Teutons have a cheap and efficient loadout combipanzer combined with good stats berserk and courage. and Montesa are reliable enough with mechanized deployment and the lack of frenzy compared to other knights Sepulcher on the other hand are different more of a special tool than a line trooper like the other Knights try to be. Santiago knights however fall short here because they cost more than comparable loadouts within other orders while also having a worse statline. Such as the boarding shotgun costing  more points than the Hospitaller one and the spitfire costing  points more than the Teuton version. Realistically what the Santiago need is probably a drop of  points across the board and at least  ph to put them in line with the other knights Father Magister Hospitaller Teuton Sepulcher only them and Montesa knights share their ph . Another option instead is to instead solidify their fluff role as boarding action troops and as such give them a loadout more in line with that purpose. As such a profile akin to the father knight with an assault hacking device and demo charges could fit into this role or maybe another profile with nimbus grenades.Stats  Gameplay  As far as their looks they stand as the only box set of order knights currently available and as such they do look great. Their poses are dynamic and the flowing tabards look great with the best looking one in my opinion being the spitfire model.Aesthetics  Ultimately they have the potential to be a great unit with a cool close firefight role shotguns emp and  visors but lack either the statline or options to really make that role work for them. As such its hard to justify ever taking more than  if even than in a list as they hold up poorly against the other knightsOverall  ,InfinityTheGame,cymkp02,3,t5_2ur7w

It helps a ton if the basic structure of declaring first short skill incl. movement  declaring ARO  declaring second short skill incl. movement  declaring ARO  Resolution  Effects is clear to the new players from the start. Everything else builds on that and if they are confused about that sequence they will make crucial mistakes even if they can cite every special rule in the book. Be strict about when short skills are declared and when the rolling and measuring is done.I would also make sure that you get in a small fullrules game soon after the demo missions. While the demo missions are a great introduction tool the rules are or may feel a little restrictive.

I usually water it down so that few layers will cover primerother paint. When glazing quite a bit more. Watering it down to a point where single layer covers primerother paint will usually be sufficient. Different colors and paints have different coverage so they amount of water will vary. F.e vallejos golden yellow ? is pretty runny on its own and does not cover shit.Edit I also use identical wet pallet.

Because the range is within your hacking area so to get close enough to effect the repeater with this attack with the goal of disabling the repeater you are also within the repeaters range. If you are the subject of a hacking attack through the repeater and decide to go with Blackout youre giving your opponents hacking attack an unopposed roll essentially since youre not opposing the hack your attacking the repeater. The best way Id see using this as an ARO vs a repeater would be if whatever the repeater is attached to is doing something other than hacking and has performed its actions in such away that a hacking attack would not be viable for it. I.E a move  move to get into position and the repeater remote comes into your hacking area during the second part of its order.  ,InfinityTheGame,d6l313c,1,t5_2ur7w

8687329,0,t3_4ywl7y,As others have said the overall army list for each faction is pretty well balanced against one another. However in a competitive game and especially in ITS I would say listbuilding is still a very important consideration. Much like writing your list after knowing the mission terrain and opponent in a casual game well technically by the rulebook terrain is supposed to be set up to player agreement after listbuilding the best players usually write their two tournament lists in specific consideration of that events set of scenarios the type of tables expected and even in anticipation to what they think the other top players might be bringing. And metas canwill vary widely both at the local and higher levels.Tactics more specifically efficient activations are of course very important. But your list is your toolbox and impacts how efficient your options available will be to tackle any given situation. That said if youre not looking to take first most lists can still at least be made to do well enough to some degree.All that is why netlists arent a thing and many players are very unlikely to even use the same list twice aside from there being a lot of fun options they want to try out anyways. Also why it can be very difficult to give specific accurate advice on the internet. As more often than not Your Mileage May Vary is a huge understatement in Infinity. As for Morats generally speaking IME they can be a somewhat unforgiving army to play with. Their toolbox can feel a bit limited because they preferare designed for a more direct approach and outlasting the opponent in attrition. Thats not to say they dont have some tricks still up their sleeves just usually not as many as most of their opponents will have.,InfinityTheGame,d6rjkm8,4,t5_2ur7w

9530728,0,t3_5beetz,Proxies are common.  Most people would not even thinks twice about it.  Never heard of the concept proxy base before however.Infinity uses a lot more terrain that other games.  Larger than regulation bases could be problem.  If you cannot fit your models on the table or into the terrain you could slow the game down.  If the base is marginally larger this should not be an issue but do not go overthetop with decorative bases that are impractical in gameplay.Check out the REALLY basic rules of Infinity and you will come across silhouettes.  Every unit has a standardised size whereby the look of the mini is  irrelevant to the rules.  There are official minis that are larger than their silhouette!  Because of this rule you can convert your minis to look like however you want and it has no mechanical effect.  You might not want to go crazy however.  If you so heavily convert that every single action requires your mini replaced with the silhouette marker you will slow the game down annoy your opponent and make the look of your mini pretty irrelevant.,InfinityTheGame,d9nv2h2,4,t5_2ur7w

The only difference is that you get  Pano and  Nomads model in Icestorm that are exclusive to the Icestorm box and and dont come in the starters or outside of the Icestorm box.

I noticed that when selecting Bran Do Castro the Infinity army builder specifically says SPECIALIST OPERATOR. Im wondering does any model with a hack device count as a specialist or how can I tell which models are specialists? Also do you think corregidor Algaucils models could pass as Bakunin moderators in the long term? Also I just made this list I would love for you to break down for me why it wont work what its great weaknesses are if youre willing to keep wasting your time on me! Also is there a way to designate Link teams in the army builder? Or is that a fluid thing during the game?
