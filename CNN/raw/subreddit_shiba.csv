598830,0,t1_cg8bfvs,My pup has the same issue! She would lick all of her paws and scratch her muzzle until they were raw and bled! We did the allergy blood test ! that was suggested by our dermatologist and it came back negative for everything!! Shes currently on a duckbased food diet but doesnt seem to have helped. We did everything you did wipes after walks shampoos no treats etc. but it didnt reduce the itchiness. My pup is currently on a steroid pill. The vet prescribed a full pill everyday but Ive been experimenting with just half a day and it seems to be just enough to stop her from scratching until she has to take it again. Do you know what your shiba is allergic to exactly? Our vet suggested to do a more definedregional allergy test but Im hesitant since the other one came up negative for the most common allergies. The pills are good for now but I am not sure of the long term implications. Im glad to hear though that your shiba is doing well!! ,shiba,cg8c9nv,1,t5_2s5ny

1344184,0,t3_29fobt,There arent Shiba specific adoption centers within a five hour drive from where I live but we were lucky to have two breeders within an hours drive. I called both breeders and one was currently not breeding as she was recovering from a surgery and other breeders were caring for her stock. The other breeder was Frerose Shiba.  Aside from a great show record they were akc breeders of merit. I visited several times asked loads of questions and eventually decided they were the breeder for us and that we were a good candidates for one of their puppies of course.  Admittedly they were a little hard to get up with and had a brusque Yankee way of speaking that requires some getting used to but overall Ive been very pleased with the experience. Sif is healthy well tempered and was already create collar house and mostly leash trained when we brought him home.  We were in talks to get a second puppy but a sudden move has delayed that.  If the apartment complex im living in now changes their pet policy they dont allow pets under  year of age then well definitely get another from Frerose.,shiba,ciku4bk,2,t5_2s5ny

1682540,0,t1_cjr8gtj,If it is a reputable breeder than they wouldnt be lying but when it comes to sesame and red colorings that is kind of hard to fully determine when they are this young. However if the breeder is good about keeping track of their own stocks genetic traits they should have a pretty good idea of the coloring. Where is the breeder located? If it is in the midwest...I would be slightly cautious a lot of puppy mills out in that area. But if they have a website and the pups are AKC certified which doesnt entirely mean anything but it costs the breeder to be a part of it so tends to make them more serious as a breeder. Another red flag is if a good chunk of their current pups are pintocream nonstandard colors.While I personally think the idea of standard colors is stupid since all the color variations we see are naturally occurring colors many are decently recessive so bad breeding will bring out those colors a lot more often. Pintos creams etc are still healthy dogs if the color occurs simply by pure genetic odds.,shiba,cjr8wmv,3,t5_2s5ny

2340376,0,t3_2m438u,I got mine from from the site paid  for him. Kai is amazing. Im usually apathetic to things in general. But him Ill start looking at things to buy him when Im supposed to be working or Im on here trying to cure my shiba withdrawal by looking at pictures of other shibas he doesnt get jealous.At six months old and only having him for about a month next week he is awesome. There is only one problem with him and its more of my living arrangement I cant leave him in the crate without pissing off the neighbors with barking. But he is so awesome that I can let a puppy stay out all day on his own and everything is just as I left it.So in terms of temperament general health and personality Id say I got a winner with the exception of crates.As for my experience with breeders it was something like this.I found a set of breeders on the Shibas AKC site and reached out to each one. Some responded some didnt. I wouldnt try email as some just dont respond in my experience. Once I found Kais breeder we chatted for a few hours. She informed me of the down payment and the contract I would have to abide by. She still had a  month red on hand and I scheduled time to go out to the breeder. Her philosophy was if the dog doesnt like you or wants nothing to do with you you cant have him. For example I wasnt the first person interested in him from what Im told. There was a couple before me and he did not take any interest to them. With me once he got his burst of energy out and calmed down he began playing with me. Although I some what attribute this to the fact that I had IHOP prior to visiting the breeder.So I did a meet and greet with Kai and his parents. Got to see the yardfarm the breeder had. She had another litter of  red that were a few roughly  weeks from what I could tell and some black and tans that were just born. They were all kept inside the house. We then talked about the breed and more and then got specific to him and his parents. I was able to pick him up without him squirming he was fine with me messing with his ears his paws he didnt mind. Note with playing with paws they might think its more of a game instead of just letting you touch them. So they might nibble or mouth your hands playfully. But they shouldnt straight out bite you or back away. She went over basic care such as brushing bathing feeding nail care etc. Then over the contract down payment pedigree info health certs hips knees eyes for the parents and all the formal stuff. That was the first visit. Second visit sign the AKC stuff contracts paid the rest and took him home. Gave me a comfort toy instead of a blankettowel a few days worth of food an extra toy some reading material and more.,shiba,cm0zemf,2,t5_2s5ny

You might want to keep them separated a bit more even when you are home to help Hachi adjust to the new surroundings.It is going to take time. Could even be up to a year. But Hatchi is still pretty young so highly doubt it.Just be sure to give them treats around each other be mindful of any food aggression keep interactions as pleasant as possible giving Hatchi her space and just wait it out!Also be mindful that you have  female shibas which mght mean a few more little fights. Females can be more reactive and since Nami is still a puppy she might still have some bad puppy playing manners that Hatchi will react to  and try to correct. Female shibsa are far more prone into getting pissed off easily and correcting unwanted behavior. That doesnt mean they cant be friends and live peacefully but do be mindful of it. EDITWent through the same thing when we adopted out Kai ken. It has taken about a good  months before Kiba started to actually play with Taro. They still arent super buddy buddies though Taros little heart explodes anytime he pays attention to her but I think in time they will be good snuggle buddies and such. Kais are harder to rehome than shibas though.,shiba,cvydhm4,4,t5_2s5ny

5484990,0,t3_3ppcss,Leaving the leash on in the apartment didnt work with my Shiba either. Short walks are what did it. And when I say short I mean walking to the end of the street turning around and going home. Wed do this for a few weeks and then built up to walking several blocks and now he adores walks. It took a very long time for him to trust the world outside. Primitive breeds take a really long time to build up trust. You just have to keep working on it because once they trust you its seriously is the most magical thing  Yes I realize how dorky that sounds but its so true.,shiba,cwcrbce,1,t5_2s5ny

One that can be detected via the skin scrap another was one that is really hard to find and needs to be sent to a specialist for testing. I am not sure if they check for mites when checking for mange.Also I would contact your breeder once you find out especially if it does end up being something genetic. Your breeder should have at least had a  year health guarantee but good quality breeders have a lifetime guarantee from genetic diseases and should help with the vet bill.,shiba,cxqj22j,1,t5_2s5ny

Puppies shiba or not require huge sacrifices of time and money and a lot of people most I would say do not know what they are getting into. I also cried multiple times with frustration because I was so stressed out at the beginning  the first time he ran out of the house when he acted out after I had a long day of work etc. Good luck with your dog!

6592601,0,t1_d00n9wk,I suggest doing timeouts in a different room. My shiba was REALLY bitey as well. I did timeouts in the bathroom so that her crate stayed a positive place. It actually worked out better because the bathroom was already negatively associated with baths and I can close the door to block her view completely AND would turn off the lights so it became an even worse place for her timeouts.I would only leave her in there for about  seconds. Anytime she would nip our hands I would immediately stop say TIMEOUT and immediately put her in there. When I take her out I usually continued playing with her but would put her right back in when she started nipping and usually increased the time by  secs.It really only took about  days of consistently doing that to get her to stop mouthing us completely.We do NOW allow mouthing because weve gotten her down to a very gentle bite but it took us to get her to stop completely before we trained for the gentle bite.,shiba,d0189aa,5,t5_2s5ny

6911568,0,t3_4abrdd,did you try cleaning off the smell of her poop and urine inside and the porch maybe just constantly take her out until she goes or I heard I think pumpkin makes them go.my shiba puppy is really good bout going outside ofc he made some mistakes so we made sure he never goes out to the living room by himself cuz that a huge sign he gonna potty indoors. I have no idea how our shiba gonna handle the snow it did snow the very day and after we got him but he was on a potty strike that day and refused to go by the time the snow melted cuz he was so scared and nervous bout our home and the car ride.Yesterday was his first rain outdoors its not fun for me cuz he took his time  a very long time to get used to it now he goes even during the rain.Make sure you give her treats and a very good praise when she does go outside so she knows that potty outside  rewards and its goodEDIT and yea like Jwallwalrus said Shibas are very very very picky on where they potty I know mines has very specific areas he goes and while im trying to get him used to ppl passing by and other ppls dogs we live in a apartment if they are at a certain proximity he sucks his poop in and we have to walk all around the area once they gone for him to poop again,shiba,d0zqwj2,1,t5_2s5ny

7925098,0,t3_4ntdzv,I use a cooling vest made by Glacier Tek. It holds two ice packs under the chest of the pup to keep their core temperature down. The ice packs maintain a steady temperature so its not to cold and last for about two hours in  degree temps. They recharge in  minutes and the liquid in the packs is non toxic so it wont hurt your dog if it leaks. The vest is used a lot my military and police canines.It is pricey around  but we live in Texas so I think its worth it especially in the summer months where it never cools down even at  in the evening. Ive noticed that it helps Nami cool down a lot quicker after the walks as well and we havent had any overheating since starting to use it. ,shiba,d46utwu,1,t5_2s5ny

8664417,0,t1_d6ofuir,I dont think they rescue shibas. If they did they would be listed in the shiba specific rescues under the shibas.org list or I would have heard about them since I work closely with a lot of shiba rescues. They would also pop up with some form of tax ID that all legitimate animal rescues have which they dont mention and they dont pop up in any search for Georgia shiba rescues.See my standalone comment. The breeder is not reputable.But with the skittish stuff that is to be expected with any shiba that is older. I am not surprised by that and it should be something that goes over as he adjusts. I think in your previous post I commented that you should expect  months for him to fully adjust and not be so scared. It takes time for shibas to build up trust and a relationship with a new family.From your previous post picture. I dont think he looks skinny. You should be able to seefeel your dogs ribs but not too much and a dip in their hips. It is also the summer and shibas look very skinny in the summer because of summer coats and their weight tends to go down because they dont eat as much to create some fat layer to help with warmth.Also with the vomiting to be expected with a rehome older dog. Our kai ken wouldnt even eat most of what we tried for a month he vomited like crazy had diarrhea and wouldnt drink water. HUGE adjustments can really wreck a dogs nervous system and also inturn screw up their digestive system.If he is acting lethargic or if there is every blood in his stool or vomit see a vet. I wouldnt be surprised if he lost weight. Again he is  months and that means his adjustment might end up being a longer wait because of his age. Be patient. Ive been there and a lot of people whove adopted or purchased shibas that werent really puppies anymore go through this.If you are really worried about his weight. Bring it up with your vet. They actually might say he is in a healthy weight. We were SUPER concerned with Kiba because he lost LBS in . months when we first got him and the vet was never concerned and even said that she thinks he was probably a little chubby because she liked where his weight was at once he started eating again and never put that weight back on.Quick Edit Everything youve mention seems typical and I wouldnt worry too much. So many new things are happening for this pup so he is going to be pretty scared unsure unconfident and a little depressed for a bit. If you have any concerns or questions feel free to reach out to me directly. Kai kens the other japanese dog I owned are the hardest to rehome of all the japanese breeds and we went through well over a . year adjustment so Ive got a LOT of experience in helping out a primitive breed and working with that.,shiba,d6oo5bo,4,t5_2s5ny
8665840,0,t1_d6ou5cn,Can be because they usually dont really advertise since they breed so infrequently.

11378868,0,t3_6290bb,We got our Shiba two years ago. If the weather is crappy and we cant take her out to the park to let her run she does get a destructive. Housebreaking her was a snap she almost housebroke herself. The mind game toys are an absolute must. We recently got her a Kong Wobbler and that thing is a godsend. They are very stubborn dogs mine has a certain direction she likes to take on her morning walks and she will dig her feet in if I take her in a different direction.We are in an sq ft apt and she is fine. I do wish we had an actual yard for her but I dont mind taking her to the park and for frequent walks. We didnt crate train her so she has free reign of the house all day. We are gone for  hours or so a day.,shiba,dflrxl0,1,t5_2s5ny
