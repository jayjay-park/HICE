You could bump up to an i processor instead of the stock i on the inch but I doubt it would make much of an impact.That means you really come down to more RAM and storage as your only tweaks. Id recommend more RAM gb just doesnt go as far as it used to but the storage is your call... neither would change the battery life in any meaningful way.,macsetups,crbcokm,1,t5_2tvx3

Final Cut Pro X is color managed luckily. I use Premiere which somehow is not yet color managed. Makes no sense to me as some of Adobes other Creative Cloud apps already are. The color space problems alone have been enough to tempt me into switching back to Final Cut. Learned how to cut on Final Cut and switched to PPro three years ago for the Mercury Playback Engine. Never a dull moment in the tech industry huh?!
