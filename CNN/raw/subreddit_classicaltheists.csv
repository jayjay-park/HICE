7812390,0,t1_d3tqgl1,gt Part of a premise being only possible is that it is not necessarily true... If a premise is necessarily true it would be incorrect to state it is only possibly true. This is false under PW semantics to be possible just is to exist in at least one PW and to be necessary just is to exist in every PW.  So whatever is necessary is a fortiori also possible.  Perhaps youre confused because in your explanation you rephrase the premise as it is only possibly true  but theres no only in the actual argument.gt it would follow exactly the same course if you changed the initial premise to it is possible for a maximally great being to NOT exist.Correct.  So either it is possible that God exists and therefore He does or it isnt possible that God exists and therefore He doesnt.  Part of the cleverness of Plantingas take on the MOA was that while it may not be rational to simply take God exists or God doest exist as a belief it seems reasonable enough to believe that God is possible or that God is impossible.  Whichever of those choices you pick runs through the MOA and leads to theism or atheism.  Plantinga himself IIRC explicitly does not attempt to prove the possibility premise though I know Pruss made at least one attempt Samkaras Principle and Two Ontomystical Arguments .,classicaltheists,d3u6e4f,3,t5_3eix6
