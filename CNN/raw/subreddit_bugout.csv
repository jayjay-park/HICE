I dont have anything against motorcycles but I am sure I would hurt myself on one of those and frankly I just have no interest in owning one.  Even having a bicycle choosing which route is still a conundrum.

Now imagine the weight of  filters!!!I mean the clip in one is great for a h bag when you are confident you can get back to safety after that time period. However if you end up in a longer scenario that filter will be used up in about a week and a half if you consume L of water a day.So in the end for a h bagGHB it will be really convenient but for an INCH bag you need something heavier duty.

You can still function adequately uncomfortable as all heck but you can function. A little freaky the first time your exposed to it but after  or  trips through a CS Chamber and its no big deal. The real reason for a gas mask imo are things like chlorine gas leaks natural gas leaks or something similar. A rag or paper mask wont help with these.Honestly there is very very little chance that you will encounter any form of chemical warfare and even if you did without training on what to look for and practice you will be dead before you ever get the mask sealed correctly.

10002483,1,t1_dbb935q,I disagree. I think more likely people are going to take advantage of the protest that are probably not involved and riotloot. I think both sides get blamed for vultures taking advantage of chaos to break shit and steal. Either way I think heres going to be some unrest. ,bugout,dbbcow7,3,t5_2s4l5
10169204,0,t3_5lk95f,Im a swimmer I wear goggles everyday. If you are serious you would want something like a speedo vanquisher without a tint more than Likley. The tint does a lot more on land than it does in water. As for protection they are really tough. I even used a pair in an airsoft war once. But real safety goggles are probably what you want,bugout,dbwqh5k,-1,t5_2s4l5

11747663,0,t3_67d8t3,Im against life boat rations in almost any form. There good for situations  where  youre sitting still and cant  cook or heat stuff up but those situations are limited.   Either go for something processed with a long shelf life such as an MREs or mountain house. Or do a little leg work and add a small cook kit and get some stuff thats easy to cook only takes water and has a few years shelf life.  ,bugout,dgrml03,1,t5_2s4l5
