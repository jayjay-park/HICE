That being said I would love it if you guys would take him off our hands for a rd or th round draft pick for a couple of reasons. Hes only got one year left with us and theres no way he would resign with us so it would be awesome to get something in return for him. Also I really like him hes been a great unneeded thankfully backup for us for the past few years and Id love to see him get a chance to succeed with a very good team in the Texans.Of course these are just rumors and likely nothing will come about but its nice to hear that there could possibly be teams interested in him. ,Texans,ceta2pa,7,t5_2s450

145619,0,t1_ceumr6c,Thanks for the input! I agree that if we get another semimobile QB who throws a low ball it will just be Keenum . which wont cut it weve already played this game and lost... serveral times. While I do think that Bridgewater is intelligent and can read a college defense I dont think that Keenum was a scrub in that regard. Ive never been completely sold on taking Bridgewater  when there are other nonQB players out there who are much better Clowney Matthews Barr etc.. So that being said it will be interesting to see what happens. I hope we end up trading down hopefully with Cleveland for multiple early picks. I think that would be the best scenario. ,Texans,cev0mjp,1,t5_2s450

The biggest arguement for your position are Ryan Roethlisberger and Flacco. Flacco had the an amazing defense and coaching throughout his career. Big Ben makes it work because he is HUGE and throws the ball fairly well and Ryan who played some very big schools at BC. Bridgewaters biggest games to date are a BIG win over Florida last year in the bowl game and a MASSIVELY overate Miami team. Besides that it was UCF and U of Houston.  ,Texans,cf1cwsi,1,t5_2s450

If you say you wouldve played your hardest and not worried about injury then your either lying or not so bright. Look at this like a business transaction. Currently he is playing for free but with the potential to get paid millions. But he gets paid ZERO if he gets hurt. What would you do? Do you risk getting hurt and jeopardizing a million dollar paycheck? Or play just enough to get buy without risking injury. Do you work your hardest every single day at work? So much that the boss has to give you double the work load just to keep up with you? I betting no. I bet if a camera was pointed at you I could find you slacking when its time for a performance evaluation. See you stand around and talk football with coworkers and share news you learned on reddit. Which is everyone does but thats slacking.. which is what Clowneys basically being accused of even after getting double the workload. I wonder what his numbers would be if he had only one guy on him...If your boss doesnt give you a raise or promotion then what do you do?

572103,0,t1_cg59uv2,Not saying dink and dunk is bad Brady Manning Brees but there are a TON of great dink and dunk passers in college. Not to mention those elite guys can chunk it when they need to. Even Peyton can hit people on deep routes in stride. Might be  yards deep instead of  like I normally prefer but it will be in stride for the receiver. Unlike Schaub who made WRs stop and wait for the ball while it was floating to themThat is a good read I disagree with saying the deep ball isnt important. Its not about the amount to deep ball is thrown its the fact that you HAVE to play more field therefore opening more holes in the underneath routes.When you truly CAN NOT throw the deep ball you basically get two extra men up on the intermediateshorts throws. I can honestly state that Ive never seen a bomb from Teddy. If it exists I just cant find it.I also dont know that Teddy wont be good. I just think he is far from a lock. His physical tools dont stand up to the number one pick to me. To the point Id rather pick up FreemanSanchez or Ponder for cheap and see if we can bring someones career back.

Anyway he talked his dad into keeping the  fastback if he could get rid of the rest...FOR FREE.  Even at free there was only one worth eyeing in my opinion.  It was a  coupe...complete car but rust in all the wrong places.  It would have just sat for too long before I could have done anything with it.

1732059,0,t1_cjx6roz,The risk to injury is so high thats why they dont have fully guaranteed contracts.For as hard as the players push for guaranteed contracts the owners are going to push back just the same. Even the awesome owners like Bro McNair Kraft Rooneys Hunts... they are going to push back because its a business. And they dont wanna lose money on an investment. Its a risky investment all the players.These sports have guaranteed contracts because there is a way higher chance of actually playing them out.I really dont think the NFLPA got worked over at all. They got rookie wage scale which means veterans can get paid more because you dont have rookies with pro bowl player contracts. They got a salary cap floor so you cant have teams sit constantly with enormous amounts of cap room. These teams have to pay these players.There is no way in hell there is going to be fully guaranteed contracts. Its just not going to happen. Every owner is going to be against it. I understand where JJ is at. And have no problems with him being like that. He wants to make his money and have security in case of something catastrophic.What I dont like is articles comparisons.

If not you can purchase a tailgate ticket but seeing as how you want to go inside you wont need to worry about it. Pretty much everyone is friendly. If you bring some beer or offer them some money most people will let you hang out  drink eat with them with out any issue. Most people here in Texas are very friendly. If you want the true Texan bar it would be the Texans Grille . Heres their info Address  Queensbury Ln Houston TX Phone  .        Im sure most people would have a better suggestion for tickets than I would. I have season tickets so dont really need to get too many extras through out the seasons. Only other tips I would suggest is enjoy our food. Its pretty damn amazing. Theres also a food truck park right outside of downtown that you should check out too. A quick google search should bring up any info about it you need. Hotels. There are a couple pretty nice ones between the Toyota Center and NRG Stadium so you shouldnt have any issue. Im not sure what to suggest though sorry.Other than that enjoy your stay in our beautiful city and our great state.

The fact that he is still leading his team throughout all of the interceptions and off the field adversity shows he knows how a locker room works.   Also he is a fantastic quarterback prospect if a team can groom him into an NFL quarterback and not the next Vince Young I believe he has a place in this league. Honestly who better than BoB to get him to work?  Petty has been somewhat inconsistent this year and just didnt live up to the expectations and I dont know about Hundleys consistency.

2682722,0,t3_2qqsh5,Nice post.  However I have several comments. gt Look at the situation in other teams around the league look at how the Bears are having issues with their roster the amount of money the Raiders have chucked away on underperforming old free agents need I say more... We can be thankful that Smith has not done any of that.Massively irrelevant and partially inaccurate. If we are going to judge him by his peers you need to judge him against the good not just the bad.  Instead just stick to his body of work.  gtThe Patriots most people can agree have one of the best franchises in the league the past decade so how does Ricks drafting record stand up against the Pats? Read this article to see more depth but in essence the Texans have a higher percentage of players still in the league  to  and around the same percentage of starters on their team. So is Ricks drafting record all that bad?There is a difference between making the team and producing for the Pats and the Texans.  It is a higher bar to catch on with a team competing for a Super Bowl every year.   gtFree AgencyThis leaves out the two biggest major mistakes.  Letting Quin walk and signing Ed Reed.  And not signing Manning.  gtTradesI agree with all this.  The Schaub trade saved his job.  gtFinding gems in the roughAgreed although this can be spun against him because we are routinely leaning on undrafted players and practice players because his first selections so often fail.  Rick Smiths seat is justifiably hot or should be. ,Texans,cn8r33b,5,t5_2s450

Im really not confident that the Redskins would draft a QB because their front office is all manners of stupid so I think Mallett would fall to the Jets. That said the Browns are in free fall at the QB position and the Rams have a huge question mark in Bradford not whether he can perform at an NFL level but whether hell ever return to form so both of these teams could hypothetically trade up for him.That said this is a rather silly post.

With a powerful arm and blazing speed Johnson is a major dual threat QB. CJ Spiller has looked great coming out of the backfield.

They wouldve been even smarter if they had listened to Andre Johnson and traded back the st pick.  Rick Smith couldve probably pulled some Kevin Costner Draft Day shit and got  first round picks for almost nothing.  I was against drafting Carr because at the time I wanted either Bridgewater or Manziel.  But I also think the Texans shouldve picked him in the nd round.

3620846,0,t3_31rzgq,Im a huge fan of Charlie Pallilo been listening to him most of my adult life. Ive learned to live with the negatives like his tendency to cut in before a caller finishes hisher thought and speak for a considerable time without reengaging the caller. I greatly prefer this tactic to the alternative lookin at you Matt Thomas where incoherent knownothings call in and are permitted to ramble and repeat nonsense because the host doesnt have the discipline to shut them up. I have on more than one occasion screamed What are you SAYING?! at callers who need to be put out of their misery. This doesnt happen with Charlie. Hes frank objective and fluent in English so he gets my vote.That said I occasionally listen to The Blitz on my way home if I want a more lighthearted experience. Fred and AJ are great radio personalities with fantastic rapport. One thing that drives me crazy about these guys is their implacable desire to demean fans who use the word we when speaking about their teams. They ALWAYS jump in with Who is we? Are you on the team? and then they share a hearty fedora tip and give each others butts a squeeze. They usually make for good radio though.Lets see in the morning I listen to Mike amp Mike or Dan Patrick to get my big picture national sports fix. I love Koch and Kalu for their football insight and analysis but Koch seems rather sexist and generally smallminded at times which annoys me.I know Im late to the thread but I love sports and sports radio and wanted to share my thoughts.,Texans,cq504oe,2,t5_2s450

As much as everyone has wanted to see what he can do including me hes not in the st team picture so far and his contract is only a  year deal with no guaranteed money.Hilliard is on a rookie deal.Blue is on a rookie deal.Grimes has been a good rotational back and should definitely be kept around while Foster is out and probably most importantly he is currently on a contract that is cheaper than Polks.Polk is the odd man out. Nobody rolls with  RBs. Even  is a bit uncommon but still practical especially with a guy like Foster who is injured fairly often.I would even bet hes gone within the next week.

No sacks but theres a ridiculous gif of him holding the edge with a single arm that sets up a JJ TFL.gt Who do you expect to make the biggest impact in Sundays gameOn your side Im worried about Olsen.  Our run D looks pretty terrifying and our secondary shouldnt have too much of a problem with your receiving corps.  But Olsen in the middle of the field...ugh.On our side whoever is under center.  Dont fuck up bro.Also JJ Watt.  He will wreck the game.  Its just what he does.gt What specifically are you guys watching forIs there a QB on our roster capable of coming in and not losing us the game?  We know we dont have a franchise guy who can put us on his back but do we have someone who can play just well enough to let everybody else win us the game?Also our running backs.  Without Foster were a totally different team and if one of them can play well it will make a world of difference.  I finally liked what I saw from Blue last week after a year of being frustrated by him and if he can keep that going this week it would be huge.gt Any key injuries that will affect the gameWere missing by far our best coverage linebacker Mike Mohamed.  Kelce capitalized on this.  Something tells me Olsen will too We also might be without Duane Brown our notquiteelitebutdamngood left tackle.  That would be devastating.Also obviously still no Foster.gt How do you feel about the choice to start MallettIm on the fence.Mallett played okay.  I know he marched us down the field and into the endzone but he also got lucky on several extremely questionable throws.Im a bit different from a lot of folks here in that if Hoyer can be a lowceiling highfloor game manager Im okay with starting him.I dunno.

5521731,0,t1_cwh5ydg,i honestly feel he came into the games excited and hopped up. he had  or  drives all year with some touch including his last one.  but most games he is throwing too hard hitting his receivers in the hands too hard so they drop it. Letting receivers tip it because he throws so hard. And also overthrowing and releasing late so the ball goes too low. I seriously feel like that is just his excitement and mental issues showing up on the field physically.  if he didnt have to worry about getting pulled every drive the job security issue all the BS if they babied him just a bit he can probably be more confident and play better. its just human nature and i see it all the time with MLB pitchers throwing wild. maybe im completely wrong but he had all the tools just not the confidence and mindset and that can be instilled in someone by a good coach and organization. which we apparently dont have. you cant teach hoyer to be cluch. keenum to grow. schaub to throw the bomb. but we coulda taught mallet to wake up early and knock off the meth and calm down some. dude was basically vibrating he was so worked up all the time.,Texans,cwhg8tn,3,t5_2s450

5532102,0,t1_cwil5p2,Ill add Bill Kollar to the DC discussion.  Think about it.  He was the ONLY position coach not fired when Bill took over.  Our defense the next year with him as Dline coach ROCKED.  Watt tore it up and Crick looked like a starter.  He gets let go and our defensive pressure goes to shit.  Where did he go?  Denver.  Hows their defense doing now?  BETTER THAN FUCKING EVER.  He deserves consideration.I wouldnt trade for a TE.  Check out overthecap and youll see a LOT of talent available this offseason.  I shouldnt weigh in on QB since everyone knows my philosophy there but I really liked McCarron and with Dalton tearing it up I bet we could get him for a th rounder.  He played well under pressure and put up good numbers in college.  Looked pretty damn decent in preseason too.I would prioritize OT though Lamm didnt look bad so maybe not over WR.  I like our developing rookies Strong and Mumph.  Brown is  and after  we can cut him for no dead money.  Well probably be able to extend but negotiations would go easier if we have the depth.  Id rather have a big WR than a speedster to complement Hop.  Both Sanu AND Jones are up for renegotiation at the same time in CIN be interesting to see what happens there.EDIT Welcome to friends by the way,Texans,cwirw14,3,t5_2s450
5532287,0,t1_cwirw14,I love Bill Kollar and it was the biggest loss to this team over the offseason.  Its definitely an interesting idea to see if hes open to a DC position.  But my impression was that he was leaving to live near family and live out his twilight years in Denver.  But it is definitely an interesting idea.The idea behind the trading for a TE was the pursuit of other FAs and I love what Ive seen from Sims and think he is a hidden gem on the Dolphins.  But I am definitely open to the idea of a FA.  Im not familiar with your QB philosophy but I always saw a career backup in McCarron. But Im most assuredly not an expert.  And yes I agree OT should be a priority but Im also not a fan of reachin so having multiple areas of priority in mind helps with that.  I agree you need a big receiver opposite Hop and Im really hoping Strong can figure out the offense to become just that.  Ideally a large BMarshallAndre Johnson type playerHopkins and a Speedy WR with YAC potential would be the perfect combination with Mumph being your go to physical blocking short yardage WR.  The reasoning behind a true . . speedster is to keep defenses honest and keep the FS back.  I want one on ones for Hop and the defense spread out.  I love what they built in Pitt and its a copycat league. ,Texans,cwisqmb,1,t5_2s450

It was clear then watching Mallet prefuckup and now Hoyer they run BoBs offense much better. Texans aka Smith and BoB the two knuckleheads decided to roll with Mallet or Hoyer and obviously that hasnt payed off so far. And lastly none of the  qbs are thr answer long term hence they all having two year deals. Insert any of the  and they are still a stop gap until they find their guy aka another Tom Brady. ,Texans,cwyg4hm,20,t5_2s450

Hes been able to bring the best stats out of every QB that weve started since hes been here.. except Mallett but fuck that guy. Seeing that Bob already knows what Hackenburg can and cant do. Theres little guesswork there for him as to what Hackenburgs ceiling is. Same with Mallett which is why he was picked up. For all of Malletts lack of mental football assets he was pretty much a prototype build for a QB. Damn near the same measurements as Bortles and that was Bortles number one draft asset. So if Bob has a say in what QB we draft and we end up with Hack Ill go with his judgement on it. I mean hell he almost got us into the playoffs with Keenum. ,Texans,cx8ef0p,3,t5_2s450

Its pretty clear that Hackenberg wants to come here.Im not saying hes my guy because personally I want Carson Wentz.

Not enough people have stuck it out since day one and remember the comical laughingstock we were viewed as and dismiss his efforts in transforming is into a division winner while the AFC South competition isnt the complete joke it is now.Also I dont think the comment youre responding to isnt a complete joke and is worthy of spirited debate. Kubiak was crucified for getting blown out IN Foxboro while people give OBrien a complete pass after getting thoroughly beaten down at HOME by an Alex Smith led team without Jamaal Charles.

Its within these areas that we typically see a heightened crime rate.My story started with a newborn coming into the world in one of those areas.

It was a play I think DeAndre amp Braxton probably make but it was tough. It doesnt seem to me like Fuller will be able to create many catches on throws that arent there the way DeAndre does.

He does hold the run more traditionally than Watt which is why he isnt getting the numbers.

10465978,0,t3_5pv064,We need OlineSafetyMLBQB and could go for a returnerNTTEWR.Returner depends on BoB still liking Ervin. NT depends on Wilfork playing another year or not. TE and WR depends on is the value way too high to miss and the value of need positions too low.First round comes down to what is available. RS is known to pick the best value player to make a save first round and it works. But there is a chance we draft back from our first round pick to get more value again this and next year.I personally hope we go Safety in the first because I do not believe there will be a st round Oliner availabe. We will get a QB in the nd and Oline in the rdampth. In the th we will get a MLB and in the th we will go for NT.To pick Oline that late is a problem that is why I think we will trade out of the first round or with a team like ATL or NE. That could get us something like a nd and a rd this year and a th next year while giving up our position in the first and a th this or next year. With these additional picks it is way easier to draft our needs in a draft that is paper thin in the first round for the needs we have Oline QB. We could go QB and Oline as our first two picks and pick Safety and Oline in the rd. No we can use our th round pick for a MLB and our th round picks for a returner and NT.,Texans,dcufbf6,2,t5_2s450

10619472,0,t1_dd9x10j,Well as always Dylan I often look forward to stay season to see write ups like yours. But I have to admit I dont agree with everything you said.His arm strength is good but its not Ryan Mallett good. He can certainly uncork one when hes asked to but Im not sure I buy into the potential of strongest arm in the league hype. Its definitely a plus but IMO were talking closer to  than an straight  grade.I completely agree that his release is very good. And while I cannot stand how incredibly lazy his lack of footwork is I agree that this could be coachable. I also agree that to what degree that could be the case well never know as sadly we wont be interviewing him at the combine or pro day.However Im far less confident about his football IQ. And moving to a system where a QBs brain is his biggest asset Im not convinced that hell be capable of digesting the nuisances of BOBs playbook regardless of his GPA.Overall Im confident that if we draft him its because BOB feels that he and his staff can coach him up. And after all the access theyll get to him this offseason I trust in BOB and Rick. But the fact that he never looked like he was trying to fix his footwork or keep a consistent throwing motion does make me call into question how coachable a prospect he really is. I genuinely hope Im wrong as the league is better off with as much high quality QB play as it can get. But I just dont see it in Mahomes.TLDR I see a guy who has taken multiple years of QB coaching and hasnt been able to seemingly take swings at fixing poor footwork or his throwing motion. While I agree that his tools like tantalizing hes a lot closer to his floor than ceiling now and hes going to have to land in the perfect spot to get the time and quality coaching hell need to grow into something other than a project QB. He reminds me a lot of Brett Hundley in this way and as much as I loved Hundley at UCLA he isnt the guy who the team needs now.,Texans,ddbbgx6,1,t5_2s450

This is extremely helpful as it allows us to move every one of our defensive lineman around. Poe may be able to do this too and would be a great player to have but he is gonna want a bigger contract. Reader is on a rookie contract and gets the job done. Also have to consider the fact that Poe has had injury problems or the last couple seasons.

10941853,0,t3_5wah0j,I know Mancz played guard in college but what do yall think if they kept him in center and moved Martin? We have a known solid commodity with Mancz and Martin could maybe get some of his brothers juju.Mancz is built more like a center and martin is built more like a guard too. Would keep more elements of our Oline the same and give them more time to gel.,Texans,de8kplk,6,t5_2s450

11074109,0,t3_5y4853,Let him go. Sucks but it has to happen. Use the money for a FA RT. Draft  a new cb early. With the depth of cb they will not be drafted early. We may be able to get the first off the  board with the th pick. We got  good corners with jjo kjax and kjo Safties  in hal and dillion unproven.

11081706,0,t1_deo1enr,This CB draft class is pretty deep. Id draft a CB in the rd or th after QB and OT and hope we can start working them into the lineup this year. I forget where but I saw a report where one scout said that this CB class is so deep a th round CB in this years draft would probably go in the nd almost any other year. I think that if we dont resign Bouye our secondary is going to struggle a lot next year. We saw what happened last year to the Panthers after they lost Josh Norman. Their entire defense struggled after being a top defense in the league the year before I mean obviously losing Norman wasnt the ONLY problem but it was a big one. Losing a shutdown corner can have a huge impact on the rest of the defense and we can no longer rely on JJo and KJax not to mention Kevin Johnsons injury troubles. Obviously Im pretty hard on the resign Bouye camp. I think losing him will mean big trouble for our defense.,Texans,deo3nw1,1,t5_2s450

11083023,0,t1_deo0rce,Josh Norman looked like potentially the best CB in the league on a stacked Panthers D. Then he moves to Washington and falls off a ton. Not saying hes bad now but hes certainly not as good as he was in . Everyone was saying the same things before he left Carolina. Legit lockdown will work in any defense and then well...I think Bouye will be great if he stays with us and I dont object to keeping him if we cant make a good deal on offense. If his contract gets in the way of improving our offense though then we should probably let him walk. ,Texans,deo91gl,1,t5_2s450

11113580,0,t3_5yn7xg,I actually think thats an under rated need or would have been if we had kept Brock considering just how bad Fullers hands are.

11180467,0,t1_dezaehy,Maybe a book is asking too much of you OP. Maybe you should start with your own comments and then work your way up.gtHe fits Andy Reids mold for a QB perfectly whereas he doesnt fit BOBs mold at all. BOB likes pocket passers. Hes never brought in an athletic QB.Implying that Mahomes is a scrambler that relies on his athleticism instead of his arm. And Logan Thomas and Jamarcus Russell? Since when have VT and LSU been air raid systems? OP call  or your local rehabilitation clinic because youre either a having a stroke or b huffing a lot of glue. That all being said Id much rather have a strong armed Mahomes or Kizer who will both sit for a year preferably two and work on footworkmechanics. Also  sorry for getting off topic here  since when does Andy Reid veer towards scrambling QBs? Because he took the KC job after Philly? Ever heard of Donnovan McNabb? Probably not but Im guessing youll Google him see he is black and then post a comment reply along the lines of haha uFreshlySnipes you fucking retard look at his QB in Philly!

11265746,0,t1_df8y4vw,Sure we could. But we could also still be paying for him after hes gone with the  and  picks.
