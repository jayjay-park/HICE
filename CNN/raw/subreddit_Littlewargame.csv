1126279,0,t3_26wr1d,I like the dragons but now units can overlap it can be harder to heal a unit. If you select a group of units they will show up in a list with their respective health bars. It would be nice if it was possible to heal a unit by clicking on them in that list. This would it make a lot more easier to see who needs to be healed and healing them.Also could you sort that list on type of unit? Now the different types of unit are mingled on the list which looks cluttered. It would be nice to be able to see at one glance how much mana you have left how the soldiers are doing if the dragons need to be healed and go on.At last why do the fire balls of the dragons home in on their target? Was there a problem with collision detection or does it make the dragons too weak against micro?,Littlewargame,chwbd77,1,t5_2zy4x

2185571,0,t1_clhjs8g,this sounds like a problem with one of the players browser did not refresh all the game files. Can sometimes happen when new versions came out. Unfort. i havent found a  fix for this yet a good way is to always refresh the page f when you see theres a new version out so your browser reloads all the files and doesnt use any old ones.,Littlewargame,clhn0qn,2,t5_2zy4x
2795152,0,t1_cnlshi0,I see. You can make it have more damage but with less HP destroyable by a few rax units or a lot of workers and get them back to normal upgraded HP with the tower upgrade but I can see this is a hard one to balance. Anyway as I said in another comment here I dont think this is the most important thing right now when not even spells are working half the time.,Littlewargame,cnlsqzi,1,t5_2zy4x
