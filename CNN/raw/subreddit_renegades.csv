4824372,0,t1_cu1plhj,All you gotta do is be chipper and overenunciate like an absolute tool and find and stick to your chosen persona niche. Its worked so well for Jatt Krepo et al. Dont publicly disagree with anyone from Riot itself turn ingame chat off etc. Im sure you already know exactly what the deal is. You have a good shot at making  figures for  years the probable remaining lifespan of League but the cost is your soul.,renegades,cu2nggr,1,t5_321t0

6267987,0,t1_cz220ql,Yeah I agree the second round pick reksai kind of ruined the Mundo pick but I dont think there is a champion that counter Fiora yes Renekton out trades her early and pressures her a lot but she still reaches the late game monster whilst Renekton drops off it would have been nice to see RF play something else we know hes a good top laner he just needs to believe in himself more and go for skill match ups not just Im Mundo I dont die ,renegades,cz23mkt,1,t5_321t0

6389156,0,t3_436gry,Man this is so frustrating! I think the fans and everyone who supported REN are owed an explanation. The facts are that some imports are unable to play and others arent. It means some teams did the paperwork to ensure a working visa for their players while others sat back and let their players continue with a tourist visa...Anyway props to the managers for at least selecting good subs!,renegades,czfvptv,7,t5_321t0
6410513,0,t1_czib11k,Doing changes before the season starts or at the very start is always going to be better then doing it mid split or even mid season.

Youre a wonderful person your stream is fantastic and we all wish you nothing but the best in the future.Youve paved the way for more women to get into this as professionals. You cracked the boys club. That is an amazing thing.Youve been my favourite Renegade from the beginning and youre a great example to everyone of facing your fears and performing under intense pressure.

6569398,0,t1_czytrmm,Hopefully Crumbz and Alex are not untouchable. Sort of seems that way with all the changes look at all problems besides them. Crumbz should been a caster or personality at riot similar to what Krepo got. ,renegades,czytw64,4,t5_321t0

6594981,0,t1_d01c9hk,Im pretty sure RF has been ahead in farm plenty of times. He definitely was against Dignitas for one and he wasnt completely garbage in teamfights that game too. Why do I care if he can get a solo kill? Big whoop thats a very small amount of gold thats not going to help win the game since Flaresz macro game is terrible. He managed this in one game by the way and was irredeemably terrible in the other two he played.,renegades,d01h47e,2,t5_321t0

6893401,0,t1_d0mtuj7,But i still dont see alex as the problem. They swapped Remi cause it was too much pressure for her which is fine.   They swapped RF because he was just playing really poorly but to be fair he was always the weakest link of RNG fuck RNE   But why are the swapping Alex. he was the best performer. Crumbz is playing really poor and id rather see him as a coach. he fucks up every second game. He just doesnt work at all with the current meta.I know he is the main shotcaller thus hard to change. But its still better to change him then changing alex who was your topplayer,renegades,d0xoo7g,1,t5_321t0
