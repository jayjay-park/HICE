3201213,0,t1_cotosp9,Where did you get complex software configs multiplexing multiple external usb arrays from?A Theres nothing complex about LVM.  Ive been running LVM for the better part of the last  years or so.  And by going the ZFSJBOD route then instead of LVM its native to ZFS and I can add more disks to the pool.  With LVM then its pvcreate vgextend lvextend.B If I do go multiple its way down the line and to nitpick Ive gone eSATA rather than USB.  But I figured Id futureproof a little.C I dont see how Im asking for trouble?  Ive had two T drives in a Hardware RAID  sitting on the same server in LVMext was LVMext for a long while for the better part of  years without an issue.  I even had a drive failure that I was able to replace and have zero issues.So in the end the idea is to spend x as much on the enclosure for near minimal gain?  On top of which I use the file server for a few other things as well that go beyond normal NAS usage.Ive flipped the enclosure into JBOD mode and threw ZFS on it.  Aside from the elsewhere mentioned firmware issue which I wouldnt had seen unless I had gone this route seems to work like a champ.  I played with the hardware RAID mode and that had no issues either but JBODZFS seems a little more reliable and if I lose the enclosure the data is easier to get to.,storage,cotszv7,1,t5_2rgxx

4039780,0,t3_36r337,Ive used Pure in production and XtremIO in testing soon to be production.  I agree with you that they are very comparable products.  That wasnt the case until the most recent XtremIO software updates latest for replication prior for compression but at this point the features seem very similar.  Certainly look at the dedupe numbers for your specific workload since it will modify how much raw disk you need to purchase with any solution.  SolidFire wasnt doing FC when I looked so it didnt meet our needs.  Starting to be a bit out of date but there was a great presentation done by the SolidFire CEO comparing all three platforms.  Pure for us has been fantastic in production.  We had an EMC CX for the same workload prior to that.  Its largely a database right now with little VM.  All the great things that happened from that install you should see with any AFA.  Really fast database clones huge performance great compressiondedupe and near instant creation of devtest databases.  When we looked at platforms for an additional purchase we went with EMC lagely based on cost.  Many variables with cost but in our specific situation EMC was able to cut us a great deal.  I would have been just as happy to go with Pure.  Concerning ease of use EMC is more moving parts.  Another appliance for replication being the big one.  That may be good or bad for you depending on your needs for a RecoverPoint or for replication at all.  ,storage,crgrkk5,4,t5_2rgxx

However if youre unfamiliar with it its a bit of a task to learn. With Stornext you pay for a license per client . But the Xsan software built into MacOS will connect for free. Stornext is almost always used with fiber channel. Although technically anything with the SCSI protocol would work i.e. iSCSI but I wouldnt recommend it with StornextXsan. Also because Stornext relies on block level access and some other magic it doesnt mix well with VMs. So youre looking for the easiest way if youve got the money then call a VAR. theyll charge a premium but its easy.

Frankly I work for a vendor that supports both fc and ip so it makes no difference to me but I just see a lot less headaches with ip.
