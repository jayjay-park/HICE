7406978,0,t1_d2j7r5f,I expected some spillover from the EDM scene as a lot of the bassnectar crowd was present and a small segment of that community is notorious for their rail antics so i was ready for the worst but this crowd was nothing but respectful vibes all around despite the ridiculous spun antics.   I love how suwannee can just whip everyone into a mad frenzy of fun and ridiculousness.Im ready for next year. ,Tipper,d2k4ifi,2,t5_2ux4a

However I think the reason they decided not to do visuals is because most of the people attending the show are there for Pretty Lights and may not be expecting crazy visuals by Jonathan Singer Android Jones or DoubleU. All in all it is PLs tour I dont think its a bad thing to not want to upstage him.Either way I am excited to see the two PL and Dave on a lineup together. They are my top  favorite artists and I cant wait for this Chicago show.I also hope more tipper shows are announced this year. He is playing Luna Light in October LINEUP,Tipper,d3wxv4c,2,t5_2ux4a

9051151,0,t3_547x5e,I mean Daves application of psychedelic culture into his marketing is completely intentional. His earlier records had a very scifi feel to element to them. Broken Soul Jamboree is my favorite album of his mostly with his fascination with death and how close he has come to it many times.  Its a much more realistic look at death rather than the common neohippy perception of death from an acid trip they had once in college. This is all my own take on his music of course and my not be Daves intention at all. But thats the beauty of electronic music your take is just a representation of yourself.,Tipper,d7zsyrg,2,t5_2ux4a
