5959390,0,t1_cxzy1bb,Highly unlikely that the taboo gets eroded to the point where nuclear war is common. Its not impossible but it has less to do with taboo and more to do with selfpreservation. The premise of MAD is that its a loselose situation not simply a moral question. It also points out that due to the purely destructive potential of nuclear arms any use leads to a catastrophic escalation. Nuking another nuclear power leaves only one response mutual destruction. If the target doesnt also launch immediately they wont be able to fight back at all. In large part because nuclear strike logic is based on nullifying as many enemy warheads as possible by the aggressor in the st strike. The only defense possible is to fire them before st strike impacts as otherwise the nukes get destroyed or sealed into their silos and are useless. Similar for why nuclear submarines became and are so important as they are impossible to destroy in a st strike scenario. Gigantic nerd hereEDIT Also watch Robert S McNamaras Fog of War autobiography. Really explains MAD but also why MAD doesnt work. It isnt due to creep but because two rational selfinterested compassionate individuals can misinterpret each others actions and priorities leading to catastrophe. MAD works if everyone is perfectly rational but that is unattainable. It also cant be tested. We cant experiment with it so as a theory its not very convincing. Its why in my little blurb I phrased it the way I did. Its only possible to test MAD by observing another nuclear society.I always find it important to separate rhetoric from who is actually calling the shots. You will note that elite ISIL members dont go become suicide bombers thats an honour they reserve for more desperate and delusional people. ISILs leadership are warlords like any other. They have territorial ambitions material ambitions and rational selfinterest. What they spout is just propaganda to attract nihilistic thugs to their cause they also spout conflicting rhetoric about state building to attract the idealists and anything else they think will get them fighters. Their crimes are more wildly publicised but honestly for all their barbarism they only marginally outperform Al Shabab or the Lords Resistance Army and dont even come close to touching the atrocities of the Belgian Congo seriously look up King Leopold AlBaghdadi is a pacifist compared to that guy Communist Cambodia Imperial Japan Nazi Germany or the USSR.,Stellaris,cy0t1ya,2,t5_39cuc

6442860,0,t3_43xe99,Ive been following Stellaris since the Gamescon trailer.  Paradox is billing it as a x game first with grand strategy elements.  This means that the map will be randomly generated with a good deal of variables that the player can choose to modify the composition of the newly generated galaxy.  I believe Paradox has said that new players will start either preFTL or just beginning to be FTL capable so they wont have any idea of the other races so no starting diplomatic anything really or trade for that matter.What I mean by this is that itll have all of the usual X elements but with a lot of the Paradox grand strategy depth so where a normal game has a simple diplomacy screen.  Paradox will have modifies that are composed of modifiers from the players actions as well as things the player may not have any control over.  For example if you control a system they want the only control you have is to give it to them or keep it.,Stellaris,czlqc0s,21,t5_39cuc

Many could just show info for your own internal empire.

7029462,0,t3_4bwv2n,My two cents is that a lot of these governments feel redundant in that they are merely one of several interpretations of the ones already in the game by default.For example the Benevolent Dictatorship is an Enlightened Monarchy. The Warlord Anocracy is just a chaotic form of a Military Republic where people vote not with elections but direct support. And an Open Democracy is merely a democracy that uses the Xenophile ethos which is strangely absent from its Unlocks and the policy that makes aliens eligible for rulership.What I like is the idea of an AI goverment even though this could already be represented by the Science Directorate.Thats just my personal feelings on the subject though so of course you shouldnt necessarily feel disheartened. To me it feels like unnecessary bloat but I imagine there will be people who appreciate the additional options simply because theyd dislike reinterpreting the ones that will be there by default.

7031022,0,t3_4bx424,My first game will be a species of Reptilians. Which uhm I have written a LOT about PEmpire Name Varanska Zeskova  The Empire of VaranskaSpecies Class ReptilianSpecies Raksasa adjcetive is RaksasanCurrent Empress Empress Veeshis the thShip Prefix VZK Varanskan Zeskovask Kazara  It means Imperial Varanska NavyHomeworld Varanska TropicalHome Star System Valiska and thus they are in the Valisksa systemGovernment Type Enlightened Monarchy with a strong bureaucracyEthics Collectivism  Xenophilia  pacifism Traits Communal ConformistampnbspNow some more in depth details PBiologyThe Raksasa are the dominate species on the planet Varanska. Below is the general biological information on them so far.Physical CharacteristicsAs a reptilian species they are covered in scales. They tend to be brightly colored in the youth and as they age the color in the Raksasans scales fades from vibrent colors to dull. They average color of the Raksasa scales are green. However as it is not uncommon at all to have patterns in their scales one can find other colors in the scales of the Raksasa from white black blues and Red as a secondary scales but Green is the dominate color of the scales. Like all Reptilians they do shed their scales at a regular period most commonly during puberty but they do shed their scales throughout their life.Raksasa are a tall species with the average Raksasa being around  feet tall or . tall. They have medium size tail which they have control over. Similar to other lizards they lack ears but they have evolved to small holes on the side of their head for hearing. Similar to other lizards they have a forked tongue which they use sort of as a secondary smelling organ sensing familiar and unfamiliar places and people. They are an ectothermic species similar to most reptiles. Thus they rely on heat for energy. In the past many relied on the sun for their energy basking in the sun for energy. Of course with the advancement of technology most houses have hot rooms for such a purpose. Sexual diamorphismWhen it comes to the difference in physology between male and female Raksasa there are a few things to identfy the different genders.In general men tend towards being larger then females. Where the average female might be . meters tall. feet the average male is about . meters.. The scales tend to be lighter among female Raksasa then males. Both men and women have a cloacaBody LanguageSimilar to many other species the Raksasa use body language to communicate. Below are the common body languages and what they mean for most Raksasa.the tongue as the Raksasa have evolved with a long tongue similar to Komodo Dragons it plays a role in Raksasa behevior. One is able to signal and show many different emotions by how one flicks their tongue from anger to saddness to joy and love and so on.Tail The Raksasa have developed a number of gestures for using their tail. As they have control over their tail one can flick their tail to show anger or fustration love and lust as just some examples. ReproductionThe Raksasa reproduce sexually and give birth via Eggs. They are able to reproduce at any time of the year. The average amount of eggs a female lays at once is around  or . On average a clutch of eggs will have  or  females for every one male. there is a small period of about a week to a week and a half where the female holds her eggs inside her before she can lay them. After laying the eggs they take about  months. They need to be kept warm and incubated during this time. While in the modern day there are many inventions to help out this many Raksasan parentsboth the mother and father like to be around the eggs even in the modern day especially during the last three weeks before they hatch. DietThey are largely omnivorous and as such can eat nearly anything. from fruits vegetables grains to birds worms other reptiles fish and more. Though different regions of the empire have different opinions as to what cuisine is the best. GovernmentThe Government of Varanska is an abosolute monarchy with a strong Bureaucracy. At the top is the Empress who wields vast power over her people. She can appoint whom she wants to any positionnotably the First Consul create and pass laws at will veto laws of the senate and more. However both tradition and reality mean that she lets the Senate handle the day to day business of governing. Most of the Government is run by an intense meritocracy based bureaucracy. The heart of this bureaucracy is the imperial examination system. All government jobs require passing the exams with a hierarchy of degrees for more important positions. The imperial Senate requires all Senators to have the highest degree. The imperial Senate handles most of the actual day to day business of Governing the Empire. From making laws to handling appointing people to the various ministries it is in their hands. While the empress can do all of that herself she lets the Senate and their bureaucracy take care of itself. It helps that since the system has been established there is the tradition of the heir to go through the bureaucracy. This ensures that the future Empress not only understands the bureaucratic system well but she is regarded by her subjects as a properly educated woman. The system is one of the most obvious social mobility methods in the empire since what matters is your ability to pass the exams not race gender religion sexual orientation and anything else. Not for nothing have many praised the Exams for making things more equal among the Raksasa. The System was set up by the first empress Vesshis and her first Consul Krazaka to transform the militaristic society that existed due to the Unification Wars into one of peace. This has succeeded making the current elite not great generals but scholarbureaucrats. ,Stellaris,d1dbk2m,19,t5_39cuc

7406401,0,t3_4gre84,I dont think weve seen the AI offer any other than a small empire that offered to be vassalised... the Blorg are repugnant after all... but trading resources is definitely a part of diplomacy yes not tech trading though research agreements are the most you can get.gtIn Stellaris trade between Empires is a very direct affair. Players can create twoway deals lasting a set amount of time and our ambition is that most diplomatic actions should be available here as tradeable objects. For example you can offer another Empire a monthly payment of Minerals in exchange for Military Access and updated Star Charts for a period of  years or receive a vital supply of the rare Garanthium resource by offering a nonaggression treaty as well as a guarantee of independence should the other Empire feel threatened. If you want to simply gift or demand something you can leave one side of the tradedeal blank and the AI will react accordingly.The whole trade aspect of the game will probably get expanded in a future... um... expansion though Id bet.,Stellaris,d2k25dp,3,t5_39cuc

He also did produce a lot of interesting suggestions for the dev teams in the games he played enough to occasionally warrant direct responses to them.

Whenever you create and save a custom species you have three options for when they appear never excluded from the game occasionally random chance to appear in a game and guaranteed WILL appear in your game.So you could set up this situation by making multiple variants of humans and then setting them to definitely appear in your game.In multiplayer it goes without saying that you can choose whatever race you like so there can and have been multiple humans in that.,Stellaris,d2xciy2,3,t5_39cuc

Territorial and solitary most of them would not meet any other member of their species outside of mating season. Their intellect would allow them to devise traps and rudimentary farming to sustain themselves. Because of their natural strength and very short sleep cycles most Sangali had no need for an organized society being able to defend themselves against other predators on their own. For this reason early technological progress had been very slow isolated innovations only being replicated after raiding another Sangalis shelter and reverseengineering them. Rudimentary societies first appeared after the invention of metallurgy. The Sangali would trade with other members and with this contact came the first wars and the first chiefs. After that they would quickly find the means to go to the stars in search of more resources. Their current society is a meritocracy where each members wealth and power is meant to represent their ability to compete with the others. A council of the  wealthiest Sangali take decisions regarding the matters of the entire empire. Members of this society are fiercely competitive and as such only the most talented and ruthless individuals gain control of the various companies on the planet.,Stellaris,d2ymghy,1,t5_39cuc

7555499,0,t3_4is2st,The game is still very new and Id like to play around a lot more in it to be sure but my line of thinking is very different from yours. Since pops add negative modifiers to tech speed and since stations are cheaper than colony ships its advantageous to focus on mineral stations first and foremost. Edicts are mostly weak from what I can tell and the base influence cost of frontier outposts is the real bottleneck on expansion. Because sector controlled frontier outposts dont pay influence maintenance you can rapidly expand in every direction as long as you can assign one actual world per sector. Dozens of frontier stations can follow.

7555887,0,t3_4iqu0v,Stellaris is my first Paradox style grand strategy game and Im a bit confused by diplomacy. It just doesnt seem to do anything for me.I just cant get anybody to even consider an Alliance even the ones that have practically the same ethos as me.The majority of things I ask for in a trade put me at an immediate  acceptance and most of the things I offer them dont affect acceptance at all even if I offer it to them for free.Ive even rivaled another empires rival to gain their favor but that seems to just be a drop in the bucket.Am I just unlucky with Empires around me or am I doing something wrong? Do I just need to keep showering them with gifts?Ive also never been approached by the AI empires for anything.

Hyperlanes only usually give you access to one planet between arms making making a choke point. Theres still a choke point for Wormholes but its wider? see my diagramTheres advantages and disadvantages of both. Hyperlanes are quicker for exploration but you can build WH Gens any where so after some set up theyre both just as maneuverable but WH are instant.

7581883,0,t1_d33i504,CK and Victoria  to name my favorite two Paradox games were... ok but bare bones as hell at release especially compared to now.Remember in CK at release You couldnt play nonChristians including Muslims You couldnt play republics. Muslims were broken as hell under the AI  the best description of vanilla CK Ive ever seen is CK A Clown Car Full of Muslims. Byzantium had zero flavor text or anything to differentiate it from a regular kingdom if you could even play it I forgot. You were locked to a start at earliest of  when everyone that was anyone was already Christian or Muslim  Your map excluded everything east of the westernmost Iranian provinces. Pretty much zero trade mechanics.And the list goes on.As for Victoria  Youd hardly see major wars except for quasiscripted ones like the FrancoPrussian War or the Mexican American War because the nations had no real reason to without the crisis system. No real way to civilize as a nonWestern power aside from preset event trees Japan Bare bones popular movements that didnt really get anywhere I certainly never saw a communist or fascist revolution until at least AHD. Industrial production was buggy as hell especially for laissez faire economies. Colonization was a simple uninteresting process.Seriously the versions we know now compared to the ones that first came out are basically entirely different games. We played them because they fit a niche that other games couldnt and were generally ok. The same is true with Stellaris. Its bare bones to some degree but itll improve and most importantly its heads and shoulders above pretty much any other scifi x I can think of with maybe the exception of Distant Worlds which has massive problems of its own. Even then the difference is that I can expect Stellaris to improve but I cant really expect Distant Worlds to.And we cant really expect them to come out with all of that at release at least not with Paradoxs development style. Its insane to expect Paradox to have come out with modernday CK from the get go or the current version of Vicky . And then you have games that do try to include everything and its either a just as bare bones or b entirely broken because the  different systems they threw in there just simply cant be worked out within the development cycle of one game. People still complain about the diplomacy of Civ V and the Total War games are notoriously sketchy on that front. Endless Space and Endless Legend allow only eight AIs and still cant get diplomacy and trade completely right.Thats why Im confident about Stellaris and am willing to overlook its admittedly not few issues.,Stellaris,d340u5s,2,t5_39cuc

Sometimes if you build a mining facility you might discover something deep within the planet or if you remove a jungle you might see a lost city build a power plant and something might interrupt with the power generation. Or maybe too much mining can hurt the planets habitability or maybe accidentally terraform it in the long run.I kinda disagree with your idea on Tile Blockers that they need to get heavily tuned down I mean its there to limit the amount of progression and rushed expansion that you can do. and Its actually nice to gradually unlock the planet out of that natural state. and It gives progression to the planet aside from upgrading the buildings from I to II to III etc. BUT I like you idea about exploiting those tiles instead. Maybe jungleswildlife would give bonus to food volcanoes would give bonus to powerplantsover it or adjacent but there is a chance of eruption mountains give bonus to research etc.I agree with technology if you find like  tropicals and  ocean its logical enough that the empire would prioritize researching tropical colonization but as of the moment you might even get arctic colonization first in your research pool.,Stellaris,d352mex,1,t5_39cuc

7611956,0,t3_4jl0l0,gt Hi everyone!gt gt Well folks here we are again one week later The development team has mostly weathered the release jitters and nerves are starting to calm down. The ship we worked so hard on for the last three years has been successfully launched and is currently on its maiden voyage. The crew seems mostly happy but some of the inspectors have raised concerns about midship structural issues. As chief architect I am not entirely surprised but the reports will allow us to commence upgrades as soon as HMS Stellaris returns from its roundtrip to Alpha Centauri. Alright enough with the metaphor lets talk about our future plans for Stellaris!gt gt First off for those of you who are unfamiliar with our postrelease policies we will release a lot of expansions over the coming years. Each expansion will be accompanied by a major update for Stellaris these free updates will be named after famous science fiction authors containing a whole bunch of completely free upgrades and improvements to the game in addition to regular bug fixes. As long as enough players keep buying paid content for the game we promise to keep improving the game for everyone almost like an MMO.gt gt Now before we begin the expansion cycle in earnest we will spend the rest of May and June only focusing on bug fixes and free upgrades to the game. We carefully listen to all your feedback which has already made us alter our priorities a bit. As a veteran designer of our complex historical games I was anticipating a fair amount of criticism regarding the midgame in Stellaris compared to that of our historical games but I was more concerned with the depth of the economy than the relative lack of diplomatic options for example. I also find much of the feedback on the Sector system interesting the GUI and AI concerns will receive the highest priority. One area I was not at all surprised to get flak for is the lack of midgame scripted content however. We simply took too long getting all the early and late game stuff in and neglected a whole category of events called colony events which were supposed to be the bread and butter of the midgame for the Science Ships.gt gt Weve been digesting and discussing your feedback and how to best go about improving the midgame to make it more dynamic both in the short and long run. Lets start with our short term plans. When the game was released we had already proceeded to fix a lot of issues. Together with some other pressing issues that have been reported the plan is to release the . update  Clarke  near the end of May. We will try to cram as much as we can into this update but the more fundamental stuff will have to wait until the next update Asimov which is scheduled for the end of June. The Clarke patch will mainly be a bug fix and GUI improvement update. Here are some of the highlightsgt gt gt gt CLARKE HIGHLIGHTS  gt Fixes to the Ethic Divergence and Convergence issues. Currently Pops tend to get more and more neutral they lose Ethics but rarely gain new ones.  gt The End of Combat Summary. This screen looks bad and also doesnt tell you what you need to know in order to revise your ship designs etc.  gt Sector Management GUI There are many issues with this and we will try to get most of them fixed.  gt Diplomacy GUI issues. This includes the Diplomatic PopUps when other empires contact you but also more and better looking Notifications and more informative tooltips on wars etc.  gt AI improvements Notably the Sector AI but also plenty of other things. This kind of work is never finished...  gt Myriads of bug fixes and smaller GUI improvements.  gt Late game crises bugs. There were some nasty bugs in there blocking certain subplots and various surprising developments. gt gt gt   gt After that were moving on to the Asimov update and this is when we can start making some major gameplay improvements to especially the midgame. As you might have guessed we plan to add some new diplomatic actions and treaties. Another thing that struck me during our discussions is that the normal lack of access to the space of other empires makes the game feel more constricted than intended. It limits your options since you cant really interact much with the galaxy beyond the borders of your empire and you only tend to concern yourself with your direct neighbors. This is bad for your Science Ships too of course since they might not be able to finish some of the grander quests. Compare the situation with Europa Universalis where you usually have access to the oceans and can thus reach most of the world or Crusader Kings where you can even move through neutral territory with your armies. We also intend to add as much midgame scripted content as we can. Thus this is currently the plan for Asimov but its not set in stone yet so please bear with us if something gets pushed or alteredgt gt gt gt ASIMOV HIGHLIGHTS NOT SET IN STONE!  gt Border Access Revision Borders are now open to your ships by default although empires can choose to Close their borders for another empire lowering your relations of course.  gt Tributaries New diplomatic status and corresponding war goals.  gt Joint Declarations of War You can ask other empires to join you for a temporary alliance in a war against a specific target.  gt Defensive Pacts.  gt Harder to form and maintain proper Alliances.  gt More war goals Humiliate Open Borders Make Tributary etc.  gt Emancipation Faction. We had to cut this one at the last minute. Needs redesign.gt Diplomatic Map Mode. Much requested!  gt Diplomatic Incidents This is a whole class of new scripted events that causes more interaction with the other empires.  gt gt gt gt Past Asimov I cant give you any kind of specifics yet but I am currently leaning towards honing in on the following general areas for the Heinlein update these are not promises!gt gt gt gt CURRENT HEINLEIN INTENTIONS  gt Sector and Faction Politics We are working on a design for this. I always wanted to make Factions more closely tied to Sectors for example...  gt Federation and Alliance Politics As a player you need more ways of interacting with the other members push your will through and get elected etc.  gt Giving Directions to Allies and Subject States.  gt Strategic Resource Overhaul You should need these and search for them far and wide. They should be extremely important.  gt Battleship Class Weapons. Some Battleship front sections will be repurposed for an XL size weapon slot. There are currently four ship sizes but only three sizes to weapons creating an imbalance. Also Battleships should have fewer small weapon slots and have to rely on screens of smaller ships.  gt Fleet Combat Mechanics Formations andor more complex ship behavior is needed.  gt Midgame scripted content Guarded treasures midgame crises colony events etc.  gt Living Solar Systems Little civilian ships moving around etc.  gt gt gt gt Again remember that we need to be somewhat flexible when things dont work out or when something else takes priority so please take these later plans with a large grain of salt. As always we also listen keenly to your feedback so keep it coming!gt gt Now I am sure you are full of questions about the details but hold your horses it will all be explained in the coming dev diaries!Copypaste for those who cannot access the website.  Personally I cant wait for Living Solar Systems.,Stellaris,d37fu4o,82,t5_39cuc

Generally I have a pretty solid amount of time to get them up and running  sure they wont have every tile filled but theyll have the allimportant planetary administration and a few farms around it.It just slows you down but its far from impossible. It just stops you rapidly expanding.,Stellaris,d37n5bf,1,t5_39cuc
7614272,0,t3_4jl0l0,gtbut I was more concerned with the depth of the economy  Most people probably dont know too much games with an actual economy DWU is probably the best example how it can be done right and Im personally a bit sad that we got such a simplified variant of like a Civ V economy.  I hope a trade amp piracy update could overhaul this but this would require a massive rewrite of existing parts of the game so I dont really expect that to happen especially since I heard you want your games less complex now.  Still I loved the fact about DWU that I could have those poor smuggler infested shit holes at the far end of my empire.gtBorder Access Revision  This should be a policy  Open  Everyone can access can be revoked for individual empires in the diplomacy screen.  Closed  No one can access can be allowed for individual empires in the diplomacy screen.  Closed could be for the more hostile ethics and open for the more peacefully ones.  gt Federation and Alliance Politics As a player you need more ways of interacting with the other members push your will through and get elected etc. You can only interact in an alliance in that you have a vote like everyone else but in a federation you cant say yay or nay to anything the AI can if you declare war though? Or what is up with that vote area when declaring war?.  Currently I dont even see why you would want one at least with the AI. While the AI itself seem to be able to vote on wars the player cant the AI dont build or design federation fleets and generally as a player Im just sitting there doing nothing year after year because no one is doing anything.  Especially when playing a more peaceful empire that is strong youre never getting attacked no matter how much a rivaling federation or empire hates you.  gtBattleship Class Weapons.  Will they fit on a fortress?  Right now pretty much all stations from starports over defense platforms up to fortresses are seriously lacking. A fortress got only like k which is a joke even during midgame thats like  battleships at best.  I suggest to make them way way stronger so that you either need a doomstack or more than a regular sized fleet or a scissor for the paper to beat them.  You can steamroll way to easy currently when fleets are the only threat and considering the stupidly high running costs of the military stations they should do a much better job at actually defending your systems.But more importantly ...  PLEASE prioritize the game breaking bugs and bugs that kill achievements for some hotfixes first!  Certain achievements like Power Overwhelming amp Domo Arigato possibly more cant be done and it seems all three end game events can get stuck robot uprising doesnt triggers past a certain event the unbidden portal can sometimes vanish during battle and afaik there is another bug with the third one which I havent had happening yet.If we can get the stupid achievements done we could at least play with mods without worrying to go back to vanilla which makes the wait for the next proper update a bit less of a hassle.  gtFirst off for those of you who are unfamiliar with our postrelease policies we will release a lot of expansions over the coming years. Each expansion will be accompanied by a major update for Stellaris these free updates will be named after famous science fiction authors containing a whole bunch of completely free upgrades and improvements to the game in addition to regular bug fixes. As long as enough players keep buying paid content for the game we promise to keep improving the game for everyone almost like an MMO.  So first off this is my first Paradox game but that is exactly because of this DLC policy.  I was and still kinda am interested in Crusader Kings II.  BUT the damn thing currently would cost me  if I would get the entire CK collection EUIV sits at .  And yes I know I dont HAVE to buy every DLC but to me this is still part of completing the game. I wouldnt buy Diablo  without its expansion either and I also dont differentiate between cosmetic and gameplay affecting DLCs however the ebook is something I wouldnt care about which is still in the pack. I already see the billions of ship design DLCs and lets be honest the  we have are more than just basic or songs for the price of regular pop songs on itunes.  Please at least reconsider the price policy of your DLCs a bit there is no reason portraits or songs need to cost  or the entire complete game . This is a very stupid price policy to attract potential new buyers for those games look Elite Dangerous for example where the price of the Deluxe Edition is a fixed price of  no matter how many seasons have been released. This means the game will still cost  even in a few years the the seasons itself would add up to way more than  which means that new players arent scared away to even get into the game.  Im sure some money from people who cant afford to spend around and over  on a single game is better than getting nothing from them.  So done for now.  Downvote along.,Stellaris,d37pbic,-4,t5_39cuc

7624470,0,t1_d38rork,gt If youre the big man who overpowers the minors in the federation then they should be allies protectorates and vassals.Alliances run into some of the same concerns as a federation with regards to the conduct of war caused by the AIs general passivity when campaigning alongside a human player.  Additionally alliances have an influence cost whereas federations do not.A peaceful empire is also going to have limited opportunity to make protectorates and vassals since the AI is generally unwilling to accept diplovassalization upon reaching even a modest size.Unfortunately the current federation mechanic does a poor job at splitting the difference.  The presidential powers do help to get things moving but the rotating presidency rather than a voting one gives that absolute power to unworthy members however you choose to define it.  The AIs war conduct then leads to the frequent complaint of the space roaches declared a war they expect me to win for them especially combined with the apparent reluctance to offer nonwarleaders concessions in the peace terms.The archetypical example of a federation is obviously Star Treks UFP and that would be ideally represented ingame as a federation of generally small individual members with a continually reelected human presidency and large federation fleet.,Stellaris,d38v0x7,4,t5_39cuc

Sometimes you want to find a specific Pop in your empire say one that likes Arid planets for example so you can make a colonization ship out of them. I currently have  or so planets and probably  different species in my empire not including ones that have been genetically modified for specific purposes. A way to quickly search through Population without having to open the sector menu and scan each planet individually would be amazing. Like if I hit CTRLF it would open the Find Menu but instead of finding systemsplanets it could be used to search for specific parameters.

7668010,0,t3_4kbzr3,. I expand as soon as Im done building stations on everything in my current borders.  Sometimes if say my researchers find primitives or presentients Ill hastily throw up a frontier outpost to claim that system. Usually though I just try to time it so that a colony finishes and expands my borders around the same time that my constructors finish building the last potential station in my current zone of control. Ive yet to have any kind of trouble with researching due to populations but I usually play Intelligent Materialists so your mileage may vary.    . Usage of vassals depends on where their empire is where my empire is where the enemy empires are etc. If theyre inside my borders and I can afford to throw minerals and energy and colony ships for the uncolonized planets into a sector for a while I will vassalize them. If theyre between myself and an enemy empire I might just leave them there and use them as a buffer for a while. I usually dont bother to vassalize and just conquer. Again Ive yet to have trouble with research times due to populations  in my current game I even managed to overtake an advanced AI in terms of tech.    . Enslaving them forms a slave faction instead but Ive never seen the slaves rebel  I believe that was removed from the game at the last minute due to crippling bugs and wont be brought back until a later patch. So yes enslaving helps with that. Integrating just lowers the likelihood of people joining the faction but never below . A factions score needs to be in the negatives before it starts losing members and eventually goes away You can accomplish that through the integration campaigns in the faction menu as well making people happy. The way to make people happy aside from things like the Social Welfare Program edict and Governors is to just lower their ethical divergence into the negatives and wait for them to start agreeing with your laws.,Stellaris,d3dt4rv,2,t5_39cuc

7668828,0,t1_d3dw5jt,Thats only really once youve upgraded them to level .  I think the scaling might be the biggest issue.  Wormhole stations end up being as good as they are almost entirely because of the extreme range they have.  Warp is good early on because it has no restrictions.  Hyperdrive is good because of fast surveying and high speed military operations.  Wormholes are expensive but dont cost your ships power and can jump long distances including over enemy territory.  However once you upgrade them wormholes gain so much extra range on each jump that they quickly overcome all the advantages that the other two offered before save when going short distances between two systems that dont have generators.  On top of that starting with wormholes are one of the few ways you can get to jump drives.,Stellaris,d3dwhcf,6,t5_39cuc

Autocannons are semiinteresting for medlow slots. Given that destroyers and corvettes cannot be very effectively armor tanked and are unlikely to be so. This negates most of the armor penetration advantages of lasers and plasma weapons which they pay for with a loss of some  and  raw dps respectively. Given that they are thus likely shield tanked however makes disruptors that much more devastating  losing  raw dps for double dps on shields  a worthwhile tradoff if more than  of the target hp consists out of shields as any shield tank will have.

7850937,0,t3_4mtz29,Whats the quantifiable difference between a grand strategy game and a X game? I agree that Stellaris shouldnt become EU but paradox has shown though Vicky and CK that they can adapt the grand strategy formula to different time periods with different mechanics. When I hear X I think of a turn based game that puts balance and gameplay above realism and depth. The way I understand it grand strategy games are to Xs as flight simulators are to arcade flying games. I think I agree with you Im just confused by the terminology grand strategy is the depth that Stellaris desperately needs more of. A lot of the most maligned features the crappy trade and diplomacy systems are more similar to X games than paradox grand strategy games. ,Stellaris,d3yik6f,3,t5_39cuc

Im facing too many Empires to be able to effectively cripple their production rates. The empires bordering with me on the left hand side were the ones who ended up wrecking havoc on my numerous space ports.gt its also possible that your warscore is already too low for a win to be viable. the sector spaceports repeatedly getting destroyed makes this threshold lower than it would otherwise be and is something that has frustrated a lot of people.Pretty much I abandoned that play through already honestly I could drag it out to a stalemate and maybe even win but its gonna take way too long not worth it kinda.

Keep your ethic divergence in check. By that i mean that you are not allowed to have any positive ethic divergence on any of your planets. . Purging is fine but like with all good things dont overdo it. I found that when i demanded that a defeated empire has to abandon new autopurge war demand  planets the whole galaxy will hate you to eternity. If you make them cede  planets and just manually purge one planet every month or so its not that harsh.Even while having no ethic divergence on my planets somehow a very small portion of pops have slightly different ethics and thus get pissed when purging. But since they are in a small minority it doesnt impact the empire too much and after some time the debuff fades.TLDR Your approach is fine not sure about individualist just watch your ethic divergence like a hawk and dont purge en masse.

They all answer the question How do I establish a legacy? SciFi is typically more speculative. The most important question is What if?Take disease for example. You mention that in CK II it is a looming and devastating problem. That makes interesting gameplay in a historic setting but compare a disease to devastating SciFi. The Death Star. Grey Goo. Robot uprising. Unrelenting assimilation. Disease may be a crisis but its too mundane to play the same role as it does in CK II.Far more interesting is witnessing the way each society manages their health. A collectivist empire may take a survival of the fittest stance spiritualists may interpret heath as omens militarists may weaponize pathogens xenophiles may embrace it as merely part of life. To those ends health could be realized as a handful of events technologies edicts and restrictions.Consider for example how it impacts observation. Observation Posts like space stations might be outfitted with modules that alter the probability of a contamination event. But through the lens of science fiction the focus is on disease as a consequence of active observation not the consequences of poor hygiene.Id rather see depth explore the philosophical questions asked in the best SciFi  Who counts as a person?  How do we find our place in the universe?  Is there more to existence than what we experience?  What counts as a responsible application of technology?CK takes these questions for granted.

8475987,0,t3_4vso7u,  Well with big empires you dont really have choice u need to break them up into smaller pieces either by getting or liberating some of their planets untill they are small enough to vassalize.  purging can be done to all pop on a planet simultaniously but that would rever the planet to uninhabited if u dont have at least  different pop there. It is the only way to remove all pops as far as I know.  The way to slow their faction growth is to make them happy if you can get them over  i think the faction would disband on it self. Here is a list of how you can get a lot of happiness for your empire government bonus  depending if its the advanced form or not teldar plant  empire bonus leader with trait  happiness. maybe the best reason to have democratic government as it gives you really good chance of finding one of those communal trait   ethos buildings are probably the greatest source of happiness. playing something like individualist xenophobe militarist gives you  happiness from buildings. there is also an event you might get that that gives you another  from an empire edict. rather rare.The second part why their happiness is so low is differing ethos between you  and the maluses from your policies this brings. This is the main reason why you want to be able to have really high divergence modifiers in order to convert the pops to your way of seeing things. The happiness makes them not angry until you can do that so a combination of the two is AWESOME.An example build would beEthos            Spiritualist Militarist Individualist   happiness from buildings.Government    Theocratic Republic   happinessTraits             Conformists Sedenary Repugnant AdaptableWith this build when you get a teldar plant up and a happiness leader you get  bonus on all worlds. This means that in almost all cases youll never suffer factions. When they get converted to your ethos this would make all pops of foreign cultures to have  happiness with the  techs for  habitability and a frontier clinic. Use liberally the edicts for happiness and divergence on all newly conquered world to speed this process.And lastly lets not forget that high happiness gives you great bonuses to all production and divergence.Good luck.,Stellaris,d611geq,1,t5_39cuc

At this point I ws just rolling war to war and letting the faction unreast grow to push that .  Iwas settling everything warring nonstop.  It still took me several more hours and several more decades in game to hit that spot.

8847643,0,t3_51e3or,I think bioships should be an alternate tech tree. Think about it you meet these creatures early on and when you meet them they can take on one of your ships easily. Why wouldnt an empire try to use them for their own gain?!Say you can start by domesticating the Tyanki. You would be able to build a Space farm in orbit of a gas giant then you would be able to build space cows there. They would generate a small amount of minerals by themselves.Afterwards with the necessary biotech you would be able to breed space amoebas. They are predators so every space amoeba would cost space cows. You would be able to research larger amoebas design them much like how you design your spaceships but unlike ships amoebas would be upgradeable from a smaller class to a larger one.Say a corvettesized amoeba would cost one space cow plus some minerals. A destroyersized one would cost two cows plus some minerals but you could upgrade your corvettesized ones to destroyersized ones with a cow and the minerals that make up the difference. Cruisersized would cost  cows so to upgrade a destroyer to a cruiser you should spend  cows and upgrading a corvette to a cruiser would cost  cows and minerals. Etc...And since these are amoebas you would be able to divide them. It would cost some minerals depending on the exact equipment of the resultant amoebas and a cow.Similarly you would be able to assemble and grow crystalline entities and hack mining drones.,Stellaris,d7bd06v,50,t5_39cuc

8885264,0,t3_51v7hp,I think its the kind of thing that can be very easily headcanonedRPed. Im not saying I wouldnt mind more expansions to it  hey more and especially deeper stuff is always great but this is something thats popping up from time to time people treating the Spiritualist Ethos like it needs to be infinitely expanded upon even though its ultimately just an ethos a gameplay mechanic fully intended to do a few specific things flavour among them. See this very thread for people assuming how it shouldshould not interact with other spiritualists with neither view really being more or less correct than the other because theyre ultimately based on personal opinion.OP  you dont know for sure whether or not subjugated species worship the right thing? You can imagine it! Having said what youve said in the first place I dare say you arent lacking for imagination so Im sure you can allow a little bit of pretend to flavour your gameplay style and how you think about your playthrough.I also think the game already lays a nice foundation for that kind of Rped spiritualism. Personal example I recently played a relatively successful spiritualist empire whose biggest neighbour were also spiritualist. Whenever I open the diplomacy screen that tiny  Wise Spiritualists modifier doesnt change the fact that they called me ignorant and lead astray or  and this is the important part  that as we became friends and their tone warmed up they started saying that our religions were actually pretty similar of course their version was right and in time they hoped I would come to accept their corrections. If you want unsourced parallels to how religion works in the real world this kind of fusion is incredibly common and its not a stretch for me to just imagine that maybe people in respective empires border colonies end up following this fusion religion or with the increased ethics divergence maybe just give up and become materialists lol.TLDR I guess would be something like Dont forget the play in roleplay.,Stellaris,d7fvt5p,1,t5_39cuc

Anyone who doesnt think so either hasnt played as Pacifist or has a very strange way of looking at the game.Ive put close to  hours in this game so far. This is a bold statement for which I cannot find justification.gt happiness and  habitabilty on planet is insanely strong you build one of those on every planet so that when your at war youve only actually lost  happiness and while you arent at war you are sitting at a happy  happiness just from your Pacifist ethosbuilding.building a special happiness building on every planet is not an ideal strategy. this takes a lot away from production and many planets are just too small to support it. excess happiness doesnt really add much especially for smaller planets. youre better off putting your efforts into empirewide negative  ethics divergence effects. and even then once you get rolling with a large enough empire a small amount of unhappy factions or diverging populations will be little more than an annoying notification that you have to swat away.gt Now as for declaring the wars Pacifists can have Liberation wars turned on with no negative penalty Fanatic Pacifists cannot. So you attack your enemy quickly destroy his fleet take the planets you want then peace out a new little empire forms with your ethics you vassalise them and  years you integrate them and you got a bunch of nice new happy pops to integrate into your Empire.The pacifist ethos does not make this kind of war any easier than the other ethos. I am not criticizing this kind of play style just pointing out that you can use this approach with every ethos and pacifist ethos doesnt make it better. its just the only approach that pacifists can use without risking a heavy production penalty making pacifist weaker than other ethos in the game.,Stellaris,d7iycwm,4,t5_39cuc

But these are still rare as hens teeth and I dont see any improvement in this area coming at this point. I think itd be improved massively if they just stopped outright annexing entire empires. Ideally they should just fight to subjugate empire same thing they demand of you at first or at the very least follow normal war rules for conquest.  Gameplay for vassals and tributaries  and rebelling against overlords needs a massive overhaul in general that would really help here but thats probably also beyond the scope of what theyd be willing to patch.

My general mindset from a gameplay perspective is highly molded from my experiences with the Civ series where you can basically do what you want regarding war ex if I see  cities I want I can get them.  The warscore concept is new to me so Im learning its intricacies. So it sounds like generally its not realistic to ever claim more than  warscore points as a goal.  Can the value of a planet go up as the number of planets controlled by an empire decreases?

As your repeatable tech count goes up and you hit  DR on those cruisers you might be able to just spam cruisers.Although against an Awakened Empire or the Unbidden or something like that going crazy on plasma might be overkill.

9649337,0,t3_5d24cp,I really feel the whole ethos wheel should be scrapped entirely.An egalitarian society is a society with high equality.  Slavery is outlawed while a society with low equality allows slavery. This doesnt have to be binary and can influence your government type and policies.  High inequality societies tend to be oligarchies.Authoritarianism is the opposite of Democraticnot egalitarian.  This is a measure of how decisions are made.  Topdown from the ruling class to the people or Bottomup from the people to the ruling class.Being prone to Xenophobia should be a variable species trait that can be increased or decreased through events to simulate people becoming more or less space racist as things happen but never completely go away. How xenophobia is handled should be a government policy.  For example its against the law to discriminate and the reason the law exists is because the government is attempting to overrule the peoples natural tendency to hate people who are different. Some people feel this impulse more strongly than others.  Naturally the more fanatic xenophobes you have the harder such a law is to maintain.  This ties in nicely with purging.  Some people might hate those who are different but not enough to kill them unless of course that group is responsible for some atrocity or the species itself simply has a high enough baseline for hatred to allow purging.  Perhaps the government can push its people over the edge with propaganda and cause its people to demand genocide which would give a temporary happiness bonus.  The risk being that people could find out you lied to them.Just some thoughts.,Stellaris,da2hb8b,1,t5_39cuc

9808952,0,t3_5fpt0r,The weapons you want to use and how you balance your ships can be generalized but optimally is modified based on the configuration of the ships youll be facing.  Are they using a lot of lasers?  Then you are better off stacking extra shields and skipping the armor.  Are the really shield heavy?  Then youll want to focus more on kinetics on your ships rather than lasers.Basically weapons have a focus something they are better at compared to the default.  Sometimes that comes with a penalty sometimes not.  But to really design your ships well you want to match your weapon strengths against the enemy defenses and vice versa.  Its not too hard to pick up the basics by spending some time in the ship designer and reading the tooltips for various weapons.  Lasers for example have high armor pen but do reduced damage to shields.  Kinetic weapons tend to do increased damage to shields.  They can also have some amount of armor pen on the larger mount sizes but that comes at the cost of reduced tracking and therefore a harder time hitting smaller ships.Shield regen mods vs more armor isnt really a choice to make as the shield regen mods fit in the A slots while armor wont.  You could use hull regen mods instead in A slots which might be a decent choice depending on what other techsleaders you have some can provide their own hull regen.  But shield regen mods are generally decent on destroyers and higher although really only excelling on battleships.  Basically what they do is allow your shields to regen in combat which wont happen without them.  But the amount the shields regen tends to be a factor of the shields that you have so on smaller ships it wont be a really high number.,Stellaris,dam5w7o,2,t5_39cuc

9889617,0,t1_dawiox1,Yes that is what I meant but as someone else pointed out this would greatly hamper multiple reasonably sized invasion fleets. So I came up with this.How about something like a sphere of supply. Friendly and occupied planets project supplies to a varying degree. These projected supplies would fade according to distance warp  of jumps hyperplane distance from wormhole station. Armies in ships or invading planets have a supply upkeep. Failing to meet this upkeep depletes army morale and major shortages deplete health and will eventually kill off armies. Overlapping supply projections are additive. Projection range can be extended via maintenance slider.,Stellaris,dawn1sh,2,t5_39cuc

9899045,0,t3_5h56fl,The critical combat element youre missing is having enough ships to deter enemies from attacking you as others have said. Your fleet is as much a deterrent as it is an actual weapon. And just because the game says your fleet power is equivalent dont think youre safe. Youre only really safe when it tells you that the enemy is clearly inferior to you.If youre early enough in the game where  corvettes is scary I dont think you should have given up on your save. Your spaceports would have most likely messed up the enemy corvettes pretty badly and reduced their numbers enough for you to counterattack with your own corvettes. That .k firepower from a basic spaceport is nothing to sniff at in the early game and makes early game rushes pretty ineffective in my experience. Im also not entirely convinced that an enemy would have enough ground troops to easily capture planets that early in the game either especially if you filled your vulnerable planets with your own ground forces. Even if they do capture a planet they wont defend it adequately and it will be quite easy to recapture.If you could have repelled the initial incursion it would take the enemy multiple years to be able to attack you again. From there it would just be a matter of building your fleet until youre strong enough to take on the enemys spaceports. Once you have a strong enough fleet to defeat enemy spaceports you can win wars even if youre outnumbered and outgunned. The trick is to avoid fleet combat and instead hit their spaceports crippling their ability to build more ships and capturing their planets before theyre able to respond.TLDR Avoid fleet combat if the enemy fleet is superior have a strong enough fleet to defeat enemy spaceports.,Stellaris,daxva5p,1,t5_39cuc

9910485,0,t3_5hddds,An idea ive had is a mix of the Stellaris living systems mod and how the tradeship system worked in Sword Of the Stars introduce ingame dynamic supply lines. Every military fleet has an assigned logistics meter  and as the fleet moves this meter depletes note it wouldnt budge if the fleet was stationarysitting in orbit somewhere and as the meter falls combat effectiveness drops. The bigger the fleet the faster it deteriorates combat burns up logistics at a faster rate than just moving amp logistics arent consumed whilst in FTL. Techsadmiral perks like thrifty etc. could reduce the drain rate or supercharge the fleets capacity upto Supply ships would leave from your nearest colonystarport or a special military resupply station and fly to your military fleets only through openborders space and hostile systems youre fighting at the best researched drive speed and whilst you cant directly control them they would just appear as friendly ships passing through the star system to not clutter up UI they can be attacked by hostiles. Blowing supply ships up has no mineralenergy cost to the player it would be unfair otherwise as the player lacks direct control and another ship will be spawned for free by the nearest colony after a short delay the main impact is that if you cant secure safe passage of supplies to your fleet its combat effectiveness will fall through the floor. If in a federation nearby allied worldsstarports can also resupply your ships making federations more appealing.This system has  effects . It limits the combat effectiveness of big fleets if they cant be supplied. . Creates a battlefront or front line not from an arbitrary forcefieldlimitation or whatever but directly by the player who has to ensure they advance evenly to not risk their fleet being cut off and annihilated. . Presently a war is often over with a single doomstackondoomstack fight and a surgical strike deep into enemy territory against their core systems. This would would discourage that and encourage a mixed guerrillawarfare strategy of many smaller fleets flying around hunting down supply ships before going after the main force.Logistics meter tiers no effect  minor malus to insystem speed amp shield recharge rates aura effectiveness as above but also reduction to combat effectivenessDPS all of above effects are doubled effects are further increased. effectively x base malus level at ltgteach supply ship that reaches the fleet would push its logistics meteror whatever you want to call it up by  points. Splitting a fleet will give each of the new fleets an average of the old logistics value discouraging cheesingsplittingrecombining. The worsening effects represent attrition the loss of cadetsofficers and rationing of fuelmunitions within the fleet.This wouldnt arbitrarily stop you using a Doomstack or add lots of extra steps to using one it just means itd perform like rubbish if you dont play tactically leaving it cut off and poorly supplied. A toggleable galaxy map overlay can be added looking similar to hyperlanes mode would show you the current paths your supply lines take to reach active fleets shaded grey segments  no issues red recent supply convoy destroyed in area. ,Stellaris,dazcy0q,39,t5_39cuc

9983991,0,t1_db8w0pu,Mine probably sat still after its initial expansion for about  years. I gobbled up most of the galaxy before engaging it including the two remaining Fallen Empires. If they dont wake up and trigger a War in Heaven I strongly recommend killing them for the tech and GaiaRing worlds. If you ever get beaten and need time to recuperate I split off about  corvettes with the most cowardly Admiral I could roll rekitted them with PSI Jump Drives Id salvaged and jumped between  systems in a loop baiting their fleet for almost a decade. I dont know if it was necessary. It was just what I did. I am a fan of specialisation. It makes things better because I can more easily change my weapon ratios. If all my ships have a bit of Flak if I am going against another threat that uses fewer strike craft or its not enough I would have to retrofit all my cruisers. With specialist flak ships I just build what I need. Evasion would be better than chance to hit. AEs are all low evasion. Similar to how I baited them into not wrecking all my systems with their death stack. Pulled all my fleets except one group of corvettes Rascally Rabbit Runners out of their space. Then I sent my Rabbits in a loop through their space ABCD. I am not sure this is necessary but I suspected jump drives take longer to spool up the longer the jump so keep them more or less equivalent so the FE fleet cant catch you prescout the jump route to make sure your fleet does not engage any stations between jumps. Once the FE death stack was in pursuit and had left A I jumped my fleet into A and sub spaced to the jump point between D and A. I evacuated the corvettes before the battle started and the FE fleet basically exited their jump into my fleet point blank. Bonus points if you align your fleet to be perpendicular to their fleet like a T. The ships at the far end of their column will not be able to engage you immediately while all the ships in your column will immediately engage the near end of theirs and obliterate it almost instantly to give an early advantage.Same logic. Seemed a bit nuts but it was effective. Got pretty high damage numbers with them in the postbattle report.,Stellaris,db8xxfv,5,t5_39cuc

Like higher education being more prolific  autocratic regimes want to limit university degrees as people who have them tend to be more likely to demand participation in decision processes while democratic regimes want to do the opposite as a well educated populace is demonstrably more productive overall. It can be countered with more democratic pops being less receptive to edicts as they are better at critical thinking and know their rights already.

10530186,0,t3_5qr8sx,One thing I would like to see would be an option to disable Jump Drives so that all empires have to conform to the ruleset. Beyond that being able to choose one or all three options is very good.I think that for combat certain systems could be improved Military station fields should produce a field around the system that will forcibly redirect Warp Drive fleets in motion into that system. This lets you create real walls which increases the value of some otherwise boring systems as you want to build a wall of stations to protect from incursions. Wormhole Stations positioning in a system should dictate where fleets can enter and exit a system. Ships should need to go to the Wormhole Station to jump out rather than anywhere out of the gravity well and ships should appear near the Wormhole Station when they jump in.,Stellaris,dd1pmgi,15,t5_39cuc

10648529,0,t3_5sda45,Im sure the main reason is because humans are the species most players can immediately identify with ... and because weve grown up with a host of humancentric scifi where other species are at best sidekicks like Kirks pet Vulcan.I dont find it surprising then that a lot of people play Humans especially when they want to recreate settings they remember from their favorite childhood show or videogame or something thats a reference to it.Likewise there is a certain attraction to what if scenarios with players looking at modern humanity and thinking of just how we may some day colonize the stars. The Space UN one of the two default Human factions in the game is probably quite popular for specifically this reason  especially as it offers the promise of a bright idealistic future as a bonus incentive something quite alluring especially nowadays.And that is before we get to the possibility of what if scenarios that may delve deeper into Human history and ask how a hypothetical scifi version of mankind would look if we had taken a different turn at some critical junction such as a future Earth still dominated by an evolved Roman Empire a Global Soviet Union or something even crazier like Space Pharaohs or Incas. To say that playing Humans automatically denotes a lack of imagination shows ironically a lack of imagination concerning what you can actually do with our species  especially if one enjoys worldbuilding in general and has fun fleshing out the details of a future governmentmilitarysociety this was actually one of the most enjoyable aspects of the NationStates game for me.Heres food for thought Considering that what defines a species should be more about its culture rather than it appearance why do Space Anubians feel more exotic? Is it really just about the looks? Lets not forget that WoW Trolls and Tauren are quite clearly inspired by specific Human cultures too.Disclaimer I myself play about  Humans  various alien species.

10678304,0,t1_ddh65s8,Niche application is fine flak amp pdc are niche and widely loved. Niche is not the same as poorly balanced. Ive tried missiles I dont hate them as much as majority. I love watching a fleet of corvettes blast their missiles and then follow their missiles as the missiles chase a fast moving target away from the main engagement. The deal is sealed when the rest of the hostile fleet comes at my corvettes from behind to wipe them out because the corvettes are focusing fire on a target that is fast enough to delay missile impact. That could be a wonderful tactical option if combat computers let you designate some ships with certain behavior patterns that baited aggressive hostiles to draw fire. Instead its an inescapable reality of the way the system is currently designed. Right now the closest missiles have for strong niche uses are to give battleships a way to destroy corvettes whirlwind are decent but S autocannons at high tier work OK there too amp to get shot down as a distraction to allow bombers to hit targets. Missiles need something missiley to set them apart from other weapons. All weapons fire moves at constant velocity in the game but that doesnt make sense for missilestheyre under constant thrust so they should accelerate towards targets. If theyre not going to accelerate then they should get sensible redirection to at least one new target or maybe get small AOE splash damage. Im with you on having control over ship roles at builddesign. Giving back combat computer options wouldnt eliminate ship sizes influence on their best use. No combat computer is going to make a battleship fast or a corvette tanky. But as it is right now a lot of people consider corvettes amp destroyers tanks really they mean fodder I think to soak up the damage amp draw fire away from their capital ships. The combat module mod gives some options back to the ship builder but not as much as Id like. ,Stellaris,ddhdwxb,1,t5_39cuc

With the increasing belligerence of the Alari Confederacy and their shared values of science and hierarchy the two nations have been drawing closer and closer together having already signed a defensive pact. After days of negotiation this defensive pact has been formalized into the Enlightened Bloc a political military and economic alliance. The Bloc is open to other nations who share its values joining it and the rather xenophilic nature of the Serdnans have made them accomplished diplomats. However representatives of the Alari Confederacy and other nations not aligned with the Blocs views have expressed worry along with casually racist insults calling the two species cowardly squids and insects over a new clause in the document which states that nations in the bloc will not only assist each other in defense but also in offense.

10801382,0,t1_ddtg6x3,If I remember correctly EU and CK circumvent this with supply mechanics. Too many troops on a territory basically exceeds available food supplies and causes your army to start defecting. Also in CK most of your available troops are basically levies owned by your different lords so they start off decentralized instead of hanging out at your capital city. Some of these ideas could probably be worked into Stellaris with the effect of decentivizing one giant stack being your whole navy and instead keeping a number of ships orbiting in each system or patrolling your borders. Changing the way that sensors work could force players to spread out their fleet across their borders and throughout their space in order to see whats going on. Adding espionage elements could increase the risk that a single enemy ship getting into your borders could pose. Having civilian space traffic and piracy pop up could also give reason to divide up your fleet power across your territory. Similarly if the game ever implements a mechanic of tradecommerce there could be smugglers and such and your navy would have to also act as a police force. This would also give a disadvantage to playing wide unless you really have enough ships to patrol your space. The more domestic purpose there is to your navy the bigger deal it is to send the entire navy across the galaxy to wage war. I think you should be able to overwhelm your opponents with your entire navy but there should be some cost. Whoever commented that fleet size could be tied to admiral rank had a great idea. Especially if it is not a hard cap but rather some sort of penalty either through desertion or reduced effectiveness if you exceed an admirals capability. ,Stellaris,ddu33zd,4,t5_39cuc

So I have five fleets with  power each because I have five colonies. The  value is okay if youre defending against pirates but not okay against AI. If I would have left it at one fleet I could have had a much stronger presence in defense against the invading infidels.I think I should go back to a previous safe save point and recombine the fleets. I hate to just start completely over from the beginning.I believe I am so new to the game that Im not smart enough or experienced enough to even know what questions I should be asking. ,Stellaris,de3znxy,1,t5_39cuc

10899478,0,t1_de46tsu,Well similarly in how currently at every point the player is considered to be taking mental control of the empires current leader they can be assume to be acting the effective mandates of the anarchist society. This is not difficult to suspend your disbelief about. You dont have a top leader and rather than elections every X years or so you instead receive generated mandates to fullfil based on what is causing your populace the most unhappiness. Failing to achieve them will massively increase unhappiness in the populace and cause factions to split out which might even demand a switch to a different government system.I could brainstorm more ideas like this but its definitelly not super more difficult to simulate convincingly more than a friggin hivemind.,Stellaris,de47cg1,1,t5_39cuc

Further although I dont think its been in an official dev diary yet I think Refugees are created as a byproduct of purging which is no longer gonna be just wholesale slaughter but also forcing unwanted pops offplanet and chemical castration and waiting for them to die off.I think Stop Atrocities might get split up because it covers a lot of ground right now but otherwise the CBs are already in place.I agree that there should be more CBs I made a post about it too a little while ago but really I think all CBs should be diplomatic items and visa versa.

11314440,0,t3_61g11s,A little excerpt from the story of my current empire  Silverpelt Clan Accords Military Junta Militerist Spiritualist Individualist Space CatsMy empire was surrounded by PreFTL primitives of varying development.  The  most advanced of these primitives had ethos that could only point to them becoming fantastic purifiers. Once the Accords established itself as a force to be reckoned with in the local region of space covert infiltrations were implemented on several of these worlds.  The intent being to ensure that these primitives would be integrated into the galactic society as smoothly as possible.Unfortunately the infiltration attempts were stalled by a single misguided rogue agent Agent X was henceforth referred to as Rogue.  Unwilling to make a scene the Accords canceled all infiltration projects and went back to passive observations on all primitive planets.  About  years later an observation post sent a very distressing report to command.  The world they had been watching over had been destroyed its civilizations committed nuclear suicide.  To make things further tragic that planet had been the adopted world of Rogue.Unwilling to let this disaster happen again infiltration efforts were reinstated on all suitable worlds...  until several incidents started to occur.  The Accords Infiltrators were being actively hunted.  Against all odds Rogue escaped the global suicide of his adopted world and found a new primitive world to protect against the predations of a more advanced civilization.  No demands were made by him.  He simply refused to let the Accords save this species from itself.Subsequent reports detailing the are vague.The First Silverpelt Fleet received priority orders to head to Observation Post  to carry out an orbital strike against a the confirmed location of the damn Rogue intercept an impending meteor strike against the planet.  Observation Post  Confirms that Rogue was on site at time of impact Unfortunately the Fleet suffered targeting failures and was unable to intercept the meteor.  Tragically the meteor strike obliterated a primitive city.Unwilling to delay any further the infiltration first contact preparations were stepped up and accelerated.  Today years later the primitives are now considered to be citizens of the Accords.TLDR  I initially acquiesced to most of the rogue agents henceforth called Rogue demands due to personal morals.  I canceled the infiltration and went back to passive observation.  That world had the nuclear war event and is now a Tombworld.  I resumed the infiltration on the other primitive planets and that same Rogue agent continued to harass my projects.  The moment I spotted the Rogue I brought in my main battle fleet to carry out the tactical orbital strike.  My only regret is that I hadnt done this earlier.,Stellaris,dfeh2g3,2,t5_39cuc

11518226,0,t3_64epfs,I find early trading and energy deficit spending to be crucial. Sometimes I spend my first  years always in the red sometimes losing as much as  energy or minerals per month. But my reward is I can almost from the start spend as much as I want to jump start my expansions. Split your starting fleet into  and send them to explore every possible direction as far as they can. The key is that the AI will almost immediately trade lump sump energy for per month energy or minerals. So for instance I meet an Ai at the start of the game. I trade him  energy per month for  minerals per month. Those  minerals are so crucial that getting them gives me a jump start and helps snowball. Of course the time will soon come where Im running out of energy. Then I just trade him say  energy a month for  years for  or whatever he has energy. And keep that up with all AIs I meet that are willing to trade with me. Eventually Im rolling in minerals and can expand and even buildconquer much faster than the AI. Im always running a deficit but I have  planets massive science and a strong fleet within the first  decades of the game. If you play a xenophile with charasmatic and run into the xenophile FE its even more OP. They will literally trade you infinite resources for per month trades. The beauty of this is that on hard and insane the AI is rolling in money so they never run out. To give you an example promising  minerals per month for  years to the xenophile FE will have him give you k minerals. Now if you saved that for  years youd have .k. So you lose  minerals but at the opportunity cost of  years of faster development.Its possible to go too far and bankrupt yourself before your early investments in rapid expansion have a chance to take hold and your economy catches up to your loans but if you dont you basically control at least a quarter of the galaxy by  years in even on insane. The only way you lose is if you end up literally surrounded with no one willing to trade with you and they declare war on you before you are able to find other AIs and get the ball rolling.,Stellaris,dg1lc8z,2,t5_39cuc

11526890,0,t3_64hjlh,gt Meanwhile by focusing on unity youll be sacrificing things like mineral and energy production research influence and happiness.Overall I disagree with you.  Sure most of the ascensions arent terribly relevant early on in the game but some of the traditions can make a huge difference and absolutely seem worth rushing.  I actually think the ideal strategy may be to cherry pick the most important tradition bonuses from  different traditions early on and after that settling on actually finishing the tradition trees to cash in your Ascension perks. Three levels of Discovery gets you a  discount on Research Stations and bonus research for every system you scan. Two levels of Prosperity to get  Mining Station cost and  ship cost. Three levels of Expansion gets you half cost frontier outposts or half cost colony ships.I agree that maximizing the mechanic completing all  traditions is wasteful but theres tangible benefits to prioritizing Unity early on both for the very strong tradition bonuses and to get a few Ascension points.   ascension perks is enough to get Habitats or complete an Ascension path which can be a game changer.gt Instead you should aim to complete your trees by  and instead focus on resources and research speed.Most of my games are basically decided by .

With the current mechanics it seems feasible but there needs to be a real way to reshuffle the board so as to not void the progress of the players and their interaction with the map the main goal of these suggestions to to make power more level so that the game can effectively start again in a cycle you suggest.The Game Currently OffBoard Invasion Introduces power asymmetries from outside the board currently known as endgame events Swarm Unbidden AI. OnBoard Pressure Introduces power asymmetries from on the board. Awakened Fallen Empires Fragmentation A Disaster Destroys certain empires entirely. PSI Shroud disaster Fragmentation B Rebellion Rebels will cut away from the main empire during a rebellion. Armageddon A War in Heaven All existing factions and groups are compelled to fight each other with large gainslosses from the war.These are the current ways the game changes while retaining some persistence. Other games in the Paradox retinue do the following Board Expansion A New World The board is expanded to encompass more continentsareas with selective access typically technology but sometimes ideas or equivelent. EUIV Victoria  Fragmentation C Civil War A portion of an empire breaks off when control is sufficiently lax super powered rebellion similar to fragmentation b. EUIV Core Input Diffusion A Strategic Resources A portion of the map is disproportional to the rest of the map and this compels empires to fight over it. This causes existing regimes to collapse or otherwise take a risk. IE Goldrush. EUIV VicSo we have a few proven options available but I will throw in a few of my own. Some possible options for Stellaris include...Possible Options for StellarisOffBoard Pressure While not always able to destroylevel the board they are still valuable and change the game fundamentally. Last stand Offmap invasions occur without end until the offending nation is sufficiently pruned or crippled. Essentially a last stand. This allows the player a bit of recourse instead of being aggravated by simply being struck dead.Fragmentation Fragmentation events would be vital because of the general tendency of nations and empires to increase their size and power. Decline the nation falls into decline or otherwise as others have mentioned. Perhaps variations of decline could be made available civil war butlerian jihad mysterious plague etc. Creeping Doom Over time the nation in question sees an increasing chance of simply being struck by calamity by virtue of their size. A zombie plague  which relies on density  is a good example of this. After a time the zombies die leaving the dust of a civilization. Landmine EventsResearch Nations in questions can make errors that are deadly as their hubris and power increase. similar to fragmentation ABoard Expansion There are a few different ways as I see it to expand the board. Expanding the board does not make the game cyclical but it does buy time. Expand to the void Expand the map to the outside of the galaxy. Expand to the center of the galaxy. Expand the map to the center of the galaxy. Expand to hidden planets or hidden areas on the map.This is all very rushed but I could type up more.,Stellaris,dg5dz0v,31,t5_39cuc

11574691,0,t3_656hsf,Here are mine currently I rarely have more than two custom races at once. Both of the races were attempts at a particular play style but with very different approaches. The goal is psionic ascension with a multicultural society focused on making friends and making vassals out of those who do not want friendship. The first attempt the Shereyn went well although they are slow starters and tend to play more defensively due to the wormhole FTL. Lasers are long term the best choice for me I think and the traits are what you would expect from a race taking the Syncretic evolution civic. One race for minerals and farms the other for energy and research. Unfortunately the Shereyn run into a problem in that whilst they do get significant infrastructure bonuses they just arent very good at the vassalisation part of the gameplan so they tend to stagnate for a little while until they can build a serious advantage.In response I made the Hongar a militaristic society of horsepeople who would act like a more military focused version of the earlier race. The theme here isnt conquest for territorial gain but rather lording over lesser societies and protecting them. The Hongar have significant bonuses to both types of combat space and planet based. They also make excellent rulers which was a move to make the RP fit more with the gameplay. This race is supposed to lord over others whilst still retaining a little bit of xenophilia. So when playing this race I set the default species rights to Residence only disallowing other species to make leaders. This does cause slight happiness problems but I find Spiritualists deal with that well and why get some potentially average xeno ruler when I can get an enduring charismatic one for only a  happiness penalty? Missiles were chosen because for the first  or so years before anyone gets PD missiles are ridiculously good especially when paired with so many fire rate bonuses. Another sweet combo here is the Domination Tradition opener and Militarist both of which reduce the amount of warscore needed for vassalisation. This means early game this race can declare war and for only  points vassalise another planet empire. Paired with an early focus on Unity by building Temples to flesh out the rest of the Domination tree this leads to quite a large empire early on comprised of many different races. I probably went way too indepth here but oh well any questions feel free.,Stellaris,dg7zwvj,4,t5_39cuc

11582690,0,t3_65b937,Rule  Okay I get that people probably are aware of this and have discussed it to death. I havent been following the subreddit closely and only showed up to comment on how broken this tradition can be.I also understand that this was something of a special situation requiring a ridiculously good start for my little lizardfolk materialists to end up with these numbers. But still its a bit insane that I can reach nearly k stored research points in multiple categories before the year .The how I started off small sticking with  planets. This was partly done because I wanted to play tall undergo synthetic ascension then go wide. However it was mostly done because the first empire I ran into was a xenophobic fallen empire located so close that settling any planet outside my own starting borders invited a death threat. I suppose that fallen empire also stopped other empires from settling anywhere near me while the plethora of random spaceborne enemies in the opposite direction down the arm which killed a total of  exploratory corvettes before I gave up kept other empires from finding me that way. In any case I sat on  corvettes and  planets for nearly  years before anyone found me simply building up my techs. Because I stayed in my own little corner of the galaxy I explored practically nothing before sending out  jumpdriveequipped science ships on automatic exploration. At this point I was making nearly  physics and engineering and about  society. The returns from the tradition simply kept building up until you see what this screenshot highlights.Sadly the xenophobic fallen empire awoke right about the time I was getting ready to wipe him out and I abandoned the game because that was the third fucking awakened empire in three fucking games that started right next to me and I was simply done with that endgame crisis at that point.,Stellaris,dg8wkzg,2,t5_39cuc

11599414,0,t3_65i1f7,Still egalitarianism is not the opposite of authoritarianism. The opposite is libertarianism. And read the flavor description of egalitarianism  Any society that does not embrace equality between its members  where an individual can rise to any position with enough hard work  is not only deeply unfair but ultimately counterproductive.This is quite literally a meritocracy. And meritocracies can absolutely be authoritarian. The hilarious bit is that the Police State to quash any traces of dissent the population in this repressive society is carefully monitored and controlled by a large internal police force civic is somehow compatible with egalitarianism. If egalitarianism is a codeword for meritocracy then it makes since that is compatible with Police State. On top of this megacorporations are somehow egalitarian. They are not for heavens sake.Also fanatic egalitarianism completely ditches the meritocratic preaching which is weird because all other fanatic ethics build on the narrative of the normal ones...Beware always those who would be despots under the false presumption that their desires and agendas are somehow more imperative than those of their fellows. A society that does not see to the needs and rights of all of its members is not a society  it is a crime.This one sounds almost... socialist.

11618073,0,t1_dgcwwbc,Theyre more like artificial planets. You can build them around any uninhabited planet with no stations around it and they act like Size  colonizeable planets with  habitability to all species. But they also have their own unique buildings instead of the typical buildings. They also cost  minerals and take something like  days  years to build.Theres also even more rediculous things like ringwords which I think cost a combined total of around  minerals and take like  years to fully construct. In total they turn a system into  size  habitability ring segments with randomly generated tile bonuses like a planet.Ive not actually built any of the others personally so cant comment on those myself.,Stellaris,dgcx3g7,4,t5_39cuc

More pops means more fleet cap more energy and more minerals. In addition by concentrating my pops in as few systems as possible its very easy to defend them. A system may have  colonies planets and habitats allowing me to defend a hundred pops in a single system using a network of interlocking fortresses.This makes wars very easy.

11621232,0,t3_65smlt,Divide up about ten corvettes put them on top of stars in systems around your empire nearest the unbidden.This does two things acts as a radar array and when an enemy fleet goes in to tye system they break off and go after the corvette. You can send your ships in a wide circle this will buy you some to to fortify a colony system in the immediate cross hairs.The best against unbidden is four shield dampening stations around one warp net close enough to the colony that your ships Immediately engage. The dampening works wonders and can easily get a K stack to over come a K unbidden fleet so long as you have the right composition of kinetic weapons.Once you have a good defence that isnt being whittled away by attacks then you can start probing the unbidden space with your corvettes. If you start to get overwhelmed send a corvette to the edge of their wormhole system this acts like a reset button as all the fleets return.,Stellaris,dgda01n,1,t5_39cuc

11625104,0,t3_65smlt,Tldr Build a whole battleship fleet with kinetic and giga cannon and if you have more money to spend corvettes with energy torps. If you have a massive fleet disadvantage you can always take the defender of the galaxy perk and eat all the crisis fleets.The unbidden ships arent long ranged since the matter disintegrators have range on L having the giga cannon  range  and kineticArt  range allows your battleships to fight without getting damage and to decimate the enemy fleets before they can shoot back.The whole battleship composition is to maximise damage in the  Giga Cannon to  KA  area and have all of your fleets stand back and deal max damage. Note that this will work best by taking on onetwo fleets at a time and not by sniping out the portal  because kinetic and giga cannon tend to spread out damage and if you have around  battleships and the perk for extra damage you will be able to take down k fleets with little to no damage to yours allowing you do destroy all of the unbidden ships in repetition and still have enough firepower to take down the portal in one single run.Bonus fact the same battleship composition works fine for killing off FEAE fleets and the only minor change you need is to switch one KA slot third one IIRC  for flak in case they use fightersbombersrockets.,Stellaris,dgdpu0z,1,t5_39cuc

11701212,0,t1_dgm7hg0,Once you find xenos use your extra influence to place frontier outposts as a wall to prevent them from expanding towards you.  The xenos henceforth known as illegals are terrorists who want nothing more than to destroy your freedom.  So you will need to watch their diplomacy report and see how strong their fleets are. If it is superior to yours divert all minerals to ships until you are at your fleet cap.  Otherwise keep a couple of constructors queued up making mining stations and put the rest of your minerals into corvettes. All the while spend your energy making colony ships any time you are above .  Grab planets which spread your borders first you never want to run out of mining stations to build and at some point you want to get up to three constructors.  Speaking of constructors in the first election support a candidate with the space miner trait.  Combined with prosperity opener that makes mining stations cost . minerals which means you can afford to keep  of them building at all times now.  If you run out of mining stations locations build frontier outposts.When you hit your fleet limit start building starports on every planet then throwing them in a sector of you are above your limit.  The ports increase your fleet cap so that you can build more fleets. The only building you might want to build on the colonies are farms and energy plants.Start Your Cleansing with Primitive Xenos  When you scientists find a world populated by primitive xenos that is a problem you have to solve.  Build  assault armies and tell them to pacify the menace.  Just like that you have a new world to populate with your great species.  By default they are set to be worked to death in compulsory labor camps but that isnt ideal.  With some effort they can be broken down to a nutrient rich liquid in which we can incubate more of our young.  Resettle one pop from your homeworld to oversee the process and populate the world after the xenos are processed. Keep a defensive army queued at all times on that world but dont bother building a spaceport.  If xenos invade you want them to go for the planet with all the defensive armies first.   Youll do the same thing with planets ceded in wars only with a larger army and a supporting fleet.End of the early gameOnce you are at your fleet limit with all planets defended you can start upgrading your planets or go to war.   If there are xeno empires with pathetic fleets bordering you who arent in defensive pacts you can invade them one your fleet power passes about k.  I wont go into how to invade them but keep producing ships during the invasion until the maintenance brings your energy production to  when they undock.  Invasions are most efficient when you have two fleets that can each beat anything they throw at you one fleet escorts your transports while the other hunts down enemy fleets.  Combine them until you have wiped out their main fleets.Research PrioritiesTech wise you want to research get economic techs.  Research towards starport upgrades basic shields point defense torpedoes plasmas and defense stations if they come up but dont bother with other military techs.  Your neighbors will research those for you.  Energy producing buildings robots the  evolution line border expansion growth orbital farms and political techs are particularly good.Improving Your Planets Once you have minerals free to upgrade your planets start with a unity monument.  With all those planets your tradition cost is very high.  But if we build all our unity buildings on every planet we earn traditions as if we just had a single planet with x that unity production.  Go into the expansion tree along the left line and you will increase that to an effective rate of x your average planet.  Youll get your ascendancy perks at a good rate once youve done this.  For your first two perks pick two of voidborn masters of nature and  core planets.  Voidborn requires fortress and battlefield tech but you can hold the spot for it if that is the one you go for.  Building habitats is slower than conquering planets but its an option if you are surrounded by illegals with too much firepower to deport.  Master of nature is very strong and is always a good first pick.  If you dont pick it first I wouldnt pick it second. Just terraform planets before settling them and accept the tax.  Imperial perogatives  core worlds is amazing for this strategy.  When you are cleansing planets of illegals you want to keep them in your core for those  years. The sectors will go haywire with pops which always produce food and you will want to improve upon the illegals poor civic management.  That means each core planet is another xeno planet you can cleanse each decade.  I like to be in the  core planets range by the late midgame so that you can swallow empires whole and also have a few permanent cores shipyards and planets which produce exceptional amounts of minerals.TLDR  Expand rapidly to up your fleet cap and claim more space then start cleansing that galaxy.      ,Stellaris,dgmcnf1,4,t5_39cuc

And then have that have the possibility to branch off into different things.The Scourge are fleeing something. Dont have it be the Unbidden have it be something else. Have that something else have a few different methods it can employ as per invading the galaxy.There are ways to have set paths for sequential crises but have them varied in how theyre carried out. Such as if youre prepared for a certain type of crisis it might throw you a curveball and do a different type of crisis. There are tons and tons of examples out there. Even though I felt meh about the seasons the Ori from Stargate would be a great crisis to deal with. It would be a crisis that takes an absurdly long time to build up and theyd be very defensive in nature but their ships would effectively be invincible so youre forced to play out a quest chain that has random elements to try and discover how to beat them. Perhaps theyd only spawn if a Spiritualist FE exists. So the quest would be tied to them because they might have dealt with them before. Perhaps they even give you a gift of special ships.Also give us something like the Replicators that would be eating FEs alive. AKA the reason fallen empires are in their state isnt just stagnation. Theyve put all of their power into keeping something contained. And as the younger races wakeup they have to start splitting their attention. Maybe when this Ori crisis appears the contained crisis is finally able to break free? Also the Oriesq could vassalize other AI empires nearby or cause massive unrest as they convert all their pops to a special kind of Spiritualist with their own faction that you have to deal with.

11751743,0,t3_67opjm,Medium plasma cruisers with shield capacitors are the strongest single ship.  I prefer using  plasma cannons and one flak cannon on each against AI.  Use that as the core of your fleet.  The only ship types that efficiently counter that are battleships with arc emitters and corvettes with autocannons.I find that against the AI a mixed fleet of plasma cruisers and XLkinetic artillery battleships have the lowest losses in battles I am going to win anyway.  Adding corvettes helps in most battles where the outcome is uncertain but the corvettes will die in droves.Destroyers are effectively useless once you get cruisers and flak cannons.  Before that they are they most efficient PD platform.If you are playing against humans all this is out the window except that plasma cruisers are still king.  Either use them or use their counters.  Of the  counters autocannon vettes are easier to tech and will also beat battleship fleets.,Stellaris,dgs38gt,7,t5_39cuc

11773281,0,t1_dguiw7a,gt Why should your admiral be magically untouchable when the ship hes on is destroyed? Its silly.Because thats what fleets would shoot for in real life when it comes to formations and tactics they dont bother with that in Stellaris.I dont mind admirals dying occasionally obviously given the two alternatives I proposed but as it stands they wouldnt survive even half their battles at least not against relatively evenly matched enemy fleets.  Admirals should die because you made a mistake or took a risk.  They shouldnt die just because the ai randomly decided to send their ship out in front for no reason.,Stellaris,dguj9wj,6,t5_39cuc

11779284,0,t1_dgud830,Frontier beacons are supposed to be a powerful but temporary tool to snatch a colony for a lower price not a permanent frontier defense.  They have a monthly influence cost if that does not scream AVOID USING I dont know what does.  Using them to mark territory in a safe fashion would be possible if they could be heavily armed but if you remove the ability to destroy them easily there is almost no incentive to defend your territory since planets get armies.Under the current warscore system you can wipe out the enemys fleet destroy its spaceports and put a few ships even just a single corvette on each planet to bomb them. You gain no additional warscore from the blockades have free access to their territory because war and prevent them from ever recovering because they have no fleet and no way to build a spaceport this can be dragged on for however long you want to.  The current warscore system is broken lets not make changes around it.,Stellaris,dgv7wo5,1,t5_39cuc
