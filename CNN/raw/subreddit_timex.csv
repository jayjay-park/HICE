7671206,0,t3_4kdyfl, I have a few years on this old body of mine And not being a watch collector I have never seen a .Timex dont laugh enough said. BUT I do have a old Timex wind up watch that I brought just guessing back in the seventies.  yea thats right and I wore it every day at work. Yea shes scratched up and dented and Ive had to replace the band several times  Not carrying a brief case but work on poles stringing wire and such. Now that old Timex has been retired just like me. But when I go wind her up she starts ticking. Heck the darn thing will still be ticking when they close the lid on me. You All have a good day !!!,timex,d3e66ya,1,t5_37ccd
