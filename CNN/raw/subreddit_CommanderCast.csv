5366947,0,t3_3j1j2j,Im Peter also known as Timespike when Im online. I do a podcast but its not about Magic the Gathering Im one of the hosts on Saving the Game  as far as my cohost Grant and I are able to tell the only explicitly Christian RPG podcast out there. I enjoy Commander when I get a chance to play which isnt as often as Id like and I started playing Magic back in high school which was in the late s. My first set was Ice Age though I picked up a shameful amount of Fallen Empires and Homelands before I knew what I was doing and I tapered off in the middle of the Urza block.Unfortunately I sold off most of my good stuff during a long time away from the game. I used to have a Gaeas Cradle and a Force of Will but not any more.  On the plus side I still have a Time Spiral and a Natural Order from that time that somehow escaped the great selloff.I started picking cards up again around  years ago and REALLY started getting back in this last year. ,CommanderCast,cvxos9k,2,t5_39rm7
