3910073,0,t1_cr1z0ok,Nice!! I was actually thinking of this too as a throwback to NBA Street Volume but wasnt sure how likely it was for people to use different kinds of shots. Aerial shots being with  would add a lot of style and substance for higher skilled players.Other styles could include for one timers have the ball passed by a teammate and immediately shot in long shots  for shooting backwards which is already a thing in the gameIn Street Volume you could even take away points from your enemies lolSo maybe  if you shoot in your own net if you take a shot and the enemy makes an epic save P,RocketLeague,cr1zet0,3,t5_30cz1

4161272,0,t3_38e2ro,Ive played the alphas a couple of months back. I tried playing a single match with kbm and I honestly couldnt stand it. The  pad or the DS feels much more intuitive and its pretty obvious the game was designed with a controller in mind. I think playing with kbm would almost always put you in a disadvantage compared to a controller. You might be able to control the camera better with a mouse but car handling is much worse with WASD. Besides that it seems most people play with ballcam turned on making cameracontrol less demanding and carcontrol more.,RocketLeague,crulfcx,1,t5_30cz1

4507558,0,t1_csys3hi,Thats the thing they arent like most devs. They keep us in the loop update us on the status every hour maybe  if its bad or early in the morning for them like this morning. They warned us the servers would crash. They just do the right things and dont try to hide behind their game after its released. They just wanted to make a fun fair game almost anyone can enjoy and that is great these days. Not many devs do that. Most just want your money. These guys want our moneyobviously dont pretend otherwise but also want us to have fun playing their game. ,RocketLeague,csytt1f,6,t5_30cz1

4519108,0,t1_ct05jyp,Thanks for the information but it looks like they only aggregate listings from other stores online like GA. Then I go their website and it looks like it is either steam gifts what I was trying to avoid before that are sent through the website or you have to buy the keys off the market place. I am just really weary of buying keys from people since I have no actual way to test it out before I give people the key and if it doesnt work end up looking like an asshole. I have kept looking but it still looks like my only real option still is the wallet codes. I just wish amazon would sell them but they only have them for ps.

4530171,0,t3_3d3xee,I agree. I played in the beta and Id like to think Im above average skill wise and standard v just isnt fun due to the mismatch of skill. You can literally centre the ball and score on your own pass at will because the beginners are still having trouble running into the ball. Its no fun for them to get demolished by players online and its no fun playing against players with rookie bot skill. Hopefully their matchmaking algorithm will improve the more games that are played but I agree its very poor as isI wont even get started on ranked. ,RocketLeague,ct1nwjk,1,t5_30cz1

Instead of the winning team making sure the ball hits the ground they now have to worry about getting it to midfield? Nah.gtwhy would you want to cheat a team out of a possible score? It can be done in one second with a lucky kickoff.So youre ok with the game ending because the time ran out just before the ball crosses into the goal but youre not ok with cheating a team out of a possible score with a lucky kickoff I really dont follow your logic here.

If you want to change where you wind up in the ranks your best bet would be to tank your rating or something.  Not sure what you could do about getting Elite players as theyre far less inclined to want to pub stomp you than you are to fall to their wondrous acrobatic antics.

In football if someone shoots and it skimmed the back of an opposing player before going in the goal it wouldnt be an own goal.If you both go for the ball and the way the ball gets sandwiched between both of you happens to mean it touched you last but went in your own goal doesnt make it entirely your fault they still basically scored and should get credit.Theres no way they can make a system that accounts for all these differing circumstances so the best option is just to not have own goals.,RocketLeague,ctc15pt,1,t5_30cz1

4708972,0,t1_cto3dvw,I do understand low estimate. It can work both ways in this instance. An estimate being low on the scale of possible estimations vs being low in seconds when they are inversely related. The higher the seconds the lower end of the scale it is for estimates. Thus  seconds being a low estimation is accurate since it is on the low side for how quick it can be done. The high side means it can be done faster thus the seconds would decrease. God damn you must go through shovels like crazy whilst digging your own hole. How deep are you now?You tried to make the point in the other comment that it was not a low estimate trying to say it was a high estimate as in I was exaggerating the speed. I was mocking you when I said I guess it isnt a low estimate because that can mean that the time would be even faster. To summarize I stated  seconds as the low figure as the speed  to launch stating it might take less. Even while recording it took less than  seconds proving it was indeed a lower estimation of the speed. You derped and implied it was actually high so I turned around and said youre right pretending to agree with you because you arguing that point can mean the time was too high. Enjoy getting subtly mocked and having the person mocking you explain it to you. ,RocketLeague,cto3rb6,1,t5_30cz1

4723976,0,t1_ctpzfgb,Because its fun to develop an understanding of your opponent?I play the same opponents over and over again because its fun to build a relationship with a player. Its better than looking for a new game and opening up the potential to match with shitty players.A lot of the time I find a game where I enjoy everyone in the room. If I want a rematch I ask for it. Otherwise I enjoy mixing the teams up. There are many times where I play with complete strangers who are friendly and all equally skilled. These same players enjoy randomizing the same teams or rematching. In fact Think of how any other MP game does this. You dont play COD and see the game automatically find you new opponents. If you stick in the lobby you expect to play with those in the lobby. Its the lobby you are replaying. If you dont want that back out and find a new one. It literally takes under  seconds in Rocket League to do all that. It is straight to the point You are in the lobby staring at a scoreboard. Readying up means you want to shorten the countdown clock that restarts the game. In no way did I ever expect to find new players.On top of all this I dont want Psyonix to waste time and resources to change this. I would love a Find new Lobby button dont get me wrong but I imagine that the games matchmaking doesnt work like that once ingame. If it does thats great and should be added but I imagine that getting booted to the menu is just how the game was designed.So if it takes work to undo that and change it Id rather they prioritize their time somewhere else because I dont think its worth changing,RocketLeague,ctpzwfb,-1,t5_30cz1
4724033,0,t3_3flvhn,I think the ability to do this is already there its just not implemented as an option in the menus  so I dont think this would be a tough feature to add. Between matches your party already gets dumped into a practice field occasionally but it never lasts long enough to get any real practice in.If the problem is server slots perhaps one of the teammates becomes the server and the other players connect directly to them? That may change the underlying network code of the game too significantly though so Im not sure what a perfect solution would be.,RocketLeague,ctq05q8,2,t5_30cz1

4736650,0,t1_ctrd3zl,The solo v queue times can already be long off the peak and theyd be even longer for parties if there was separate queues. Not to mention growing longer when the initial hype around the game drops.Prioritizing premade vs. premade for the first minute or so might be an option but further fragmenting the community could really hurt the ranked play and the game overall. Having unranked variants for every mode already seems excessive as they only lead to less balanced games with the exact same gameplay.Even games like CSGO that are far more competitive popular and rely more heavily on good communication have a single queue for all ranked play party or not.Still I happily play solo and occasional party on both games and its fine.

Remember that the strike box of the ball is actually a circle and the car being a box has edges. I believe when i lead the ball with a barrel roll what im actually doing is hitting the ball slightly off center in that it would go leftright without the barrel roll as it is. The roll is there for the additional shove to influence the ball to head off with more power than just a bump off your car.Plus dont forget that a roll keeps your car much more stable when placing a head on collision. I often roll with straight shots to ensure that when i land after the hit im not disoriented.,RocketLeague,ctzi1cn,1,t5_30cz1

4827735,0,t3_3gywqt,Is it verified that only winloss ratio declares rank or are there possibly more variables which are contingent to the ranking system as a whole? I for one am  an  day player my win percentage is  last I checked and I have been consistently climbing the ranks. I am however starting to get into games that have players with a higher skill level than I do. Making it harder to practice things like aerials and goaltending for a newish player. That being said regardless of a win when I am not playing well I will only go up a few points in rank. However  when we win and I get an epic save  shots and  of my teams goals I go up  points. Same goes with losses. When we lose and I finish the game with  points I go down sometimes  in rank. Likewise when we lose and I finish the game with  points I only go down  points in rank.Its it possible that perhaps you are the rank that you should be and the algorithm is much more complex than you expect? Maybe that the game is saying hey this dude wouldnt enjoy any part of playing with these players that completely outclass them so lets give them an opportunity to play with players on or slightly above their level so they can have a chance to progress in their abilities to earn their way into the higher rankings.I leave you with this question would you throw a high school football team up against the winner of this years NFL Superbowl in expectation of the high school team standing a competitive chance?Edit this isnt directed at anyone in particular especially OP as I havent reached Veteran rank myself so I havent a clue how it differs up there but it is directed at anyone else sitting at  rank whinging about their insubstantial progression in the ranking system. ,RocketLeague,cu32qo3,1,t5_30cz1

I almost wanted to comment on how this should be intuitive just like it is in any other sport but youre totally right. There are way too many people that just chase the ball around which in turn puts them at a bad angle if they do happen to hit it. Planning ahead is huge. On a somewhat related note I tend to overdo then prediction thing sometimes like when Im expecting someone to hit the ball. Ill either jump up to block the shot or take a different angle to intercept a lot of the time. Problem is sometimes people miss which then makes me miss too since I predicted wrong.

Sending the ball back at our net on purpose.  Not going for the faceoff when they are in the lead position.  Everyone crashing the corners when they should be back ready for a pass. Sitting in goal in a game we trail in the last minute.   I might end up the lowest score on my team but I was for damn sure the only one playing like it was a team game.  I love when I spend a game setting up  shots that arent converted because the dingleberries were more interested in jamming the ball in a corner than just staying back since I was clearly on that already.

4883444,0,t1_cua1iw5,First of all we arent devs. So again theres nothing we can do about it. I cant break into their codebase and implement a report button.Second reporting might make you feel better but unless theres an army of people actually reading the reports its going to be an utterly useless system. Automated reporting systems can and are abused. People will get reported for playing poorly or for no reason at all. Someone has to sift through it.And third the internet and games on it arent a place where you get to force you views of respectful discourse on others. If a player is going to tell you to STFU he isnt a good teammate anyway so just ignore him. Find some friends and party with them. Or just learn to ignore stupid people on the internet.Fourth Ive seen far more caustic people on CSGO than Rocket League. And certainly more on CoD. For me people who complain about toxic people all the time seem nearly unbelievable because Ive seen so few. But I have an understanding that hey maybe I just go lucky or they got unlucky. But at some point maybe you need to look and say Hey if Im getting into an argument with someone every single game or Im getting told to shut up every game maybe its me?And finally no ones excusing their behavior. Were just trying to tell you we cant do anything about it because thats the way things are on the internet and maybe you need to grow up and be an adult about it instead of yelling at people on some tangentially related internet chat board.As a general rule of thumb respect is earned not given freely. Thats no excuse for telling random people to STFU but your attitude and behavior toward the subset of the community youre currently talking to certainly drained any respect I may have initially had.,RocketLeague,cua3h4e,3,t5_30cz1

4938852,0,t1_cugyopb,I dunno if its anything the Mods can do and its probably due to the fact the sub is new and the Esport scene has not emerged. But the my first aerial posts get old. The absolute hardon the sub has for Kronovi is ridiculous it is practically idle worship. How many posts a day are I summoned my inner Kronovi for this one? We all get it hes good and people like him which is fine. I think having someone of his skill will really progress the Esport. That being said you dont see people on a sports reddit posting summoned my inner Peyton Manning. Or let me post like everything Peyton has done ever. Seeing all of the Psyonix plz posts also gets old. Especially when its the same thing. How many move the replay let me save cars and requeue button threads do we need a week? I would like to see more discussion around strategy and see high level team play. Not someone who just flopped around and got lucky. Every now and then that is fun to watch but its to the point of over saturation. As I previously mentioned I think its due to the up and coming aspect of RL Esport that is really hindering high tier play to be highlighted. Yeah yeah I know CA but the play the same rotation strategy I want to see someone whip something else out. Someone needs to break the meta but we will never know. I dont know what you as a mod can do and dont take my comment as a jab at you. Its this community as a whole.  I think in large part because they dont realize a good play or a good post. As a SSARPBC vet alot of these gifsvideos and posts are quite mundane. To someone just starting its mind blowing or hilarious  how many times have you hit an aerial against a player lower than pro and blown their mind same concept and so it gets up voted.

So recently I would rather leave the match then start a match with bots. If bots replace leavers thats fine for me but starting with bots suck.

One approach is to roll is slowly towards them if coming from the front wait for them try and clear it and then try to block the clearance and hope the rebound will go in.  Another approach is to play it high above their goal from the corner so along the wall and aim for it to drop down near the centre.  As long as youre further back from the goal line their position will make it more difficult for them to clear and when it drops low enough will give you a better chance of scoring boost when appropriate of course,RocketLeague,cv3i863,5,t5_30cz1

Thats when I stepped back and tried to figure out if there was something I was doing wrong instead of it being my teammates all the time.Thats basically when at the beginning of a match I kinda laid back played defense and observed what my teammates were doing before I started doing anything.If i was playing with some crashing smashing ball chasers it was rare that I ever crossed the mid field line. Even in their crashing and smashing opportunities will present themselves for you to get a long goal or make a quick dribble move to take a shot.You just have to try your best to not let the other team score as your top priority for get about offense.

Player A who was aggro on defense takes ball down side B fills mid and C fills opposite neither go in unless a shot is up.Right image is defense. If ball is coming down A side he goes straight to the net B goes to cut off the ball since hes closest with a good angle and C goes back to cut off the front of the goal.Person IN net or the back side takes opposite side offense. Aggro takes ball down their side last guy gets middle. Simple yet effective.I always play the opposite side role when I solo Q and it actually has been winning me a lot of games. When I see a bad set middle I get ready to head back if I see the ball might be knocked to my side I go in. Just play smart really when your opposite ball.,RocketLeague,cvb54e8,2,t5_30cz1

So many times I missed a goal having the net wide open and no one around with people rotating and having someone back and ready we will score more while still maintaining a strong defense.The ball isnt in their red zone go back to goal and wait to clear it.

Players driving backwards from the front positions are usually going for the full boost.  It does stink if nobody is there to challenge the ball but shots from midfield are usually pretty easy to stop.  Kuxir allows his opponents to shoot in almost all of his vs and he rarely concedes a goal so check out his stream sometime and that may help.I recommend getting some friends.

5247366,0,t3_3msunq,It is very easy to spend other peoples money and not your own. So in an attempt to not sound ludicrous I wanted to preface this with we dont know what is going on behind the scenes.I will say that F has attempted to reach Psyonix to discuss the possibility of adding Rocket League in a LAN setting for a charity event were running for Extra Life in November to no avail. We have arguably one of the best teams in the world. If we contacted Valve for anything regarding our other teams in CS or Dota there wouldnt be this lack of communication. You will see valve do content for our player Yegor Markeloff Markelov in the upcoming major for CSGO where they sent a film crew to his home in which they contacted US in order to set it up.Why is this important?We even reached out to discuss the possibility of adding Esports Flags for the players similar to CSGO in an attempt to give players a piece of the monetizing of the game. Psy would get a large portion of the proceeds as Valve does for stickersCharacter Skins. This allows players to build a revenue to stream to justify being able to focus on being a professional player. This is meaningful because this means that when they are competing in competitions like GfinityMLG or ESL everyone will get the BEST of the players specifically because they would be able to practice to the best of their abilities without distractions financial of course. This also gives fans the ability to rootcheerand give sponsors some insight on how big the fan bases are for all teams.Now so people dont get the wrong impression FlipSid doesnt need the money per se but I see smaller organizations with teams that could absolutely benefit from this sort of system as we did on DOTA and still do on CSGO.Specifically you see CA without a sponsor and maybe they wouldnt need one long term if they could benefit from their success internally ex Team Secret.Personally I believe this is just something out of Psys element. No one could have predicted the success of Rocket League. Even at twitchcon members of twitch were talking about how fun the game is and how big RL was it was th at one point for overall numbers which shocked me. This post is NOT meant to disrespect anger or flame Psyonix. This is merely our way of enlightening the community on ways that everyone can make RL a legitimate eSport. It starts with posts like this informing Psyonix on how much the community would like to see large competitive tournaments.Once again we do NOT mean to offend anyone. We are trying to be very openhonest and direct about our opinions considering we have teams that compete in sold out stadiums currently. We would love to see MarkyKux and Mk experiencing those things as well.,RocketLeague,cvihvto,10,t5_30cz1

5279543,0,t3_3nb072,Dude yes. I love doing these and I pull them off often nowadays. The best part about self setup aerials is that if you are planning on doing one with a chip of the ball and you are quick to get up in the air you will ALWAYS beat the enemy to the ball if they go up for it too which basically guarantees a shot on goal if on target or at least a good push right up to their goal or even a pass to a teammate.The reason you will beat them every time if you are quick to go up for it after chipping is due to lag compensation the delay is enough that the other team is simply reacting to the ball going up in the past giving you a time advantage.,RocketLeague,cvmitnq,0,t5_30cz1

5287929,0,t1_cvnkpzs,I agree with this. I have alot of matches where I play somewhat of a utility and set up playsclear balls getting  points at a time if Im lucky but still doing alot for the team. Sometimes the saves dont count and if youre playing with a ball hog theyll likely have the high score because theyre hogging all the shots. You dont always score big even if youre playing well. Wouldnt be fair in that situation. If all plays counted about the same in points it would work. Short of that I cant think of a way this would work.  It would only encourage even more rampant ball chasing. ,RocketLeague,cvnlfop,1,t5_30cz1

What really matters is how often you win  if youre always winning but always finishing last the boost ball gods favor you and so do I because team players. Your wins say a lot more than your points do  this is why I think bad players have trouble leaving unranked and lowbronze  they dont play with the team and constantly complain about being stuck in a bad bracket because the mmr system keeps putting me with bad players.

That way the pressure is still on the opponents and your guys might get lucky and clusterfuck the ball into the goal. You can start to read when they are going to clear long down the wall or knock it across field you can work on your positioning and you should be fine.

I played a v game yesterday where I was up by one goal with not much time left on the clock so I boosted into the opponent to send them flying and then had a free shot for a goal. The  goal lead with a few seconds on the clock assured my win.ampnbspThey complained of course for having such a clean game until that point... but what most people dont realize is that hitting another player is much harder than hitting the ball since they can change direction without a moments notice jumpdodge to avoid you and if you are just going in for a bump they can boost into you and actually send you flying instead.,RocketLeague,cw810nt,3,t5_30cz1

I never loathe teammates or despise the opponents and I understand that the game isnt to blame. I find that when Im angry its because I know I could do better. I find the weaknesses in my play and learn from them. When I dont learn thats when I get angry. I think if people were honest with themselves about why theyre angry a lot of people would find they are angry for the same reason. In fact when you think this way I often admire the other players for scoring those tricky shots or making those advanced moves. ,RocketLeague,cw9kqdc,1,t5_30cz1

5460749,0,t1_cw9g0bw,Youre making it sound like they were preparing to own people in rocket league the fact that they have been doing it for so long just shows you how much they love the game and in my opinion they deserve it more than the people who just started. I see nothing wrong with this. There is no issue fact of the matter is if they did not exist.. there would be no esports  because people would take ages to even start discovering aerial stuff. Its because of the veterans that we know about all the advanced techniques that would take us a long time otherwise. I honestly believe if it wasnt for SARPBC veterans this game wouldve died much earlier because there would be no one to display the huge skill level and people would give up thinking there isnt much to the game.EDIT  Look at super smash bros melee that game started .. and there are people who played since it came out and people who got in years later and can still dominate. Think of it like this SARPBC veterans did the research for us new players the mountain that you wouldve had to climb if rocket league was a brand new game with no prequel to it would be a much much harder one than what it is right now. Right now because you already know the possibilities or the skill level that you can reach you have something to work towards and you wont give up thinking that all there is to this game is basic stuff. You will get to the veterans level way faster than them because you already have the knowledge you just need to practice and play. This is how it works with any competitive game just because others played longer doesnt mean you have no chance it only means they have more experience. In a few months you will see RL people coming up.,RocketLeague,cw9nuwt,3,t5_30cz1
5461442,0,t1_cw9pp85,Yeah I cant imagine there would be an issue but its always better to get permission to use a logo or trademark rather than just use it and hope its ok. Although they wont be selling the flag the flag will be added to a product that is being sold and I think legally they need to get permission to add someones trademark to a game before actually doing so. I mean a similar thing can be seen with the PS and Steam version differences. Because Sony owns the rights to Twisted Metal they probably had to give consent to the guys at Psyonix to implement Sweet Tooths ice cream truck into the PS version but they were most likely strictly told they werent allowed to distribute the vehicle onto other platforms. Reddit owns the Snoo logothe robot thingy which is what I assume Psyonix would use in a flag for the game and it directly represents Reddit itself so if Reddit doesnt want to be associated with the game then thats their prerogative. Heck they could say yeah put it in the game but only let Reddit member use it or somethinghow they would enforce that Im not sure but this is just as an example. its completely up to them whether they let Psyonix use the logo freely or give them certain parameters that must be met before they are allowed to implement it in the game.,RocketLeague,cw9r1r1,2,t5_30cz1

5475188,0,t3_3q1n7i,I firmly think that you should never play a role but simply adapt as the situation is given to you. If you are forced to play a role thats more a problem with the team. However I often find that people generally adapt to roles so you should be getting points the same way others do.Offense and defense are the big points in this game and its hard to exactly calculate what a midfielder contributes.Perhaps existing points could be fleshed out or expandedFor example maybe assists could also include bonus points for Clear Assists or Center assists wherein you assist a shot by centering or clearing a ball for your teammate to score. This would add some bonus points for you.Maybe another award could be created that recognizes midfield plays.Maybe if the ball is in the enemy zone and then it gets cleared past the middle line you have x seconds to shoot it back into the enemy zone thereby getting Zoning points. This would reward midfielders for keeping pressure in the enemy zone and act as a buffer in between goaltending and offense.By the way I firmly believe that adding medals post game rewards to the game would hugely benefit from distinguishing players for their roles.For example combining points for Assists  Playmaker  Demolitions  Clears  Centers should be calculated as Best Midfield and awarded to a player.In contrast Saves  Saviour  Epic Saves  Clears should be calculated as Best Defense and be awarded to a player.Perhaps adding bonus points for AFTER the game to boost scores would help in this regard as well.So if you get a Best Midfield award you get a bonus  pts for example.All this said I think its important to always be fluid in your role so if you play midfield you should really be playing whatever comes your way,RocketLeague,cwbi8qj,13,t5_30cz1

Youll be able to see over the ball to see what your opponents are doing to intercept you.Once youve done that for a while youll have a good idea of how to get around those intercepts. Then its just a matter of predicting how your opponent will approach while youve got ball control. Most of it will come down to timing and sharp hits. Keep the ball low stay on one side of it and slide the ball to the side by hitting it with your front corner when you expect an intercept attempt.,RocketLeague,cwc13u0,1,t5_30cz1

If your opponent if closer than you you will almost certainly not be able to make effective contact with the ball and youll be really far out of position if you try.

If the ball is still just boost into the sucker no dodging but not too fast otherwise you send it flying too far away from you to catch up and do an aerial. If the ball is moving toward you rolling. You can usually just drive forward into it even without boost and it goes almost straight up and in the direction you hit it.Or you can push it to the wall to roll up.Or you can get aerial balls that other people create on purpose or by accident.,RocketLeague,cwl7vh9,2,t5_30cz1

Then how come pretty much all the pro players these days are playing Dominus?  Its a DLC car which you said is worse and only look different cosmetically its not in the list of top cars in your original post yet they nearly all use it?Surely at the pro level theyre totally willing to switch main cars for a perceived advantage no matter how small.  Naturally everyone playing the Dominus now had a main car before for example Kronovi played the Paladin almost exclusively before he started playing Dominus.If the advantage youre saying the better cars have is there how come all the pros arent capitalizing on that advantage?,RocketLeague,cwqysos,2,t5_30cz1

5621545,0,t1_cwtr4hd,This is incorrect. If you have an MMR where it should be with around a  win rate then you will catch up. The bonus points will give you more for a win and less for a loss. With the bonus points say I get  bonus. I would get  points with against equal opponents and lose  points against equal opponents. Now if I lose and win every other match this might take a while because it is a two points for extra. Lets say if your points are something ridiculous and my MMR is around Gold II players but Im in Bronze II. I would get  bonus points. That means I would earn  points against equal opponents and lose  or  per the losses against them.What previously happened in Season  does not influence the difficulty of what is happening now. If your MMR is where it should be and you are facing equal opponents as well as if your RP is near your MMR closely you should gain and lose  points against them. If your MMR is below your RP then you lose bonus points to drag the RP down toward your MMR. If your MMR is higher than RP you add bonus points. Your MMR is effected by wins and losses. Its a variant of the TrueSkill Algorithm. The only thing that matters here is your Mu value since the Sigma value is most likely already at minimum cap. Win a game Mu goes up. Lose a game Mu goes down. If you go on a winning streak you will face opponents with a higher TrueSkill.Lets say you are facing a slightly better opponent. They should yield  points if you lose to them or  points if you beat them. Now lets say you now have around  bonus points for your RP to catch up to your MMR. That is  points for a loss against them and  points if you win versus them. That sounds pretty damn fair to me to catch up to your MMR. Lets say now they are very slightly better than you. So they will yield  points for losing against them and  points for winning. You have  bonus points. That is now  for losing against them and  for winning against them.By no means is this unfair it just might take some time.There are flaws in this system yes but not the ones you describe.Edit Mispell,RocketLeague,cwtwn0t,1,t5_30cz1

5639955,0,t3_3sa0be,This would kick ass. But you guys have to understand how much strain this would put on servers and matchmaking. you queue for a mutator match with any options. You then split that into every single combination of possible mutators and you have to find other players with the same preferences. I so hope they can figure something out thoughA vote like teodzero mentioned could be quite viable though as its a single server already in place,RocketLeague,cww6va6,1,t5_30cz1

5652120,0,t3_3siecs,You also need to specify what kind of processor you have. The only two is after a  second google search that natively appear to run at .GHz are the iS iMThese processors are from  and  respectively which is slightly old in the computing world and neither of these are one of the processors most frequently regarded as gaming beasts k k etc.. Even with this info it seems like this processor should probably be able to handle Rocket League adequately so assuming this isnt the issue...What are the other specs on your PC? Do you actually have a graphics card? If not then that means Rocket League is running entirely on your processor graphics included which would explain the  usage pretty easily. This is my current guess based on the info youve provided thus far.The easiest thing for you to do would be to hit your windows button and type in dxdiag and then Save All Information and upload this file so that we can read it and see what your full specs are.  is a great website for this you can just set the expiry to a week or something.After you do this it will be easier to figure out whats going on.

When and if that happens we can start asking Psyonix to change the way it all works for S.Were part way in to a season we cant just ask Psyonix to go throwing drastic changes at it now.

5817639,0,t1_cxi7g1r,As mentioned I think one of the best ways to compensate would be to change the replay system from mandatoryuntilunanimousoptout to a system with no ingame replays but with an added postmatchoption. In a game with  or more goals it only takes one player too stubborn to skip replays to cause everyone to spend an extra  minutes per game waiting around between goals amp kickoffs. Id much rather spend an extra  minutes waiting for a more optimized matchmaking system than spend that time watching replays. Add an option to the postgame screen to view goal replays if a players is so insistent on seeing them.At the very least it would be nice to limit the replays to one angle instead of two.,RocketLeague,cxi8dq1,2,t5_30cz1

It took me a while to notice but here is why I think once I start losing Im more likely to continue losing and get progressively worseAfter going on a losing streak I start playing very defensively. I dont go for the ball because Im always worried about shots on our goal. Its almost like my team is a man down because I let everyone on my team and the other team go for the ball first so that I dont end up out of position. Ive found solo standard is the absolute worst for this because its very easy to lose all faith in your team mates in this mode e.g. if you go for the ball but dont win it and your team mates didnt rotate then you get burned one too many times and stop going for the ball in those situations.And then on a different day Ill get some confidence back and suddenly be scoring amazing goals Ill start going for risky shots and chasing down the ball and Ill go on a winning streak and be the MVP every game.,RocketLeague,cxmbfx0,1,t5_30cz1

5923789,0,t1_cxvx3cq,Its because the server doesnt update the clients ball desync when the ball isnt in motion server side. I have had this happen to me personally and it definitely had nothing to do with lag after observation. If you notice all car positions never get repositioned. The player never gets repositioned only the ball.Ball doesnt move server doesnt update ball position clients iteration of the ball does whatever it wants after being hit on the client screen due to a small delay from the server causing the hit. Until someone hits the ball server side no ones screens gets updated.The fix for this is to update the ball even while it is not in motion on server side. Right now as is ball doesnt update when not moving at all server side. How it should be to fix the issue ball updates at least every quarter of a second or faster like the ingame tickrate.I could be wrong however this seems most likely and fits the scenario perfectly.,RocketLeague,cxw51t6,1,t5_30cz1

We get a HUGE turnout for all  events tonight being  teams. we had around  people show upWe originally started with around  teams which then turned into  immediately the next week. From there it has grown rather steadily and now its consistent with no less than  teams.As for player skill we do get some pretty large names involved. Ones that Im sure youve heard of Octanez  Pluto who hasnt missed a week since week  Kronovi Espeon and crew HuskihTheres many more but if you look at the top  in each game type a majority of those guys come out at one point or another. vVv has a real strong focus on nontoxic.

5933530,0,t1_cxwn9cm,And? Many other games have the same system in place and its not like you cant play togetherjust not ranked.What I would like to see is a change to unranked to penalise players who leave matches and no joining ongoing matches.I honestly dont get whats so boring about unranked. Its still the same game with the same rules in place. Currently its a shitfest because people leave the games all the time but that could easily be changed by a  min queueban for leavers and afk people to prevent people going afk ito circumvent the queueban for leaving.Its not hard to implement and would improve on unranked play a lot.,RocketLeague,cxxezr8,2,t5_30cz1

5952326,0,t3_3wyem4,When Season  first started everyones MMR was reset to the default amount  but with a preset Ranked Points based on their preseason rating. This caused Gold I players to be matched up with Bronze I players because they had near the same MMR. This is what made the very start of Season  so terrible. The aftermath is now MMR is now sorted out to be near a persons skill level on average Ranked Points trend better toward MMR and quitters no longer punish the nonleaving team by making them win less or subtract more points.I have a full detailed explanation of the current Match Making Hidden MMR and Ranked Points here Be sure and read it thoroughly.

Planning for a second touch amp setting up for it is far more reliable than deciding whether its possible to go for another touch after youve hit the ball as that time spent thinking loses you a lot of momentum.

With keyboard it can get tricky since you will have the same key for accelerating and pushing the car forward while in the air.

Yesterday I was playing v Ranked and normally turn my text chat to Team as opposed to All so that I dont have to see the offensive language that is thrown around ever so often in the game.  I decided to open it up to All just to see what type of players are playing on a Sunday morning.  The game went down to about a minute and I tied the game  and I got a chat message that simply said doubles? so i said sure and heshe says score so we can end it dont care about RP.  He let me score and we hopped into the best half a dozen games of Ranked doubles Ive played in a good long time. Ranked up approximately  points in doubles with a random player only communicating via text chat.

But there are also times where I went for a aerial and epic failie. tip to wrong direction or whiff. Shit just happens and its when good team mate has your back and you have theirs game is fun even if you are a few score short.Even casual queue have have really competitive people. Ive seen full team parties that like to stomp randoms but once random have some sort of competition and they cant get their way the party leaderusually the best player quits. I dont understand the exact reason of this but its casual no points involved so they can play anyway they like.Went back playing a few standard s after a few games got my first  game. And pretty close to Silv now and I dont feel any pressure. For people dissing casual queue quality it can get quite good especially facing coordinated team the pressure is overwhelming. And when you predicted the chain of events and are slightly off position just to see a goal went in helplessly you just have to grow and surpass that.I like tough opponents the better they are the more I learn.

6189450,0,t3_40bm9y,Not sure if I agree on taking the cap off of  points.  This really only seems like an issue that would occur for smurf accounts and that kinda thing really shouldnt be encouraged anyway.  Gibbs even said himself it effects his playing with potatoes account he didnt really mention his regular one probably because its more like he gets  points for a win since his MMR and RP are already high.Theres no point to wanting smurfs to climb RP faster although there would be a point to make their MMR climb faster. If you did this its just making it easier for the very top players to have more than  account in platinum.  Kind of unfair when platinum is for only the top  and there are season end rewards and all that.  And yes there are multiple people who have more than  account in platinum on at least  playlist already.Granted I think it probably WAS an issue at the beginning of season  because AFAIK everyones MMR got reset at season .

The reason that there is no best car is because what works best for you wont necessarily be whats best for somebody else. For example a lot of people like using Dominus because of its handling and intuitive hit box but I like the Octane for its easy dribbling and more easily controllable shots.  Theres a pretty general consensus of Dominus and Octane being the best ones to use but you should try all of the vehicles and see which one works best for you. ,RocketLeague,cywt1v3,3,t5_30cz1

6239002,0,t1_cyypkc4,Okay so let me tackle this since I put those teams at  and  while Cloud put them at  and  for Voltage and Turbulence respectively.For Voltage their win over Apollo was not as good as if they ed the full team hence why they are below SnK but they did beat three very strong players in Azi Huskih and magicgoodies. Voltage also only lost to Divine Entity during this period which was a power team consisting of Rizzo Jodari and Cinema. Because of this and the fact that they did not compete this past week I put them at the number  spot.I prioritized this past week over all the other weeks since being a Power Rankings list form is an extremely important note. By results alone I had that Turbulence gt Weebs gt Foremost. This incidentally put them in a spot just outside the Top  and because of their form compared to Voltage I put them in the  spot.If you look at what each of us ranked each team and especially the averages you can see that there was a definitive consensus about the Top  teams and then the next in the Rankings was Turbulence at . average. To land a spot in the Power Rankings you just have to be the best of two teams outside of that  lineup. Incidentally during these past couple weeks I thought Turbulence and Voltage were the top although it was definitely a tough call.Hopefully that cleared some of it up especially from my perspective where I actually did rank them both in my Top .,RocketLeague,cyyt2g6,1,t5_30cz1

6257886,0,t1_cz0hg5l,I respect your POV but the nefarious community servers were only a symptom of the core problem.The core problem remains that Valve stopped thinking about gameplay which led to the vast majority of long time players leaving the game altogether.This led to the situation you raise being a problem  the player base became younger game experience wise not age wise and unable to distinguish good servers from bad.Going back to the beginning of TF servers had always been run by the community. There were always some shit servers.The problem you raise only became an issue because the players no longer knew how to deal with them and Valve itself didnt care enough to actually solve the problem properly.Valve itself admitted that the Quickplay chance of January  was in their words nuclear. Yet  years later they have made exactly zero changes to it.Meanwhile theyre happily adding thousands of cosmetics amp skins to the game because theyre vital to the freshness of their Crate system... which is about the only thing fresh about the game.Valve basically decided that it wasnt worth the effort of keeping many of the long time players around as long as they could keep churning through new players.I suspect that its because many of the older players understand that the Crate system is a sham and its no longer worth supporting Valve because they stopped caring about the game years ago.Meanwhile new players join the game thinking wow this is great I can support Valve by buying keys. Which frankly is what I thought too... back in .TLDR if it comes down to it Id rather pay Psyonix a subscription fee for them to continue working on Rocket League and running the servers than have them waste their time on lottery systems.Its gameplay that keeps players playing. You can attract new players with shiny things but if you lose your old players all you end up with is a constantly churning player base.Its the worst situation for a high skill ceiling game like RL as when skilled players leave the remaining players of similar skill have no challenge so then they leave and it becomes a fast decline to a perpetually young community.On that note RL is going great ATM but IMHO Psyonixs greatest threat as Rocket League grows is going to be dealing with the toxic players.The game is awesome fun and the only times I think about stopping are when I encounter the douchebags who feel the need to abuse players. You can already see it becoming a bigger problem as more Steam players get online since the PS players are largely silent due to lack of keyboard.Muting players doesnt really address the issue and never has in any game because enough players dont know to use it and you have to cop some abuse before using it.,RocketLeague,cz0ybl9,1,t5_30cz1

6335110,0,t3_42do7a,My understanding is that MMR is actually a pretty good indicator of skill but that Psyonix believed that players would become frustrated when their MMR very quickly homed in on their actual skill and then stagnated because playing lots of games does not necessarily guarantee a true skill increase. So they hid the MMR and added RP which was designed to slowly move toward MMR thereby providing a sense of progression even while no actual skill is being gained.I personally dont like this system and would love to see my MMR and would not be discouraged if it stagnates. In fact Id see that as a useful signal that I need to try something new because Im in a rut.On the other hand Psyonix has a much bigger stake and investment in making this work so Im very willing to suspend judgment and see how it feels after a few weeks.,RocketLeague,cz9qdlu,3,t5_30cz1

6342255,0,t3_42i6x8,I think the most helpful thing to remember is that the chance of the enemy team having less skilled players is exactly the same as the chance of your team having less skilled players. The game is not conspiring to keep you in Bronze  so over a large enough sample of games you will climb if you are more skilled than the average person in Bronze .If you are genuinely playing better than your team mates consistently you will be a driving force that leads you to win more than half your games which is all you need to climb. If this isnt happening then the unfortunate truth is that you are just as skilled as your team mates on average.

6347892,0,t3_42kkn7,If you play with a controller try to come up with a scheme that allow you to move your fingers as little as possible. For me for example DS I have boost on L and driftroll on R with camera change on the square button. I dont have to move my fingers at all basically.And the most important one IMO  dont ever ever go for the same ball as one of your teammate. Ever. Try trusting them or prepare for the missing but placing yourself stuck to their rear end will only provide an opportunity for the other team to pass to guys in one go. If one of you miss both of you miss.,RocketLeague,czb6nhj,1,t5_30cz1

6349425,0,t1_czbbx89,gtThe issue was RP and MMR not matching up.Exactly this! Glad someone else sees it this way. In the current system you can be stuck in Bronze playing against SilverGold players because your MMR is high. That doesnt make sense. To me this proposed system sounds great. Your rank is based on your skill rating MMR not on your daily grind. If you consistently win your MMR will go up and eventually your rank. RP was not a good representation of someones skill especially in the lowermiddle ranks. I played bronze players that stomped me. Did they make it to silver? or gold? who knows it would depend on whether or not they put in enough time to grind through that mess.,RocketLeague,czbcxmf,3,t5_30cz1

6353240,0,t1_czbp6d4,My way is not incorrect it is different than yours. I developed it through just normal play and learning. My way works because I dont leave that far from the goal so I am always available for the block if I need to and because almost every time both players flop and the ball stays center the enemy goalie would always come for a beautiful shot and I would always end up barely making the save or sometimes not if he shoots it at a corner. The enemy goalie almost always goes up for the ball in that situation the trick is to already be on your way there with forward momentum and hit it over his head as hes coming for the ball. Your way is not better it is different. Im sure many people would have a hard time going for the ball my way and its not for them unless they want to practice it. It works for me and Ive scored many goals right after kickoff using this sometimes two in a row. I play in Gold  and no matter what if the two rushers bounce a distance from the ball you can better believe one of the goalies is going to go for it and thats not a bad thing.,RocketLeague,czbsk1n,1,t5_30cz1

6530782,0,t3_453acq,It seems like most players just jump right into ranked off the bat so games like yours are generally what happens when someone who at least figured out the fundamentals starts playing ranked. Having a friend helps as well as most new and sadly even experienced players have no idea how to play and actively rotate between the various roles. Theyll just chase the ball up walls and shit like a bellend when you perfectly set it up for them and all they had to do was boost straight down the middle of the field to tap it in. Or theyll set up for you you go in for the goal and then they come boosting in from the side like an idiot launching the ball off to your side of the field.I started off with plenty of practice vs friends as well before going into v ranked and I actually got bored of the game for a while because every single match was an effortless win most around the  mark but I managed to get as high as  once.

Some things though gt If I wanted to play only Dust and never any other map I could do that.Not that familiar with CS GO so tell me  if you want to play whatever ranked system they have there you have the luxury of choosing on which map youll be ranked ? Like everytime ?If so I dont find that very demonstrative of your overall skill level but nvmgt then it could potentially cause minor unbalance to the rankingsThats the part where I dont agree I think the consequence of adding Wasteland in ranked is that people have to learn how to play on Wasteland if they want to hold their rankings. So if both players have the same stats on flat stages and one has better stats on Wasteland I dont see that as an unbalance Ill see that as a better mastery.But once again I get you and your point of view.,RocketLeague,czvxd44,2,t5_30cz1

6543766,0,t1_czvuk8w,Matchmaking literally didnt change between Season  and Season . Nobody was ever matched up based on Rank Points. Thats simply not how the system worked. Since Season  started matchmaking has been based on a hidden matchmaking rating MMR. In Season  matchmaking is still based on the same hidden MMR value. The way MMR is calculated wasnt changed either at least Psyonix hasnt announced any changes to the way it is calculated between seasons. And there was no reason for it to change anyway. Matchmaking worked fine in Season  it was Rank Points that were broken. Bronze players would get matched up with Gold players. This seemed broken but the reality was that on the backend both the Bronze and Gold player had similar MMRs so they were matched up. The game was balanced but RP values were drastically disparate in games because the RP was intentionally slow to adjust compared to MMR.Now thats not to say that matchmaking wasnt impacted by Season s launch but its simply not impacted in the way youre claiming it was. The way matchmaking happens literally hasnt changed at all. The only thing that changed when Season  launched is that your MMR was reset. I use quote marks because MMR wasnt really reset it was just kind of reset. By that I mean everybody doesnt start out at the same MMR in Season  rather your Season  MMR is strongly influenced by your Season  MMR.For the sake of example lets say that your average Season  Gold  player is roughly equivalent to Season  Rising Star players in terms of MMR. I dont know if this is true Im just guessing for the sake of example. Now if your MMR was at this level in Season  that does not mean you were Gold . It simply means you were being paired with players who on average played at a Gold  level. I say on average because Gold  was not a representation of MMR it was a representation of RP which only trended toward your MMR over time. You could be Bronze and playing against Gold  players because your MMR was at the same level as your average Gold  player. In Season  this will no longer happen because your division is tied directly to your MMR. If youre a Rising Star you should expect to play with primarily other Rising Stars with some wiggle room of course especially if your MMR is trending up or down. Unlike in Season  where Bronze and Gold would frequently be seen in games together because the divisions literally had nothing to do with matchmaking.Regardless of all that the actual way MMR is calculated has not changed and the way matchmaking uses it has not changed. The only thing impacting matchmaking at the moment is the reset of MMR from Season s launch. When you combine the reset with the low player counts in competitive mode right now due to all the hype over Rocket Labs you should expect competitive matchmaking to be temporarily wacky. It will quickly stabilize though. Just give everybody some time to get some competitive games under their belt so their fresh MMR stabilizes. No need to panic yet.,RocketLeague,czw6ftk,1,t5_30cz1

The thrill of getting near or further away from Gold I was driving me to play more and more. Me and my friend were playing much more tactically and losses encouraged us to play better until we came up with a really good strategy. The feeling of improvement was amazing. Now that the ELO system is gone every game feels just like a casual game and rank isnt that appealing anymore. This is one of my favourite games and it really angers me and saddens me at the same time to realise that its simply not as enjoyable as before. Terribly sorry,RocketLeague,czwdnh3,19,t5_30cz1

6572295,0,t3_45nibf,I guess Ill throw in my two cents...SK Gaming vs. Flipsid Tactics |  FThis is Flipsids last opportunity to take some wins to further secure themselves a decent spot in the playoffs and I expect them to play as such. However SK has series wins over myXMG and Noble both  both of whom were able to take two games each off of F. I expect SK to at least one game.Crown amp Jewels vs. myXMG |  CampJIn their last three weeks going back one extra week for CampJ to compensate for last weeks bye myXMG and CampJ have gone up against the same three teams Noble Spectral and Flipsid. Both teams won  over Noble both teams won  over Spectral but myXMG took two games off F while CampJ took one. I think it is underestimated how close these two teams are and am definitely looking forward to this series.Supersonic Avengers vs. Noble eSports |  SAComing up to the th week of the Pro League Noble is still the only team in EU that has yet to win a series. Meanwhile Supersonic Avengers are coming off a win over Flipsid in the previous week and have shown no signs of slowing down. Interestingly Noble has taken exactly two games in every series so far so I wouldnt be shocked to see this trend continue. However I expect SA to take a hold of this series.Apollo  vs. Kings of Urban |  KoUKoU and iBP may be the biggest rivalry in Rocket League right now. iBP took RLCPL  last week but a few days ago KoU won their series in IRCL  against iBP. Both teams swept FTL and iBP swept Apollo so I expect Kings to be capable of the same. I foresee no more than one win for Apollo in this series.Failure to Launch vs. Untethered |  UntetheredAnother matchup that Im very excited for definitely the most interesting series for NA this week. Untethered have had a strong last two weeks with a very impressive showing against KoU and a strong series over Mock last week. However last time FTL played was a  win over OC and OC won in their series against Untethered. I say Untethered takes this but it will be a close series.iBP Cosmic vs. Orange Creamsicle |  iBPIn their last three weeks OC are  having recently been swept by Kings and dominated by FTL . However last week iBP won their series against KoU and so far have only lost  games  of them from Kings the other from Mock when they were  in NA. With Gambit I could see them taking a game but without him I couldnt imagine it and having a full roster has never been their strong suit. Another sweep for iBP Cosmic. ,RocketLeague,czz4omg,6,t5_30cz1

To me Underpass would be strange as a v map as would Double Goal.  Really I think the only queue that should have different map options should be v in my opinion. Edit To be more clear to me Doubles and Standard are so similar that any map thats fine on standard should be fine for doubles unless we go massive with maps. v I can see the argument since there isnt really any passing and the objective is to out maneuver a single person or mind game them I could even get behind a standard pitch only set for v.

To get better you simply have to try shit all the time youve never done before.

Supersonic Acrobatic Rocketpowered Battlecars was the old title and Im sure it was changed just to shorten it not because they were trying to make it a more  friendly game. As you notice from higher level game play people will do it as often as possible to throw the other team odd and give you a larger advantage on scoring. Also stealing boosts from the enemy as frequently as possibe will further isolate their game play.

He tried to switch teams by doing the  v  but they werent having it and kept on exploding the guy. In the end we lost but the other team called the guy that tried to switch teams the worst fucking player they ever encountered and more words that I wish I can recall. Whole party left afterwards.

Since then no matter who Ive played Ive just been dropping Divisions fast regardless of my WL record against quality opponents.

Youre saying lets leave the money out in the open for anyone to access keep it guarded but let people who want to take the money take it and then arrest them after they have. This is what is implemented now people can delete the map but its guarded.What i was saying was to put that money behind a door and lock it up but also keep it guarded with the same security you had before. I wanted people to not be able to queue up with modified maps locking up the money which prevents people from cheating stealing the money.

6816967,0,t3_494cgb,First learn how to aerial backwards. If you can do this then start to practice going up on the wall jump off of it and start doing some spins then try landing with your nose facing the ball. This may seem pointless but it will help you learn how to control your freestyles later. Next go into pro striker training and find the shot where it rolls in front of your goal. Start freestyling by lifting off normally then holding your air roll button once you have enough air.  If you have thrown yourself too far stop air rolling and orientate your car towards the ballthis is where the wall training comes in handy. Use the remainder of your air time to try to make contact with the ball. Dont be worried about freestyling at the end just try and hit the ball.I call this specific type of freestyling launching since you dont actually control your freestyle from the beginning and are instead almost throwing yourself to where the ball is going to be.A controlled freestyle is when you boost during your air roll rotations to push your car towards the ball as you freestyle. You should naturally learn this if you practice the basic freestyle.You will eventually want to start your aerials by freestyling and this will take a lot of practice. A large amount of the freestylers will do the Kuxir Twist to start of their aerials.  To do the Kuxir Twist hold your analog stick in either bottom corner  air roll and boost. To correct your flight path begin by tapping your stick in the opposite bottom corner that youll use to spin. The Kux Twist is very difficult to learn and is frustrating to those starting out freestyles so I suggest that you begin by launching yourself if you dont feel comfortable freestyling yet. I went more indepth with a freestyling guide I made but this is sort of the TLDR version.,RocketLeague,d0p01sb,2,t5_30cz1

You cant make a player rating determination based on a single overtime goal. If Paschy tips the ball and it bounces back towards the CampJ goal and F scores then according to your method the player rating would be reversed and your analysis reversed as well? Really?You see this done is sports post game analysis all the time and its super lazy. The spurs win a finals game  by  points and are praised for their experience and fundamentals. If they lose that game by  points the post game crew would call them too old and suggest they bring fresh blood.

Im to the point where I am regularly beating v so I feel pretty confident there.I have a buddy thats started playing doubles with me as you suggested but hes still in low Challenger tier so the skill differential can be frustrating at times.  Might need to look into getting a new teammate or encourage him to practice more.The biggest issue with advancing in solo standard ranked seems to be teammate consistency though I could easily be wrong.  It just seems that every time I get back to Rising Star Division V I get  teammates on their warmup game for the day and then I get bumped a division down and have to work my way back to only be bumped down again.I dont mean to sound overly confident in my abilities but I think I would be a strong contender within the Shooting Star rank just cant catch a break to actually get the promotion!,RocketLeague,d0w720j,1,t5_30cz1

7004595,0,t1_d1ab0i8,. There is no DefenderAttacker scheme. It is situational. You see your teammate will try to pass? Move in a better position for him and you for passing. You also see that the opponent is in between and that a pass would not work? Move away. Only real defending tips I can give you are If the opponent is on the attack one teammate should pressure him while you stay back more. If they come over the corners etc. defend from the goal line. Thats really Important. Not  meters out of the goal not near the corner but from the line. It makes a huge difference.. Striker allstqr training. The balls are not slow.

I can barely use all  of my boost to hit the ball in the air once let alone remain flying under it hitting it...I cant do this but I can see how to practice it. Practice two thingsFirst go into free play with infinite boost and practice jumping into the air angling our car vertical like a rocket and tapping the boost just enough to hover and then balancing so you stay up and then moving around the map with quick boost taps. Seems weird but its not hard to get used to that. Within twenty minutes of practice you can fly around the map without hitting walls I bet.After that the next part is to practice with boost limit turned on and practice boosting up to a wall going up the wall vertically then jumping off and angling yourself into your beforelearned verticalboosttapflying. Once you have the skill of being able to jump off the wall and fly to a goal then it just becomes a matter of playing games and using opportunities to make attempts and hope that you can pull it off. ,RocketLeague,d1av9cv,6,t5_30cz1

Thats insane and I never willingly did this. If you mostly play with the same teammates play with someone else. Try a new car. Maybe a really different one like Scarab or Merc. Post on rrocketleaguecoaching and get a mentor to critique your play. This one was amazing for me. Play  or  matches in Rocket Labs. Since I didnt have any builtup patterns for those maps I was forced to be on my toes constantly and that came back with me to the regular maps. Play a different mode like v especially this or even v dunno maybe it could help. Warning v can be hazardous to your emotional wellbeing. If you start to get frustrated take a break. Watch a tutorial video and then play some unranked matches trying to focus on doing the things from the video. Something on basic mechanics is probably better than something fancy like air dribbling or freestyling but whatever works works. This tutorial on striking is amazing and made a real difference for me.The nice thing about ruts is that on the other side of them is a jump in skill level.

Theres gonna be thousands of teams for you to measure yourself against but do not expect to end up going to the finals it just isnt gonna happen. Rather see how far you get and look to improve the next time. The reason why there are so few top players is because not many people want to go through the process it takes to become one.

7057384,0,t3_4c9p33,Learning how to control your car in the air at unusual angles is one of the most difficult things to learn because your brain has already established a strong connection of right  right left  left back  up forward  down. As you become better at controlling your car in the air from normal angles relative to the ground you develop such a fast feedback loop that you actually subconsciously stop paying attention to the position of your car meaning youre ignoring the visual representation of it on the screen and start flying by feel almost entirely. Then all of the sudden you start introducing all these wacky angles into the mix and that feedback is completely broken in your brain and you are essentially starting from scratch.It is possible to learn how to fly just as proficiently upside down or any other angle for that matter obviously because weve all seen other players do it in montages as you do at a normal angle but it takes a lot of time and you have to do a lot of relearning to throw the factor in the angle of my car by looking at it step into your loop.Here is a really interesting video that demonstrates one such example of how your brain develops a very strong relationship with a feedback loop system and then becomes completely broken when you reverse just one component of the system. ,RocketLeague,d1gbb3t,13,t5_30cz1

7080031,0,t1_d1iv0hw,Hey thanks for responding. The beastly machine comment was for people who would diagnose the issue as potentially being fps lag that I was misinterpreting. Yes my thoughts are that its definitely a network issue. In regards to speedtest and pingtest my gf was streaming Netflix on the TV and I was streaming Spotify highest quality while I did these testsSpeedtest  Ping ms  Download .mbps can be up to mbps on good days  Upload .mbps      ampnbsp  Pingtest  Packet loss    Ping ms  Jitter ms    ampnbsp  Fairly high jitter but I cant see why that would cause ping spikes as high as ms consistently and only on Rocket League. The rubberband is so bad some games that the ball will fly into the back of the net and bounce back out again on my screen before it registers as a goal.Thanks again for offering your help any insights would be appreciated. ,RocketLeague,d1ivx2u,1,t5_30cz1

7083162,0,t3_4cje23,Hi I made a post on the Steam forums regarding the Batman Car. I said I strongly disliked the Boost Sound it makes. The post simply disappeared without any kind of moderator message. So I reposted my concern regarding the boost sound a few hours later.That apparently was reason enough for one of your anonymous moderators to give me a permanent ban for spamming...Is that how it works? I can give you my money but if I dont like something and say it it gets deleted without comment and upon reposting I get permanently banned from all forums including the Search for Teams section? Wow!You sure made a great game but if complaining about certain aspects almost immediately leads to a permanent ban I dont think Ill be able to keep supporting this great game. I bought the Batman Car three times to support your game was utimately very disappointed by the annoying boost sound it makes and now Im permanently banned for daring to voice my criticism.

I blew up a really nice guy middribble a few feet from my goal in a ranked v then blew him up again when he respawned and moved in to save my retaliatory shot pushing me into the lead with only a couple of seconds on the clock. It had been a really delightful close match up until then with lots of Nice shot!s and Thanks!s and Close one!s from both of us. Didnt even get a gg out of him after that and honestly I dont blame him. Id have been hella annoyed. I apologised profusely at the time.On the other hand I once blew up a guy in unranked v to stop him making a save. I replied No problem. to his barrage of sarcastic thanks. He spent the rest of the match demanding that I apologise to him which I found hilarious. We ended up playing together for about an hour and a half more him not wanting to leave until hed forced an apology out of me and me not wanting to leave because Id never seen behaviour so odd or entertaining in Rocket League. After a while he got kind of annoying scoring own goals whenever we were on the same team but someone else in the match would typically switch sides to balance it out.

The evidence that the position cannot be held long is right here also.gtHowever he may have uncovered an abuse in matchmaking by finding ways to queue and boost the way he wants.This is exploiting and breaking the ranking system but Im not trying to get into an argument about the definition of breaking is.gtTheres nothing wrong here in the ranking systemTheres a chance youre right but Im not sure how you can look at the numbers youve presented and come to the conclusion that there is no question here that this is normal especially with his name which is a clear message.

7173164,1,t1_d1tahmw,gtThis is exploiting and breaking the ranking system but Im not trying to get into an argument about the definition of breaking is.Its not breaking the Ranking System. The Ranking System is placement via Hidden MMR. Thats it. Theres nothing more to it. Skill Rating is just Hidden MMR going through an equation. The only thing odd here is that he is close to or at  in v with the highest Skill Rating. Hidden MMR and skill rating as well both go up through wins and down with losses depending on the difficulty of the match. In order to get to the  spot he would need to raise his MMR. There is nothing wrong with the Ranking System in this aspect. However it may be a problem with matchmaking where he could play the system to get matches he might be guaranteed to win. gtTheres a chance youre right but Im not sure how you can look at the numbers youve presented and come to the conclusion that there is no question here that this is normal especially with his name which is a clear message.Because I saw Mu and Sigma. His Mu and Sigma values are normal. Sigma is at .. He has a total of  matches played. Theres nothing hinting that he has a high Hidden MMR by cheating the Ranking system. The only plausible explanation is he exploited or dominated in v matchmaking and grinded to the top of v. This system is grinding after all going from  to top.,RocketLeague,d1tirz2,0,t5_30cz1

Just because they dont play competitive matchmaking a lot doesnt mean theyre abusing the system of demonstrating some flaw. Those are some of the best players in the world and they deserve to be at the top. The rankings are based on skill. You shouldnt have to grind much to climb a skill based leaderboard and you shouldnt have to play a ton to remain on top of a skill based leaderboard as long as you arent completely inactive. The only thing I think needs to be changed is for some minimum activity requirement to be implemented for a player to remain ranked. If you go inactive you shouldnt lose your skill rating but you should be hidden from the leaderboard until you win a handful of games. Very few players on your list fall into this category though. ,RocketLeague,d1uc80o,0,t5_30cz1

Its the reason I included this in the instructions If youre using the Controller version you should unbind the Gamepad Quick Chat commands and have them bound only to keyboard It was the only way I found to get it to play nice with the existing quick chats and also still use the dpad for custom chat selection.EDIT Yeah looks like that is a limitation in AutoHotkey  Not sure I wanna add thirdparty code to try and work around it,RocketLeague,d2u0p2l,2,t5_30cz1

However the amount you move is about equivalent to the differences in length of hitboxes between cars.

7561855,0,t1_d316nfm,gt Currently there are thousands of players in v who are being put at a disadvantage by being matched against these toptier players abusing the system.I promise you the majority of players on lopsided teams that youre matched up against arent abusing the system. Theyre playing with friends who happen to not be ranked exactly the same thing. Happens all the time. Zero of my IRL friends are my rank but I queue ranked with them because unranked play generally sucks in my opinion.Also not that this solves anything but as someone whos often queueing with lower ranked players its not as fun or advantageous as you might think. I generally feel more confident that Ill win queueing v with randoms than with someone ranked way lower than me. Plus in order to win lopsided matches I usually have to play hero ball which frankly isnt that fun for anyone myself included.Its not a problem that can be easily fixed. Taking the higher players MMR exchanges one problem for another. Disallowing players with vastly different skill levels from queueing together would also exchange one problem for another.The only reasonable solution I see would be to match lopsided teams against other lopsided teams which might make the matchmaking process prohibitively slow.,RocketLeague,d31qvu4,1,t5_30cz1

YMMV Ive barely practiced aerials without ball cam.Other times to turn off ball cam whenever the ball is popped straight up high and right above you and also when youre headed back on defense caveat make sure opponents arent about to make a longshot while you arent looking also your teammates will now hit you much more than you hit them and this will probably be irritating,RocketLeague,d38fk9t,1,t5_30cz1

That is the nature of solo q.You need to continue to play increase mechanical skill and you will slowly rise up. You cant expect to win all or even half your solo q games at first.

7671609,0,t3_4kdjmx,Go into Freeplay and try these following methodsSimply hitting the ball. Drive into the ball from the side. Flip into it to roll it up the wall. Follow it up and touch it while staying on the wallHitting the ball when it is not touching the wallThere are two parts to this one is to move the ball to the middle of the pitch and one is to move further down the pitchMiddle. Hit the ball so the it is near the wall but not on it. Jump when your car is right next to the ball.. Side dodge into itForward. Hit the ball the same way. Jump a small distance before your car is lined up with the ball. FRONT FLIP EDIT I forgot about the more advance method that increases the range of the these movesHow to boost to ball far away from wall. Go on wall until you are at the appropriate height. Jump at the times indicated that depend on which dodge you are trying to do. Move the analog stick down to boost away from the wall and move it up to boost toward the ball. Move the analog stick right if you jump off the right wall to move up and vice versa. Execute either dodge method depending on the situationWall drags. Start Freeplay. Hit the ball from the side but jump before you hit it so it stays low. Move to the leftright side of the ball depending on where you want to hit it.Go left if you want it to go right. Jump once right as soon as your back wheels line up with the banners or when the front of your car lines up with the bottom of the ball.. Air roll I would say a kuxir twist but it maybe a barrel roll. Its second nature to me so idk which it is. Feather your boost and hit the ball when you are not boosting. Follow it up and scoreEDIT  lt here is a video of me doing a wall drag in case if instructions are difficult to followHope this helped. It takes some practice.

Then because theyre demoralized they play worse and it becomes a feedback loop of frustration. Goofing off and being able to not take unranked seriously has been my best way to break that loop.It helps when youve got a friend or two to play with too one that plays off of your humor well. I got into v with a group of guys yesterday and had an absolute blast completely ignored the chance at a loss. Did stupid defensive formations where we were lined up and let the other team act as a firing squad on us and our net.

7768561,0,t3_4lpj4s,The trash talking doesnt bother me so much. Im usually too lazy to respond and if it gets too immature I just mute them. If this is your experience with Rocket League I would highly recommend muting all chat in settings. Ignorance can be bliss. Just play your game and ignore the ragers. What does bother me is that there seem to be so many people who just cant handle losing and quit too soon.A bunch of my buddies play the game and were all a pretty mixed bag when it comes to skill level. Well often do Chaos simply because there are many of us playing at the same time. Lately it has been hard to find decent opponents. We never quit the game even when getting absolutely trashed. The same opponents who were winning in the previous game are quitting as soon as they are  goals down or worse as soon as we equalize in the next match. It just seems that so many people cant handle being on the losing team. Im not talking  down and then you quit although I personally wouldnt want to quit that match either. Im talking about a match that is pretty close throughout and then we take a one goal lead. The result is that almost every full match we actually play is a match we lose. And a match were actually doing good at ends too early because the opponents forfeit. Or worse we end up playing vs one poor dude and three bots.Weekends are better since there are more people playing and a larger pool of players who just want to have a fun match win or lose. Usually when you find a team like that we just keep on playing each other for awhile.,RocketLeague,d3p81rx,1,t5_30cz1

To be brutally honest with you Veteran is a pretty low level and the average players skill level has shot up drastically in the past  months since you last played you have a lot of catching up to do A huge thing thats been bouncing around in your absence is theyve given the ok on rd party programs within reason which includes being allowed to use training gems like Rocket League Trainer. If youre looking to get back into the swing of things sooner than later i recommend checking this out firstOther helpful tips Ballcam is your friend. Carcam has its momentary usefulness but Ballcam is where its at and anyone who tells you otherwise has unintentionally hindered their own gameplay to get where they are.  Turn Camera Shake off Consider rebinding your keys while youre rebuilding muscle memory. Its personal preference but many people have great results rebinding boost andor driftair roll to L and R LBRB Rotating teamplay is pretty standardized now across s and s. s   forward  defenseman. Rotate accordingly s   forward  mid  defenseman. Ideally the forward rotates to defenseman defenseman rotates to mid mid rotates to forward etc. Exceptions to the rule being if the forward has a better followup opportunity than the mid then common sense says to chill and let them do their thing.

There will be lots of ball chasers and in these instances you just have to play a solid defense and only strike when you have a perfect shot.   Youll have unfortunate teammates at every level of play you just have to do your best to carry the team and play smart.

As long as YOU are not the weak link in your team your team should have the advantage if your teammates and opponents are the average players at that rank.Ranking up is frustrating when you are stuck playing with people not at your skill level especially if youre a more teamplay focused player like me. I ended up burning out around Challenger Elite Havent played since then which is when people finally started at least seeming a little competent At least  months ago.

He cannot expand it on normal mode with people below his level and everyone pretty much doing their own thing  only in Ranked. Now all of a sudden psionyx throws in a giant effin huge curveball into his progress. With Tokyo there is now a  of him not getting a standart map and thus him not learning as much as he would like.But you are learning as much on these maps as on any other map. He might expand his knowledge on how the ball in a more general context and not just in in the closed enviroment of normal maps. But it is not the damn time for that yet.With him complaining about that he obviously sees still holes in his game which he needs to improve on. I can see why the top  of players would vote towards fun maps because they are complete players they can almost perform any play they envision and those ballinteractions are basically the only place left to evolve for them on top of being probably fed up with standarts due to high playtime and repitition.But for everyone who tries to play this game competetively not as in going to rlcs but rather trying to improve day by the day watching your own replays reading tutorials analitcally watching pros this is a huge backstab as they enforce new variables upon us when we are still trying to master existing ones.  Having the one Map in CSGO is not equivalent to having the only the standart maps in RL  that would be swapping the csgo weapons with unreal tournament ones.Just like sudoku your trying to get that midlevel x grid and BOOM all of a sudden there a x grid level.An RPG?

Like if you banned basketball but no other ball games. gtI think I would be a higher rank if not for those pesky smurfersI was grand champ last season boosters dont reach that high if they do it right they play against stars or challengers. I dont even plan to play ranked this season except s. gtlimiting who can play together is selfishNo its not wanting to play with friends and being willing to ruin others games to achieve that is selfish. Agreeing with a measure that makes that harder prevents that. gtremoving the possibility for the top  to easily boost would somehow move you up on the leaderboard LOL. I know I said I wont play ranked this season but I cant ignore that.  of the top  last season was boosted. Pros werent bothering to play ranked because they couldnt climb unless they boosted. The  player in doubles would be destroyed by any player from either power ranking EU or NA. there was literally no point in trying to climb without boosting. And there were  posts a day from lower ranked players on the sub with screenshots of smurfs even when people knew it would be fixed purely out of frustration with what boosters were doing. The system was fucked and this limitation was necessary. gtI have already laid it out repeatedlyOh yah my bad you mentioned it once halfway through a paragraph without identifying it as the idea you had. Silly me. That idea would ensure that parties playing with their friends lost almost every time. If you belong at a rank you win  of games there with a teammate of the same rank. If you had a worse teammate even by a couple of ranks youd get destroyed. You cant carry against two people who are as good as you thats the point of the system. ,RocketLeague,d4jxuo8,-1,t5_30cz1

8045876,0,t3_4p3do8,Wasteland was their first nonstandard map.  There was no rocket labs  so unranked was the only place it could go. Unranked was the lab. Then they introduced Rocket Labs.  Its still an unranked playlist.   Maybe they always intended to have the same rotation of maps in both and introduced rocket labs to feed the pool.   The purpose of unranked is to have casual matches. Perhaps they want that to be the only difference between the two modes and not have seperate map playlists. I play ranked almost exclusively because I hate all the quitting and bot subs etc.  I want to play the same team from start to finish and play hard to win. Look at it this way There is now one official Rocket League map set.   You can play these maps competitively or casually.  Rocket Labs lets you test new maps before they become part of this official playlist.  They also wiped everyones ranks with a new competitive season. It seems to me that they wanted to do it this way so the entire player base knows all the official maps and has equal exposure to them regardless of casual vs competitive.  ,RocketLeague,d4kfl30,2,t5_30cz1

8050491,0,t1_d4kalxu,I mean dont you think theres a chance that a map voting system would make it easier to play the new maps?  Disregard all the options for the specific type of voting that could be implemented.  Last night I wanted to try Pillars.  Do you know what I played after waiting several minutes to find a game in a queue with lt  players ... I played Cosmic Cosmic Retro Utopia Pillars Cosmic Cosmic.  Yay... I played the new map once.  So my options are play it with Bots play it by myself or take the gamble and play it potentially once in  games ... maybe more maybe less.I know what youre driving at and why you think map voting defeats the purpose of Rocket Labs testing. It opens the potential for players to skip maps and avoid playing them all together thus not testing them.  Theres ways around this such as allowing only one map to be played twice in row before a random map is selected for the third game or allowing each vote to represent the percent chance of playing a specific map with a random generator ie like a wheel with slices of different sizes representative of voting input.  It would essentially give me the same odds of playing the maps as if there was no voting or possibly even better because most people would vote to play the newly added maps and thats the purpose of the playlist to play the newly added maps.Theres no reason to be such a zealot against map voting especially when you admitted to not knowing how the different voting systems like the Mario Kart voting system work. Its possible to implement and not lose the supposed purpose of Rocket Labs.  The system currently is off putting and you can see it represented in the player base for this playlist.  Im glad you started the conversation on these maps but keep an open mind.,RocketLeague,d4ky8dg,1,t5_30cz1

All with a below average teammate this was Prospect in the new season as we ranked up who clearly was not up to par in terms of positioning striking or much of anything else.

If they were truly placement matches people would get placed into something other than prospect. I was shooting star and I think I got placed prospect three. Youd think placement matches would just be matches where you have an extreme flexibility in your rank so it fly s around for the first  games.

Work on your clears  try to disrupt your opponent attack as quickly as possible. Work on your rotation  this one is a little bit harder if playing with randoms. Generally try to play on the safe side if your teammates are too reckless but if theyre conservative dont be afraid of trying to steal ball possession from the opposing team if someone has your back or leaving the net for a solid hit if you see someone coming back to replace you.,RocketLeague,d4pq4lw,4,t5_30cz1

Even if you only lose half of the points its enough reason for people to boost with a second account. Moreover it would encourage people to insult and make their random teammates leave so they dont lose all their points.And finally there is usually a reason why your teammate leaves. Do you really think you would turn the game if your mate stays till the end but only does sht? Dont forget that leaving gives a  min penalty so your mate is probably very sure that he is useless in this match.Ofcourse you could increase the penalty for leavers by making them lose double MMR by leaving but that is unfair for people who have a bad connection and get disconnected by mistake.,RocketLeague,d4sdnfd,2,t5_30cz1

8130544,0,t1_d4tw4a7,Think I got it now. Its just a lot easier on mouse and keyboard because you can hold W and A together instead of holding your analog stick diagonally. This also makes you roll faster. I remember there being something about playstation controllers having an advantage regarding this as the input of their analog sticks record in a square rather than in a circle.With controller I can now get the same result as you but the tap on the boost is necessary to keep in the air just that bit longer to allow you to roll. Either that or you have to jump a bit higher before you flip.Anyway thanks for all the help!

I give rats ass about my personal stats nor if i lose or win as long as the game is balanced and fair play. Turns out there are people out there who dont need to win to feel good but enjoy the challenge. For campers there is no fair challenge. I can do that too and what happens is nothing... If you feel good about doing nothing and winning then go ahead In this video thou we shouldve seen what happened before how long was this going on.. Cause it just might be that the goalie actually never left the goal but is also camping and this came as a response to that.. There are a LOT of games and sports where inactivity is punished simply because in a lot of games responding to opponent has huge advantage over the initiative action.

8247054,0,t3_4scu45,I hated the titles. They all imply a certain degree of skill with the game when they really mean very little aside from how much youve played. Moreover the titles themselves are kind of silly because you reach the prestigioussounding ones way too quickly. I had maybe  hours in this game when I hit Expert and let me tell you I was anything but an Expert at the game by that point. Im now  hours in and one level short of Legend.  Im alright but Im definitely no Legend or even a Master of Rocket League so they sound kind of dumb. Plus I run into Legends and Rocketeers who I completely curbstomp with about the same frequency as I run into Veterans and Experts who fuck me up. I would much rather the titles come from achievements in the game rather than simply time played.  Perhaps the Certified items could grant various scoreboard titles upon reaching certain milestones do they already do this? or you could receive a title for your highest ranking in the previous season.If the titles meant something Id make mine visible. But they mean almost nothing. And on top of that sometimes I have bad days or games and I dont need the silly title under my name in those situations so that people can quip hue hue r u really a legend?? ,RocketLeague,d58fr5j,4,t5_30cz1

8249227,0,t3_4sej59,Not awful for  hours. Thats really no time at all. Good on you for using ball cam.A couple of things I noticed. You give up on possessing the ball too easily. A few times you just rolled it to your opponent with no attempt to retain possession. Especially when your opponent is giving you room you dont have to flip into it. Just dribble it. Youll make mistakes but the more you try to keep possession by dribbling the better youll get at it. Also it will help to turn off ball cam when you are dribbling. But turn it back on if you lose control of the ball.Try to be more aggressive attacking your opponents goal. You never made him make a play on defense. And one last thing I think I saw you doing. Boosting when you are already supersonic just wastes your boost. You are already at top speed essentially once you are supersonic. Boosting more doesnt help. ,RocketLeague,d58pjlp,1,t5_30cz1

8264438,0,t1_d5allac,Yeah. And theres a big difference in s or s actually. In s knowing your teammate is always in goal or never closer than midfield offense is gonna be very tricky to pull off. Itll be a low scoring game where youll have to rely on getting a counter.In threes however Id say having a dedicated goalie lets the  others have very clear roles at any given time. You can be forward and take risks rather than worry about whether your teammates have taken their turns to rotate when you thought they should. The most common issue in random s Ive experienced with teamplay is that  or  people will see the same task that needs doing and feel theyre the best suited for the job. They might see the other roles that need filling but unless each person sees a different role as their current best option shits gonna go bad. When one person takes a role permanently you might be slightly less effective than a great rotation but a lot more effective than people fucking up the rotation.,RocketLeague,d5am1u4,3,t5_30cz1

8296287,0,t1_d5ejs63,But the disadvantages to the proposed idea would be tge same but their are fewer of them. The team would have to opt into veing unbalanced by partying up unbalanced but there would be little advantage to doing this other than to speed up the ranking process for the lower player. For example player A is superstar player B is unranked but is as good as A. This way theyll be able to play together at their skill level without player A cheating the system to get above where he should be on the ladder. Opposing team doesnt got wrecked by losing to an unranked player theyd be losing to  superstars. Or in the otger scenario where player B us worse than A then their team is lopsided as a result of player A grouping with a lesser player. But lets say player A us only doing this for coaching now the iption is still available but its a disadvantage you have to opt into.The last scenario has player B being better and player B can maybe carry player A up a few ranks but will eventually get to the point where he cant carry anymore. This is unavoidable since Player B could just climb to player As rank under any sort of solution and do the same thing.Unpartied groups would still work the same as they currently do obviously.,RocketLeague,d5elejx,1,t5_30cz1

I had no idea he suffered from competition anxiety it never showed even the slightest during his competitive matches. Perhaps social anxiety has something to do with it too resulting in him feeling very uncomfortable going to the LANplaying in offlineevents.

Yes if the opponents stand on the ground waiting and you roll the wall up the corner that is probably the case.But take for example this The opponent was able to fly backwards up to block the shot. The only reason I scored was because I predicted it and dunked him. He was by no means bad. There are several other examples. You can make every aerial a freestyle.

I cant find the exact thread at the moment but another user higher up in this thread copypasted it here.gtPsyonixDunhamSmashgtgtHey guys Those assets are indeed early pieces of an upcoming system we plan on implementing to fund our esports prize pools and events. We plan on officially announcing it next month at or near the RLCS Live Finals since it directly relates to that event and other events like it but since this image came out before our official word we wanted to clarify some things for you Crates will contain cosmetic content only. We have a strict Dont Sell Advantage policy for Rocket League and were sticking with that. There will be no Steam Marketplace integration with crates. We are definitely aware of the problems related to thirdparty gambling in other games and we are not interested in taking that approach. Players who dont want to interact with this system can hide it entirely with a single checkbox. Also of note this wont affect or impact our current itemdrop system in any way. We also want to reassure you guys that we are sticking with our approach to keep introducing free new Arenas Modes and Items along with the occasional paid DLC just like we always have. Hope this helps shed some light on what we have planned. Its actually a pretty cool system that well be happy to share detail about next month. Best regards,RocketLeague,d5mxvh4,2,t5_30cz1

Its just there to give you a little bump up in the beginning.In the start of the season nobody had any MMR so it placed people based on very little data. That would end up placing people higher up. Now the MMR cap to get into challenger is much higher because of a very high concentration of players competing in that range.

Which I mean is technically lag but a lag that is passively applied. The numerical value of your ping is the delay of whatever you do in milliseconds. Your input will be applied to the servers a bit late and as late as the ping you are getting.Lag what we normally talk about are temporary connection disruption. These cause rubberbanding and is different from ping. To put in easy words ping is the pain going for a long time after you eat something super spicy.

8499090,0,t1_d62tszo,I have a recommendation but I feel like you guys would need a lot more data to accurately do this so it may be useful for next season.Rather than having the system match a super champ and superstar with two super champs and having the superstars team winning or losing rating change as if they were two super champs have a modifier based on rank when partied with someone more than  ranks lower than you that increases the matchmaking systems rating so that you face harder opponents. This makes it so you dont have to party with someone within a rank of you and would make boosting extremely hard to do and doesnt punish you for playing with someone  ranks lower thank you. I feel like the match making system was fine for similarly ranked players and this makes it so that playing with anyone not exactly at your skill level punishes you and your party member.,RocketLeague,d63xrsx,1,t5_30cz1

8499556,0,t1_d63a72z,Yes that way its not as confusing as Corey said it might be with team MMR where every different combination of people you play with is a team with its own MMR. However the one thing to consider with true teams is how would it be used in the existing playlists? Would there be separate playlists? Could you be on multiple teams?Im all for the idea though. In fact if we ever get ingame tournaments having teams would be a great way to organize it.,RocketLeague,d63zvk2,1,t5_30cz1
8500562,0,t1_d63sk8q,how is it easy for me to carry my friends to a rank above my own skill?that logic makes absolutely no sense. its an average so if we only play with eachother he will weigh me down slightly and i will elevate him slightly once we reach an equilibrium.you cant be boosted by someone worse than yourself.,RocketLeague,d644ff3,1,t5_30cz1

8502018,0,t1_d6481ot,With the current playlists I agree.  We either need to suck it up and play harder matches or play unranked.  This is not a criticism of the update I think it was necessary.What Im suggesting is a new way to have friends who may be different rank wildly different or just a little different play a competitive ranked mode together without impacting solo players.,RocketLeague,d64b070,1,t5_30cz1

That may be worth it for you but many people would rather not wait  minutes for a game  especially if they are stable on the data centers that your connection has trouble with.Try adding exceptions to your Firewall andor Port Forwarding.

8683097,0,t1_d6qsumv,What the player did in the gif was place his car perpendicular to the trajectory of the ball therefore eliminating some of the forward and downward momentum giving the st player time to catch up. Most of what you said really didnt account for the angle of the car at all so flat surface doesnt really mean anything in your explanation. what he also could have done is drive under the ball and tip it into the net which is what the other guy said. Youre suggesting it would have bounced off the roof of the car and hit the crossbar. That might be true if the ball just hit the floor but the car isnt an unmoving plank of dirt. If the ball landed on the front half of the car it would slightly force the nose downwards placing the roof of the car at an angle for the ball to go in.

Contrasting that with RS levels its night and day what teammates willwont do.At the lower levels it most certainly becomes a matter of playing solid defense and conceding as few goals as possible because your teammates will rarely if ever cover your half unless the ball is moving that way already too late and they will both try for the ball regardless of who has a better shot.,RocketLeague,d71gmcu,2,t5_30cz1

8770597,0,t1_d71yqs1,gtThats pretty cool if they did and Id love to hear how they got around the desync issues. Usually serverauthorative implementations suffer hugely from round trip times and with something as fast and kinetic as Rocket League I can imagine it would be unbearable but the game is so tight it doesnt feel like its implemented that way.Source QuoteThe server is constantly streaming positions etc to the client and the client is constantly using this old information to predict where things will be.Source QuoteThe server and clients are all running the physics simulation. The server constantly sends the physics state for every car and ball to all clients. The clients can tell how old this information is so they look back in time to see if any of the positions are significantly different from what they predicted it would be. If there are no differences then they just continue on their marry way. If there was a disagreement then the client resets all physics objects back where the server says they were then resimulates back to present time. The delta between the old predicted position and the new corrected position is then smoothed out visually over a short time.Source QuoteThe only thing the client sends to the server is which buttons hes holding. Lag compensation is all clientside. If he has a ms ping he predicts where the ball will be in  ms. We can do this because the clients and servers run game logic at the same fixed rate regardless of what FPS the client is rendering at.Source QuoteOne of the reasons we decided to use dedicated servers was to take control over the authoritative physics for each game so it could not be manipulated by clients. This is a sound strategy that will prevent manipulation of the ball and car physics even on PC.ampnbspampnbspTLDRThe server controls all positions manipulative and only accepts inputs from the clients. To reduce the apparent lag especially input lag round trip the client actually predicts it by running its own iteration of the game at the same time as the server. It tries to predict it by taking the last amount of information the server sent and the delay and predict x milliseconds into the future. This way there is no apparent lag until very high pings or very spontaneous movements that cannot be predicted between client and server such as a random jump or beginning to turn ending a turn braking dodging etc etc.,RocketLeague,d71zn0i,1,t5_30cz1

8941583,0,t1_d7mgbog,Watch playing with potatoes s on youtube.  The two keys for duel is to play more conservatively which for most people just means slow down and take the defensive stance to pounce on counter attack and boost management.  You have to weigh those two things but often winning and losing in duel is making sure you dont put yourself in a bad position and making sure you have as much or more boost than you opponent.At this point my duel rank is higher than my other ranksjust made challenger this morning but I also usually just play with randoms in the others which makes it much harder to get a good win streak going to climb ranks.Im the same  hours a day usually and my drop rates seem way lower than others too but then about one or two days a month it seems like Ill get a drop every other game.  The few days when I do play longer I find I start getting more drops.  I also dont know if they actually have different drop rates for the mode but I also find if I stick with a certain mode then I tend to get more regular drops where if I am going from duel to a few doubles match to a few s then I may not get a drop or only  where if I play say all  matches in doubles I may get  instead.,RocketLeague,d7mnaat,3,t5_30cz1

This MAY OR MAY NOT effect their game play.In general most players FEEL they play better AFTER being told of camera shake when they turn it off.CERTAINLY All stories in this case are anecdotes.HOWEVER at the very least FEELING you may be playing worse DOES actually make you play worse the effect is related to Placebo called the Nocebo that is If you think something bad is happening you may unconsciously make it happen.MY OPINION is to turn it off. IF it does in general make someone play worse might as well turn it off if you want to do everything you can to play better.

9022568,0,t3_53qmhu,What a neat little post idea ill play even if the crates are gone! I think meaning of life varies a lot from person to person not the concept but the very definition of the word meaning.A lot of people use the word meaning as a synonym for purpose like what you personally are intended to do in your lifetime based off guidelines set by previous generations fuck have kids die that offspring then repeats their parents cycle so on so forth followed by inevitable extinction of our species as a result of xyz. But the question is almost never answered for the regard of why life is life. I believe the meaning of life is a lot simpler than we give it credit for and that humanity is an oversized plague on our planet. I believe that were the embodiment of a destructive force similar to that of microorganisms who breed and grow using its surroundings for support while unknowingly causing detrimental damage to their hosts through their day to day lives akin to humans on Earth as a whole. Were simply going with the flow of our planet trying to find reasons for being here when in all of its simplicity we are our own reason for being here. I believe the meaning of life isnt what we need to do or should do but to simply exist as an ignorant counteractive burden on our planets ecosystem. Inevitably our sources of nourishment will expire and our species as a whole will quickly fizzle away leaving a barren planet covered in manmade infrastructure and carcinogens that restrict the creation of life from continuing.,RocketLeague,d7wddu6,3,t5_30cz1

9024779,0,t3_53v599,Finding people to play with is a BIG plus. you can learn their play styles and become better together. plus they may know something you dont and vice versa where you can teach each other first hand. If You play with someone online and you seem to work well together let them know. shoot them a friend request. ask if they want to party up. the more people you can reliably play with the better it becomes. This naturally leads into passing plays and knowing your strengths in roles. Those same skills transfer to solo standard play. If people are ball chasing. let them. be the defense man and only take your shots when you know theres someone rotating back. Try different play styles out in unranked. Defensive agressive positional play setup man Tactical Boost stealing bumping enemies etc. as you try all these out you get a better well rounded perspective of not only your game but they gamestyle your opponent is playing allowing you to counter act it. I wouldnt say play competitively in Rocket league nor play just for fun. Play curiously. wondering why someone does something and then figuring it out leads to improvement. Its one of the main reasons people learn a lot from watching vods and pros play. If you simply play curious youre always improving and your enjoyment of the game will grow as well. tldr get teammates try styles be curious. ,RocketLeague,d7wmxw7,3,t5_30cz1

9036084,0,t1_d7xwydj,I remember replying to that exact post. I do agree with you in principle about this making them look confused as to what they want the future to look like.gt COnsidering that in Queue play it already doesnt count the variants as seperate maps DFH Stormy vs DFH Regular for example but instead decides the map will be DFH  then chooses a variant it is safe to assume if map veto is ever a thing in game or even just for tournaments what you are talking about wont be an issue.                gt Taking the next logical leap I doubt Map vetoing if it exists in the future would treat ALL standard maps as the same map.  so that teams couldnt just veto wasteland neo tokyo comic octagon for example and get all Standard Maps.             gt Alternatively we had this discussion while at RLCS and you could also Just have Team A Chooses a Map Team B Chooses A Map Veto Veto Veto Veto etc for the final . You could also throw a Random for the final map to balance it out between teams. THis way a team could get really good at wasteland and force people to play them there. This method would only really be needed if the Standard maps arent all considered the same map whenIF vetoing becomes a thing. ,RocketLeague,d7xzsvf,2,t5_30cz1

Shortly after they realized that they needed to add more ranks and added champion super champ and grand champ and renamed the old champion to superstar. When this happened they took people who were at a certain MMR level and put them in the new tiers. So your  month figure is not correct.

9088600,0,t3_54raez,Every time you see someone going for the ball try to predict where it is going to go and if your teammate isnt there be there.  If your teammate is going down the side dont follow him be in the center for a pass or a center.  You should be far enough back to cover a challenge that goes over his head and down the side though if you can.gtOther times I see them pop the ball around the corner hoping for a center but of course both the opponents sitting on goal. Should I have bumrushed it try to force it in?If your teammate centers the ball you can go for it even if there are defenders as long as your teammate is rotating back behind you.  If you see them heading back go ahead they should be able to cover all but the most ridiculous of clears.gt Generally I tend to hang back and play sometimes overly defensively because I feel that if I try and be aggressive one mistake from me is going to land the ball in our net and I dont trust either of my partners to mind defense either because in general they never do.Playing with random teammates is difficult because playing slowly dribbling etc often looks very similar to losing control of the ball and panicking to a third party.  Since you cant communicate you have to do your best to read the situation.  Usually I hang back a bit in that case as even if they are dribbling a challenge will probably result in it going over your teammate.  IMHO playing defensively is a better way to rank up but playing aggressively and trying to read the ball faster than your opponents is a better way to improve your ability.  Unfortunately you make a log of mistakes when you are learning so its not the best strategy for ranking up short term. ,RocketLeague,d84ax2q,3,t5_30cz1

9093544,0,t1_d84s3ia,Youre somewhat limited in the Y axis but youre absolutely able to use it. Heres a great example where the forward player starts a wallplay orange goes for a challenge. Second blue passes the now floating puck to center where third blue uses a glitch in the physics engine to aerial pinch a goal. You can see the intent from how he brings the undercarriage up at the last second.If youd like another example look at this First player goes for a wallplay but hits an intentional pinch on the wall. Orange catches the pinch and it bounces into the air. Second passes and third scores with some unnecessary flair. Its worth stressing that pinches are completely controllable. Theyre no more random than hitting the ball is.All of the previous clips have full team cooperation though. Teamwork isnt necessary to score aerial goals though. Dojo here demonstrates the standard centerfield shot in hockey. Another common occurrence is the aerial wallshot which I demonstrate here You really dont need to attack from center either as Robotic provesOf course you dont need walls either. Heres a cooperative shot from centerfield. In some cases its even worthwhile to dribble the puck on its edge. I agree that hockey is different than soccar but its not simpler.,RocketLeague,d84wc8y,1,t5_30cz1

9159141,0,t1_d8cm6k1,Use the wall and side jump. Side jumping suspends gravity for the duration of the jump a blessing and a curse tbh and gives you better contact with the ball. And using the wall saves you wasting your jumps getting up or wasting your boost getting altitude AND it saves you tons of boost building up horizontal speed so the wall is a powerful tool for aerials. So once you come out of the jump you just need to point up and steer giving tiny boost taps to maintain altitude. You could probably do what OP did with  boost if you practice.,RocketLeague,d8czlkn,7,t5_30cz1

9178085,0,t3_5606m2,Theres also a pretty dismal win streak mechanic at work thats holding some people back.  It was put in place for the right reason get people to their true rank faster.  It doesnt actually work and is negative for the player and the people they play against.  Heres what happens lets say youre Challenger I div .  You win five games in a row and in those five games you go up two division.  Since youre on a win streak the game assumes you can play at a higher quality so your next game you play some Challenger III players. What should happen If you win you should gain more points than you would against your usual opponents since they are better.  This will help get you to your true rank faster.  What actually happens The mathematics treat you like youre a Challenger III so you dont gain as many points if you win.  You end up losing about the same amount a points as you would to a Challenger I.This works out to be even worse for your opponents the math for them treats you like your true rank so if they lose they lose big.  If they win they get breadcrumbs because you were significantly below them in rank.  I had two games back to back like this once I played against a bunch of CE players on a win streak and actually earned  points.  I was then on a win streak and played against some higher end All Stars and lost  points.  It doesnt take your win streak rank into account.  In general win streaks arent really a good thing for players on them and are horrible for players playing against them.,RocketLeague,d8fe0yv,1,t5_30cz1

You try to make it all literal by using definitions that pull the entire thing out of context. The whole idea that it is an objective fact is an opinion in and of it self. Youre trying so hard to be right but its impossible there is no objective fact. The experience of playing rocket league managing the buttons is subjective and based on each persons comfort level with different button presses and combinations. Some people may feel more natural using the bumpers to air roll their car than a button and a stick in those peoples experiences it will be useful to have the option to set those control bindings.

9186414,0,t1_d8gfqb9,Sorry man but if you are experiencing that in doubles then you need to take a deep introspective look at yourself and your own playstyle. Chances are you are not rotating effectively and ball chasing at least that would be my guess. A lot of people dont realize they are ball chasing because they dont really know everything that constitutes ball chasing. They mostly think of the prospect kind of ball chase. Believe me I was the same way too. People would tell me to stop ball chasing and I was like wtf I am not ball chasing you are.. However eventually I realized I was actually ball chasing and I have been improving ever since.Honestly man the reason why you have stagnated your rank is because you are blaming other people. Any time you blame someone else you miss out on an opportunity to learn what you could have done better. Any time a goal gets scored on my team I instantly try to think of any possible way I could have prevented that goal.  of the time there is something I could have done better. The other  of the time is worth caring about.By recognizing my mistakes and brainstorming ways I could have played better I have been improving myself immensely. The main difference between star rank and challenger is purely positioning and rotating which is a mental game. I can pretty much guarantee you are not positioning or rotating properly if you are not star rank.Of course all of that is a completely moot point in solo standard as that playlist is just fucked. I dont know what rank you are but if you want I can look at a replay or two of yours and point out some ways you can improve. It is much easier for others to recognize your mistakes than to do it introspectively.,RocketLeague,d8gg13p,5,t5_30cz1

It brings in situations and issues like these which remind me of how people make an issue out of crates in counter strike. It is most def not the same thing and I get that it doesnt affect me personally if Im not in the competitive scene or open crates.

Figured it would help console players more than pc.For example when I practice air dribble Im hitting the ball to the side wall perpendicular to the goal. But when I practice flicks and dribbles I prefer to drive into it much closer to the goal. And when I practicing off the backboard shots I prefer to drive into it much farther away from the ball but straight on to it to build momentum.

9265139,0,t1_d8qe2ae,Top . of players who have played more than  games in a Competitive playlist. If there are roughly  individual users Grand Champions thats  players who have played Competitive for more than  games which is very reasonable. Id say  of the Competitive playerbase maximum actually played Competitive for more than  games. That means  minimum would have touched the playlist once or twice and not done anything. And Id say  of Rocket Leagues total playerbase wouldnt have touched Competitive at all just playing solo private matches casual only or played once and moved to a different game. That then gets to Rocket Leagues  total players players that hopped on the Rocket League servers at least once.These arent solidified numbers. They are very roughly estimated. Not necessarily pulled out of my ass because there are around  Grand Champions in Solo Duel  in Doubles like  in Solo Standard and around  for Standard. While you may think to add them together for  remember that if people are Grand Champion in something like Solo Duel or Solo Standard they are likely to be Grand Champion in Standard or Doubles. There are some people even Grand Champion in all  and more commonly  out of the  playlists. ,RocketLeague,d8qf7mq,28,t5_30cz1

I doubt you were banned for aerials. I very heavily doubt that its punishable.     Im use to League of Legends. If someone complains about their ban on the forums they get something called a Lite Smite. Lite was the guy in charge of punishing players. He would go into the thread and posts that players toxic chat log. That was entertaining as fuck.    Toxic folks usually dont acknowledge that they are Toxic.

9285868,0,t3_57ix7k,I know Im late here but here is my  cents on the matter. I think you justifiably got banned because you are not playing the game how it is intended. So in the game if there is a guy blocking you can knock him out of the way and blow him up or whatever to help you team score the goal. You have basically just turned into the goon on a hockey team and just go around being the enforcer. While yes like you said there is nothing in the rules about it it is about good sportsman like conduct. If someone get bumped during an epic play that is one thing he is going to be pissed but its the way she goes. Instead with you the other team doesnt have a chance because now someone is going after them and they have to try and play while avoid getting blown up or constantly knocked out of the way. Personally I have always been against head hunting in games and this makes me feel like it is rocket leagues version of head hunting. ,RocketLeague,d8t1ud8,-5,t5_30cz1

9287909,0,t1_d8sy51l,Im sorry but no youre misunderstanding what the devs have already confirmed. Different cars are simply not capable of hitting the ball harder than other cars regardless of hitbox size and center of gravity.When a car impacts the ball there is no rotational velocity factored in at all. The collision between the car and the ball is calculated based on only two vectors the vector of the cars direction and speed of travel and the vector of the balls direction and speed of travel. The cars orientation is of course factored into the addition of these two vectors because the angle of incidence effects the sum of the two vectors but the change in the angle of incidence at the moment of impact is not a factor. Flips effect the cars overall vector of moving through space as a quick impulse in a specific direction but otherwise do not play a roll in collision calculations. This is precisely why flips are capable of momentarily canceling gravity.There is plenty of anecdotal data to confirm this if thats your thing. Just watch the best players in the world play and pay attention to the speed of their goals. They are all experts at ripping power shots and you simply do not see specific cars consistently producing higher speed goals. In fact its the exact opposite. A good player can shoot power shots at the exact same speeds within a reasonable margin of error with any car.uPsyonixDave upsyonixjosh uPsyonixThomas or anybody else who can officially confirm this would be greatly appreciated but this is my understanding based on the few pieces that have been confirmed.,RocketLeague,d8tb56p,0,t5_30cz1

9332201,0,t1_d8ydj6r,Its ultra satisfying.  I used to play a crapload of TF as well amazing game. Rocket league is almost several different games in one because of the learning curve.  Youre always matched vs people your level and skill roughly.At first its the hilarious bloopers phase.  Just hitting the ball is hard.  Teams are just as likely to score on their own net as the opponents.  The game is played on the ground.  If someone masters basic double jumping they are considered aerial gods hitting the ball in flight.. Any goal no matter how ugly feels awesome.Slowly the game changes to clumsy aerial fumbling.  People go up and fly at the ball.   chance they hit it  chance its anywhere near the actual direction they mean to hit it.  Great fun.  Simply smacking the ball is satisfying.  When you score your first true aerial save that replay!! One day youll look back fondly.  lolEventually the game becomes so complex.  Its not just hitting the ball its predicting where the ball will be reading the field bumping  demolishing opponents for a high risk reward.  Aerials involving flipping and rotating to generate max power by hitting off the hood corners which produce the most punch.And the game is still evolving.  Pro players from months ago compared to now are so much better.  Half flips? Wave dash? Oh myThere are key constants  scoring feels amazing.  Its such an adrenaline rush to score a goal.

This is a problem because each item has a different gender. In this case Caja crate is feminine so the final result should look likeCaja de campen  rara rare champion crateAntena limitada limited antennaCalcomana rara rare decalRuedas raras rare wheels  ALSO THIS ONE IS PLURAL so it needs the s.Estela de cohete muy rara very rare rocket trailUnfortunately deciding whether a noun is feminine or masculine is something that has to be made manually since theres no way to know the gender of a word. These are some examples but you can fix a lot of the spanish translation mistakes by just moving the adjectives to the right of the noun.Im sure all spanish players would be grateful!edit formattingEDIT Also take a look at this post where I say that many song names are translated word for word. Seriously? TheFatRat translated as Rata gorda literally means fat rat? Also its for keeping the consistency. Many other song names just got the feat.

9496986,0,t3_5atz7a,The differences are minute in the grand scheme of things. You can see Gibbs and other pros do videos with cars like Merc that are almost never seen in procircuits and still melt faces in ranked play. Those slight differences only need to be compensated by using more powersliding for snappier turns jumping a bit later because the car has a taller hitbox etc.One thing that arguably gives you an edge is a longer hitbox. Since the flip takes the exact same amount of time on every car longer cars have their noses spin faster than shorter cars. So flipping into balls will give them a slightly faster shot. But I dont know if anyone has made macros and trainer shots to test this Id imagine the difference is in the range of  kps between the shortest and longest cars. And the offset of that faster flip would be that you really need to hit the ball at the right time or the shot is off. So again we rotate back to whatever feels right for you.,RocketLeague,d9jpexk,2,t5_30cz1

9557691,0,t3_5btqz0,The gap between superstar and grand champ isnt as big as you think but youll see with experience. High skill players are fast at making plays and accurate with shots. Try to be as consistent as you can and learn to make plays fast. Also a good way of suprising your enemies are pinches and powershots. Pinches when done right can create good opportunities. Powershots are great for clears but also great for shots. Shots will be easy to defend for good players when it isnt going fast. With powershots you can shoot prety damn fast and if you practice your accuricy with it youll see you get a lot of goals out of it because people arent always prepared for such a hard shot. Others than that practice your mechanical skills things like halfflip dribbling wallshots redirects passing etc...

Given that youve played some and ur current record Ill say youll end up challenger  or prospect elite. Very rough guess. Youll probably be lower than ur actual skill  just because the system doesnt have enough games to have faith in you. You win games ur MMR matchmaking rank goes up some points you face stronger opponents.  You can also go on a streak I think  allowing you  to face people much higher than you or lower if other way I think.  Partying has some special rules. Its based on a weighted average so that you partying with a much lower rank person doesnt make the game so easy that you can carry. Its more heavily weighted to the higher rank. And what Im not specifically sure of is if you win and u were the lower rank your MMR changes based on the oppnwnt party MMR right? I think thats it. So while you cant boost you still get a bonus for beating a team more heavily weighted higher than you if you were the lower rank in your party. Hope that made a modicum of sense.

9640858,0,t1_da197px,The ball was high and over his shoulder and an opponent was about to take a shot while the other opponent was in position to accept a pass. Turning off ball cam off for a second would have completely removed him from the play whether op was back or not so he definitely needed to keep ball cam on and keep an eye on what was happening. Unless OP was on comms and called his teammate off his teammate had no way of knowing where op was going to go if he was going to get there in time basically anything about OPs position except that he probably saw him  to  seconds ago heading back on defense. Without knowing where op was or what he was doing the teammate was completely in the right heading back to goal while keeping an eye on the play that was developing in case something unexpected happened like a pass to the other opponent that was in position or a whiff by that opponent or any other millions of things that could have happened. OP on the other hand had the advantage of seeing everything and knowing that his teammate should have ballcam on and therefore cant see where hes going and had plenty of time to make the necessary adjustments or if he didnt notice he definitely had time to just flip over his teammate and make the save. Heck if he had even tried to dodge around his teammate he probably would have had a poolsave with his teammates car. Basically teammate was making the best of a shitty situation OP was expecting teammate to have  vision while also defending an aerial shot and a pass to the other opponent while OP wanted to sit in net. OP is definitely at fault.,RocketLeague,da1fn3p,2,t5_30cz1

You dont really always need to go to the corner.. as long as you have ish boost you can just start driving and picking them up as you go.. All situational obviously..

If you are  Tier apart maximum you do gain some bonus points to catch up to them. Should you be more than  Tier away you do not get bonus points to catch up.If the highest rated party member is Champion or above matchmaking is no longer a weighted average and matchmaking is based off of their rating only.

Youll never win  points easily because people who are at a higher elo than you are still really tough to beat even when theyre having a really bad day but losing  can be really easy. I just won  out of  v matches just now the last one against someone who is rated over  points above me in s and who has just a handful of matches in s and I still lost  point overall even though I had to fight hard until the very last second and I might have easily lost. For those people who play a lot of Rocket League this just happens constantly and losing points is just one negative aspect of this demoralization for losing all this matches that you shouldnt even be into is another.Unless youre at the top of your game on a particular day if you grind soloQ you are bound to lose points in my experience.

At the moment the all round best car is probably the octane whilst the top  cars used include the octane breakout batmobile and dominus. Batmobile and octane have the best turning radius and people like the break out and dominus due to the control in the air you seem to get. Tbh the car wont make you a great player hence why someone like marky or greazy could beat just about anyone if they were using the merc. I recommend using the octane for learning purposes and for all round play. Hope this helps a bit,RocketLeague,dahgrel,4,t5_30cz1

9785281,0,t3_5f9dwd,As a Northern Gaming fan the article is appreciated. Though my initial prediction after group play was that it would be NG and F in the grand finals and it still may well be the author is fooling himself if he thinks such a match would be close. F have utterly crushed NG in every series they have played against them. Theres no dancing around that fact. Were talking winning by  goals and sometimes more in several games.

9790257,0,t1_dajopi0,Yea thats an old saying and god is it outdated. For example in the NBA  season the number one ranked team in points per game? golden state warriors. And guess who was second? The Cleveland cavs. Of course defense is important in my mind just as much so as offense. But to claim that every point made is a defensive mistake is just bogus frankly.  I watched steph curry im a basketball fan btw walk up two steps past half court and sink a shot to win the game. Sometimes things are unstoppable short of reading minds.  Rocket league is even more dramatic in this IMO. For example if im playing d vs someone with the ball on his hood and i predict a flick im going to jump up and try to level myself with where the ball is on his car or maybe even higher if i know he can flick it quick.  If he just lets the ball drop of his car in this situation did i really fuck up? i simply took away one of two options  btw in most situation the offense has more then two options and i simply guessed wrong. its easy to say you shouldnt of done something after watching a replay but that dosent always mean its a mistake. ,RocketLeague,dajv1na,-1,t5_30cz1

9794103,0,t1_dak9ptf,gt First off just because I dont have the same view as you doesnt make this blind praiseI know I didnt mean you specifically I just think this sub is usually very heavy on the praising and rightfully so but tends to shut down any criticism which I dont really like.I dont know that the result of splitting the queue would be youre probably right. But I think that while it made sense not to penalize players for leaving normal games initially players like me and my friend are now stuck in a sort of a limbo as a result.  Normal games are never taken seriously people rage quit all the time I can count the number of normal games on my fingers where the players who started a match finished it without leaving being replaced by a bot and then maybe another player down the line.

I love s  if Im challenging an opponent at the ball Im looking for a good  not necessarily just trying to outright strip the ball from them. So Ill watch your car speed boost usage etc and be ready to contact the ball at a time when youre hitting it too. And if I see that youre close but not hitting it I wont necessarily hit it either but Ill definitely put myself between the ball and my net and then slowly cut off your options to set up a favorable  or block.

No reverse sweep no overtime we started to think it was over for mockit. Then with about  seconds left there was an attempt but it was easily cleared away and it looked like they were done for. this clip starts right at that clear Then almost out of nowhere they got another shot and scored it.

Its been touched on a lot in this thread that there is just too much hype coming from the RLCS casters.  A big consequence of that is overhyping things that may seem flashy but are actually both easy and commonplace i.e. AERIAL GOALS.  It makes the casters seem like inexperienced players who think JHZER is the best player in the world because of his montages theyre obviously not so their casting shouldnt give that impression.All love to the RLCS casting team and the hard work that they do.

9892752,0,t3_5h2toj,On PS...  GB free space cant download a patch of . GB... Really Sonys patching system is very badly implemented.If any Psyonix devs see this please report this issue with Sony? Ive submitted it as a bug during their firmware betas already... they dont listen to us but they might listen to developers. This issue is only going to get worse with each patch.To quickly explain it The PS does a hash check on the files you have already and only downloads what you need to update thats the preparing to download xx bit. Unfortunately the check for how much free space you need to have available is done before that and not after so it will require the free space of a complete update since v. of the game. Or apparently like with Rocket League the total size of all patches combined.

Rocket League can believe it or not get boring after so and so many matches. Adding a new level of requirement for your depth of understanding of the game seems to be the challenge to people not that the maps are actually bad... Some people do not want to learn or might be able to learn.I think the majority of Rocket League players actually appreciate the variation even though what seems like a vocal minority wants neo tokyo and wasteland changed.

Telling us to learn to like it is stupid. If you like labs then great. Play them. But dont take away the game we love by making us play one we dont. I believe they will change this. I was never a big fan of Tokyo or wasteland but I played them because it was only here and there. Now nonstandard maps make up HALF of the rotation and at least today made up most of the rotation. I will probably stop playing as much if this stays. I know you dont give a shit but Psyonix will if enough people stop. I usually have a hard time stopping playing.

9916898,0,t1_db05keo,I understand what you mean but let me counter with what Ive seen with a few of my friends that may help to back my point.  My one friend lets call him friend A was allstar last season.  This season he just achieved Grand Champion.  I play with this friend fairly often and while he may have gotten a little bit better he is certainly not at the skill level of last season grand champ. Last season I had to grind to finally hit Grand Champion this season not only have I found it extremely demotivating to have it just given to me I also dont like it that players in the Superstar skill range are able to achieve Grand Champion.  I do not want to come off as an elitist because I feel as if I am pretty down to earth with this kinda stuff but it really doesnt seem right having this humungous skill gap at Grand Champion.  As you agreed to there really needs to be additional ranks added at the top.This is the first time Ive been vocal about this on the subreddit and while by my wording it may seem Im a bit flustered by this it really doesnt bother me too much because at the end of the day it is just a game.  I appreciate your thoughts but I do believe the bar has been significantly lowered from last seasons Grand Champion standard.  There was a skill gap last season but not the this extent we are seeing in season .  That alone I believe works to show my point that it is too easy to achieve the highest rank possible.,RocketLeague,db072qe,-2,t5_30cz1

9917129,0,t1_db00yck,I assure you everyone did not start at Rising Star. I put about  hours into the game on season  and hit silver the equivalent to the challenger ranks at the time. Season  I put in another  hours and hit Shooting Star Season  Ive put in about  hours thus far and I usually sit at div  AllStar atm. Though I dont have a wife or any kids let alone  so your mileage might vary.Youre absolutely right in that the lower ranks are not represented well on this sub I believe a poll was conducted earlier and it definitely showed that the regulars of rRocketLeague are skewed towards the higher ranks. So if this is your main source of Rocket League consumption it can definitely feel like more players are at higher ranks than there are in reality though with the massive number of players in RL there are a lot of players at every rank.Psyonix released the rank distribution of the player population and youre actually really close to the average player well within one standard variation anyways. In Season  after the rank calibration Challenger  contains the largest portion of the population with the Challenger ranks being the norm when looking at all the ranks. So with a life full of obligations and a wife and kids youre hanging in there with the largest chunk of the player base so kudos!

9931849,0,t3_5hpjab,  Countercounterpoint Im going to relate this to smash because I feel it will help. If you are unfamiliar with how the competitive smash scene works not all stages are allowed. Only a select few are playable in tournaments. This allows players to not have to focus on trying to be good on so many different stages with different obstacles or weord terrain. Because a lot of the stages are generally similar the players can focus more on a consistent playstyle.  I agree it does take learning to get good at a stage like NeoTokyo with the raised sides and such. But lets be honest most people dont want to learn in a competitive match. They want to go in knowing they will do good because they have built a style that works on all the other stages. Adding obstacles throws their style out the window and makes it very hard for them to do good.   Keep the weird fields for casual play and add even more if you want like Psyonix is doing with Rocket Lab fields. But I say we should keep the competitive fields roughly similar with only mild changes so players can stick with a strategy throughout every match.Note I know strategy isnt  field based it depends on opponentsteammates too but strats would have to change from field to field which people dont want.,RocketLeague,db2588r,1,t5_30cz1

I am a super champion in solo and a grand champion in doubles. I cant even get past all star in Standard or even to Allstar in solo standard. I struggled most in s. I do my rotations but the skill disparity at these lower ranks compared to what I am used to in ss is greatly noticeable. I am told I am the worst the shittiest the most awful stupid etc. player they have ever come across. In the back of my mind I know that I am not. I do not blame them either on mistakes. I just wish all playlist took consideration of your highest MMR. For me my highest ever achieved would be  and my s MMR is mid . I sometimes feel that it is just best to never play in s again. Once I hit Grand in solo.. I will probably end up focusing all my energy in solo standardstandard to just get into the purple ranks. I played with a few friends who are SCGC in s and always do well.. but sometimes I need to solo queue due to different times we are all available.

9954802,0,t1_db3gcnx,Talking about vThis is something almost everyone in the blue ranks do. Blindly go for boost at kickoff. Why I ask you? You spawn with more than enough boost combined with picking up  pads to help your teammate win the kickoff. If by chance the ball goes to your corners youre always earlier than the opponent cause you kept your  boost you should still be on your half of the pitch and they have to waste more in order to catch up to you.If the kickoff went succesful and the ball is on their side of the pitch you can now control the midfield boosts  maybe their boosts as well. This is how you keep on the pressure by stealing boost  keeping possession of the ball while trying to force a goal.If youre running a premade its a different story. Its really good to mix up your kickoffs so trying to go for cornerboost when your teammate is trying to get the ball to go to you is a good thing. But not every single time. Its insanely easy to counter the kickoff you and your teammate are trying to do. This leads to you wasting a shitload of your newly gotten boost in order to save their dribbleincoming shot after they won the kickoff they get to control the map boosts etc. Its a snowball effect and it is easily punished if you do the same thing on every kickoff.,RocketLeague,db54wcn,2,t5_30cz1

I admire you because you tell it like it is and give your opinion however controversial it may be. You lurk through A LOT of bullshit on here and deal with it accordingly and professionally most of the time. You have to respond to people that want nothing but to argue with you very often and sometimes your responses come off as forceful and aggressive when they really might not be. However its true that youve lost your cool before but you dont deny it and even provided the source here. This post is proof that youre trying to curve that and I hope the people that were angry with you and vice versa can forgive you. In my opinion you definitely have asserted yourself as a strong moderator and member of this community. You often do get into debates in the comments but theres nothing wrong with that. After all you tell it like it is and youre a great source of information. It doesnt always have to represent you as a moderator. This post really shows that you give a shit about how this community works and how you are a part of it. I have nothing but respect for you after reading this.As far as criticism I feel like you have trouble considering other peoples opinions in a debate. I dont believe youre likely to admit someones argument is right and that yours is wrong. Thats understandable and common but in a debate thats something that you should consider. After all the point of a debate is that the right conclusion is reached regardless of who is right. Your reputation relies on your ability to admit when youre wrong and adjust accordingly. You dont always have to pursue being correct and being respected.  Thanks for your contributions to this community,RocketLeague,db6drno,1,t5_30cz1

It can be frustrating but youll learn in time.Heres a PC custom training that focuses on maintaining a dribble on the roof of your carFEBFBDThe first time I did this it took over a half hour to get all the goals completed and after the th time or so it took less than  mins so its helped me a lot.Heres a video that might help tooThe main point of that video is that if the ball is in the exact middle of the roof of your car it will not bounce off of your car. If the ball is just to the left of center it will roll off to the left. Imagine almost that your car is a minihill with the peak of the hill being the middle of the roof and if the ball is off center it will roll down the hill in that direction.,RocketLeague,db7ss54,3,t5_30cz1

9995531,0,t1_dba0x5w,Wasteland is fairly poorly designed in some aspects. Shooting almost any ball at any speed or angle into the corner equals it rollingbouncing into a dangerous position and the elevated areas around the sides really give some serious advantages to anyone half decent at dribbling. It wouldnt be much of a problem if the goal was normal but its  bigger or something meaning that a single person basically cant cover it at reasonably close ranges.It also places extremely high value on aerial skills and positional skills two things that the vast majority of the player base lacks. Think about the distance at which you score the average Wasteland goal vs standard map goal. It basically requires less skill to score and more skill to save putting more value on your teamwork which is a rare thing in randoms.I personally dont mind it much these days but the problems are fairly obvious with average player skill in mind and the fact that the vast majority is playing Doubles. ,RocketLeague,dbag259,0,t5_30cz1

10009488,0,t1_db9qoke,Sorry for the late reply!  Id say you have to get really used to air control. Like REALLY used to it. Youd have to have air control to the point where it takes almost no time for you to adjust and carry the ball in almost any kind of orientation your car is in  be it reverse sideways to the right or sideways to the left.  For starters and although it seems like bad advice try to learn to freestyle! Throw in some practice with your airroll and obtain control over your car  be able to aerial in any kind of orientation your car is in as said above.  After youve gotten a good hold of your air control then should you try to actually air dribble. There are many ways to start an air dribble  you can start it from a dribble from a bounce or off the wall.  ampnbsp  Off the Wall  Imo this is the easiest way to start an air dribble but its the one that can be disturbed the most easily. Simply roll the ball up the wall and chip it out then jump along with the ball and boost under the ball to carry it to the goal. There are many videos out there that show exactly how its done and the many ways to do it you should check them out!  ampnbspFrom a Bounce  This one is rather convenient. If the ball is bouncing infront of you simply move to it slowly and pop the ball up after it has bounced with a jump. The ball should be moving in the same direction as you so you can carry it to the goal.  ampnbsp  From a Dribble  I feel like this is the most difficult way to start an air dribble and itll produce a notveryefficient one too.  However its convenient. The ball simply has to be on your hood moving at the same speed and direction of your car. Simply jump face up and start boosting to carry the ball.  ampnbspIf youd like any more help Id be willing to have a private match with you to maybe show you how to start off an air dribble from either of those ways and I can spectate you to tell you what youre doing wrong.

10020883,0,t1_dbdn4zj,I have figured it out. Its a somewhat simple issue with annoying fixes. The issue is the stick on my controller Xbox  controller on my PC is limited from its full range of movement by the plastic cover plate on the controller. I discovered this by taking the controller apart and testing the joystick on the controllerjoystick settings on Windows. So its simply poor craftsmanship by Microsoft. As for a fix the easy way would be to buy a new controller. The crafty way which is the way I did is to take apart the controller and file away at the circle which goes around the joystick on the plastic cover plate until Windows sees the full range of movement from the controller. Its not pretty but it certainly worked.Its silly and somewhat Microsofts fault for not having a calibration system which actually works and also Psyonixs fault for requiring a controllers full range of motion in order to be able to play the game at the highest level possible.,RocketLeague,dbdqyyo,1,t5_30cz1

Open command prompt type ping google.com t hit enter and leave that running while you play. The moment you have any issues check command prompt and check if the ping timed out recently. If you play on console you can still do this on a laptop or computer nearby while youre playing. This isnt a foolproof test as there could be other issues at play including your hardware.

10153544,0,t1_dbuxo00, in that video is probably the most relevant part. The game clientserver will do a pretty good job of predicting player and ball movement at lower pings.At ms this starts to become less effective and youll begin to notice cases where it seems like someone made contact with the ball but then it immediately gets corrected by the server seemingly snapping back into place. I think what youre saying has a bit of confirmation bias associated with it. That is if you lose a challenge or a kickoff and check your ping youre more likely to say it was due to lag if you have a higher ping. Ping is pretty negligible up until about ms when the prediction can no longer keep up. Keep in mind this can go both ways. The one issue with having some compensation for network lag is that the players with good ping will experience negative effects. If your team has  ping and the opposing team has  ping you may actually lose some s and it will look as though you are the one lagging. Some very weird stuff can happen when both players dont have a stable connection.For reference I usually play with ms but I have ms while Im on break.,RocketLeague,dbuyl5t,4,t5_30cz1

This would a require a system overhaul since currently the system doesnt consider map preferences until after players have been grouped into a lobby and b increase queue times for everybody.

Its because the majority of high grand champs will climb every time they play they are better than  of the players that they can possibly be matched against so they just climb forever.Thats why you dont see a fair representation of who are the absolute best players in the top  leaderboards its just down to who has played the most out of those top players.I wouldnt count myself in that btw.

Which way the is the ball going to shoot out? The direction of least resistance past your fingertips. Move your hands in anyway keeping them in contact at at least  point. Where you see the largest gap is the path of least resistance and the ball will travel in that direction.Think of it similar to pinching the ball on the wall. you pinch it but put your car in a position to put more pressure on the direction you do not want it to go leaving the ball only  option to travel the other direction.Now take this knowledge look at the direction your opponents coming from adjust your angle to create that V with the largest gap allowed pointing in the direction you want the ball to travel.,RocketLeague,dc4p77c,2,t5_30cz1

10261028,0,t3_5mv59x,Placing fun and friendships over match results is the best way to play Rocket League.  If you are able to have fun with your teammates and also find good results then youve got something special.As for game strategy I prefer playing with strategic minded players rather than mechanicalreaction players.  There is far less frustration when everyone on the team is thinking on a larger scale than Hit Ball away from own net  GoodPersonal story time I played with two different teams.  In both teams we had great banter and I could play with any of the teammates at any time.  We had many great successes and took some games off Generations of Billys Galaxy Gaming Complain and Cosmic Aftershock XD.  Both teams disbanded though when Rocket League became more about being serious than fun for us.  The frustration and constant failures in the RO in tournaments was too much.  I scrutinized mistakes too harshly instead of focusing on our game strategy and probably contributed to making it less fun.  Since then my entire mindset on Rocket League has changed and I think we could be really amazing.  Too bad we dont keep in touch anymore. Also I have one friend that I always loved playing with.  He was full of banter and never took the game seriously but still played like a god.  I would say he was my first real friend that I made through Rocket League.  We also clicked on a level that I have not been able to reach with another person since.  TLDR  I am so alone.,RocketLeague,dc756a8,4,t5_30cz1

Discord has its PTB League of Legends has its PBE Dota has its Dota Test. WoW OW amp Diablo  all have PTRs. These are all done this way because not only can it not work as a single playlist like you suggest but because it is far more efficient to work with and provide feedback on. whether you like that fact or not is irrelevant. ,RocketLeague,dc9i5ib,1,t5_30cz1

This is probably what they have now but its very lax because many people would be wrongly banned or muted.Real employees looking at reports could be costly because Im assuming there are too many reports in a day to keep up with.

That alone took me a few hours to get used to that everything works with a delay so you have less time to react to surprising situations. My PC is an ancient piece of shit and still the stuttering is worse on XBone. Graphical glitching drastic frame drops and crashingwhich I think has happened once on PC in  months twice on a single night of XB all really noticeable. Theres no options. I want to disable half the graphics stuff there are to make it run better but I cant. I cant do the rebinds I want. The lag is terrible. I get roughly double the ping on my XBone.

10399927,0,t3_5oxrz9,Did you follow the directions in the answer here and it still failed? You should run a hard drive test looking for bad sectors if so. If your drive has any bad sectors immediately back it up and go buy another hard drive then securely wipe out the dying drive with DBAN and send it away for melting down.The OS can often recover from and deal with bad sectors and most new drives have the odd one already premarked. Once they start developing in the drive in my experience dont bother with it any further. Back up and get a new drive.Thats for platter drives. I have not much experience with the death of solid states. My guess would be that they deal with bad sectors much more gracefully and would be more usable as sectors start going.Anoyher thing is that the download might just be corrupt. So you can try deleting the temp files and kick the install off again. Not sure how to do that with steam. ,RocketLeague,dcmwcnm,1,t5_30cz1

10419303,0,t1_dcosjpg,Nice. The only few recommendations I could have are A SSD is something I cant live without after owning one. I only put windows and a few programs I use regularly like Photoshop steam rocket league chrome etc. on it. And It is truly amazing how much quicker everything is on start up and how snappy windows feels. Check this out I suggest at the very least a gb one for just windows. It is worth every penny. If you think theres any chance your going to want to dive in to over clocking at all pay the extra for the k since the  can not be overclocked without essentially unlocking it which from the last time I looked is quite difficult and ruins warranty. A CPU cooler is a good investment just to extend the life of your CPU. Hyper  Evo and the Cryorig H are the two most commonly suggested for on a budget. If you do prefer the Hyper  Evo make sure it fits in your case before hand its quite large.  Buying xgb Ram has the ever so slightest unnoticeable advantage over xgb stick. But its also slightly cheaper and allows the option of upgrading to gb if wanted in the future where the latter forces you to fork out the cash to jump to gb. This isnt really to big of deal though.  The GTX  is also another option you have. When performing FPS test it performs a few frames better on every p test. But as soon as you go to p or higher it falls behind by a few frames to the . Peripherals?  Your going to want to have case fans to help out on cooling especially with the graphics card and hard drives. I have these and they work wonderfully and arent very loud either. Plus that cost is cheaper than a meal at most restaurants Does your keyboard have bluetooth for your controller? If not your going to need buy a USB bluetooth adapter or a cord. Watch for deals! I saved close to two hundred dollars and got better parts for my first build because I just bought items on sale and some used. For example got my Rosewill PSU for like  on sale. Got my AIO Antec Water cooler for  dollars used off ebay. Bought my tb Hard drive for  dollars refurbished. Bought my Samsung  Evo gb ssd for like  on sale!

10471616,0,t1_dcv19ug,Thats a good question that I dont know the answer to haha. But I do see it recommended a lot.If I had to guess I would think that limiting your fps to double your display rate assuming you are capable of maintaining that fps will result in more stability because the refresh rates will somewhat be in sync due to their common denominator. E.g. We have a hz monitor and set our fps limit to  vsync and it stable because we can guarantee a  refresh ratio. If we set our fps limit to  and are confident we can comfortably maintain that we can guarantee a ratio of  or  loops per display refresh. If we were to set it to  fps we would have moments where the CPU would perform  loops while the display refreshed and other times we would have  loops.Anyways thats just a guess!,RocketLeague,dcv2d3r,1,t5_30cz1

10511270,0,t3_5qhv5r,Toxic and annoying people are part of every online game. Theyre arguably part of every experience with the random public in general online or off. It takes a particular mindset to deal with that and if you dont have it I can sympathize. Its not for everyone.Regarding the ranks though theres nothing wrong with the system. Result not performance is the basis of virtually every individual ranking system in the world. Chess for example. Tennis. Golf. Go. Its extremely difficult to find a combination of performance statistics that is universally predictive of skill. The only combination that really works is. . .all of them. Did you win or not? Its admittedly a terrible metric in the short term but its the most accurate thing available over dozenshundreds of matches. What that means is that although you might think youre playing well if youre not ranking up after playing a statistically significant number of games what youre doing is not helping your team win. Now due to the large number of games you need to play for the average result to assert itself its entirely possible that you might be ranked a little bit lower than you deserve. If you improve it may well take five or ten hours to see that reflected much in your rank. Having played and watched a ton of games for over a thousand hours though I can assure you that someone  ranks higher than the rest of players will carry a game far more often than not. Grand Champions on new accounts can make it back to GC in under  games. It may take them another few hundred to claw back their last bit of MMR but they can get  of the way there with basically zero effort. You might be a Challenger  or you might be a  but youre absolutely not a Star. So again the ranking system is fine. Its not perfect you may not be precisely where you belong but youre in the right ballpark. Youre close enough to be getting pretty fair matches and thats whats important. A meaningful increase in your skill level will absolutely result in ranking up within a reasonable amount of time. ,RocketLeague,dczkbiv,2,t5_30cz1

And then  games later your string of seemingly bad teammates has you just avoiding demotion to challenger . Logically I know I was the most obvious common thread in demoting back that far.  But also logically I know I was the only common thread in promoting that far.  It makes your head want to explode trying to figure out if you or a random string of others are the problem.,RocketLeague,dd2pddz,3,t5_30cz1

10586911,0,t3_5rj62i,The third is they actually are superstars but because playstyles and rotation vary so much between superstar champ and GC the fact that they are a team all on the same page gives them an advantage over the positional confusion happening on my team. This is bad as it doesnt truly signify the game understanding and ability that makes you earn your rank.I have to disagree with that point as if they as a team are rotating and positioning better than your team and win because of that there is no reason that they shouldnt be playing at the same rank you are.Id also like to add on to your list of reasons somebody is playing at a rank below their skill levelThey havent played in a while and lost their rankThey were focusing on a different playlist but still improved as a playerWin streaks are designed to minimize the pain of playing with people who arent your skill level so that a player who should be at champion level only plays  games against ShootingSuper Stars and not . Now you are taking a risk of your own if you decide to solo que and end up with a teammate who isnt at your level.Are there things that should be changed about the system? Definitely.

10609695,0,t1_dd9wdhw,gt  In Rocket League there is no such thing as a comeback through superior athleticism despite it being an ENORMOUS part of real life sports of any kind and only a complete fuckup from your opponent allows you back to save the day. I want to reply to this part in particular. This is a misconception in my opinion. While there is no athleticism in a high level scenario you have to be going at the highest speed possible with no mistakes. Generally for a long time due to bo and bo series. Comebacks do happen do to athleticism but not in the way youre thinking. Lets put  equal teams on the field and call them Team Mountain and Team Boomer. Team Mountain goes up  in a bo and wins the games pretty handily due to some mistakes on the part of Team Boomer. Team Mountain gets tired and starts trying as hard due a variety of factors including overconfidence playing for a long time etc. Team Boomer continues to try as hard and fix their mistakes. Team Boomer wins . This is one of the many things that separates high level players. The ability to stay focused over long sessions and keep focused on winning.,RocketLeague,ddab4sp,3,t5_30cz1

Be really fucking cautious when you advance dont just go zooming at the ball the second the first pass is whiffed or stuffed or youve completely abandoned your zone and opened up an easy counter attack.

10759061,0,t1_ddpnbt0,Well the batmobile has one of the longest and widest hitboxes but is the shortest of all the cars. This means that hitting the ball on the ground will pop the ball up higher which is neither good nor bad. This also means that some shots on goal that other cars for example the Octane can simply drive into and shoot towards the top of the goal would require the batmobile to jump before hitting it to avoid hitting the ball too high. Also the batmobile cant ground dribble as well because the short hitbox makes sharp turns with the ball very difficult as the ball would simply roll on top of the car. Its also perhaps a bit more difficult to dribble with the ball on top of the car. Its also a lot more difficult to bounce dribble with because the timing has to be a lot more precise and its a lot easier to accidentally drive under a bouncing ball. Shots are also more difficult to aim because of the shortness of the hitbox.As for the pros it has covers a large area with the top and bottom of the car making for some favorable aerial hits and blocks. It can pop the ball up on top of the car to begin a dribble easier than other cars. Because its long and wide it is much easier to flick the ball once on top of the car. Rebounds are easier again because of the size of the roof. Air dribbling is easier because of how wide it is.,RocketLeague,ddppuj0,2,t5_30cz1

10851323,0,t1_ddz83ke,Yes that is what you should work on.  You want to be able to do the basics as efficiently as possible.  It helps to take time every play session to go into the trainer and work on things you feel you need to improve.Also being able to clear a ball from the wall when it rolls high in the corner helps keep offensive pressure off you.  People will often wait for it to roll onto the ground which gives time for your opponent to challenge your clear.  Just make sure you get a good hit if you miss a wall clear you will be punished.,RocketLeague,ddz8jpc,1,t5_30cz1

10857163,0,t3_5v7hst,Mute them. Report them. Continue to play the match.  These  steps are all you need to do.  Solo standard is bad because it is a tougher playlist and people have a lower rank in it . Some people think that since they are X rank in doubles that they deserve to be the same in solo standard.  This mentality causes some sort of superiority complex and makes them think all other players in their match are worse than them.  They fail to see that others can be the same or higher in skill and they have a meltdown when they start losing.All you need to do is shrug it off.  It sucks but if you report and mute them your experience will improve.  From an outside perspective from someone who rarely sees this if this happens more to you than the average person.

10882154,0,t1_de2e8vk,What is the plan for the organization? Say if the business does start to pick up and you gain popularity you might be able to petition Psyonix for funding for prize pools. I think the point the comment you replied to is that as a new and unknown organization Im making an assumption your heart and soul that will form your play base will most likely not be people that can easily afford tournament fees. While I understand the need for some way to generate capital for the prize pool having a tournament fee during the infant stages may very well discourage people from participating. My guess is that when the organization opens and you have your very first tournament the player list will be comprised of no namespeople who might be trying their luck with their first tournament. Ideally you should raise enough capital to support prize pools without charging the participants. Personally Im at the stage where Im entertaining the idea of joining a tournament. However I am not willing to pay any  due to my lack of confidence. After you start generating revenue to make the organization self sustainingyou get funding from Psyonix then you can go from there. Full disclosure Im a  college student with no formal experience in anything business related so I may very well be incorrect. ,RocketLeague,de2f0lh,1,t5_30cz1

I left my powerslide on L too because I dont need to powerslide in air and backwards.And I put boost on X and jump on square.

10904074,0,t1_de4m0wx,Like I said I didnt mean to be a dick. Im not saying that Paladin decals are shit. TBH Id prefer if none of the decals were locked to  car so that we didnt have this problem in the first place. I hate the Takumi and most of my decals that I have are Takumi. Its a waste and makes me feel bad about my decision to purchase keys. Im not talking shit on the Paladin. I am not in any way taking the stance that Paladin decals would lower the chances of getting something good from a crate. In fact if Psyonix took all of the Takumi decals and made them Paladin decals Id be happy. What I am saying is that some of the community would react that way. It may even be a large enough portion of the community that they would lose money by making Paladin decals compared to if they just made something else.Im trying to say that what is best for you and what would get you to buy crates isnt necessarily what is best for the game and what would get the most people to buy crates. Again I hate Takumi. If they took the Takumi decals out Id buy more keys. But thats not going to happen because Im in such a small minority that it would be a bad idea. Psyonix knows the stats of how many people use what car admittedly it might be higher if there were better decals for other cars but Im sure they take that into account and they probably have metrics for figuring out what would appeal to the customer base in the most effective way.You want Paladin decals. I dont want Takumi decals. We both have to deal with the fact that our opinion is in the minority and might not be catered to.,RocketLeague,de4oell,2,t5_30cz1

What youre trying to bring up now is an entirely different point i.e. the  degree turning with joystick vs.  directions of KBM.So for the third time If there was any objectively measurable advantage to using a joystick instead of WASD youd see CSGO pros holding a controller with one hand and the other on the mouse.

I agree fully that they should give a skin to these maps that makes it easier to play because its just not fair that the graphics outside of the court while the mechanics are all the same is the difference.,RocketLeague,de6mbbf,2,t5_30cz1

10928296,0,t1_de6l0el,You need more overall skill to achieve the same maneuvers thats why people prefer controllers. Many also prefer to not use binary keys for movement in a game where movement is the main core mechanic of playing the game. Factually you are limited by input you have a maximum of  directions to move while controller players have  degrees of movement. Its a big difference not at the casual level where most people learn the controls without rebinding them and most of the time dont mess with camera settings or camera shake and just play for fun. Though for ranked play theres a reason why there is not a single paid RL pro who uses kbm.,RocketLeague,de76dw0,1,t5_30cz1

Trying to complete the trade up gives me an server error and I dont lose or gain items.Screenshot along with an unrelated pigeon.EDIT after further review what the game has shown me in the buggy state was my complete collection of rare items I accept crate donations. s .

Get that through your head.ampnbspIf you think that just because the game is big and successful that it has to have perfect servers you are mistaken. CSGO has issues with servers. Dota has issues with servers. And these are from games that are magnitudes more successful than RL.ampnbspWe arent fangirling shit. We just hate seeing pointless complaining.

Now I love a rant but when its a decent rant that people may actually care about. If you reached GC and put a post up id be there congratulating you. Because if you reach that next rank whatever it is its an achievement but I really dont give a crap if you division down after winning  games. crappy rants like this should be in the rant Monday pinned post. anyway Im done on this post next time make it a little clearer your joking rather that it seeming like yet another toxic ass wipe rant. ,RocketLeague,debpgzs,2,t5_30cz1

And he only said he has one smurf account.You could be right as well but I just dont think it would make sense to make this post if hes doing what you said simply because the easier solution to warming up would just be playing unranked.

11035950,0,t3_5xigvc,gtWhat I cant expect is which teams will make it out of the group of death Iris Atelier and Selfless. One of those teams will not qualify and thats kind of scary to even say.uKronovis actually mistaken here  the group of death is actually Gs group not Iris.  Because  teams can make it to RLCS from each group and Gs group has three of the top  NA teams whereas all other groups only have two top  teams.  Essentially next week G is projected to face Ohana and Selfless faces Atelier.  Then in the losers bracket whoever loses G vs Ohana is projected to face whoever loses Selfless vs Atelier for the last RLCS spot.  But the other top  NA teams Genesis Iris Take  NRG and Denial are projected to have a relatively easier ride through qualifiers not having to face another top  team like SelflessAtelier in the losers bracket. So funny enough if G lost more the past few weeks and were subsequently ranked lower like rd seed or even th seed instead of their current nd seed they wouldve actually had an easier time in qualifiers.  So the RLCS qualifier bracket seems a bit flawed.,RocketLeague,deiwlrt,3,t5_30cz1

11060590,0,t1_delnels,Demos can be usefull and bumps are sometimes an even better option. But when someone goes for demos chain bumps or carries while ignoring completly the ball and not usefull in any way to a play it is just really frustating to be out of the game  seconds at each demo without the ability to move the camera around to know where the ball is it was better when we could still do it.... At higher levels its accepted because goalies are so good you have to do something better than just a shot on net. Demos or bumps are common plays at RLCS for example. But at lower levels it is not the case because the players are trying to focus on the incomming ball car placement boost and jump timing. Adding an opponent trying to bump is not possible and thats why at lower levels its called drity plays because youre going for the easy play when on their side they were entirely focus on not missing the ball.  On an other subject its the same for player in v who only scores on counterattacks. A lot of times it leads to forfeit or bad talk from the opponent ,RocketLeague,delp7j9,2,t5_30cz1

Challenger Players cant rank up due to Prospect Players actually being in Challenger rank and are not good enough against other high challenger players  Real ones that group up  in turn forcing solo players to stay at a lower rank than they should be.,RocketLeague,denj2ay,1,t5_30cz1

And then Ill play a couple unranked games to make sure Im playing well. If Im not playing very well Ill just keep playing unranked to warm up. But sometimes if my internet is bad or Im just not feeling it Ill play training for a long timehour or . All star Ariel training is good for learning to do the fast take off and learning to twist your car. The shots are a little unrealistic but I feel like but it can help with mechanics a lot. I will also get into free play and work on my ground game. I found that I started playing better when I slowed down and really thought about what would happen after my touch on the ball. Like dribbling it out of my corner instead of just clearing the ball to their half and then they have ball control again. I started playing ones a lot also and that made me WAY better because I was forced to find the place between to aggressive and to defensive. And that carried over to my doubles and standard game play. ,RocketLeague,deochx7,1,t5_30cz1

You can see the list of all the team brackets on the RL wiki here If you see something wrong on Liquipedia it is very unlikely to be intentional and most often cause by misinformation from a tournament organisers website or just simple human error.Instead of assuming people intentionally are putting you down you should try to get in contact with them. For Liquipedia that is easy most contributors have a userpage that has their contact info look at the history tab of a page to see who has made edits to the page There is also the Liquipedia Twitter account and our Discord Server that you can find linked on every single page here CS SC HS etc or here RLDotaOW etc,RocketLeague,deqe8nx,5,t5_30cz1

11175258,0,t1_deykod2,Everything here is good but Id also like to add one thing speed of play. This involves going slowly as well as playing quickly. When the ball is coming your way look ahead. If there is open space in front and you feel confident in your skill trap the ball and dribble it upfield or up the wall. Just keep possession and then pass or shoot. Dont just be in a blind hurry to get the ball out of your half.  On the other hand the higher you go the faster things are gonna be. Ball anticipation and prediction will be a huge part of your game. He who can read the ball faster will be first to the ball. And he who is always first to the ball can be expected to have more opportunities on net. This means being able to read bounces before the occur and line up your car so that your jump is in the right direction so all your boost can be focused on speed instead of flight direction changes. Timing is everything. ,RocketLeague,deypbgl,1,t5_30cz1

11179433,0,t1_dez5sha,gt Right but over time the playerbase over time increases meaning that it allows extra GCs into the pool while maintaining the same percentage.gt Plus I never said for it to be purely percentage only either. But rather closer to percentage dictated. Just altering the MMR value to stay close to the true percentage but not exact. This would allow said wiggle room for  of smurfs and such would it not?It might but it might not. It all would depend the actual numbers which neither of us has access to. Actually Psyonix probably wouldnt even be able to calculate since there really would be no way to tell since some hold accounts on different platforms in addition to the smurf accounts.

11182336,0,t1_dezhnpp,Well thankfully dislikes are going to carry way more weight after matchmaking in Season  like they should have been.  They are supposed to work as a voting system to get as close as possible to how RLCS works with map picking and they are not supposed to be an ultimate  ban on maps because  player says so and dictates what other players have to do.  So now if no one in the match wants it they will never see it.

11204061,0,t3_5zy22y,I dont know what rank you are but its possible that your teammates behavior is your fault at least to an extent. You have to show initiative in coming forward. If you dont appear to be coming up fast enough they may feel like they have to turn. Obviously this depends on the situation and level of play might be a good idea to set your flair in the sidebar but in most scenarios if theyre able to retreat with no boost grab mid turn and STILL beat you to the ball you probably werent aggressive enough. Keep in mind that you dont rotate for fairness sake you rotate because your defensive teammate should be able to get a faster better hit. Now yes I understand that there are a lot of ball chasers who arent going to rotate no matter what. Many people will though if they see youve got it. In the beginning of the game try to give your teammates the benefit of the doubt. Dont wait to go forward until they have come back go forward when they should be able to get back. If youve done this a couple of times and your teammate refuses to drop back well you might have to resign yourself to a game of defense. I think youll find that a lot of people can take the hint though.  Also yes I realize that this post was meant to be funny and it was!.

11215161,0,t3_603pbg,First problem typing in game on console is likely to lose you the match  theres no time and theres no chance in hell youll be able to educate your team mates on the fundamentals of rotation by typing in game.  Likely outcome you lose goals  you piss them off.That being the case you must adapt.  Awareness of your team mates is as critical as the opposition players  no quick tips here this just comes from brutal experience.  You need to quickly determine what is needed for the benefit of the team by analysing your team mates and the opposition and fill that role  I agree this is likely to be more defensive in the Challenger ranks but...Final note rotation is very fluid your statement All Im getting now is complaints I never leave the goal due to them not rotating positions suggests you are perhaps part of the problem.  You need to be in a position to rotate in for your team mate to maintain pressure  this is highly susceptible to change depending on the play but if your team mate as he tries to rotate out sees you too far back and not in a position to maintain pressure he is likely correctly to turn around.  You need to be in the right position for the play but also be visible for your rotating team mate  its a tough balance.,RocketLeague,df383yk,6,t5_30cz1

11216077,0,t1_df2qxsq,Its not about being fair for the teams its about getting the best teams into league play in the fairest way possible. A spot opened up  because of a DQ. No matter how this happened or which teams lost against the illegal team the next step is to get the best team out of all contenders to fill that spot. I think Psyonix did a good job at that. ,RocketLeague,df3bug9,3,t5_30cz1

With framerate based sampling it would skew the results too much for both high FPS players and low FPS players because it would be checking too often or not often enough. over and undersampling respectively.

To get better you will have to improve your mechanics a bit and become more versatile in how you handle the ball.Playing s is very good for your overall ball handling. Aside from that the best way is probably to play around in freeplay and training for like  minutes everyday trying to become better at aerials ballcontrol or whatever. Just grinding matches doing the same thing over and over again will not help you become more versatile.,RocketLeague,df97khb,5,t5_30cz1

11271470,0,t1_df9lgh0,Well... I guess the difference with me is that I always play with randoms. I rarely team up with friends in any of the ranks. Yes the skills are there but it makes no difference if neither of you or your teammates back you up where the other is lacking. I cant even get into Champ on s because of that.

Everyone is different in that regard though.

I havent played it on console. I will tell you this thread is the first time I found out a loading screen existed though.

11283676,0,t1_dfayx39,I understand your idea I think you dont understand how this benefits the losing party and how this is a negative feedback system. Try to implement a similar system to a football match. When team A is ahead by at least one goal the last  minutes of the game goals count double. When amount of goals are irrelevant like in RL and only winning matters such a system does not benefit team A at all they are already at winning position and even if they scored themselves it would have the same effect as scoring from a winning position if your idea was not implemented for example if team A is ahead by  when they score it will be  if we implement goals count double but team B then only has to score twice to gain the victory. If the system wasnt implemented team A goes from  to  and team B has to score  times. If team A doesnt score at all and the score is  team B needs to score once when the system is implemented twice when it isnt. The new system benefits the party thats losing.This example may be crude were not counting scores doubly but the same thing happens when you make a system where scoring becomes easier in any way. The team thats ahead team A does not benefit at all considering any additional goals they make will be as likely countered by additional goals by team B they gain the same benefit whereas the position that team A has gained by winning all game long is now in greater jeopardy because team B can now more easily come back from the losing position because scoring has become easier.In other words the last minute has become much much more important than the  minutes before that. Like I previously said a team can get completely wrecked  minutes long but when their good minute happens to be the last minute they can get back and win which I consider to be unfair considering the complete outlook of the game.Such systems only make sense in games that scale have inherent positive feedback loops like DotA where if you do not implement negative feedback loops an advantage early gained can unfairly become impossible to overcome later on.,RocketLeague,dfazkpp,1,t5_30cz1

If youre in a tough low scoring match and have worked hard to get possession of the ball and create a scoring opportunity that hits the ground right in front of the goal that hard work amounts to nothing when the clock hits  and OT starts.Im not lobbying for the change just playing devils advocate a bit.

I responded by telling them that they should really read my ticket before responding because they either didnt read it or completely missed the point that I wasnt at all upset that I couldnt report in game because he had left midmatch and that I went out of my way to report through their site directly because I felt it was an exploit that could ruin the game for a lot of people. Their next response was clearly from someone who read my message and they were also of no help telling me the best way to help them is to report for unsportsmanlike conduct ingame.Anyways I believe you.

11310919,0,t1_dfd2w7n,I understand everyones distaste with boosting but try to consider the other side of the picture. This guy who is a professional player who does make money off of tournaments has dedicated an insane portion of his life to rocket league. The hours of traininggames combined with the mental dedication while not playing i.e. daydreaming about new tactics leave little time for much else in a lot of these players lifes. So what does this guy do? He uses the skill hes has developed and earned to try to make extra money so he can live off of the game. Well why doesnt he just live off of his tournament winnings???? Answer tournament winnings are small unless you are on the top  teams in the world. The guys on the th best team in the world put in a crazy amount of time to not be able to make more playing the game. Hopefully as the rocket league esports scene develops there will be more money for pros and these tactics will stop. Dont hate on this guy for trying to make the time hes put into the game worth it.

11338675,0,t3_61scg3,This is a weird tip but it helped me a lot. I like to think of my teammates as sort of my personal assistants. Instead of going in the corner yourself stay in net and let your teammate do it. Instead of trying to center the ball let your teammate do it and wait for the pass instead. This helped me a lot because I always had the mentality of needing to do everything myself with my teammates being there as backup. This way it encourages you to watch the play way more and understand whats going on. The moments when you NEED to play the ball will become MUCH more obvious once you start letting your teammates do more stuff.,RocketLeague,dfh7w9w,1,t5_30cz1

11350044,0,t1_dfi7kwa,I moved...several times during the years you learn all the fundamental stuff. Because different districts meant different curriculums there were entire years where I relearned stuff from the last school.I have trouble with Matrix equations some fractions and had no idea there was an order of operations until my first semester in college boy was that an eye opener. In fact polynomials were new to me. The schools also pushed for me to be given Ritalin this was the s and early s which I received the worst sideeffects. All of this coupled with the fact that I am a weirdo meant I was placed in the Special Education classes.I did start to eventually figure things out but only after failing Calculus twice in college. In my final year I did make thisCoC  E .  yNE  ED CieCoC  Cost of Care E  Total number of actual elderly in a population.  elderly estimated to be institutionalized as a percent of the totalyNE  Number of new elderly in one yearED  Number of elderly who have died in a single yearCie  Average cost of a single institutionalized elderlyAt this point you just cross reference studies and place in data. The entire equation can be divided by the amount of time you want to see a linear snapshot of the CoC. I made this because I couldnt find something comparable poking around online and needed the data for a classgroup research paper. Some small alterations and you should be able to figure out the growth or decline of cost over time though I am not sure how to go about that.I am sure there are math savants here on Reddit who would absolutely destroy that equation. To me though it felt amazing that I could even begin to do something like that.    ,RocketLeague,dfii8zu,2,t5_30cz1

11352568,0,t1_dfiqu2i,Ahh i see. Ive noticed that forum mods dev team reps etc are typically very reserved when making public forum comments. While a comment like We are looking into this can help it also implies that it is going to be fixed at some point. Now I dont know anything about SCs arcade mode but if its anything like Overwatchs then it is not a top priority for the dev team. So saying we are looking into this then not actually being able to look into it can be a very stressful and problematic situation for the team. So what are they to say instead? We dont have the time or  enough resources available to fix the issue right now but hopefully we can fix it soon. That just looks bad.

Im still joining games regularly in s with season  Grand Champs. I think the issue is that you might end up with  opponents that last season where champion while your team mate was rising star. So you end up bobbing up and down in the ranks struggling to get where you should be. There are still a lot of players in platinum that imo clearly shouldnt be there so only time will tell if the ranks will even out. ,RocketLeague,dfq5509,1,t5_30cz1

11419611,0,t3_630b4n,imma full masamune player  its really easy to dribble and flick with. turning radius is also pretty good it feels smooth when playing with it. power hits are medium you have to hit it right or it wont go supersonic speed unlike something like the batmobile where nearly everything is a power hit. but better than the octane for power hits. also medium is the shape versus the looks its pretty easy to see what youre doing but very occasionally the rounded corners of the car will mess you up. The main weakness is probably challenges. its a narrow car so if you dont hit the ball dead on and the other person has an octane or batmobile and does youre pretty much toast. overall I like it a lot although I admit its not really the best car to pick if youre trying to go pro.

So ball possession in early game would be another element. Unless they all go for the aerial kickoff which would still be fair as it leaves everyone boostless and out of position.However I still think you can always counter faceoffs. If you see the diagonal flip you know it is a fastkickoff so you go for the outer block. For normal kickoffs go a little higher and avoid late forward dodges. But you probably know all of this.,RocketLeague,dfqj8v4,1,t5_30cz1

11465834,0,t1_dfvidco,If a batmobile and an octane are equally distant from an aerial ball and both jump at the same time to reach the ball the contact will be indistinguishable in terms of visual proximity i.e. you will not be able to see who hit the ball first. However given the length of the batmobile it will generally win out aerials in this manner. There is little science in this area as this is the physics of a video game we are talking about here so anecdotal evidence is really all there is to go by. In general if you launch for an aerial with a batmobile against an octane if the launches are similar the batmobile will win the aerial due to its length. I cannot provide controlled experiments to affirm this position  however I do not believe this is necessary. Its a measure of the length of the car.,RocketLeague,dfvn91t,1,t5_30cz1

11471225,0,t1_dfw3319,This is something I have practiced for months and finally have gotten a really good handle on.I see a lot of players try to blast through the ball off the wall possibly to give it trajectory. It doesnt work. Theres really three main things to consider when doing them your speed while approaching the ball the part of the car you hit the ball with and your jump upon hitting the ball.Your speed should match the ball. This is really noticeable because if youre too fast the ball will launch from the wall and too slow youll fly over it. Repetition is really the only way to find the niche.You should always be hitting the ball of the wall with the front of the car. The angle of your car closest to the net will drive the ball to the corner. The other angle as youll be in front of the ball.Lastly when to jump. This has been debated even within you asking it. For a long time I was doing a hit the ball and jump in one fluid motion. It really doesnt work. You jeopardize your hit ad the ball is less predictable. The true answer from my perspective at least is to jump just the tiniest bit after contact. If you wait too long the balls no longer I. Your control. But again repetition is the only way to feel that it.Then you learn them and realize the actual chance you get to use them in game makes you question your real life decision making and how you chose to use your free time. ,RocketLeague,dfw9aiy,1,t5_30cz1

Focus on what you did wrong rather than what they yell at you about. If you can stay calm and point out your errors and actively fix them youll shoot up ranks. The only time you need to talk to your teammate is... well never. Think about the times you watch pro streams they never really talk to each other too much. They just know what to do and do it. They know when they mess up and they fix it. Just copy that mindset and youll do well. People get angry they have bad days have internal struggles or something is wrong with them. Then they take it out on someone they dont know because it has no real consequences. Its like really mean ranting. Im not saying its okay to do this it just happens.

11570671,0,t3_655cnx,If you blame your teammates then that means you think your teammates performance should reflect your rank which is a bullshit line of thinking. You are in control of the game for  minutes and every single decision you make hundreds! will impact the game.  There will always be something you could have improved on and you can. In ranked s theretically everyone should be valued as  of the teams success but the guy who is able to carry his team is the one who will climb not the guy who just plays ok and doesnt get carried but doesnt carry either.Btw points are BS. Assists are just as important as goals and plays that earn no points can be gamechanging. If you realize your team is shit you need to play more defensively.

You have to just keep trying and you will start to feel sooner and sooner that you need to adjust and eventually you can dribble. I have found a couple of philosophies that helped me a lot. Never break hit left trigger if you do it is most likely too late to recover. And remember that speed is not the goal. Use boost very sparingly and that accelerate button right trigger does not always have to be pushed. Use each button press very carefully never just hold accelerate or boost. Good luck!,RocketLeague,dg7kc3e,2,t5_30cz1

Before people learn aerials and air dribbles they really should focus on power slides and power shots first though the fast aerial launch is important as well especially to transfer momentum into a power shot.,RocketLeague,dg9duc8,2,t5_30cz1

11600400,0,t1_dgaoxit,It depends on what you mean by randomness.Is rockpaperscissors random?  I would argue yes.  There are no random elements in that game but the only way to win  of the time is to be psychic compare that to chess where you can win  of the time by playing perfectly even without psychic powers.I would argue fakes provide the same sort of randomness in Rocket League  sometimes you cant save both a fake and a hit and you need to guess which the opponent is thinking.Additionally the server latency causes a literal element of randomness because it is beyond anyones control.  Aside from the rare server chaos where things get completely unpredictable even the best connection will have tiny occasional latency hiccups which can cause the ball to travel in a slightly different direction than anticipated or can even mean the difference between a hit and a miss  These random hiccups can sometimes even cost you the gameSo yes there definitely is some element of randomness in Rocket League.,RocketLeague,dgawx50,11,t5_30cz1

They both cried if were going to use that termThats such a weird thing to be so against though.  If streamers genuinely cried out for help on their stream assuming Twitch is really the only support they can seem to find then I would not be opposed to them venting their pain out to others.  May not be the best method but its probably better than internalizing it past a breaking point like Im sure the reason someone would break down on stream is because they internalized their depressionwhatever until they hit a breaking point.  I doubt anyone would really want to use Twitch chat as a support group more likely than not its a lastditch effort.  Id rather they break and reach out for help than keep it to themselves because it can fester and get much worse.If they kept doing it then I mean fuck it its their stream they can do whatever they want.

11682313,0,t3_66p91j,I am going to explain this as how I understand what was happening I dont mind getting proven wrong but this is my interpretation. I watched the whole video and your teammates were NOT ball chasing at all. Of course at this level they might accidentally go for the same ball a couple times like you did yourself. And I understand you are new to this game so take this criticism with a grain of salt. I see why you think they were ball chasing but the problem was that you played way way to defensively and never really pushed up. Instead of rotating you could have pushed up when your teammates were getting  boost for example and thereby they would have waited for you to rotate. From what I saw the few times you were going for the ball and challenging it they did a good job of staying back but as the game went on you whiffed almost every single ball you went for there were only a couple of times you went for the ball and actually hit it having said that it makes sense that your teammates stayed close to you when you went for the ball yet they also seemed to be patient most of the time. IMO its ignorant of you to call them out for ball chasing when there were so many more things you did wrong.Edit yes they were overly aggresive but not ballchasing and you played defence the whole game and never attempted to attack.,RocketLeague,dgk7gli,2,t5_30cz1

11685223,0,t1_dgkcozi,. Paschys shot was very good. Crossing the line halfway. Most of the time it would take me much more time to recover thats why its goodand thats why chuasette aproachd closer to punish bad clear. I controlled the ball after the clear and managed to keep my speed while hitting the ballessentialy clearing it and grabbing the  boost pad that was the hardest part of the play and it leads to  being succesfull. And then quickly recover again to beat unexpecting violentpanda in the air.   Usually in pro play u dont want to commit to rotation to quickly when see ur team mate having easy touch . It set ups the redirect play thats why panda at worst tried to  and buy some time for chausette to rotate .

11688081,0,t1_dgkct52,I think  is about right at least for me I play a lot of s.  I knew your camera preference immediately when you said turn on ball cam which implies you use car cam more often.The truth is that players at a higher level dont really need to watch their own car because they always have a mental image of their cars position and orientation on the field.  Because of this ball cam is more useful because it allows them to track the ball accurately without having to focus on what their car is doing.  The other  is used for lining up shotspasses controlling the ball in tight spaces and checking whats in front of your car e.g. boost location.For some pro players Id say its probably closer to  ball cam depending on the playlist but theres a reason thats the universally accepted standard in the pro scene.  You lose so much information about whats going on behind you when using car cam that youll sometimes see those players get lost.  They cant see upfield passes coming unless they cherry pick they cant shadow attackers in the goal they cant spiderman camp above their goal and so on.As an anecdote I had a friend that solely used car cam last season and maxed out at Challenger .  I finally convinced him to give ball cam a shot at least for a few weeks and hes now approaching Platinum ranks.  Both ball cam and car cam have their uses but ball cam should be used  of the time unless youre playing a lot of s.Just my two cents.,RocketLeague,dgkv14p,1,t5_30cz1

At this stage there are many GCs stuck in Diamond which means those champions from last season cant get to champion yet.  The first item you shared is not official and is currently Incorrect. Yes the second item is official update notes but even psyonix have stated that the ranks are not lining up how they thought they would. The reason for the down vote is that you stated all ranks are exactly the same as last season except for GC. But you then go on to say champion  is champ champion  is super champ and champion  is low GC. Which means champion and super champion are different.
