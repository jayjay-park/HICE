178220,0,t1_ceyqaru,gt We are STILL rooting for Ms Sidibe. And it would seem you feel very strongly about Gabourey which is something I appreciate except for in this case.  Were both Team Black Girl obviously. As for rooting? On some level so am I. I really do still like her her actingbody of work. But that doesnt change the fact that she goofed and the nonapology she gave was an ever bigger goof. Im holding out with hope and faith that she does the right thing and evolves beyond this. The rooting comment is a play on Tyra Banks outburst from one of the Americas Next Top Model seasons.The problem here is that you assume I was sitting in the shadows like Gollum waiting for Gabby to drop the one ring because I dislike her on a personal level rather than simply calling her out. Because my issue is that honestly I didnt think she would ever say such things. She could do no wrong in my eyes. This title is about how she shattered that illusion for so many of us and even just in this community.  So instead of you asking me to apologize for using words you dont like maybe you should consider that you completely misunderstood me and applied a shitload of bias to your issues with the discussion at hand.Sure we share a difference in opinion and I am okay with that. Were not all here to agree with each other no matter what. But when you go in for the kill with this extremely defensive attack on her behalf you shouldnt be shocked when I hit back. At least enough to stop moving the goal posts every time you respond to me?Youre still way high in the positives in my RES for a reason but still.,blackladies,ceyqfje,5,t5_2vk9t

388738,0,t3_1ygthp, For most of my life I was complicit in this repackaging. I let myself be taken out of black culture and put into the white world because I thought that was where I belonged. I didnt conform to societys perceptions of black women and I didnt want to. I wanted to be viewed as classy and approachable as fun and lighthearted. I didnt want to be the girl who got into politicized debates about my race with my white friends. I thought that by letting them view me as a white girl I was changing their perceptions of black women. But I know better now. I know that what this does is degrade all black women in America. It says that my good traits are inherently white traits and if I were a real black girl I would not have those traits. But I AM a real black girl. And I DO hold those traits. And I refuse to let myself be removed from black society any longer.God. Damn. Chills. Thank you for this. From a black girl who grew up with the oreo stereotype.,blackladies,cfl241g,8,t5_2vk9t

1852788,0,t3_2fsxg7,Simple answer. We have no sense of community in the business sense. Blacks are less likely to support a blackowned business unlike various Asian or Latino peoples. Not only that when there are several people up in for consideration for more than one position blacks have to compete within to be better than the other blacks as corporate sees us as exchangeable.  So this mentality kind of propagates. Personally I try to support blackowned businesses when I can but I find the more notoriety they receive the more quality suffers. Nothing will change until businesses uplift their community and stop being so moneygrubbing. ,blackladies,ckcgfq3,6,t5_2vk9t

And now is the PERFECT time to start learning about the difference between you and someone else. To start learning what you are entitled to and what you arent.He wont learn it today. He wont learn it this year maybe. He will always be learning where the boundaries are and when its right to assert for himself vs. when someone else needs to be respected and given space.

2006519,0,t1_ckuvgxy,Absolutely. Also I thought he downplayed just how sicko the piece he was replying to wasgtOne of the worst parts about loving someone who wont love you back is the time you waste committed to that person while theyre off doing something without youloving other people caring about other things. They show up once in a while and you abide with your undivided attention. Then when you finally get over it you wonder why you gave so much to a lost cause.gtIt feels a little bit like that with DAngelo and Dr. Dres Detox. Same was the case with Harper Lee and J.D. Salinger. And now of course Lauryn Hill. Once you stop waiting you realize its not worth waiting. There are so many other great loves and artists out there more deserving of our adoration more willing to give it back.gtI often wonder if we just stopped caring would they stop withholding? Would they produce because by a twisted calculus theres no longer an incentive not to? Its like Achilles in the tent not wanting to go into battle despite pleas from his fellow soldiers. Once they leave him alone he comes out. Did you forget about me?I get loving something that an artist does and wanting more brilliance. But holy fuck they do not owe you anything.

Inventing all these ulterior motives whole cloth and concluding she must have had them is their way of trying to seem wise and sophisticated. That theres no evidence supporting their conclusions doesnt really matter.To be fair only some of the posters on that subreddit are responding that way. In any case heres the skeptics.stackexchange.com page one of rrunning mods posted where they conclude that the incident most likely happened. The post is over a year old and the marathon is from  so most of the Zheng Kai website links they cite as evidence are broken but I was able to find a cached version of their  marathon results.

2198614,0,t3_2k8ylc,Part of the issue here is the voice its coming from. Often men particularly white will hijack the humour and parody used by black women to express their righteous anger toward white women and perpetuate their own misogyny. White men especially love being able to use bitch as a pejorative removing it from its AAVE context with the simple condition of adding basic in front.Take these examples from the first results page of a google searchNo one would deny these as misogyny thinlyveiled as a critique on whiteness. These tropes of being basic are no different from those white male redditors ridicule during their womenhating circlejerks and feed back into a patriarchal system where womens behaviours and interests are seen as lesser. Take the comment thread for this submission Just White People Things and imagine how different it would be if the poster used the qualifier Just White Girl Things. Also theres a reason white girl wasted is used so often by whites while theres no concept of being white boy wasted where dicks are drawn on passed out people.I think its plausible that irememberwhenicared has only encountered this latter use of the term. She also has some seriously unchecked white privilege. But I can sympathise with her response even though alarm bells should have gone off when the first two people highlighted race not gender.This being said those article are cringeinducing.

2948170,0,t3_2tu53u,I think another issue with American media being something that pretty much everyone in the world is exposed to is that it makes the American black narrative into the only black narrative. Ive noticed that people all around the world apply stereotypes about AfricanAmericans to Africans. And many many Africans kind of...adapt to it? I dont know if Im making sense. I travel a lot and when I see groups of African boys hanging out in Asian countries in European countries in Arab countries they are usually listening to rap music have their pants sagging are speaking in ebonics or at least as close as they can get using the nword...and if you think about it its strange because those are American things. These kids have never been to North America. They behave the way the black people they see on TV behave and there arent any Africans that arent hungry dying suffering on TV. Its interesting. I think the reason this is necessary for them is because in their own African countries they dont need to be black. but the minute you leave Africa you arent Ugandan or Nigerian or Ethiopian. Youre just Black. And people will treat you differently badly because of this. Black people around here need to carve out their own safe spaces.  And when around other black people they act the way they believe black people should act I guess. I dont know. My thoughts are all over the place. ,blackladies,co37yvo,2,t5_2vk9t

3692624,0,t1_cqd5olu,gt Black men didnt invent the narrative that european features were the ideal form of femininity. Were suckered into that in a way thats also pretty warping.I wonder though if thats even the issue. The straightness of my nosehair or even the way I behave has little to do with the way a Black man chooses to treat me on a date or in a romantic context. If you prefer European features fine but why put Black women down at the same time? Liking WW doesnt go hand in hand with downing BW...thats the issue were talking about. gtYour dating life shouldnt suffer for that but on a larger level white men dont really respect black women either...I mean this culture wasnt designed by black men. Were all responsible for how we live but this topic always seems to have this binary where black men are pigs and white men arent. I really might have missed that binary here and its definitely not what Im saying...I didnt see anybody praising WM. The threads been about BM and their poor treatment of BW. Thats got nothing to do with White guys. Ill go one step further though and say that if White people can be responsible for perpetuating negative stereotypes about Black people then Black men can be responsible for perpetuating negative stereotypes about Black women. Im not responsible for making anyone look good but if I go out of my way to open my mouth Im definitely responsible for making someone look bad. I  see where youre going but I think this topic is about something particular to Blackness and honestly something that would happen albeit a bit differently if White people didnt even exist. Personally I think there is an active dislike among many def not all Black men of Black women and Black femininity...some decide to stay with us thats the aggression or leave thats the public bashing and dating WhiteWhiteaspossible women. ,blackladies,cqd6m0v,8,t5_2vk9t

Thats not how it works. If they want to be taken seriously as a contender for equality in America white liberals need to listen to and value the voices of minorities in the same way they value their own not push them down to a secondary agenda.

In the UK black people face pretty much everything you do minus the shootings That being said black people do dieget killed by police disproportionately and if they did carry guns you better believe we would be getting shot more than whitesasians Black people get harsher sentences for the same crimes as there white counter parts. Black people  are discriminated against for jobs just like in the US. Black people are  times as likely to be stopped and searched by the Police shakedownfrisked. We face everything you do minus the executions on a daily basis and yes American black music is popular over here. The last time officers shot and killed a black man Mark Duggan there were riots all over the UK so i doubt they will do it again.We are very much connected to you guys not just genetically but mentally. When SandraMikeTravon happened a huge sadness swept across the UK it really affects black communities over here and people are angry so there were marches in London. I think because the oppression we face is not really by the gun it does not make global headlines i think Africans in the diaspora really need to communicate better because we face similar hurdles to success.,blackladies,cu3k2m3,22,t5_2vk9t

Coming to University was a bit of a culture shock. While the population was still relatively diverse I wasnt used to feeling dwarfed and being surrounded by so many really really white people all the time. The trick is to find your community. Im sure there are a group of black kidsPOC on your campus who hang out together and have their own social eco system. And if that isnt really your thing just make sure to have a diverse group of friends. Being the only POC in a group of friends can be exhausting. ,blackladies,cud11fh,2,t5_2vk9t

5366601,0,t1_cvxmn8e,Thanks for explaining that to me.  I have to admit my sympathies still lie with Malcolm.  I have some experience with leaving a religion and the initial anger towards your former religion i.e. seeing the negative things about it feeling duped are pretty common.  Most people usually grow out of them or at least grow out of the intensity of feeling them.  I think Malcolm likely would have done the same sort of moderation of his rhetoric given time.  Unfortunately he wasnt given that time and the people who did it and encouraged it did so in the name of their religion that was as you said born of the need to uplift blacks.This and my own background with religion are why I have sympathy with Malcolms decision and struggle with how to think about Farrakhan.

She died at age  in  but the stories she told about her life and their lives are also treasures.  Just off the top of my headyou know how I said my ggma had  children who lived to adulthood?  Well there were  born.  Little Anna died at about a year old I think from diphtheria I have to double check with my dad.  Aunt Margurite told the story of how it was blazing hot on the day of Annas funeralso hot and dry there in Topeka KS. where they had their farm that their hog died and had to be butchered and salted down that same day so they could at least use the meat.  Aunt Marg was maybe five.  She and Laura my grandma were closest in age.  I think grandma was one year younger.  They were going to have the laying outvisitation at their home as people did then and Aunt Marg and Grandma Laura asked their mother if they could dress the baby and she let them.

5466509,0,t1_cwadmud,Cultural competency means you are acting in a way that is in accordance with the cultural norms for the people involved in a situation. Thats just my off the cuff definition Im on mobile right now. Ill try to remember to look up some good sources when I get home. But for example lets say you build a health clinic in rural Haiti that has the best western medicine can offer in terms of techniques and technology. For some reason though you dont see the rates falling for whatever disease is of interest. You then find out the locals partially practice various forms of voodoo and will not go to a clinic that does not abide by any of those customs. This is just a fabricated example that is likely culturally incorrect but I hope it gets the point across. Ill look for factually correct examples when I get home there are plenty. Basically though culturally incompetent systems and interventions work through a lens that only makes sense to group A while group B suffers from solutions that are not taking into account all the major variables at play. What really blows is that group A will often blame group B. Its like if you gave a Mexican immigrant child an IQ test in English then when they score low you assume its because they have a learning disability also happens. I strongly believe aiming for increased diversity in various institutions is merely a halfassed politically correct attempt at addressing systemic oppressionits just a buzz word at this point. Cultural competency means you actually are trying to learn about people different than you and make it so society doesnt disadvantage some purely by design due to cultural differences. ,blackladies,cwaeccr,5,t5_2vk9t

5521096,0,t3_3qptpv,gtcritics say it segregates women without addressing the problemOkay first of all theres no such thing as selfsegregation. Segregation is bad if someone forces you to stay somewhere with x group of people in order to keep power and equal status away from you and your group in favor of another. Any person of any gender deciding to deal only with their own for particular situations is their power and right. Finding a way over and around large obstacles is addressing the problem. This taxi service is a good start and a benefit to women even if it doesnt instantly and magically make all men respectful. People have to carve out ways under oppression with the power they have.,blackladies,cwhdbw0,5,t5_2vk9t

Notice how you see a lot of black people on Fox news speaking out against the black community without mentioning our history in this country and why we are at this situation in the first place and never mention any solution on helping us. Here is a white man Tim Wise who knows this and spreads the truth and helps what more can you ask for of an ally? If he can reach a larger platform and gain more viewers by being white all the more power to him. If nonblack people want to help us let them do so without our derailing them for doing just what we ask of them which is to combat and challenge and repair the racism in the United States.

For white ladies in the s working outside the home was revolutionary. For us its often more revolutionary to have the luxury of looking of staying home and looking out for our families rather than working for white folks. I hate that when we finally got a princess she was mostly a frog. And when she wasnt a frog she was a cook. Nothing against cooks obviously but traditionally in Disney movies cooks are something princesses are liberated from being like Cinderella. We get a princess and its what she aspires to. I wanted a pretty black girl in a poofy dress that had few responsibilities outside of twirling singing and driving the prince gaga with her hotness.

5909312,0,t3_3w760l,Never take anything written by somebody online too seriously. That being said the palpitations the spasms and tightening in your chest sounds similar to the effect of a person with Atrial Fibrillation. This is a flicker or irregular heartbeat that can lead to blood clots stroke heart failure and other heartrelated complications. It is best diagnosed by a telling irregular QRS rhythm those little squiggly lines on the heart rate monitor that show the hearbeat a person in AFib has one that looks different. You had mentioned that the ER staff ran an EKG of your chest. Depending on their findings and examination they may not be looking for AFib or even not see it happening as the spasms have to be actively happening to be seen on an EKG. From personal experience a few minutes or more on an EKG can be too short of a time to catch this kind of dysfunction. Typically people with this kind of issue as sent to a Cardiac expert where they will then be sent home with a remote EKG unit to wear for  hours for a full recording of your daily cardiac health. The good news is again I am likely wrong in this assumption the better news is even if it is AFib its easily caught with the right instruments and there are multiple treatment options. The take away is ... listen to your body. If you are experiencing these spasms and pain time and again talk to your regular doctor  its you dont have one a Med Stop or other Health Clinic will suffice and be cheaper than the hospital ask about AFib or for that matter look into your recent family history as well ask to be referred to a cardiologist and seek out the professional help. My other theory is just plain old stress and diet sodium sugar caffeine intake. Goodluck to you and again it cannot be stressed enough. Be very careful to not assume too much based on Internet research and advice. ,blackladies,cxu8s3s,6,t5_2vk9t

The tone the authorities particularly the lawyers and interrogators used while they were talking to the Averys reminded me so much of just about every counselor and assistant Ive ever had. Heres a note I made while I was watching. For the initialism averse I shortened Atypical Person to AP and Professional Typical Person to PTP.gtIs there some sort of training manual for people who deal with neuroatypical people for a living telling them exactly how to talk down to us and infantilize us? They all seem to talk the same way no matter who theyre talking to what the circumstances are and what diagnosis if any the person theyre talking to has. Always very slow very patronizing nominally phrased so it sounds like theyre taking the APs wants and needs into account while leading the AP to do exactly what the PTP wants them to do. Gaslighting us and getting us to deny our realities for their own ends and phrasing these abuse tactics so they sound like theyre good for us. Playing kind while they try to play us like a deck of cards.gtI dont trust professional neurotypicals. I dont think any neuroatypical person has any reason to trust them.

Im sure they werent on board with the open relationship in the first place but you insisted you knew what you were doing. But to have one with no protection or no testing AT ALL? Im not an expert but whenever someone brings up how evolved nonmonogamy is compared to monogamy isnt one of the strengths that you have lots of open communication?But that is the past. On to the future. You really have only one good option. Drop your end of the rope. Stop chasing him and his potential other sexual partners to try and protect them. They are adults. If they choose to have unprotected sex with a man whose health status they cant confirm they are doing it in full assumption of any risk.  What you are doing is not only futile but it is potentially harassment. Outing him on social media sites is unethical and may have very bad consequences for you in the future.

But for someone was already living in Southern Cali which is pricey they should have known that it is NOT the driving force that will pay you well in Northern Cali. Feel free to study Eng Lit but you should be taking minimal student loans to do so less than k and you should be networking to get your face in front of someone that would hire someone with that degree. You also have to accept that there are not a lot of high paying jobs in that field. So you either study it low loans and go be a teacher of some kind where you get to work on eng lit. Or position yourself to be a technical writer or something that will give you more money. Shit a degree like that isnt going to do that well in the Midwest.And yes she could have moved up in the company but no one with real world experience was there to tell her to MOST companies have you wait  yr before being able to move to another position. Why the hell would i want to keep hiring for the same position every  or  months? This aint a game. Learning curves are costly to production and occur in any position.

He makes almost  milllion a year and Im a few k shy of k per year. Do I think its fair? Hell to the no.

Yeah some white people do keep black people around to make them feel better but its not like black people dont do the same with their white friends. I guess what Im trying to say is that the dynamics of a relationship arent always clear unless youre close to it. This made me think of one of my cousins white friends who was clearly only friends with her because she thought a black friend would give her an edge and my cousins sisters gave my cousin a lot of shit for it. But you know what? My cousin was only friends with this girl because she was something to point to when my cousin wanted to complain about white people. The white friend was all about proving her worth by not only having a black friend but dancing better than her partying better than her and attracting black men better than her but my cousin was all about showcasing how white girls aint shit and how black men fall for it.

7492012,0,t1_d2tqmgy,I too am a single childless in case it wasnt obvious.I think breadfeeding is a poor example but an excellent analogy because breastfeeding is a very strongly womancentric activity. You cant think of breastfeeding and not think of women. My opinions on breastfeeding have traditionally been complicated and probably not in line with what women say they want but I also recognize that for me its mostly a nonissue so for the most part Im either listening to someones thoughts and considering or just letting it go because even if Im against it and Im not for the record I dont consider it my place to really go into that arena. As a wannabe scientist and the only boy in my branch of the family tree theres literally only one in every branch if I felt my opinions would help elevate the thoughts of someone affected by the discussion I would share them but for now Im not convinced they do.When people criticize breastfeeding they are playing into the same stereotype that women should be grateful for more work and be perfectly happy being tied down doing it but its more upfront. Its like the difference in racism What really struck me about this post was that it made the very interesting point that this does apply to EVERYthing. Its not just breastfeeding which was obviously about women. Its also bed times regular vs letting the kid tire herself out  and baby monitors vs checking in child monitoring tech vs keeping an eye on the child. None of those are what I think of as gendered. Dads would have to deal with those issues to.. except by numbers they arent thus making most though not literally all of the fathers who speak on these issues are speaking from a perspective of zero risk. If they win they feel good if they lose their work load doesnt change. So while the hypocrisy of saying women must be X way about breast feeding is obvious. The hypocrisy of saying parents must be X way about how many toys to buy their kids is insidiously not obvious or at least it wasnt to me. When its obviously about women its easy to explain why womens voices should matter on the subject. When its about parents in general parenting in general its more debatable why women should be given a special voice.,blackladies,d2tsup4,2,t5_2vk9t

Were all a bunch of wierdos one way or another.Youve never experienced something like that. I have. So I can tell you that it does get easier over time. A lot of folk arent too bright and after a while you just sort of learn to shrug it off. Thats not to say life gets easier its always going to be a struggle. But its sorta like how you gotta break muscle to make muscle and over time your shake the haters off muscles will grow strong.Truth be told it would be nice if life didnt have to be like that.

I have quite a few straight guy friends but they fall into  of  categories...guys I grew up with I mean prepuberty...if they met you afterward youre probably sexual potential for them and guys who arent really attracted to Black women. Friendship means accepting the possibility of  never having a sexual or romantic relationship. I have ZERO new Black male friends and I expect it to stay that way. I dont care how nice Christian professional married or stoic them seem. My expectations are gone. And thats because most straight men process a good portion of their emotional issues and needs through sexualromantic interaction with women that and sports...hence all the crying so friendship is like a pink dolphin...sure it exists but why am I gonna expend the energy to find it?If its something you want. nonBlack dudes who arent familiar with Black women are your safest bet...I mean not even like Europeans or nonBlack Latinos who very possibly see Black women as inferior sexual objects to be used. ,blackladies,d4gogkl,6,t5_2vk9t

8062038,0,t1_d4ls7x9,Overall I dont think you will have a problem. I broke down some of the things I have observed out here for you to use at your own discretion.Negs The white racism in Omaha is subtle. Its more in public polices red liningand behind closed doors. Though you may find that one corn fed blob who will want to try youI havent yet. Also there are no mountains in Nebraska. We have some hills but everything else is super flat. It can get dreary driving through the state because of it.  be prepared for College Football. Seriously! I am a huge fan of my alma mater because thats where I was born and raised and graduated Go Buckeyes!but these chuckle fucks out here take it to EXTREMES.  There  is some very interesting poc racist in Nebraska  Mexicans and Asians. When I first moved here I found it odd because POC in my city were cool af to each other and intermingled. In Nebraska they may be the most overt ones. There is a large group of black men who hate black women out here. They blame them for everything thats has happened wrong in their pathetic lazy lives. Steer Clear. You can identify them by their fat Cookie Monster looking non poc girl. stay away from the sun down towns in your travels through the state. They may one poc family living there but they dont know YOU!! And they will treat you as such. They may not threaten you with violence but. ... These are the towns with less than  in it. If you cant avoid it travel with someone you trust.  Be wary of people who friend you fast bc you are exotic. They are looking for a token. Easy to spot. in the burbs surrounding Omaha they took that Stepford wife Jon and Kate plus   shit and OWNED it. THE WORST DRIVING I HAVE EvER SeEN IN My WHOLE LIFE. Now for the positives The racists are in the minority in OmahaLincoln and Grand island I dont think that you will have any problems in that respect. As long your nose is clean you will be fine. There are communities of black folk that are supportive and caring and all the platitudes that they give people living in the plains.  cost of living is cheap af  Fine educated dudes.  If you want dudes Fine educated chicks as well lucky for you Omaha is the most diverse city in Nebraska. There black and African stores hairdressers businesses and more.  if you are LGBTQ Lincoln is a short drive away. LIncoln is a hub for LGBTQ persons in Nebraska.  Tons of bars gatherings and LGBTQ events. the Downtown area in Omaha is comparable now to Columbus in attractiveness and walk ability. There is a ton of stuff to do and the Zoo is legit. there are a lot more open minded global citizens in Omaha and Lincoln. If you want more in detail let me know ,blackladies,d4m8yhv,2,t5_2vk9t

The version history has chosen to run with completely ignores the existence of POC at all. Theres something powerful in seeing someone who looks like you as a founding father versus being forced feed the idea that only white men are capable of doing anything important.

8503253,0,t3_4w5vka,I think there are layers to this. Heres my college educated feminist lesbian perspective. Mind you despite being black Im pretty far removed from any real black community at this point so Im on the outside looking in. If Ive misspoken please correct me.When I meet a dude black or white my guard is up because I havent determined if this guy feels entitled to my attention and affection. I havent determined if this guy will disregard my sexuality. I havent determined if he is a feminist. I havent determined if he is racist. Effectively for any strange man I meet I can not assume that in his eyes I am a person. Now when I determine that a new person Ive met does indeed read me as a person equal to them selves then their race sexuality ethnicity whatever becomes a condiment to their personhood. If I determine that this man doesnt see me as a person then I look to their identity to determine where theyve fallen short. Is it the black mans fragile masculinity that stems from their powerlessness in society that causes him to disregard my sexuality or my bodily autonomy?  Is it the white mans privilege that makes him feel entitled to my attention? ect ect. Knowing where the discrimination comes from helps me to repel it and work around it. Its simpler for me because Im never looking for any mans approval or affection. If they see me an object an animal or a second class citizen I can simply walk away unfazed because I have no need for them at all. If I was trying to earn the love or respect from a man but kept running into men who dont see me as a person then this would be a much more frustrated narrative. Id demand an explication for why I was not worthy of these people who I considered my equal and who I wanted to love. Id search desperately for explanations make broad accusations and generalizations and attempt to fight back in what ever way I could. Walking away is much harder when you want to feel validated by these men who reject your personhood and sovereignty. So some women try to stop looking for validation by adopting the group who I believe to be misogynists men aint shit approach. A more refined approach would be to say I am valid valuable worthy and beautiful regardless of what any man may say or do to me. I refuse to be used or lied to and I respect myself too much to compromise myself for anyone period.   However in a society where a womans value especially a black womans value is derived from her male companionship adopting such a belief is very difficult. Black men and black women operate under the same premises that black women are worthless and disposable. This leaves black women especially vulnerable to betrayal by a man who believes this because it feels like societys message of worthlessness has been confirmed.    Now a man who believes any type of woman is worthless and disposable certainly aint shit at all. A misogynist isnt worth any womans time love or sympathy. The fallacy comes when one makes the generalization that all black men are misogynists. In america men and women in general are trained from birth to be misogynists and most end up being at least sexist if not misogynists. However not all men and women will be. Some black men will be feminists as will some black women. Over all it would be more productive to check each of our peers for sexismdiscriminationbias and call them out on it. Distrusting only black men due to the misogyny in the black male community is flawed because weve all adopted the same rhetoric its not limited solely to black men. Still though getting a rather complicated feminist view of black gender dynamics out to the populous is kinda hard. So the defensive black men aint shit I cant trust them to treat me like a person remains in the hearts of some though not all black women. Much like I cant blame a black mans fragile masculinity on his poor character because he is a victim of society I cant really blame these black women for writing off black men. Everyone is a looser of a much bigger game here.  Weve been pitted against each other because its simpler and more accessible to fight among ourselves then organize and reverse the toxic rhetoric society jams down our throats. The great white hands of patriarchy reach into our homes and tells the men you are worthless because you are not like me and then tells the women you are worthless because you are not like me. The simplest thing to then do is look at the black person you are facing and say Youve made me not like him youve made me worthless when really the big white hands made us worthless because we believed them. If we keep the people trapped in the ghettos fighting among themselves they will never notice that they out number the guards.,blackladies,d64gl1b,40,t5_2vk9t

She wore mostly jumpsuits and sometimes there was a flashback to her interningdoctoring days at Arkham Asylum.

This film is styling Joker and Harley as grungy doc martens pyramid belt dipdyed hair tattoos silver teet as opposed to carnival freaks.

8724705,0,t3_4ziih3,Femininity is as much of a consumer culture as being punk goth and emo. Its weird that its so heavily associated with being female when Half of feminine personality traits are just human characteristics.  And when the overwhelming majority of external feminine markers are just things that you buy. Put a beautiful shapely woman in mens clothes and give her short hair and shell still be considered masculine or butch. Theres no such thing as an unfeminine woman and barely such a thing as an actually ugly woman there are just women who dont or cant follow the hobbies have the personality traits or buy the fashions or cosmetics necessary to push them into the realm of acceptably feminine. Its so bizarre how femininity is equated with being biologically female female when you consider how much the average woman has to work to fit into that mold and how effortless it is for some men to embrace it. Why is it associated with anyones body parts outside of outdated tradition? Personally I dont feel like a woman I just feel like me. I have no idea what other women feel like so I think its weird when people say they feel like a woman or a man because how audacious is it to assume that any other woman or man feels anything like you do? Ive been kind of irritated by a lot of feminists articles of late that complain about people not accepting femininity. Theres nothing wrong with being stereotypically feminine but it feels like people decontextualize popular representations of femininity to the point where they forget that its literally the product of hundreds of years of racist patriarchal society and people trying to sell shit to women.,blackladies,d6w8abf,7,t5_2vk9t

Also it helps to remember that youre probably the only one who cares. No one care about your hair or your outfits while youre in a lecture. I went to most of my classes in sweat pants and gave no fucks.  So you can either PAY to go to class a mess and learn something or you can PAY to stay at your dorm be a mess and learn nothing. I spent my st  years of uni struggling with depression and not going to class nearly as much as I should. Then one of my professors sat me down and told me the same thing I told you. You are paying to be here. You are paying to learn.  Dont let your hair hold you back from getting what you paid for. Worst case scenario go to class so you can afford some bomb ass full lace wigs if you decide you still hate your hair after you graduate. lt Lastly if you are not still going to therapy sessions consider going back .

9022129,0,t3_53txdh,Honestly I say she needs to make her voice heard. She can contact her state and federal reps. When a white lady gets in front of politicians and pleads for them to protect her children it matters a hell of a lot more than when a black woman does. She has power in her whiteness and power in her love for her black family. She can get involved in the BLM movement in her area. She can speak to her white friends and family on fb and get them to empathize with her. She can use her skin color to get white people to rally around this issue and apply pressure to the people in power who pass laws to reign in the police. She can also interact with the PD safely. She can speak to the chief of police and express her concernes in an open letter. She can pull the media to her and make herself a megaphone that projects our message into the hears of black and white people a like. All of this would require her being formally educated about the issues of racial profiling by police and the racist motivations of the officers who murder black people. She will need to learn about deescalation and body cameras and other potential solutions and petition powerful people to implement them. When black people unite and stand up for our own we are being combative and rebellious. When a white mother stands up for the safety of her children her community picks up pitchforks to defend her. She has a lot of power if she chooses to use it.,blackladies,d7wbhdr,52,t5_2vk9t

Personally I think they are victims of themselves and one another. This was a toxic relationship from the very beginning and unfortunately with children and her moneyattention grubbing around its not going to end well.By the way I find it interesting that it seems the internet went wild after he said he would have voted for Trump and went after Beyonc and went after Jay Z.

Im not being selfcongratulatory thats pretty fucking significant. gtgt whereas other POCs arrived here later and thus dont have that cultural nexus point that centers their experiencegtLatino persons have been living in Southern USA since before slaves came to the U.S. Mexico didnt randomly become inhabited by Mexicans when white people arrived. And there are more Latino ethnic groups than Mexican and still see my point above. gtgt Black people are Black pointblack and that unites us and gives us the confidence and the scholarship to speak up more often.gtNo. There are plenty of people that retain strong heritages and ties to Africa and the Caribbean. Black people have a diverse culture and nationalities too. Good lord you are practicing some heavy erasure with your comment. That wasnt the point. Black coalitions in the US include black people from the Caribbean the African continent and AfroLatinos and we can mobilize without major conflicts between different nations being an impetus to that. Partly because they are mostly made up of African Americans. We had to reconstruct our culture from being descendants of the TransAtlantic Slave Trade and that also means we do not have nationalist divisions amongst ourselves that keep us from working with each other.On the other hand other American people of color still have conflicts going on between their ancestral countries. There are still ethnic divisions based on conflict or even just culture and the West uses that to pit them against each other as much as the west throws a little bit of money at our celebrities to sell us up the river. We are not in a position to where our political power is hindered by ethnic and cultural division which is more than a lot of POC can say.gtgt POC often do speak up but their histories of activism are often erased especially with Asians and their platforms are stripped from under them. The racial middle doesnt get the same visibility as the racial extreme.gtLet me counter that with a quote The  election marked a comingout party for conservative ChineseAmericans who offered Donald Trump some of his most passionate support among nonwhites. Let me also counter by stating that Asians have the lowest voter turnout of any racial demographic generally fall heavy in their interest in attaining white status and recently tend to be of higher economic standing. I doubt that they have any strong record of recent activism. If you want to point to some recent scholarship or examples please do.  Case in point right here. There are many many more Asian ethnic groups than Chinese and even within that group there are different political stances depending on class for starters. And we dont like it when others use black conservativesRepublicans to make broad statements about us do we?And for examples on reddit see raznidentity a mod from there is also trying to get rnonwhite off of the ground. Its a more mixed space than this one so you will encounter both conservative and liberal voices. Also check out nonwhite.com and kulturemedia.org. I honestly do feel that if we let ourselves be pushed and pulled by the media with minorities dividing ourselves into this and that this will be a dark  years.

10816740,0,t1_ddvlef6,I think a lot of the hatred comes from patriarchy. Even looking at the comments a lot of complaints are about them being too emotional and irrational which like you said sounds a lot like complaints about women in general. I dont see how emotional is necessarily a bad thing either. Black women are already expected to be resilient and put others emotions first so that criticism is a little alarming to me because it reads as black women arent emotional like white women. Most of the other complaints that I have or have heard other black women have are about beauty standards and dating. For one the whole concept of beauty comes from patriarchy. But I also think its funny how black men mostly complain about white men and black women mostly complain about white women. And the ones that be complaining the most are the ones that are dating a white person but dont see how white supremacy is relevant to both genders.Dont get me wrong Ive had some nasty experiences with white women. But the whole coolunderstanding white guy thing is a farce. You cant look at the White House right now and tell me that white women are the problem not white men. White women dont have the power like that. White women didnt even want Hillary in charge. ,blackladies,ddvo5c9,15,t5_2vk9t

And the current popular opinion isnt always the right opinion as history teaches us. Now if you have a job where your opinion can affect other peoples lives  like a cop or a judge yeah no. But its fuzzier when its a TV personality. On the one hand who cares what a talking head thinks? On the other hand... a lot of people. And they use her opinions to form theirs and THEY might be cops or doctors or teachers. So... eh. Im eh on the fact that she got suspended for ANY opinion.

Wypepul take that shit and use it as an excuse to be obnoxious to black people to dismiss our issues. See That post that made it to the front page about the black girl billionaire.  It was full of white smug about her being legally made white because she was so rich. It was full of SEE WEALTH IS THE ONLY PRIVILEGE bullshit.It sucks that we always have to constantly filter ourselves with that in mind.  I dont think Luuvie should be demonized for what she had to say because honestly.  Shes right about a lot of it.  I hate that online culture only allows for extremes to be the POVs amplified. The nature of the beast means that the most extreme voices are the ones who get the attention necessary to make real change.
