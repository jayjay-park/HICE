5670104,0,t3_3s8gzo,When me and my partner went to NYU to test out the Vive apart from enjoying the experience we really began to think about the opportunities the Vive has to offer in terms of game development. We have some projects in the works most of them narrative exploration games in the vain of The Vanishing Of Ethan Carter with influences also in games from studios like Tell Tale  The Walking Dead Season amp  and David Cage  Beyond Two Souls . We here at POVGAM are really interested in putting Vive support into our titles and would absolutely love the opportunity to do so. Wed be willing to sign any NDAs pay any price and fulfill any requests necessary because honestly we want to get started with this device as soon as possible. ,HTCVive,cwzxkij,4,t5_378gy

8196935,0,t3_4rli3h,Theres no reason you couldnt use the mounts that come with the lighthouse. The lighthouses have gyroscopes and know when they are mounted upside down and you will have no problems as long as they are mounted securely. Other than that they just use a standard camera mount thread so pretty much any mount will work just double check the thread size is compatible. Edit Also there are two mounting points on the lighthouse itself one on the bottom and one on the back. I leave a standard tripod quick release attached to the bottom of mine and mount them to the wall on the back. Then when I want to switch rooms its as easy as unscrewing my lighthouses dropping them in my tripods and rerunning the room setup only takes a few minutes. ,HTCVive,d52648i,1,t5_378gy

8676825,0,t1_d6q7r36,Yes VR is definitely lacking in what it will become but as of right now its amazing. There isnt really much of a mess of cables and newer Vives are even being shipped with a in cable instead of the triple cable that runs from the headset to the link box.Aaaand you dont really need that powerful of a computer.Point is if you have the money to spend and want to experience the beginnings of something great the small annoyances are barely noticable once you get everything running well. Its worth the price if you enjoy what it has to offer and if you dont dont buy it. Easy.,HTCVive,d6q8600,1,t5_378gy
9268494,0,t3_57b1y2,Thats reprojection. Try turning down some of the settings to see if thats alleviated.I know its heresy to turn down settings with a Titan X and a beast of a machine but it might be necessary since its going through revive and maybe the game isnt well enough optimized.,HTCVive,d8quivv,2,t5_378gy
9819030,0,t3_5fczhm, yo.  Just got one.  Im CTO at a manufacturer  ecommerce corp.  I wish I had more time for gaming these days but life yo.  right?. I had an oculus rift dk that I bought used from ebay.  I bought vorpxI swore Id never be able to play games with a shitty d monitor again.  Resolution may need improvement but come on people do you remember gut demolishing dizzy spell inducing sessions in virtual boy?  it was red lines on a black background!   Its  and we have p headsets with stereoscopic vision.   We improve this tech much further and reality will not be distinquishable from vr anymore. or wait.. the other way around.. i think..  That was a year ago and shortly after that video was taken some neighborhood hooligans broke into my apartment and took exclusively the oculus rift head set.  Not the  gaming rig hooked to it.  Not the  LED TV.  Just the head set.  Like seriously kid? You were so fucking strung out on dope you couldnt have followed a wire to a night of binging or wtf ever it is you do? ugh.. moving on.Just bought the vive.  Went through setup  hours ago.Compared to dk. Are you fucking serious?!?!   Where has this tech been!?  I should have ordered months ago!The fact that I can have all the lights and monitors off in my home office and still find the wireless controller on the table WITH the headset on is a HUGE improvement over the dk or any other vr tech I have tried outThe integration with steamwindows is pretty fcking smooth.  I was up and running in  minutes and spent an hour in the setup room popping baloon animals with a laser!I just want to go download the vr apps I demod on my oculus and try them all over again in the vive.  I mean seriously?! is there even a comparison now?Ralph you my dog by the way.  VorpX is even more worth it to me now.  Nearly a year went by.  I kept my web installer on google drive supposing i may get a new vr headset again.  Lucky for me I did because I double clicked that bitch and vorpx was up and running again in no time.  ESO launched in cinema mode but ill fk with that stuff after work... in like  hours... crap.. I may just burn ALL my remote work hours for the entire year on this week alone.  I work with automation for large scale business operations.  I can make it LOOK like Im at my desk for at least  days this week. lol,HTCVive,danfsa0,1,t5_378gy
