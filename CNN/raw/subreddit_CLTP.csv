1470269,0,t3_2azzjs,Recap for seasons  amp Season  after redoing the draft twice for bdls arrival and Waynes arrival we had a round robin on wormy between the teams of Tofus team Capernicuss team and currys team. after intense arguing caps team of Wayne Cripple and Ido defeated Tofus team . After that team tofu defeated Team curry. Going into the last match the possibility of a three way tie loomed over both teams. The final game included team Cap and team Curry who fielded Curry bdl Mr.Baggins and Asa Akira. After no caps in the first five minutes Wayne and cap continued dominating powerups and eventually Wayne ended up scoring with a dual tagpro offense. After another Wayne cap Team Capernicus was victorious and Wayne led the league in caps with .season  After many new people joined CLTP was ready for another team and bad became a captain while tofu and curry resigned captaincy and Wayne and bdl stepped up. This seasons map was Colors decided by Capernicus. After many arguments about draft order season  was tournament style. started with Capernicus facing Wayne and Bad facing bdl. Capernicuss team fell to the hands of Mr. Baggins Boogy and Ojdude as Team Bad defeated Bdl. In the championship game it was tied  minutes in when OJdude picked up a tagpro and was quoted saying I have to leave Ill be back soon someone just gave me somethi. During the confusion Team Wayne surrendered a cap leaving them down  at the  minute mark before the game was stopped. After another Wayne capture with  seconds remaining ad three in base it looked like a two way tie or at least OT but as the flag was returned Wayne slipped through all three players for team bad and secured the go ahead cap for team Wayne. After that I left so idk what happened.,CLTP,cj0knyf,1,t5_30ode
