It is way too fat and slow.  There have been many demos that use COLLADA directly and they give WebGL a bad reputation for having terrible load times.Use COLLADA in your editing process then convert to glTF when you deliver to your audience!,webgl,cl7papx,2,t5_2rq1k

6645549,0,t1_d06orta,Wacky.  I didnt think your question made sense.  WebGL is a feature of a browser not an OS or a device.  Either an app uses a builtin browser or it embeds it a browser inside its own code.  But apparently there are some complaints on the French forum about getting Your device is not compatible with WebGL.  So yeah.  I guess that happens.Does WebGL work on your device inside the browser?  You can test it here Either way I dont know of any way to hack in support to a device especially if WebGL does work in your standard browser.  If it does not then maybe if you update your tablets browser or add FireFox or Chrome for Android to get a browser with WebGL support that might enable the app to use the new browser...,webgl,d06phfy,2,t5_2rq1k
