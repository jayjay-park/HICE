704864,0,t1_cgfqvmx,Hey there! Im Matt the Producer of ZMR for En Masse Entertainment.As the publisher of ZMR EME is afforded the freedom to choose what is sold in the game the items that are available and how they are acquired. For this reason ZMR will be a bit different than versions published in other territories. For example I have evaluated the gameplay effects of all the weapon modifications and tech passive perks in the game and can confirm that those that provide a distinct advantage will not be offered for purchase from the store. These items will still be in the game but they will be accessible to all players through other systems for free. I play shooters. I know how it feels to go up against a player with a purchased advantage its not fun. I consider my job here to be about making ZMR fun and accessible to all players. We will be monitoring and participating in our communities closely following launch of the game and will always do our best to address any issues they may have.  Youre right a number of items can be earned for free in a variety of ways  completing missions completing coop scenarios and shooting targets in the shooting gallery with bullets earned through gameplay. We will share more details on these systems as we approach launch. ,ZMR,cgke9ne,4,t5_2zzpk

If Shmurda was actually hacking youd goddamn know Id be up there posting videos myself. Of course he wasnt hacking as far as anyone could tell and I stick by that he wasnt hacking. If he was the devs wouldve banned him. Dont act like EME is racist to Brazilians for whatever god forsaken reason either the reason you dont see that many American hackers get their name strung up in lights is because its easy to detect a NA hacker because there is less lag less excuses.

2530961,0,t3_2on350,Defiantly worth it to get all of them dont really know about the headset though.Most gaming keyboards allow more then  key presses at one time. The one I use is the corsair k with green cherry mx switches. On a traditional keyboard lets say you were using down space bar a  directional keys if you wanted to reload which would be a th key press the reload would be ignored. With gaming keyboards the low end at least support  key presses and the one I have along with others have no limit. I can literaly press all  keys and they will all register.With gaming mice you have a more accurate sensor as well as control over you DPI density of pixels per inch so you can lower the mouse setting in windows and increase it via the mouse. Lower speed in windows is more accurate when you increase speed via windows mouse setting it will actually skip some of the information the mouse is sending to make it move faster. Same with games. if you open up paint on windows and use the pencil to draw a circle and go from lowest speed to highest your circle will be smoother at lower speed meaning more accurate mouse readings and very jagged at high speed lower accuracy. This applies in games as well. So with gaming mice you can lower both windows and games mouse sensitivity setting then use the mouses DPI sheeting to increase the speed and still have pin point accuracy. Not to mention most gaming mice have hot keys to cycle through preset DPI setting. I have  on mine and number  is  DPI to swing the cross hairs very fast for cqc combat and number  is low at around  DPI to do long range sniping with.Head sets Im unsure on as I barely use them.

In a very real sense that is how this game works with the galleries and revealing. If you cant manage the condition on your own you might consider seeking out a group like Gamblers Anonymous in your local area to meet with. If you honestly are having trouble controlling the impulse to spend money that you dont believe is well spent a group like that should be able to help. For a period of time I spent more than I was comfortable with on this game as well but Ive since been able to pull in the reigns and am much happier about my experience in the game since its not a financial issue.,ZMR,cs3lwlp,1,t5_2zzpk

8891359,0,t3_51kuxh,Good thing this game has the best Cheat detector available to anyone who downloads it cough Virus or trojan or something like that cough. Be warned when downloading it look it up considering when it came out for steam there was a tf promo going on for the black butterfly knife for the spy and pretty much a lot of people downloaded the game or not so many did due to this reason. No clue if its gone or if its still there though and yes I am still very much alive. ,ZMR,d7gm5s1,1,t5_2zzpk
