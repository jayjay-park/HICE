6310390,0,t3_41wjl6,Optimal mass is when your ship starts performing optimally. Youll still get better results by equipping better thrusters until youre at about  of your optimal mass but youll see less improvement than going from above optimal to optimal. Its worth noting that its not just turn speed your top speed is always affected by your class of thrusters and weight.For example you can be well under optimal mass in a Vulture with D or C rated thrusters generally Vultures are T and get T optimal mass with D thrusters so Arated thrusters wont give you much of a turning benefit. However you will always have a top speed about ms faster with Arated thrusters.If you have the power to run it and the money to buy it theres no reason not to. All youll be doing is going faster.,EliteSchool,cz6x5nh,2,t5_37xep
