7494694,0,t1_d2tztzo,Hmm so do you mean like taking that snare sample I recorded and playing that alongside the actual live playing whenever the snare is hit? It sounds a little troublesome to get the timing just right without triggers but Ill give it a go next chance I get thanks!I cant actually fully separate the parts of the kit since the reason Im mixing them together is I only have one microphone though otherwise this would be easy,metalproduction,d2u3uz6,1,t5_2ze6j
