Each class has a role with the arguable exception of opscoundrel dps and you need to know what to do. Healers need to heal the carrier. Tanks need to guard the carrier and flip their guard all the time. DPS need to keep the damage dealers off the ball carrier and need to kill their ball carriers. Everyone has a job and if they dont do it a single noob can screw you. One idiot who gets the ball but forgot to map the pass the huttball button can ruin a team.

91695,0,t1_ceouqzy,gt The short answer is that there is no good solution to this due to Biowares antiaddons stance. Its something thats been pretty high on my list of SWTOR cons for some time. Addon support is basically just free development for them and I really dont understand MMO companies who refuse to use the incredibly valuable resource that is community development.IMO the issue is when does an addon become compulsory? At least when theres no addons for good or for bad everyone has the exact same information available to them. As soon as you have addons you have things like Deadly Boss Mods that tell you what to do in a Flashpoint or Auctioneer that does work that a human either should do themselves or physically cant do automatically track competing auctions scan the auction house for items within seconds that are selling far far below their normal price. And lets not forget how Gearscore affected Wrath.Youre using programs to change how you play the game. Given BWs stance on Macros I think its understandable for them to want to ensure everyone has an equal experience without outside intervention. Its a great resource yes and Ill even admit this is something where there should be a BW fix but even aside from the worries about botting moreso on the Macro side there are a lot of things Addons do that are to remove the inconvenient side of the game which means anyone without it are relatively more inconvenienced.,swtor,ceova5c,6,t5_2qxih

But what I would like to see them put a system in place that has more impact from choices and story branching. Even if it is branching to get to the same place with subtle differences. I understand that the nature of MMOs isnt very conducive to such gameplay as they will be irreversible so I hope BS finds a way to either let us A go back and replay select missions to overwrite previous choices or Bsave multiple versions of a single characterId like to think the time and resource saved on ending individual character arcs would give them more flexibility to do something like this.

133113,0,t1_cetbsm4,Yes they are downvoting me without backing up their statements arent they?  I didnt downvote your post by the way.  Anyway by what metric are you judging best?  Most useful?  Most damaging? Best damageperenergy? Best damagepersecond? Best damagepercasttime?Death from Above deals about the same amount of damage actually it deals more  but its kinetic instead of elemental but is instantcast costs less energy and is done dealing its damage before OS has even started dealing damage.Both have the same ancillary benefit of knocking down weak and standard mobs and neither gain any procs or buffs to other abilities.Death from Above is limited to  targets and only has a fivemeter AoE compared to eight meters for Orbital Strike and Force Storm.  It also has a fivemeter minimum range that can make it a challenge to use in certain situations especially for Powertechs.So compared to OS when striking five or fewer targets its total damage and DPCT is comparable but DPE is slightly higher and DPS is much higher.  Orbital Strike however scales beyond five targets.  When ten or even twenty targets are present rats in SampV or lobels in TfB for example Orbital Strike quickly becomes much more powerful.  Ease of Use is debatable.  OS is fireandforget and has a larger AoE but because of the long time it takes to deal its total damage it often fails to deal its total damage because the target has died or moved.If you add the PvP set bonus OS gains pulls  ahead in DPE and  ahead in total damage and DPCT.  Orbital Strike gains as much as  total damage from Engineering skills.  Marksmanship gains a bonus to cooldown and cast time this pulls OS ahead in DPCT but not DPS or DPE.  For both Marksmanship and Engineering I should add because its part of the singletarget rotation as well using OS offrotation can seriously disrupt the rotation.  That is having it a part of the rotation doesnt make it easier to use it makes it much harder to use.I call that a wash unless more than five targets are present.  The only true disparity here is the fivetarget limit and the fact that Bounty Hunters receive no skills in any tree unless I missed something to improve Death from Above while two Sniper trees improve Orbital Strike.   Force Storm deals about  of the damage of Orbital Strike but is instantcast and has no cooldown.  It is however a sixsecond channel.  It costs considerably less energy in terms of total resources  depending on spec and bonuses vs.  for OS but costs somewhat more with regard to the time it takes to recover those resources.  It doesnt instantly knock down weak and standard mobs but it has a high chance to stun them during the duration.  It also procs for Lightningspec although quantifying that benefit is difficult.It is limited to five targets like Death from Above but unlike Orbital Strike.  It has the same eightmeter AoE as OS.So compared to OS when striking five or fewer targets it matches OS in DPS but loses in total damage DPE and especially DPCT.  However it has a huge advantage in easeofuse with no cooldown no cast time and the procs it provides for Lightningspec Sorcerers those procs not coincidentally provide a bonus to another AoE ability Chain Lightning dramatically improving its DPCT and DPE  the areas in which Force Storm really suffers compared to Orbital Strike.Force Storm is therefore much more difficult to compare to OS.  It clearly deals less damage but is far easier to use.  For Lightningspec Sorcerers the instant and free Chain Lightning proc may make up for the damage and energy disparity but I dont have those numbers in front of me.Ill call that a win for OS in power but a win for Force Storm in usability.  When more than five targets are present Orbital Strike once again quickly gains relative to Force Storm.Im out of time so I cant go through every AoE ability in the game and compare them.  I think Advanced Prototypes Flamethrower and Rages Smash are also appropriate comparisons  both of which favor those abilities over Orbital Strike by the way.  Theres also healerspec Overload which is free instant shortcooldown has no fivetarget limit and provides healing in addition to its damage.  It also deals far less damage per target.  So which is better? Thats my whole point the only way in which Orbital Strike is consistently better than the other AoEs in the game is in total potential damage and only because it does not have a fivetarget limit.  But instead of addressing the only important disparity both players and the developers have chosen apparently to just go with their gut and nerf it  not only in the wrong way but they also managed to target the wrong specs at the same time.  The only Snipers unaffected by the change are the ones playing the only Sniper spec that might be overpowered Hybrids.  But as you said people would rather just downvote away rather than back up anything with facts.,swtor,cetlam5,1,t5_2qxih

161211,0,t3_1vxiyl,Another note  unless you are being hit by the boss or Kephess you are not taking any other AoE damage. If you start getting hit you know there is an orb on you. That is sometimes useful to know esp. if all your fellows are bunched up all on top of each other for AoE heals on the back of the boss.The other one of course is the bright light beam connecting you and the ball hehe.It is maybe a good idea to leave the boss on  kill the next clone and quick go burn the boss to  to enter transition.Having  balls on you is bad luck but by far not unmanagable. Yesterday I had  balls in a roll on my sentinel and the rd one spawned right after boss went into the transition. If you would allow me to paste the link from my stream  min into the video. In our case we benefit from the fact that the fight is not a tight DPS check as Kaikka explained  I was walking around with the balls without touching the boss.,swtor,cewsmn6,2,t5_2qxih

200432,0,t1_cf12dju,gt Gold add first as he will cast a fairly powerful raid ccing attack healer bots after silvers after that. Flyby is currently the best for that. We have the other tank interruptstun the gold while dps kill the healer droids first then silver and finish off the gold. Regardless of everything the gold doesnt do anything if he is being thoroughly stopped from casting. The issue is however that we are taking too much damage raidwide and unable to heal through it beyond middle of wave .

316153,0,t3_1xowqe,Makeb is OK for what youre doing but the content is spread out.  Since you have ScavSlic its going to be more costeffective if you gather wild nodes to grind up those skills and this will also give you the resources you need to grind Armormech.  Droidnodes generally have a higher skilllevel requirement to gather than the local wild nodes and they will give more crewskill XP.  Most planets have a droidheavy location of some sort though some of them are a bit off the beatenpath.  When the droid nodes turn gray move on to the next planet.  As uRuudVanBommel mentioned crafting MK Augment Kits is a pretty reliable source of income for crafting and the method described gives you the best ... um ... clang for your cred.  Other things you can try since you can also make Augments themselves is to check and see what augments are in low supply on your server.  Armormech has access to crafting Aim Cunning Absorb and Shield augments.  At endgame if you make level  blue augments youll find buyers. However the prices of kits will probably be a bit more stable in general because every class can use the kits while the augments themselves are only going to be useful for the specific classes that need those stats.  For lower levels the augment market can be pretty unstable.  There might be giant gaps for some augments and a huge overstock of others.  The price ranges are going to be smallpotatoes compared to the endgame stuff however  ,swtor,cfdje7s,2,t5_2qxih

The obvious differences between them is one is melee range the other ranged and one tanks while the other heals.  Im usually a tanking man so I have a soft spot for Powertech Shield Techs but I wont deny that Bodyguard Mercs are stupid amounts of fun as well.  Gotta love Kolto Missile.If youre looking specifically at the DPS side of it both Adv. Prototype and Arsenal have been fun for me!  Arsenals rotation seemed simpler and was focused on getting Unload to proc as often as possible through the Barrage talent in conjunction with Tracer Missile plus the missile spam is really fun from a flavor point of view while Adv. Prototype was instead focused on using Prototype Flamethrower as frequently as possible.Mercs are definitely going to have an easier time sticking to their target thanks to their ranged attacks but theyre also susceptible to being interrupted something a Powertech rarely has to worry about.As the saying goes your mileage may vary!,swtor,cfhauxx,4,t5_2qxih

363543,0,t3_1y8ecp,Im not very far along in the smuggler story and I havent quite finished the trooper story yet but so far trooper is most emotionally similar to imperial agent for me. It might just be me and not the story though. The other stories particularly the jedi and sith ones seem a lot more deeply fictional. Throwing around force powers dealing with those zany evil sithy types digging about for mythical ancient artifacts etc. etc. Imperial agent and trooper have very different roles from the force users  youre not someone born with force sensitivity and trained specifically to be super powerful and whatnot youre a grunt whos worked their way through the ranks and you have duties to perform and people to answer to. So the choices feel more real and more purposeful.Smuggler and bounty hunter dont really give me that same feeling I guess because theyre more like free agents following a path set by circumstance. The imperial agent and the trooper have their lives and livelihoods on the line right from the start.,swtor,cfig3jv,1,t5_2qxih

Neutrality has traditionally gotten them more. But as some of the storylines have shown us there are specific Hutts who have made deals with both Empire and Republic.

638298,0,t3_21fpfm,Yes there are often sister guilds. While there are many vibrant and thriving sister guilds there are others who struggle to maintain guilds on both sides. The problem here is the lack of cross faction chat channels. Invariably one side of the guild will have a heavier population than another and as people migrate to the heavier population faction in the guild then one faction empties out. You can get around this a bit by using a voip program or other similar third party solution. Still being able to make a cross faction chat channel would be the best solution for this situation.,swtor,cgctppw,1,t5_2qxih

693319,0,t3_220tna,I also went through this exact same thing parsing k myself so I know exactly what youre going through. A couple of tips that I can give you. Watch for bubbles. You dont get credit for any damage you do thats mitigated so sometimes its better to hop off a target thats bubbled and burst someone else for a bit.. Watch who youre targeting. Are you targeting a healer or a sorensu specd jugg tank with mitigation and CDs? Make sure youre hopping on smart targets and DPSing.. Use your CDs like they are candy. Your Cloak of Pain should always be on CD.. Manage your dots  beserk. Your beserk should be used the second you have  Fury built. The proc time on that is actually very long so make sure youre procing that and Deadly Saber the second it comes off CD.. Know the benefitsweaknesses of your spec. Im a NiM raider that uses Annihilation during raids but I wouldnt bring out Annih during pvp personal opinion. I feel that jumping on a healer and giving them a carnage burst is a lot scarier and a hell of a lot more fun.. Finally know what PVP bracket youre in. You just dinged into the new PVP bracket which means youre getting pushed around by up to level s. They just have a higher selection of skills that they can use think of how much more damage youll do when you get Annihilation.Thats all I can think of now. Hope it helps sorry for the novel.,swtor,cgj2z70,2,t5_2qxih

772659,0,t3_230891,In SWTOR in order to craft things you generally need three skills  a crafting skill a gathering skill and a missions skill. Gathering skills scavenging archaeology bioanalysis and slicing allow you to gather materials as you travel around the maps. Each node is marked by a kind of sunflower shaped icon letting you know where it is.Mission skills cost a set amount of credits and you send your companions out on a mission of a certain amount of time they will be unavailable to you while they are sent out. Theyll bring back blue and purple mats needed for crafting better versions of your basic recipes.Once you have materials you can use your crafting skill to create items then reverseengineer them from your inventory menu to learn better schematics. Your character doesnt actually do any of this your companions do it for you and like with mission skills you wont be able to use them in combat while theyre crafting.Certain skills go together so which ones you should take depend on what interests you most. Cybertech makes armoringmods droid parts and earpieces. Artifice makes crystals enhancements and wieldable items shields and focuses mostly. Armormech makes nonforce user armor generally. Synthweaving makes forceuser armor generally. Armstech makes guns and barrels. Biochem makes medpacks stims adrenals and implants.Additionally each companion you get has two bonuses towards certain crew skills so you should use a companion with an artifice crit bonus for making artifice objects for instance. What you have depends on what class you play.,swtor,cgs3tj2,3,t5_2qxih

Put the crystal into the weapon and then send it to whoever you want in your legacy.  You have to pay to remove the crystal but it works every time.  Once the new toon equips the item it will be in their collection and you can make more for their companions.  I do this all the time.

974526,0,t1_chevlgf,Youre referring to two different raids here so Im not sure what you mean.  Dread Palace is the most recent raid and is level .  If you left before Makeb youve never seen it and its harder currently than any of the other raids.  Next patch well get the Nightmare Mode difficulty level for it as well if youre looking for more challenge.Eternity Vault is the level  operation that was in the game at launch.  That hasnt had its difficulty updated to level  but it does still retain the Story Hard and Nightmare mode difficulty levels for players to do.  Most people just do Hard Mode for the weekly quest that gives commendations but some groups do occasionally do Nightmare to get the title.Currently there are  level  operations in the game Scum amp Villain Terror From Beyond Dread Fortress and Dread Palace.  These are the current endgame for gearing up and all have Story Normal and Nightmare modes except for Palace which will get it in the next patch.Along with this there are  level  operations.  Eternity Vault Karaggas Palace and Explosive Conflict.  These also have Story Normal and Nightmare modes though they are level  so a geared  group is unlikely to have difficulty.  The exception to this is Explosive Conflict as that has difficult mechanics that can still wipe level  groups that arent paying attention.,swtor,chf29ta,1,t5_2qxih

992224,0,t3_25h0n9, Republic Smuggler I think I fell in love with this class when they first showcased it with the cover aspect. Gunslinger The Space Cowboy that uses cover DPS I would recommend it due to the great story funny dialog lines both in and out of your class story the ease of playing the class and the numerous abilities you use in the rotation. It was a great class and story. Definitely liked the cover mechanic. Was slightly disappointed that natural cover was not used as much in higher levels. Pre. this class had low mobility and had trouble with certain boss fights due to that. Both sides are great. Is a great Light Side Vigilante  Sheriff neutral Mercenary for hire or Dark Side criminal class. . My first  and second . Healer Sage had more Flashpoint pops so I leveled from  to  faster with him. Still one of my mains. Mostly Light Side. Most games that I play I tend to lean towards Light Side if I am not RP a character. Being neutral or Dark Side gives me a sort of disconnect with the character.

I am almost guaranteed at least a level using the legacy flashpoint boost and  xp boosts lvl  now and have leveled everytime Ive done KDY just about. They are also going to be having a double xp week coming up July st  th I think and if you couple that with legacy buffs and xp boosts it doubles all of them as well so legacy now gives  xp boost and the buffs give  all of this on top of the double xp you would normally get.

Even if you were to only spend if it was halfoff itd take one month less than a year.  Of course you can also spend money on Riot Points itd cut down the time but why would you when there are completely free alternatives to it? months of  games a day in Dota  could earn you a fair amount on the Steam market which can also be spent on games.

1461884,0,t1_cizaqrq,If youre leveling as a dps you should never use a tank companion over a healing companion. Hell I pick a healer when I level as a tank as well because healers just let you go go go. Youve hit the nail on the head on what is important for leveling which is sustain and in my opinion especially with the amount of presence I have a healer companion brings more than enough for any dps class. every tank AC has a spec that does huge aoe burst that makes life really easy in terms of clearing most mobs you encounter while leveling. Personally Ive leveled  toons to   of which are tanks two sins one jug one guardian one PT and the only time I ever felt tanking was more efficient was when I was trying to kill golds that were two levels above me on Corellia. As an aside the only time I truly hated leveling was my guardian during a double xp weekend getting your healer takes forever QQ tried both tanking and dps I just rely on healers to chain pull at this point. ,swtor,cizityl,1,t5_2qxih

1603747,0,t1_cjhb7pt,Perhaps a large part of the problem is managing the community amp offering a reason for stimulating interaction.  Surely cantina chat is not all that anyone is looking for.  Guilds need events amp shit.  Dueling tournaments as training exercises.  Mentor programs to help gear induct new players amp a regular schedule for social stuff.  Ill admit I wouldnt know right now how to keep that shit going but with the right group it could be done.  I always thought it would be cool to have some sort of offshoot spec forces team.  Not actually on the books as part of the pubimp faction but not just merca either.  Like an extremist group that is only looked to as a last result in times of dire circumstance.  This could justify them being the ones taking on the dread masters amp what have you while maintaining their own independence amp power structure.

I always did lockbox missions for Slicing and the mission books that come with that sell for a ton especially if I get an Underworld Trading which is k.

You probably can hit the per character point contribution limit doing exclusively solo things and I am sure that there are many guilds that would love to have any contribution every point matters.  It would be a winwin for all involved.  You contribute conquest points via solo activities and boost your guild which does better in the standings allowing you to participate in the conquest rewards.Ultimately I hope my guild does decide to try to recruit players exactly like you.  We already have a few guys that only participate occasionally and in many respects it is kind of fun because when they login we catch up on what is going on each others lives and take them to show them cool things they havent seen yet.

1753348,0,t1_ck05qlx,Honestly I really like the light side warrior path. For starters Jaesa is still a Jedi but has to pretend to be evil around the rest of the crew to keep her cover intact and she is terrible at it. Im pretty sure all of them are on to her and just dont care. Im sure Pierce knows there was one particularly hilarious conversation where he overheard her saying something about saving people and poked his head into the room to ask some followup questions.Good news master I found more people to help!Whats that?Umm I said umm....good news master I found some cuddly animals to set on fire! Yeah! And then uhh eat them? Yeah that. Anyway dont eavesdrop on me you err worm? Yeah worm! Or Ill....kill you I guess?Heh. Sure youre a real scary lady. Dial it back a few notches.I was absolutely no help to her during that conversation kept asking her to clarify exactly what evil things she was planning to do. Anyway I kind of liked doing the exact opposite of what my superiors wanted in every given situation. My idea for this character is that he was light side out of childish spite because nobody tells the Wrath what to do damnit. Plus the light side decision is usually smarter anyway collect a bunch of favors rather than pointlessly murdering potential allies. By the end of the story I had a small army standing with me for my showdown with Baras not that I needed them. Republic special ops disgraced Sith overseers pretty much every contact Baras sent me to kill etc. I didnt even realize Baras was going to turn on me I just figured an informant that owed me a huge favor would be a good card to keep.,swtor,ck061ho,2,t5_2qxih

If healing bubbles and puddles is something you like youll like sorcs.  If reactive healing shells is something you like youll like mercs.  As noted below all of the healing classes can clear all of the NiM content we have in the game today.  NiM Brontes on a sorcsage will take some strategy considerations for the final phase but it can be done.  NiM Draxus on the other hand is quite nice to have a sorcsage as their bubbles work under those shields and no other healer has something they bring to the table at that time.So in the same operation a sorcsage has both ends of the spectrum with regard to raid benefits.,swtor,ck73r98,1,t5_2qxih

1824246,0,t3_2ffy01,This is a very subjective question and hence will solicit a lot of subjective answers. But my two cents are thisIve played a decent amount of FP games including Guild Wars City of Heroes Lord of the Rings Online DampD Online and Star Trek Online. All of those games I was able to enjoy the FP. I felt like I could enjoy doing what I wanted to do and from time to time spent money as it was available on stuff that I wanted to spend money on.SWTOR is the only game Ive played where I felt like the FP model was punishing me for playing FP Ive since resubscribed though Star Trek Online comes in at a close second.Personally its the little things.LotRO gives FP at least one or two of their cosmetic tabs. The equivalent in SWTOR matching item color to chestpiece and hiding the head slot require money or ingame credits.LotRO lets you keep any rest XP youve built up when your account clicks over into FP SWTOR takes it away.I get that game needs to make money to continue I really do want to give money to games that I enjoy and that a lot of what SWTOR makes you pay for as a FP are unnecessary nicetohaves. I cant really give you a detailed list of what made me feel so frustrated with their FP model all I can tell you is that at the end of the day Ive never felt like I couldnt enjoy a game as a FPpreferred status except in SWTOR.Basically every other game  made me feel like if I were to put in enough time I could earn enough of the outofgame currency or ingame currency to unlock the particular aspects that I wanted to unlock.

1839585,0,t3_2fn641,The way I see it is that conquest like most other features is an optional grind with a specific reward at the end as long as the required work is put in. You want PvP gear but you hate PvP and dont want to participate? I guess youre not getting PvP gear and rightfully so. This is basically how it works with the features.When it comes to small guilds and conquest these guilds are small by choice not because the game is preventing them from doing what they need to do in order to win which is to put simply growing their size. When people or groups choose not to do the work or take the steps necessary to accomplish a goal they are also choosing to not want the reward intentionally or not.,swtor,ckav7av,6,t5_2qxih

Sharpshooter is mostly burst moves and a couple of good defensive buffs. With the changes in .

The obvious counter to this is have the scouts go straight to them. Theyll be too busy going after easy targets. Usually gunships will run really far to get away. While they are running you take out the bomber and mop up any idiots who dont run. Also dont fly in a straight line.

In TDM if you dont die the other team doesnt get points. Learn to LOS. learn of spaces in the map to play to your advantage and learn you evasive abilities. And stay close to your team.

2014287,0,t1_ckvufbi,Inhouse testing tests for different things than public testing. Inhouse testing is really good at catching regressions and making sure changes do what the patch notes say they will do but its awful at pushing the boundaries and finding the exploits and edge cases. Testers are necessarily people who play SWTOR for a living and are intimately familiar with the systems so they quickly stop doing stupid illogical things even though real players always do those things. They also rarely play real characters that leveled organically and that they are extremely familiar with.  There are whole categories of bugs that internal testing stands basically no chance of catching which is why the most established MMO developers have very extensive public testing. Thats not to say they wont be stupid and skip the public testing.

However due to coding and client server limits its not retroactive meaning if you preorder before they announced the sub perk you were not eligible to get the new race skin for free.

I was leveling  I think dont remember and spending all that rested xp was a pain. ,swtor,ckztx7m,0,t5_2qxih
2047411,0,t3_2i98m6,I would like a Tattooine Homesteadscale stronghold deep in the jungle on Dromund Kaas.  It should be large expensive and magnificent. Reasons this is a good idea Imperial design and architecture are freakin awesome and extremely prominent in the game and I would like more room to play with it. The Kaas City apartment is apparently meant to be a cheap starter stronghold which in addition to pissing me right off means shoddy hook placement room for only one centerpiece in a terrible spot that is entirely too small for a massive structure no starship hooks and terrible building security I routinely receive visits from my rentcontrolled neighbors in the lower floors. I am a powerful and wealthy individual and if I want to start my own cult in the jungle outside the Empires capital THAT IS MY RIGHT. I want an Imperialappropriate outdoor area to decorate. By the Emperors boxer shorts I own TANKS and I cannot abide Kaliyo driving them up and down my small balcony any longer no matter how happy she looks when she sticks her head out the window with her tongue out.TLDR Dromund Kaas jungle massive compound make it happen.,swtor,cl02kht,26,t5_2qxih

2134561,0,t3_2jdkyt,Ill just toss my vote in for this having been a wonderful experiment. I think BioWare took a baby step toward something like this with the character perk system but they didnt take it far enough at least as regards the class mission xp buff.My one sadness about this experiment is that it wont last past the launch of . and the thing is that having now finally finished my th and final class story Id done . before this started I kinda dont feel like rolling a new alt until the disciplines system gets introduced because I feel like that will actually make the combat at lower levels much more rewarding.

2134704,0,t3_2jfc1f,The community is strong and since you leaving you would be overwelmed if you wanted to keep up with the content you missed. Class balance is pretty on par with what it should be. And maybe one day every specialization will be on par.Full heal ... if that annoyed you will still be annoyed. Juggernaughts essentially have to be killed twice and healing is pretty strong to overcome the heavy DPS they have added. TTK was pretty low prior to . before you left. Its a bit better now. Some classes have some good life taps. Sorcs to name one.Sin did have trouble tanking in the past. It is better now. And at this point I dont know that there is content in which progression teams actually sit out a competent tank based on class. We use a sin tank for our progression.We are about to get an expansion in December. So as for wasting time you will be probably be extremely overwelmed trying to catch up in a month and half.

I think of PVP in ToR as a fast paced MTG match.If the combat is too fast I feel it makes it a little too much like Hardcore Modern Warfare.  I imagine players just wanted to last long enough to matter.In the end I think the TTK has been mostly affected by the insane amount of buffs to DPS that have been implemented over the past year. ,swtor,clpbceo,2,t5_2qxih

I prefer Lord Scourge myself as I like a tank with my pure DPS characters but Sentinel has enough armor that it can take hits if you want to bring the healer out.  DPSDPS is a little fragile but once geared you will wipe trash mobs fast.   I slightly prefer healers for bosseschampions in case I screw up my defensive CDs and take to much damage.   IMO the right way to do it at the end is to rotate between a couple different comps depending on the situation.For leveling just go KiragtDoc.  Scourge is ok when you get him but you kind of need to tweek your tanks gear before they get decent.   I wouldnt use him in his starter greens. ,swtor,clst9ne,3,t5_2qxih

Heres a link So Id say its definitely more of an Inquisitor look.Anyways every armor set from the Cartel MarketPacksHypercrates can be unlocked legacywide once youve equipped all pieces of the set on the same character. This costs cartel coins however. Usually  sometimes  or  and very rarely . I have no idea what these numbers are based on and they seem pretty arbitrary.As for good sets to unlock its all a matter of personal preference but Id be surprised if theres really no set in the game that appeals to you except Spectres. What I would recommend for you to do is to open the Collections tab and start digging around. You might find some stuff you like.

2351310,0,t1_cm29ei9,Changed is a better question.  Hmm.  Its the same game with more stuff to do.  There havent been any real big game altering changes just additional content and balance changes.  That might change somewhat in . but i really doubt the changes are going to be THAT dramatic.  Time will tell.All in all i think the raids were improving until DF and DP.  Although they are challanging I think they are just too short and lack... flavor if that makes any since.  I think the best raids in game so far are SV and TFB.  Either way its impoved over the old EV and KP days.  PvP has new maps and ranked mode.  Dont really do much in it so im not a good judge in that since.  I never do GSF so its a wash for me.  Lots of new clothes and we have homes of a sort now so you can play dressup and HGTV with your new space sims.Never really spent the time on the exploration missons with the seeker droids and boniculars but theyer there.  So i guess my honest recommendation is this if you had fun playing the game in the past yeah its worth it cause its more or less the game you enjoyed with more too do.  But if you didnt enjoy the game then no they havent added anything to the game thatd alter it in any way. ,swtor,cm2bzce,1,t5_2qxih

I think this is partly why they toned down the healing for SalvationRevivification.The lack of control will be the biggest problem with this heal it will only heal when the person with the lowest HP when the healing last jumped takes damage.,swtor,cm2d9di,1,t5_2qxih

Theres some new dialog with your companions but the two expansions so far Rise of the Hutt Cartel  Shadow of Revan  have one core storyline that every class plays through with small variations in the dialog based on your class. In SoR there is additionally a single class specific mission that does a call back to your class story which was a really nice nostalgia touch.    Other than that if you wanted to come back and explore some character stories doing so during october and november mightve been a good time they gave you x exp for class missions so you could lvl  without having to do all the repetitive universal side quests to see class story.

Basically youre the super special awesome almighty chosen one ultimate hero of the universe and mighty savior of everything ever in the history of ever.

2584043,0,t1_cmvun6u,Right now ltCharacter Namegt only is unique per server and ltLegacy Namegt isnt unique at all. So its entirely possible in fact its quite certain that you will have more than one Luke Starkiller in the game already on different servers. You cant have anyone named Luke Skywalker because thats a violation of the naming rules since it is a canon character name.Now when you throw those two Luke Starkillers together into the same megaserver how do you tell one from the other?  You cant unless they tack on something to them to sort it all out. There are going to be boatloads of these collisions and just arbitrarily forcing renames on characters people have had since launch would result in epic ragequit.Star Trek Online avoided this problem right up front because it was a singleshard universe from the start and your Handle or at handle was made to be globally unique across the game universe. So you could name a character whatever you wanted but the combination of CharacterHandle was guaranteed always to be unique and in fact most of the systems like mail and chat worked off the unique handle instead of character name anyway.In our case there is no naming element that is globally unique across the entire game universe so in order to let people play in the same namespace theyre going to have to add one.,swtor,cmvvekl,4,t5_2qxih

Then when you hit level  you will be utterly brutalized for the next  levels so it might actually be worth just doing the daily PVP mission and level via PVE.Also the experience from PVP from  to  is VERY slow winning a warzone with  medals a complimentary XP boost and  bonus was worth about .k at  which is less than the XP youd get for killing a couple of Elite mobs on Rishi.

Even without a healer if youre doing the right stuff to mitigate damage to yourself you can keep several people defended and still take a while to die. With a healer its even better.TLDR Yes if you are a good tank.,swtor,cnmomjg,1,t5_2qxih

2818546,0,t1_cnogc67,My original guess was around  of the total population did it. I mostly picked this number because during TFs first attempt at Loot they had an idle program that someone made to make sure that you could get loot without playing the game. Despite using an external program it still managed to have a . usage rate however the Ravagers exploit was obviously easier and offered immediate results. Once you hit around  youre looking at  in yearly revenue in subs not counting Cartel Coin purchases. I just cant see anything major happening due to how wide spread this appears to be. If they act too harshly players will simply stop subbing which result in lowered profits and less content for everyone in the future.

2824889,0,t3_2seu5b,My guild combined two progression groups to try a  man ravagers last friday. Prenerf Bulo was doable with coordination but Torque was a real mess and I expect that along with Underlurker to be the prime pugkiller from now on. I should mention that there was not a single person in our group who had not already cleared the entire op multiple times in man. You can do the repair droid mechanic perfectly each time but theres no avoiding melee DPS getting destroyed by the fire which seems to hit x harder in man. After two wipes what we did to clear it was have two ranged focus on shoots lasers and DFD and not touch the boss at all while all the other DPS focused on the boss and nothing else. Ended up with two melee down due to the fire and  seconds of enrage at the end which was enough to kill both the tanks but nobody else. Rest of the op was easy as usual.Personally I still will not be pugging it at all.

2838111,0,t3_2sduhk,Cashewguy Im really disapointed that you are influencing opinion with strawman arguements andIf you wont properly backup your arguments then I will simply tell you why they are wrong.The scars on Revans face are from his mask.Ive never seen anyone deny this but Ive never actually questioned it myself. Its common sense. First off this amounts to your experience against mine. I was referring to a conversation where two people in a guild chat were arguing about whether or not the character model was badly designed. I butted in and brought this up the guy who was saying how stupid the design was immediately denied it because he felt it hurt his argument. Neither of the players like many of my friends were aware of the origins of the scars. If its common sense to you  congratulations but that does not make me wrong.out that the Revan on Yavin is way taller body type  than the Revan in the Foundry body type .Im going to want your video on this because I doubt it. Ive not done the fights personally as Im only just returning to SWTOR but all the videos Ive watched show the same Revan. No player believes me when I point this out even when I provide indisputable proof such as the screenshots I have already provided they make any excuse they can in order to deny it. This among many other things illustrates the unbelievable bias of the online community.Revan Reborn is an obvious clone and no one noticed.No. Thats all I have to say on that. Answer me this how does someone magically grow a couple feet in height at Revans age? If you want to claim its from mechanical legs then please give me a logical reason Bioware would not reveal that he had them. This is where I stopped taking you seriously. This is a really cheap tactic often used by people who are accustomed to arguing improperly. Let me share with you the words of a brilliant man who essentially invented the art of illegitimate debate.    Ridicule is mans most potent weapon. It is almost impossible to counteract ridicule. Also it infuriates the opposition which then reacts to your advantage. Alinsky Rules for radicals. The fact of the matter is that you dont give any reason as to why he is not a clone. You simply insulted me by claiming my argument is not worth your attention. I was a kid and I know every I think a lot of people overgeneralize Revan. Personally believe he doesnt align himself arbitrarily to the Light Side or the Dark Side or more storiedly the Jedi or the Sith.Rather he has his own personal code one which seems to align very much with the Republic overall. He has demonstrated numerous times that he is more loyal to the Republic than the code of the Jedi. You shouldnt call me out on lazy grammar when you dont check your own. The second sentence is missing I at the beginning and Storiedly is not a word. Ironically you were trying to use the word storied so you could sound smart but based on the way you tried to make it plural I know that you had no clue what the word even meant. Revans personal code is never clearly defined He would often knowingly sacrifice his own people just to get an easy win on malacore V he had intentionally put dissentors into harms way as bait allegedly. Even on wookiepedia where all your ideas seem to be taken from Revans evil tactics are aknowledged  Moral shortcuts became common under Revan and Malaks leadership and the two Jedi developed a cold and calculating disposition unlike that of a Jedi they matched the Mandalorians brutal tactics with tactics just as merciless.  In every old republic game you have options to do things like this becouse it appears you have no choice however it turns out if you pick light side that there is always another way. Revan should have been using creativity to win while minimizing his losses but instead he tossed them away like chess pieces.  Revan is at his core a ruthless pragmatist. Pragmatist  a person who is oriented toward the success or failure of a particular line of action thought etc. a practical person.  The Sith emperor is also a pragmatist biggest one in the EU in fact as he meticulously plans to kill everyone in the galaxy.  A lot of real life dictators are pragmatist. Being a pragmatist simply means you are devoted to a goal be it right or wrong or you use methods that are extremely practical be them good or bad. not exactly sure how Revan being a pragmatist makes him sane or good Revan began his journey to the Dark Side out of a need to protect the Republic. Republic forces were being absolutely pounded by the Mandalorians and the Jedi refused to assist the Republic Military.There isnt a lot of info about the early life of Revan. All I have to go on are quotes that hint at an exceptional thirst for knowledge which the Jedi seem to be implying was powerlust and that he eagerly charged into war against the councils wishes. These are not the actions of a one note light side Jedi and you seem to even acknowledge this. At no point did I say he turned Dark side prior to the Mandalorian wars this is a strawman argument only that he is not light side. During the Mandalorion wars is when he turns that is one thing we can agree on.   While the Jedi and Republic have always been incredibly close at the time they were not connected beyond vague partnership similar to how lawmen in the Old West US operated. They may have assisted and benefited from the Republic but they were not officially part of it.Revan believed they should be aiding the Republic and it was this movement that led to a sect of Jedi joining the Mandalorian War on the side of the Republic. It was undoubtedly this action that led to the Jedi Orders future involvement in nearly all Republic conflicts in a military capacity.Revan is short for Revanchist  which is specifically a policy to regain lost territory.The Revanchists were the rogue sect of Jedi I spoke of a moment ago. Their goal was short and simple repel the borders. Reject and destroy the Mandalorian threat to the Republic.There is no canonical name for Revan anywhere. He became known as The Revanchist as leader of the Revanchist faction. It was shortened to Revan and he held that title before he became a Dark Lord. He essentially adopted it as his own name.On Cathar the Revanchist discovered the now famous mask underfoot. Upon picking it up he was struck by a vision of the Cathar being brutally slaughtered by the Mandalorians. He donned the mask and swore revenge against the Mandalorians for their genocide.  Im going to refer to these points later on.During Revans fight with the Mandalorians he defeated  in one on one hand to hand combat  Mandalore the Ultimate. Dude I know all of this I have the very comics these events were first revealed in. I left it out because all you have to do is google Revan to get all that information I assumed people already knew this. You missed the point entirely I said he was a bad person who didnt need the emperors help to continue to be a bad person. Just because he was loyal to the republic does not make him good. In Kotor Revan got amnesia and then has his memories manipulated by the Jedi council who then make him think he is a generic soldier.This is false.Revan was knocked into a coma either by Malaks attack or Bastila Shans push. He didnt suffer Amnesia the Jedi Council very specifically and meticulously wiped his mind and reconstructed a false identity. Declaring outright that something is false is something you should only do when you have damning evidence. You however are basing your argument on pure conjecture. Bastila does not force push Revan in the dream cutscene I dont care where you got that info if it contradicts what happens in the game it doesnt count. If the Jedi council decided to wipe his mind as you claim his alien language skills would have been lost and if youre suggesting that they destroyed his memories please recall that they do come back and obviously were not completely destroyed. Bastila also says Revans mind was severely damaged when Malak attacked the ship he was on. He was practically dead and the council rebuilt his broken mind the game is very specific about this. If you actually had played the game you would know this.  Much as Meetra was cut off from the Force the Jedi Order could artificially sever Revan. By infiltrating his mind and utterly destroying all of his experiences and training he could and was reduced to little more than a very powerful forcesensitive. more conjecture if his alien language abilities survived which is something that is actually established that means the skill section of his brain was still working think Bourne Identity.   The combat skills and alien lexicon remaining intact do nothing to aid Revans forcesensitive nature and only aided the Jedi Order in their ability to create a false identity.Dude I acknowledged the false identity. The force is supposed to be based on the spirit. Lucas may have tried to ruin this concept but if you almost die and forget you were ever even able to use the force youre going to have a hard time using willpower to levitate an object. Remember how in empire Luke cant move the Starfighter because he believes he cant do it its too big. Luke doesnt use any of his force abilities until Ben Konobi explains the existence of the force to him once he recognizes it is something he is able to do Luke starts to display small force powers. If one does not confidently believe he can use the force it will seriously inhibit his ability.,swtor,cnqoub3,1,t5_2qxih

As a Combat Sent prior to . I had some decent control over opponents but between their new CC immunities speed boosts and our removal of ranged root and extra speed from Transcendence which I cant justify taking over more needed choices weve been nerfed from all sides.  I think the CC immunity should be attached to Transcendence along with either removing Trans from the Centering mechanic or adding an internal CD to the immunity effect in order to prevent it from being used back to back.  Ours is the only speed boost that directly affects my dps  by using Trans I am not using Zen.  At this point there is pretty much no reason to ever use Trans over Zen while attacking but give it a CC immunity and you are giving me an interesting choice to make Zen fueled burst or CC immune but lower dps phase.,swtor,cnr4yzk,3,t5_2qxih

My issues so far have been     Using taunt against enemies already attacking me     Not staying within  meters of my guard target     Not switching guard enough     Forgetting about my healer if I have oneFor  I just need to be more aware of the situation instead of just hitting taunt every time its up.With  coming from a healer background with a m range  meters seems really tiny.  Need to adjust and be aware of who Im guarding and where they are.For  I was mostly guard switching when I entered a battle.  I would do a target of target switch to that person guard and back to the enemy.  I would forget about guard after that though.  I need to keep an eye on the operations frame and use that to switch if someone else starts taking damage.Similar to  for  I need to know who my healer is and always keep an eye on them in the operations frame.  If they start taking damage break off my attack and Jet Charge back to the healer guard and taunt.  I wish there was a way to know who your healer is quicker.

Ive saved a little money on gifts by leveling crew skillls.  From a credit standpoint its probably more expensive in actuality but because my goal was to boost the crew skill and not comp affection its kind of saving money because those credits give a dual purpose.,swtor,co8plx9,2,t5_2qxih

The matchmaker grants high priority to anyone in a group because its a team game.  We arent sure exactly how matchmaking works as priority but time in queue is a big factor but so is is grouped.On every server you can cjoin gsf and then ask around.  Sometimes you can get a solid group very easily and this will often result in chainpops of the game.b Hard to say.  Do you have a joystick?   GoD Factory Wingmen available on steam has moba aspects in fullthreespace.  Its meant as an esport with a handful of races and powers and builds you can work up for them.  Its inexpensive.   Star Conflict might be interesting to you.   Elite Dangerous and Star Citizen are both very toptier games but its relatively unclear what direction they are taking as regards the space pvp side of things.  Star Citizens Arena Commander module will be a lot like GSF in that its queueable pvp that doesnt interact muchat all with their persistent universe but like everything else it is in development.

Getting the app to recognize the window then align and scale it would be the hardest part if you make the user pick the class and discipline first then you dont have to recognize the images just where the brighter selected utility items are.

3322497,0,t1_cp6xgnp,I very much agree. No matter how much or little you enjoy postvanilla stories you prolly mostly stop caring about them after the  hours it takes you to finish the new expansion. After you are done the story stops being among things that keep you playing andor paying.   Id think an MMO that wants to make a subscriber out of you would be much more worried about adding and focusing on longevity.  Neat tidy  hour stories dont bring much of it.Id like to think above is reasonably objective. More subjective bits to come! Personally Ive been completely unable to give a single fuck about single moment of narrative during MakebRevan.   My absolute favorite narrative  moment is the Rakata Flashpoint You and few of your pals derp through completely irrelevant Flashpoint. There are no mechanics to learn or encounters to beat at no point does anything challenge the group in any way. Have you ever wiped or failed there? Even once? Yeah.  After killing utterly irrelevant final boss Revan makes an appearance and starts nuking the planet with capital ship turrets that cant hurt you. This event chain sums up perfectly how questionable and bad the narrative toolkit of BW writers are. Even if writing dialog etc is okay and all..you just cant make a good video game story in this environment. What is supposed to be a dramatic and powerful moment really isnt for the same reasons flipping a bird while wearing an owen mitten doesnt work.    You dont get to be a hero in this environment. Shooting fish in barrel doesnt leave you expecting keys to the city. Nothing you do is challenging.  Fuck yes!! We did it!! doesnt happen. As such nothing gets to feel like a rewardrewarding. I mostly do GSF and have no clue how to play my sorc anymore. My friend is a clicker for the love of ged. Im pretty sure we are almost as noobish and average as they come. Yet she and I two manned through the Forged Allegiance Fps as they got released without an issue.  We keep wondering what the point is. Is like rolling dice which comes with  s    Content is not exciting and it doesnt get you involved. IMHO BW really shouldnt leave getting player excited or involved for  talking heads alone. Every time somebody goes  Awesome  work you totally saved the  Empire!! during some Forged Allegiance turn in quest I keep thinking of the first  seconds of first tutorial mission of some old RTS. Use left mouse button to click on Thrall. click  Nice work!   Now click by the green flag and Thrall will move there.  click   Well done! No it was not well done.

See if you can find another GB memory chip for it somewhere GB is really a nice minimum these days for any PC.Hard to say where you can wind up on the graphics setting but it should run at least. But notebooks are crap for playing anything on. Even the uberexpensive Alienwares and whatnot still sacrifice power to achieve portability.

3479296,0,t1_cpon88w,Thats not actually true if youre going for max rep overall.  It really doesnt matter in the long run which you use when.To max yourself out it takes  total rep.  You can get k per week or .k per week if you be smart about it.k rep at k rep per week   weeks.  k rep at .k per week   weeks.  The only difference is you end up really really close to the gap.  The smart route leaves you only needing  rep on week  the whatever route leaves you needing  rep on week .  But its  weeks regardless.  Typically if youre maxing out you probably have left over tokens anyway.I guess maybe it depends on your definition of much quicker but I dont think thats a very significant difference.Incidentally Dulfys page is wrong about this.

3480034,0,t1_cpomtx3,Not exacly. As you are right about Concealment your main damage dealer as Lethality Operative is a  meter rifle attackCorrosive Assault. You also have A Toxic Blast which is also an mid range rifle attack and a major part of your rotation.Its only two attacks in your main rotation that make use of rifle but Corrosive Assault is kinda spammableyou will be often using  of those in a row. And your filler attacksrifle shotovrload shot are also using your rifle. And Lethality is as mobile as Concealment actually even more since you dont have to stay in m range all the time to do damage you will be staying mid range most of the time.Lethality Operative actually fits the run and gun play style nicely.,swtor,cpoy6e0,2,t5_2qxih

Its a mix of ranged granadesdart mid range rifle attacksmain damage dealer and a bit of close range stabbing great mobility with rolling and all skills being instantno channeling skills that make you stand still. Add to that pretty good selfoff healing and stealth as a cherry on top.It has some issues like a bit long setup timeyou need to put dots with your granadesdarts first on your target and generate Tactical adventages before doing man damage kinda delayed burst and crappy dot spread mechanic but its still very fun and imo a bit underrated spec.Check YT for some Lethality Operative gameplay vids I think you will be pleased! ,swtor,cpoya2s,1,t5_2qxih

3626188,0,t1_cq5km0b,Everything you are quoting is from the EU which is no longer canon.There is no canon evidence that TIEs do not have shields that Awings are fast or that Ewings exist at all.  In fact we can infer from the Episode  trailer that they dont.The only thing we know from the movies is that Xwings have hyperdrives and that a basic TIE Fighter doesnt.  And that makes sense because the Empire has hundreds of thousands of carrier ships and the rebels have almost none.  The rebels are forced to use a hyperspacecapable ship and the weight of that drive plus the astromech are probably why we see Xwings constantly outrun and outmaneuvered by TIEs in the movie.  This includes Luke who is supposed to be a great pilot aided by the Force.  He gets a TIE on his tail and is unable to shake himhes going to die but is saved at the last minute by Wedge coming to his aid.  And the only reason Wedge is even able to do that is because the rebels outnumber the TIEs by more than x at that point.The trope that TIEs are mass produced crappy fighters that win purely through numerical advantage makes no sense and is purely an EU invention.  The first time our heroes encounter a TIE it is alone.  In the Battle of Yavin the rebels outnumber the TIEs by more than x.The only time we see a swarm of TIEs is in Return of the Jedi and thats because there are also swarms of Star Destroyers present and because it is a trap where the Emperor himself is bait.  Everyone has been called in.Plus the notion that the Empire spends all this money to recruit and train pilots at an academy which Luke wanted to attend and then throw them into a crappy fighter that cant compete with what the insurgents are flying is ludicrous.This is the same Empire that builds giant robot camels and Super Star Destroyers.  Their Navy is all about excessthere is no reason to think that TIEs are not state of the art.The rebels on the other hand are forced to use whatever they can find and since they have few carriers they have to choose fighters with hyperdrives which must have an engineeringweightfuel cost that somehow reduces the potential effectiveness of their fighters.  Theres no free lunch.Disposable mass produced crappy TIE Fighters would only make sense if their pilots were also disposable and mass producedi.e. Clones.  But Rebels canon has shown that to not be the case.  TIE Pilots are academy trained volunteers.  We can infer Luke wanted to be one!The entire notion that Xwings are this amazing goodateverything fighter that can single handedly take on superior numbers of TIEs was invented by EU writers.  Probably because they had to come up for an explanation why in every Star Wars video game Xwings have  hitpoints while TIE Fighters all die in one or two shots. But this is true in any space shooter video gamethe hero ship always has to be more durable than the droves of enemy ships he is destroying.But in the movies every Starfighter is destroyed or disabled in one or two shots.  Deflector Shields for all we know are mainly for deflecting physical debris and are minimally effective against lasers.  And regardless there is no canon evidence to suggest TIEs do not have the same defensive systems as Xwings because they all have approximately the same survivability.  Some Xwings blow up the instant they are hit.  Some get disabled and have to retreat.  Its the same for TIEs.  Some blow up the instant they are hit.  Some survive but often they end up running into something like an asteroid trench wall or Vaders TIE.  Either way flying a starfighter is dangerous business where you are just a blink away from death.  Your only hope for survival is speed and maneuverability not durability.If Xwings were better than TIEs then the Empire would have started mass producing them.  Especially if the Empire believed that it was the superiority of the Xwing that resulted in the Death Star being destroyed.  Even if they somehow couldnt recover Incoms stolen plans another purely EU invention theyd try to replicate the ship.But they didntbecause thered be no reason for them to.  Because at the Battle of Yavin their existing TIE Fighters cleaned up.  Of  rebel fighters only three survived and two of those were disabled to the extent where they werent trying for the trench anymore.For all we know TIE Interceptors might not even be superior to TIE Fighters.  About all we can derive from their name is that they are fast.  But they could be customs enforcement fighters whose job is to intercept smugglers.  The TIE Fighter may be the best space superiority dogfighting TIE variant and the only reason we see Interceptors at Endor is because the Emperor had called a ton of ships from all over to make sure his trap works.I know I sound crazy but as we prepare for Episode  we need to understand just how much of our preexisting assumptions came purely from EU despite a lot of it making no sense and having no basis in the movies.,swtor,cq5m2jg,0,t5_2qxih

3632362,0,t1_cq6aumc,The Warrior is admittedly not very subtle especially on Korriban but I have a different way to look at it. In a lot of conversations with NPCs outside of story missions different classes have unique lines usually the top conversation choice.The Inquisitors lines can involve Sith philosophy or political intrigue the Bounty Hunter talks about blasters and hisher hiring rates the Consular is insightful and wise the Smuggler tells the best jokes.And the Warrior?The Warrior is valiance and fury and war.What I enjoy so much about the Warrior story is how unstoppable it makes you feel. Every class goes to a bunch of planets and gets the job done but the Warrior is an absolute boss about it. Complete control over every situation. You dont just overcome the oppositionyou wipe the floor with it.Now I dont know exactly how far youve gotten so I dont want to spoil anything. But I can tell you this a lot of the Warriors personal character growth stems from your first companion. I didnt like himher at first due to the... philosophical disagreements between them and the Warrior. Nevertheless they grew on me like no other. To this day its my favorite companion in the game and never fails to make me laugh. I believe this character grows not only on the player but even on the Warrior despite himself keeping the Warrior human metaphoricallyI like to go Pureblood despite all the violence and the bloodshed.Theres also quite the amount of funny moments in the Warrior story. When youve finished Korriban I recommend checking out this little album by yours truly to see what I mean.,swtor,cq6bfgm,2,t5_2qxih

These gear items are designed to be used by these low levels in your legacy but you can just simply sell them back to any vendor for the basic coms before the return timer runs down in stead of trading them in for the gear to the vendors on your home world.

3761153,0,t1_cqkwc3f,gt I dont think FF has fully voiced and unique class story lines.Voiced no. But each class does have its own story as you level it.FFXIV also doesnt have the level of tying into your past like swtor does but it seems theyve dug into that a bit with the . story where different portions of dialogue were changed based on starting cityjobs played. Personally as someone who played from beta up through a year or two into fp the loss of individual class story hurts. The class stories were great and gave a decent incentive to leveling another toon imo. Losing them gives less incentive to do anything other than work on a main class per side.Both games arewere known for story FFXIV kept up with an epic journey from lowly starting adventurer to hero of the realm to where they set your character up for the expansion. SWTOR had some really great story for classes a main story and plenty of sidequests then some main story per side and sidequests...and then just main story for everyone and sidequests. For a star wars appropriate quote this deal is getting worse all the time.I played up to SoR so im missing this last bit I need to level through and Im a current sub of ffxiv whos cleared all content and leads an endgame guildfree company for where my experience with both comes in. ,swtor,cqkzzqw,3,t5_2qxih

3785247,0,t3_33o51j,I like how you phrase a question but then you are like the problem is the players who are good at the game!  Aces arent the problem.  Give me a break.  Thankfully youve gotten some good responses.  The GSF forum discusses this some times as well.    The extra req gain has already helped a lot but the simple fact is that GSF devs are currently on other things and they need to get the band back together to add stuff.  Most of the vets want balance fixes all players want more maps and I really think that the learning curve is so steep in part because of the fact that the game engine doesnt tell you the difference between a shot you the player aimed properly but your character missed because of the tohit roll based on your ships accuracy and their ships evasion a situation where your character got outplayed by their character and you didnt click correctly a situation where you the player got outplayed by the other player.  One other piece is that the game is constantly bribing players to do some activity.  If theres extra rewards for pvping one week we have noticeably less pops.  If theres rewards for other things or no rewards we see a good number of pops and if there are GSF conquest rewards we see a few more pops.  The issue of making a bunch of prizes here is that GSF would feel mandatory and it simply uses such a different skill set than the ground game that it would feel unfair.  At the same time its definitely not helpful to GSF to go up to the playerpool and give them a bunch of rewards for doing anything BUT queue GSF.  I think this balance is a bit too much towards the ignore GSF end of the spectrum.  Cross server is needed just for GSF.  It would also be massively helpful for ground pvp but the larger amount of overlap with pvp and pve skills means that theres normally not a huge shortage of pvp players there can be shortage of a bracket or a type but thats comparing group arenas solo arenas max level warzones and leveling warzones to just GSF.  ,swtor,cqnqxdq,1,t5_2qxih
3786412,0,t1_cqnbtg0,The listing charge is based off of an internal item value  the default price you see when you first put something into the sell box. The problem is that all of the cartel market items have an internal value in single digits making it essentially free to list a cartel item for tens of millions of credits.

Not to mention I havent played since RotHC and never fully finished all the content up to Oricon anyway.The purpose of the guide is to provide a stepbystep checklist for completionists that want to do every quest in order. Ive determined this order based on the recommended quest levels individual story chains and where quests and quest chains fit into the overarching story. As pointed out in the comments this order may not always be consistent but I put most of that down to BioWare failing at continuity its a big game hard to have  perfect continuity between  different classes and ALL their dialogue.The bonus series are placed where they are because that is when the breadcrumb quests for them on the fleet or elsewhere e.g. Voss in the case of Hoth become available. For example the Nar Shaddaa bonus series breadcrumb becomes available on the fleet after finishing Chapter .

3907084,0,t3_356n9z,For PvE I would go either Merc or Operative. Merc has some really awesome abilities that get overlooked in their overall effectiveness. IE Progressive scan gives a  armor buff to all effected targets making it arguably the best AOE heal to have in the games current AOE damage heavy mechanics. Plus smart heals are always great to have fire and forget.Operatives though are also pretty dang epic and are much easier to manage from an energy standpoint. They too have a pretty epic ability which I will add was totally stolen from Mercs pre . for their Recuperative Nanotech. This ability gives all effected targets a  increased healing from all sources! So This could even be a self heal on a tank.For PvP I love my Merc for healing though. lt,swtor,cr1n4k9,1,t5_2qxih
3907895,0,t3_357goc,This is why we cant have nice things...But on a serious note Im surprised something like this took this long to happen. Their in game harassment policy is terrible. I know a quite a few people who have left this game because the Devs did next to nothing when pictures addresses phone numbers have been linked in game.  SWTOR is full of a lot of bullies.  They say all the time Bioware doesnt ban subs.  Theyre unafraid and this is what alot of the players deal with on a daily basis. Im not saying the Devs should get over it but it shows what the community is like.  Just like when the Devs stream chat goes bad quick.  Just like the rape jokes by SWTOR players in Towellies SWTOR stream the other day. Sad part is this is just going to be an excuse the Devs use to close the ranks back up and lose the transparency weve been kinda getting.  Its like a PR move so they dont have to actually tell us if NiM mode is going to exist and other game issues. ,swtor,cr1qglg,19,t5_2qxih

3937134,0,t1_cr51hta,And you dont think its a problem that you cant craft above ? I can certainly make anything else above ...and none of those things have their direct counterparts on sale for real life money.Also CM crystals are generally superior to crafted  crystals because they can be used all the way down to level  also have superior color schemes that an artificer cant produce.You keep defending their decision if you like I dont much care if you think its okay. Lotto boxing the entire economy and invalidating all crew skills as anything but companion support is pretty fucking hilariously awful financial planning in my opinion. Its not just about  crystals. Every adaptive set that comes out of a lotto box is worth x what a synthweaver or armormech can make armor mech and weapons tech and cybertech as well have a limited area of competitive creations and in all fairness the only thing that comes out of any of these that has any worth is aug slots and augs. Artificers get screwed by  crystals that can be used at level  raining from the sky at k a pop when it costs them ten times that amout to get one schematic for a  crystal that will sell for less because the color scheme is less interesting than the CM ones...and Biochem is the only crew skill left standing that doesnt have to give a rats ass about what the CM has done to it because you dont do Biochem to sell things you do it to self support in PVEPVP.,swtor,cr52gdu,0,t5_2qxih

That would have even made Ziost dailies worth doing. What Im trying to say here is that this is not a limitation by the engine or work hours its just a design decision theyve chosen that I disagree with or perhaps more likely a simple lack of awareness that this is even something a group of players care about.,swtor,crf2y3e,-1,t5_2qxih

The mobility of Guardians has been increased also in . with Enure giving the  speed boost. The Guardian has some nice moves like Guardian Leap and Force Push which come in handy at times.

4112258,0,t3_37qbji,OK let me be the dissenting opinion just a tad bit to tell you some cons of the game so you can make an informed purchasing decision.  Im not doing this because I hate the game but because everyone else in this thread will likely cover the positives already.Firstly the story is not up to par with KOTOR  and .  Is the story better than every other MMO out there?  Heck yes.  But if you go into the game expecting huge dramatic decisions to have a big impact on the world around you  baring some minor changes to future class quests  then youll be disappointed.  Your decisions make the most impact on whatever is happening during that moment and wont change anything worthwhile in the future.Secondly combat is different.  Combat is more fluid and responsive as opposed to the turntaking system of KOTOR but it is also  in accordance with most MMOs  split into multiple classes.  Theres no hybrid specializations and youre shoehorned into one of three specializations for your class.  At the moment theres not truly a bad class barring PvP balance and in my opinion they are all pretty fun to play.Lastly the quests other than your main storyline arent particularly interesting.  Every planet you will have your class questline a long chained special quest for that planet and a bunch of other oneshot quests.  Those oneshot quests are just a bunch of kill this or click this objectives that are the definition of typical MMO grindy quests. Overall Id say SWTOR is a solid game especially if you arent a burnt out vet with not a lot to do.  The  starter pack is also an amazing deal considering that  days of game time is already worth  and that amount of cartel coins is worth .  If you do get it be sure to visit the sidebar and see what you should spend cartel coins on so you dont waste them.Also I recommend the Ebon Hawk server as one of the most populated.  Once you finish the tutorial area and hit the fleet  and this goes for all servers  most people will be willing to answer any questions you have about the game in the general chat.  If you do choose Ebon Hawk and decide to give it a shot pm me and Ill add you ingame so you can ask me anything you want.,swtor,crp0u0n,-4,t5_2qxih

4141368,0,t3_384hx9,I understand why people do this but usually when you allow a game to damage said relationships its part of a much deeper issue. other than just addiction to a game I play games with my wife for fun and while a lot of that is for escapism I wouldnt do it if I didnt legitimately enjoy it. Hell I probably clocked in  hours of Witcher  this weekend its like reading a good fantasy novel that you cant put down.

I cant just spam the resourceintensive heals what I referred to as running at maximum HPS  of the time without running out of resource. Sorcsage can and pulls similar numbers for doing so.Again maybe Im missing something but I see other classes as having to balance triage resources and mechanics while sorcssages only currently worry about triage and mechanics.Now if Coras healing requirements are so tight that I have to take kolto shot off my bar let me know... and I wont be sad that Im not there yet because that sounds boring and frustrating.,swtor,cryd92o,-1,t5_2qxih

4244114,0,t3_39hgxs,I came here to say the same thing about Kalligs Countenance. I recently made an assassin and I really wish I could use that headpiece or the Phantom one under my hood. I had to settle for the Agile Reconnaissance Mask at least until I have enough credits for the Revan one but the colors look completely off. I dyed the mask black and red and it shows up as black and red when I preview it and on my toons icon but in actual gameplay and in cutscenes the black part is bright yellow or sometimes blue and the red is more of a bright orange. I set all my graphic settings to high to see if it would make a difference but the mask looks exactly the same as it does on lower settings. Is this something wrong on my end or does the game just not render masks under hoods very well? ,swtor,cs40pf4,2,t5_2qxih

4303304,0,t3_3aaar3,I dunno dude.From here it sounds like youre starting off with a certain assumption that the only way for an MMO to succeed is for them to focus on endgame content to retain players and that players who dont actively participate in endgame OperationsPvP will inevitably drop out of the game and stop tossing money at the game.You never stop to explain that base assumption though. Why is that the only way for the game to generate revenue? Are there really no players who stick around purely for the story content or for Starfighter or for Strongholds or to mess around with cosmetics or for roleplaying or whatever? I mean Bioware certainly seems convinced that most players arent really interested endgame OperationsPvP and theyre the ones who have the relevant data to be able to tell how many players are actually doing a set class of content and how long players stick around. Why should I assume that Bioware doesnt know what theyre doing just from that?To me it seems like youve kind of fallen into the typical endgame player trap. You participate on the forums you post on the subreddit you hand around in guilds with endgame players and such and so you affirm to yourself that thats what players are really interested in. The problem with that is thats kind of a selfreinforcing notion only players who are particularly invested in certain portions of the game like Operations and PvP will go to those places and talk about it so youre going to get opinions about those overrepresented.As I understand it Bioware is staggering the release of KotFE over the course of months to continue to bait people into playing. If they handle that right it seems to me that there isnt really a reason why they cant make that into a valid model. Oh you certainly couldnt keep people playing for a month on the same chunk of story alone but Bioware hasnt said thats all theyre planning. Theyve mentioned gaining reputation with various factions to unlock companions for instance so they could pretty easily keep people engaged by messing around with the Alliance system in between presenting us with new story chunks. Again thats just an example of what they could do theres other things they could do to keep players engaged during downtime periods.But I mean I can always be wrong this is just my opinion after all. So... engage me why am I wrong? Why is endgame a more valid model for an MMO to focus on than content focused towards solo play?Because its an MMO doesnt really sway me as a rebuttal though I should mention theres nothing saying that the devs cant release new Ops and PvP maps alongside story content without making that a priority of theirs and theres still a lot of validity in the idea of treating the multiplayer portion of the game as more of a social thing than a gameplay thing. So I dunno just try for something else here.,swtor,csapgu5,7,t5_2qxih

4514910,0,t3_3cwunn,Swtor is WoW with Star Wars skins. Dont get me wrong I dont mean that as a bad thing but too many MMOs follow the same successful formula as WoW and it makes it so they cant shine somewhere for being different.This game has amazing voice acting and story telling. Would have been better if it was a single player strategy rpg like the first two.The combat is soso where its the same button mashing as any other mmo. Unlike Archeage which has an amazing combo system but is run by idiots. SWG was similar in that you didnt run up to an enemy and start your rotation. You had to take time to figure out the individual classes the person was made up from and use that to choose which HAM bar to attack. There was more strategy involved.People look back on SWG with rose colored glasses and remember it fondly. It was a broken game. But even with the broken stuff there was a lot to do and the promising halfworking content allowed you to see how great the game was going to be.SWG allowed you to live a life in the Star Wars universe. Your character contributed to the economy every person had a job to do and each job had its own purpose. Whereas in swtor I feel like my character is faceless even though theyre the hero of their own story. They have no sway on the outcome of anything in the universe.

4533682,0,t1_ct22dku,I agree and theyre all so boring.Most of them you never notice and have such a minor effect on your performance.Personally given how they changed the talent system I think it would be cool to have another tier of utilities that are unlocked by set pieces having maybe  choices per tier allowing you to alter your rotation to your preference.For example the  set ones can be straightforward and dull but on the correct abilities that they should be relatively equal something like X ability increases your alacrity for so long or this other one increases your crit by a certain amount for so long. The idea being that they would average out to the same DPS but would allow you to be burstier or speed up your rotation etc.And then youd have the big  piece bonuses which would all drastically alter your rotation in some way by reducing the cooldown of one ability when another is used or causing your next attack to deal twice as much damage or something but put on an ability that doesnt usually preceed your biggest attack that youd want it on thus forcing you to alter your rotation.I mean this will never happen but I think these sort of things would have to be on something the player could choose because forcing an altered rotation is not always a good thing it doesnt always feel nice to play that way.One thing I do know though is I would really like the set bonuses to be noticeable very much the  piece  it feels like it ought to be a big thing it should feel cool to have the  piece bonus going. Sure the  set might be a generic boring stat increase but the  piece should be unique and somewhat cool and the  piece should be something thats really satisfying.,swtor,ct23r6n,6,t5_2qxih

4558927,0,t1_ct57zo4,SourcegtEricMuscoStart at Level  in Fallen Empire | ..  AMgtHey folksgtI have seen a few questions around how the Start at Level  will work that comes with Fallen Empire. I want to start by saying that we will be releasing a blog when we get a bit closer to launch that describes all of the nitty gritty details and walks you through everything. But for now I wanted to cover a bit about how it works and address some of the things I have been seeing.gtAs a subscriber when you get Fallen Empire you will receive one free level  character. This character must be a new character you cannot boost an existing character up to . Beyond that first one which is included free with KOTFE you can purchase additional level  characters through the Cartel Market at any time. I know that this raised the question of character limits as well. In talking with the development team the plan is to increase the subscriber maximum character limit per server by  for the Fallen Empire launch. Not confirmation it will happen but it is definitely their goal!gtI know you still have many questions such as how this impacts Class story etc. We will be revealing all of these details down the line as we get closer to launch. gtThanks!gteric,swtor,ct59rft,2,t5_2qxih

They sometimes used more brute strength in battle.Red is the only color that is fully attributed to dark side users.The other colors are generally used by certain individuals in the history and did not fall strictly into the usual spectrum of light side  dark side.If you are asking how to make or acquire the crystals that is completely different in the game.  You can go the easy route and buy them off the GTN.  The ones from the cartel packs are  to certain stats and can be equipped at level .

He is supposed to be some master strategist who sees the future yet he doesnt see the potential pitfalls of freezing his most dangerous enemies?  What if he did it for a reason?  The PCs and some of the other implied victims are serious threats to his plans because they are not just powerful but capable leaders he doesnt eliminate them because he is going to need them around later.Why does he need them?  Because he has a vision of the future a vision of something coming from the Rishi Maze.,swtor,ctqmjs5,3,t5_2qxih

4871541,0,t1_cu8f62v,gt How do you do it right? Do you phase so that players who have reached a certain part of the story only see the galaxy a certain way? You have a problem there if those players want to go do old content or want to game with their friends who havent gotten that far yet. And can cause its own problems if youre not careful. In WoW killing Sylvannas one time our raid wiped because only half of us had done the Retaking Undercity event. In that event you kill one of Sylvannas head bodyguards and if you go back afterwards hes phased out.

This he decided included Revans heelface turn.And I agree with that. Star Wars likes to have big blackandwhite morality decisions on the large scale BioWare likes to blur it on the smaller scale but the movies dont really show that. Saying you can be evil but then if you repent and do good stuff well just pretend it never happened runs counter to what the movies set up. Would you expect Palpatines hair to grow back if one of his clones had decided to dedicate itself to the light?Frankly if the Clone Wars series had launched the scene with Revans ghost it would have felt very tackedon and Christianlike similar to the ending of Andersons The Little Mermaid. Im sure Lucas considered that as well he made a very strong effort to avoid mentioning religion in the movies and many other places because thats just not part of the setting.Im not saying Lucas is infallible. There are plenty of decisions of his I disagree with. But this is one that makes perfect sense to me in the setting and with the rest of the story.,swtor,cuar9u2,-3,t5_2qxih

Just make a toon with same name as your current toon name on the server yourre transferring to so itll prompt you to rename it. After that you can transfer the toon back. It costs cc per transfer so cc per rename. Added benefit is that this copies your legacy to other servers so you can use your goodies there if you ever roll a proper toon there.Note that you cant transfer the toon back before  hours have passed since the last transfer.

WildStar is a brighter more fantasy style that just looks prettier. SWTOR is a darker scifi style with a bit more detail but being darker makes it less noticable.

5189349,0,t3_3m2uh2,Hi always happy to see new players   Ill answer your questions in the order you gave them but let me first say that if your gf doesnt mind Id strongly suggest that you keep asking her questions as she would be the quickest source of information for the myriad of questions that youll keep coming up with. I mean come on shes your girlfriend and hopefully shes thrilled that she now gets to share her MMOgaming experience with you although it doesnt sound like the two of you are playing together?  A. Light or dark side choices have no bearing on gear that you can equip barring the measly lvl  relics that you can purchase from the LSDS vendors on the Fleet. What they will affect are the look of your character as your skin becomes increasingly corrupted by the DS of the force but you can turn this off in options so its not a big deal. Other than that your LSDS choices will affect the amount of affections points you losegain with your companions during conversations but this can be easily remedied by giving them gifts items you get through crew skillson the auction house aka GTN that can increase companion affection. Theres a guide to maximizing companion affection somewhere on the web so refer to that as you go along.  A. You should be using the Basic Commendations you earn by completing quests and that also drop randomly from defeated mobs to upgrade your gear as well as your companions with mods every  levels or so. Mods are the Armoring Mod and Enhancements pieces that go into Orangequalitycolor adaptive gear. You can purchase these mods using your basic commendations at the planetary commendation vendors found in the main cityhub of whatever planet youre on. Go into your map M and turn on vendors to locate them quickly by mousing over the various icons until you find the right one.  Also I dont know what you mean by dumping most of my kit could you elaborate more? Do you mean that youre using all your stims to heal yourself during combat? I hope you arent selling your gear once its damaged and buying a whole new set of gear each time as you can repair your gear at any vendor for a few credits something you should be doing after every  deaths or so. But honestly you shouldnt be dying that much and having that much trouble killing stuff especially with a companion. Make sure to pick Basic Commendations as the quest rewards unless theres a piece of gear that drops that you really like the look of but honestly even then you can almost always find it easily again later once youre higher level either on the GTN or at various vendors or on the CM Cartel Market.  Sorry for the longwinded answer but I feel like youre struggling when you shouldnt be and Id like to help you out. Also bear in mind that when . the expansion hits in  weeks you will no longer need to keep your companions gear upgraded as their combat capabilities will be determined by their affection will be changed to Influence level and your stats. Also companions will be able to fulfill all three roles healerDamage aka DPSTank with . so leveling will become much easier as you only have access to Vette atm who is a DPS comp.  Let me also add that you can purchase a healing companion Treek through the CM if youre desperate for a healing companion. She comes with a full set of gear has a really fun backstory and says some pretty hilarious stuff during combat so thats a plus! DA. Maxing out companion affection will NOT become useless in . it will actually become MORE useful as once again your companion will perform better in combat as their affectionInfluence level increases. Another major change to affectioninfluence in . is that you will be able to losegain companions based on their reactions to your decisions and their influence level. So as opposed to the current system where its impossible for a companion to ever leave you in . their reactions will be a lot a more realistic based on their personalities and it will be possible to permanently lose a companion or gain one based on the decisions that you make woo!  As for being fp or a sub kotfe will ONLY be accessibly to subs or to people who sub for at least a month at which point they will permanently gain access to kotfe and however many story chapters have been released at that point. So you could sub for a month in October and get permanent access to kotfe as well as the first  chapters. But in order to get access to the later chapters that will be released on a monthly schedule youll have to resub.A. Once again with the dumping of the kit Im really confused by what you mean when you say that lol please do reply with more clarification on this matter.  Anyways soloing will still be viable in kotfe thats actually how I play  of the time as I have been unguilded for a while now as you can always advertise in chat if you want to group for a H heroic  or queue in GF Group Finder for a heroic FP Flashpoint aka DungeonInstance or Operation aka manman Raid or queue for a WZ Warzone aka pvp Battleground as solo which I do all the time. You can queue for all of these through the various icons surrounding your minimap btw more options become available to you as you level.  However as this is a MMO playing with a group can be very enjoyable depending on what youre looking for and can also be a great resource especially if youre new at the game. Your guildies will be able to answer many if not all of your questions if theyre good nice helpful guildies that is and run you through the various content that you might otherwise miss by only playing solo.Hope this helps!,swtor,cvbi9t4,3,t5_2qxih

I can hold my own for a while and even if I lose Id be more likely to chalk it up to getting outplayed than any obvious or inherent class advantage. Fighting a SorcSage though? Forget it.Between Bubble mez Egress Barrier Force Slow instantcast selfheal and the numerous things theyd have available in their DPS specs? Yeah nah. Not happening. I cant catch you when I do get close to damage you I get ccd and Im stuck a majority of the time holding W than actually doing any type of rotation. Even the absolutely terrible SagesSorcs Ive gone against in PvP take too long to take out with help usually coming just because of their retarded number of tools available in every situation.SageSorc right now is the only class I legitimately feel cannot be beaten reliably in anything but a v  when competently played  barring Commandowho can probably give them a run for their money in a v but things dont happen in a vacuum anyway.,swtor,cvcn8ts,1,t5_2qxih

People who are new to it often treat healers as magic fix me buttons and will do absolutely nothing I.e. stand in damaging mechanics than berate the healer for it.If your new and dont want to put up with shtick people tend to be far more lenient on a new tank than new healers.All classes have their own challenges though to that I agree ,swtor,cvgiwrn,1,t5_2qxih

5254134,0,t3_3mylw6,Sith Assassin is one of my favorite classes to play and I hope you come to enjoy it as much as I do.  Good luck!  Others have covered the gear upgrades and I hope you listen to them.  But you do have several options here if youre going to be redoing your gear anyway.  First  Leveling in the tank spec with Khem Val is going to be tough  Khem is currently designed as a Tank companion so if hes in his Shadow Killer stance hell pull threat off of you wont do as much damage and his questreward gear is generally tankoptimized.  For the most part its going to be easier to get him a set of his own Adaptive gear and upgrade him when you upgrade your own gearfor quest rewards always take the Commendations so that you can do this.  Now regarding your options for setting up your spec and Khems stance    Switch your spec to DPS and use Khem as your tank in his Tanking stance.  This is how I primarily level when playing the AssassinShadow and its fairly easy Khems a pretty good tank when you keep him geared.    Stay in the Tank Spec and switch Khems stance to DPS adjust his gear to remove shield defense and absorb from the gear instead give him accuracy and power.  This is slightly less useful Khem will still have his tanking abilities like his Taunt and he will still use them unless you disable them.     Stay in the Tank Spec keep Khem in his Tank stance and trade threat back and forth.  Fights will take longer youll need to heal between pulls itll be more difficult overall.    Put yourself in a DPS spec and Khem in a DPS stance  Fights will go faster but neither of you will be able to take advantage of shields.  Youll be a lot more vulnerable to damage.  Personally I suggest you go with Option  or   and  were just included for the sake of being complete.  Running DPS with a DPS companion is viable but primarily for experienced and wellgeared players and running TankTank is pretty tedious.  Combat Suggestions  At some point either now or soon youll get a sleep ability.  You can use this from stealth while not in combat to put an enemy to sleep for  minute.  It doesnt work on droids.  If theres a group of normal guys and one Silver or Gold enemy put the sleep on him so that you can focus on the little guys and take on the big one by himself.  Any Areaofeffect attacks that you or Khem perform will wake up that enemy.Look over Khems abilities and turn off the ones that hit more than  enemy expand the companion skill window the ones with a green square will be used by default the ones with a black square are disabled and he wont use them unless you manually select that ability in combat.  Rightclick on the little square to turn them on or off.  You should also have two stuntype abilities the instant shock for  seconds and the longeractivation whirlwind for  seconds.  If there are a lot of enemies in a group set up your priority for them before you start combatstealth in put someone to sleep then if theres another toughlooking fellow whirlwind him before engaging the others.  Like your sleep ability the whirlwind will break if the enemy is damaged.  As a bonus you get an aoe knockback which can keep enemies off you and serve as a lastresort interrupt on some enemies.  If you ever play with a group avoid that skillpeople hate it.  Hold back the instant shock ability and your interrupt to break enemy focus while theyre channeling certain abilities.  You always want to try to interrupt healing skills and longchannel highdamage skills.  Heres some good news though  As you develop your skills youll find that you need to do this lessusing your AOE attacks is really helpful when fighting a large group of normal enemies and its vital for a tank to hold threat against that group so while using your short and long stuns is a handy little cheat while leveling you wont always be able to rely on it few groups have patience for that sort of thing.  But if youre playing by yourself you can run content at your own pacemeaning that you can slow down if needed to plan out how youll deal with each enemy in a pull.  ,swtor,cvjb7wn,3,t5_2qxih

5288301,0,t3_3nfsfo,All healer classes are fairly balanced and good right now. Marauders and Juggernauts do have good dps output and different utilities that make them viable and sometimes desired. But due to them being melee some groups may be reluctant of taking them. A skilled melee DD is treasured unless the group already has one of the same AC. That said for SM shouldnt be a problem unless you are of below average skill andor a big group already has too many melees. For challenging content it is really dependent on the groupguild you find and your skills. TLDR If you hone your skills and play them good you shouldnt have a problem with either one.P.S. I personally find the JuggVengeance and Immortal are the disciplines I play a little better as it allows for the secondary option of tanking but Maras have the very pleasant to play Carnage and the beast DPS and hard rotation of Annihilationhavent really played this myself.P.P.S.

Why should a Bounty Hunter care about killing a mad Sith Emperor? Well I wouldnt say because of duty or credits. Probably just because of the glory of the fight.

Second he is the only companion that for some reason is stuck on the ship during Star Fortresses.  We had an entire expansion of him talking to us through a headset.

5509685,0,t1_cwfu1zi,The character is far above average but not invurnerable which in my opinion is good. You are right about the fact that Jedi in movies and tv series take out larger groups of droids. But think of the fight in the arena at Geonosis. A lot of Jedi died because they are vurnerable. Even if your hero is the best of his generation he should not be able to deflect the bolts of  enemies firing at once or simply you know get hit and dont take damage. Consider this if you fight a droid on a starter planet and one later on. The droid on the starter planet would not hurt you but the one later on would. Does this mean that your superhero has forgotten how to use his powers when fighting the droid on a later planet? Is it not more consistent to show that yeah your hero defeats the droid with relative ease on the early planet and the late planet. The droid is not upgraded much cause levels for enemies are simply there to give you a gameplay challange. But from an in universe perspective your hero can now travel from one planet to another and fight enemies who know how to shoot. If you go from one planet where they cant even hit you and to a later one where you fight a thug who almost defeats you is that not immersion breaking? Not sure if my argument was presented in any good way here. Kinda wrote it in a hurry.,swtor,cwfwuz9,1,t5_2qxih

The two new operations were overly difficult in storymode by themselves and even without the difficulty BOTH were very bugged. The final fight of the solo part of the expansion was also incredibly bugged to the point where many could no complete it which really dampered a lot of peoples spirits about it.

I would have liked to have seen a bunch of red sabers like when Malgus sacked the Jedi temple mixed with a bunch of blue and green sabers.  Revan killing a bunch of them off would actually have served the purpose of making the survivors including Theron the wookie and Vizla seem more powerful by comparison.At least when I kill him in ToS I feel like I have some powerful allies but again Marr and Satele couldnt spare anyone to help really?!?!?.,swtor,cwggvqj,1,t5_2qxih

The worst thing to do is play a game that you do not enjoy. I personally enjoy being able to get through the story quickly. I have  characters all at least level  and Im sure there are others with many more. I do not want to waste unnecessary time dying to things and doing side quests not your quarry but same idea. These changes allow for you to focus on the story without outside distractions so you can quickly get to endgame. That is the point endgame.BioWare wants players especially new players to get to the KotFE content as quick as possible rightfully so since its amazing but still wants you to enjoy the class stories.

So while EVKP original level  hard mode drop the same gear as DFDP original level  they are not of the same difficulty.

My point about Strike was that since Strike is shown as activating instantly either Strike is computed differently from everything else i.e. latency doesnt figure into its delay since I certainly do not have  ms latency or latency does not figure into the delays at all. The second still seems feasible because the server could be sending the client what activations it received from the client and how much damage they did and when from the servers point of view.

This is more like KOTOR ......... and  that you can play with your buds! this is literally an exact quote they had at an E conference.The game wasnt advertised for its gameplay.  Instead you had these large expensive CGI trailers.  Heck most of the budget was spent on voice acting.  To add to that a reason why the game had such a large gap between content at launch was because Bioware thought players would take  months to complete the story.You can shout at people all you want but Biowares main strategy has always leaned on people expecting this to be KOTOR  or better.  Perhaps you should have given your friend a gift card instead.,swtor,cwpcy53,0,t5_2qxih

DPS is probably the simplest when youre new to the operation just because theres four of you and you can follow someone around. Generally if theres stuff to do in multiple directions follow the ops frame groups ie left side goes left when facing boss right side goes right. Remember to always watch your feet dont stand in stuff! Healing is also a good choice theres only the occasional enforced cleanse mechanics that arent pretty obvious. Theres only two of you but a good healer can generally solo any of the SM operations so long as its done cleanly anyways so its still not a big deal.Obviously if you want to prep skimming over the operation guides is always helpful see dulfy for instance.I found tactical flashpoints to be a bit hit or miss with ..

5716410,0,t1_cx5heap,Im honestly thinking Meleeing healers Lana Senja etc are worse esp on some higher quality mobs who spam pushbacks... as compared to a Healer equipped with a ranged weapon who stays away from the fray. T is ranged Qyzen is Melee. I have more problems with using Senja on my Warrior than Lokin on my Agent.

5717560,0,t1_cx5kyag,One of the odder decisions in SWtOR launch was to make the UI significantly less useful in giving information than contemporary WoW but still expecting high situational awareness while also giving lots of clues about what enemy players are doingabout to do as relatively relatively subtle visual effects.

Ill give you my theory though and Im sure others here will be able to correct me.I have an i. Its not an incredibly powerful version  .ghz with .ghz spike. That said the game isnt built for modern hardware and cant properly utilize  multiple cores. So I dont give my os or processor the chance to dance between just any of my  cores I tell it you get these  and thats it. Im the dad that takes away the adult remote and replaces it with something thats got two buttons on it so these little shits can only watch tellitubbies and rugrats.

5763711,0,t3_3u3eff,Mostly. Heres how it worksEach planet has  main quest lines Planetary and Class both will have purple triangle icons. You will have the same Planetary quests but your Class quests will be different. When you do the Planetary quests you both get full credit participate in dialogue together and all that jazz.When doing the Class quests the other person is along for the ride. When doing Smuggler quests for example the Jedi can follow and help with all quest objectives instances etc. They just wont participate in the dialogue and they wont get credit for the completed quest. But since youll be doing that for both players it balances back out.So in effect youll be doing three main quest lines on each planet Planetary Smuggler Jedi Knight or Consular?. Youll each get credit for two of them. Although all XP from killing mobs along the way is still given of course.If you choose to do any of the many side quests which I wouldnt bother with if I were you they would behave like Planetary quests Fully shared and simultaneous. ,swtor,cxbjiio,2,t5_2qxih

5815882,0,t3_3uv0kd,I personally would kill for Selkath Bothan or Kel Dor Rodians and Trandoshans are honorable mentions.   Honestly when it comes to adapting aliens to something playable I keep hearing that the voiceovers are the big sticking point as nobody wants to hear a looped track of gibberish for the entirety of their class story. Yes the majority of the races listed there have their own language or speak some variation of Huttese but I feel this can be circumvented by simply introducing a voice modulation along the lines of how helmets already function. The modulation could simply be explained away as a universal translator of sorts if you really want to go that far but the current voiceovers would otherwise remain as they are no further changes needed.   Now it would seem a fairly simple fix but how easily this could be done I honestly have no idea. Im not a developer but they would need to do something like this already if they were to ever go down the road of introducing playable Voss which they hinted at heavily back a year or so ago long before Togruta were apparently on the table.   As for the armor I have no problem with them utilizing a similar system to how the Togruta helmets function now if the species has weird hands or weird feet etc. just have those pieces hidden by default. Bioware indicated that the system they introduced for handling the Togruta would allow for easier implementation of species with I quote head things going on so why not just extend it to other parts of the body?   All in all while Im sure some people are perfectly fine with playing their humans or their Twileks I feel there are plenty of us that would jump at the chance to play one of the more iconic cantina species and with the game entering its fourth year with only two additional races added honestly its long overdue.tldr wtb more aliens. bioware pls.,swtor,cxi0j60,1,t5_2qxih

5826957,0,t3_3v0oy1,Im much the same resubbed a couple weeks ago after two years absence.The guides linked by the bot are good and helped me but heres a list of the stuff that threw me off pretty quickly. The skill tree is basically gone.  The new system has you pick your spec then it automatically progresses you barring one thing  Utility options.  I recommend playing around with your new abilities a little before locking in your Utility picks.  Im sure someone has The Only Possible Correct Build for your spec listed somewhere but if youre not a fan of that mentality the Utility options heavily modifyimprove a few of your core abilities.  So its worth finding out which ones you actually like and use and would benefit from focusing on.. PVP specific gear is all level  now and before  depends on bolster.  So if you had old CenturionChampionBattlemasterWar Hero gear its actually going to complain when you go into WZ that your Expertise is too low.  You want to ditch your old PVP gear and equip just standard gear for whatever your level is until you hit .. Once you do hit  its pretty simple. You just earn Warzone comms from WZ theres a daily and a weekly.  You buy your Basic gear with those comms then trade in basic pieces with more comms to get the advanced pieces.  You can also use the PVP Items vendor to move warzone comms from one character to another.  So for example if you have two you could do daily and weekly on both and pool all their comms to get one of them into Adv gear then switch.Took a little getting used to but I actually like all three of these changes now.Edit regarding skill tree I forgot to mention  do go see your class trainer.   They automatically give you a bunch of abilities but some they dont and you still have to get from trainer.  Dont forget.,swtor,cxjfu4u,1,t5_2qxih

That is just because of experience though subbed since early access.  I know where I am in OG huttball at all times as well.But to counter that...still have no idea which side grass and snow is in CW.  Probably because mid is usually the one that changes hands and if someone calls a side I just go to the side we control.  If we lose mid have both sides and someone calls grass I am completely lost.Kind of like Hypergate I think the most common call is ours and theirs even though that designation has no real world meaning.

5887089,0,t3_3vukhm,Quality post my GM Unfortunately this is just part of corporate industry in any sector be it video games or what not. Focus is on short term maximum profit and quarter earnings to make more than was invested in. The thing is the Expac has added little new repeatable content. Start fortress being sole exception. The other issue is the refusal to even talk to us about the changes like this. The funny part is soloers are in the same boat. Completed Chapter ? Grats! Now grind some Heroics from .. Pvpers get same stale maps. OWPvP has been dead since Vanilla since engine. RP isnt really supported like other games. Raiders are told to bend over. Casual dungeons havent been forthcoming. Crafting isnt engaging to those who like to craft. Story was breaddy good but at the same time my choices didnt matter and there is no uniqueness of story based on my gender or class past actions and what not like other stories. In every area Swtor is being outbeat by other games including its vaunted Story.

I also cant up and quit without losing the raid team I play with every weekday. At a minimum I lose my spot at worst I lose contact with them. I left Lotro  years ago for the same exact reasons Im now leaving SWTOR I tried to come back a few months ago and I didnt even know how my skills worked I had to retake the whole learning curve my friends there were all in different games and while I still kept in touch there was no getting the group back together. To think that you could just come back at any time and it would be as if you never left its a bogus claim.The carrot is not the motivator the motivator is the difficulty which granted it is still there. Except in order to get the carrot I need To effectively meet that difficulty Im being forced to eat at the kids table. Not only that I already built a carrot armor and without further notice for the third time in a row they nerfed my main toon so bad that Im gonna need to go to a different toon to even attempt nightmare. if they have applied it in any way to meet the guidelines that they themselves set. Then give me examples of when they have implemented PTS feedback outside of the ones I provided. Or listened to the complaints that are issued here and the forums after every patch.

5919648,0,t3_3wdskx,Dont abandon the MMO group content model. Seriously horrible idea. But If you are going to abandon the MMO model go full swing. Make it so that is worth it for me to pay month I.e let it not be me paying full Imax price for a hr movie. I know nothing about programming so all of this may be capped by the game engine or something. Make solo play difficultI.e lower companion effectiveness in story phase only make enemies less of an annoyance while you get to the next cutscene and more of a real fight. Give real mechanic to boss fights think OPS fights without OPS health damage. Make the maps less linear in story missions  different ways to finish the same objective. Choices actually need to matter and not just for slightly different conversations. Make so that certain choices have a least  different story outcomes it would be an interesting way to get back to the diverging storylines of launch. The key here is replayability if we cant have new end game players need to be entertained somehow until next patch. Then Id retool conquest. You already took a big step by having level synch planets. Make conquest of a planet involve more in planet activities for the planet you are actually conquering. Get less points for stuff that can be done anywhere crafting random PVP and random GSF and more for in planet activities. Get dailes that only show up while your guild is conquering the planet. Special PVP areas with objectives only available when your guild is conquering the planet. Make so that specific outpost obtained either through PVP or pve missions which the guilds lose after a few hours of ownership in planet give temporary buff. Kill special mobs or group of mobs only available if you are conquering the planet. In other words if you guild is attempting to conquer a planet that week that planet is your home base thats where most of your playing time is going otherwise you wont get it. Make it an actual in planet competition not a two way race between two big guilds just spamming the craft button. And ffs give a real incentive to winning a planet aside from a crappy title. ,swtor,cxvligs,0,t5_2qxih

5921302,0,t3_3wdskx,From the beginning of the game I would have engine permitting Made the worlds larger but with more repeated features then allowed actual vehicles and reasonable speeds. the factions would be chosen later in the game not at the start.  There would be animation changes for abilities if you were a force user and changed allignment so there would be mirrors but not quite the same. only two classes  force users and nonforce users.  There would be different categories of abilities to choose from in those fields allowing you to become a hybrids or specialized.  So a melee healer could be a thing as much as a ranged caster or hybrid forcemelee fighter and stealth would exist as a possibility within both trees and not lock you into darth maul sabers if you chose. Armor would work closer to ESOs system but obviously I didnt know about that system then. The vehicles and large maps would actually matter in open world PVP.  You would have different objectives and strategies to use on each planet and different vehicles.  I dont think I would make a flight sim perse... walkers would function not unlike controlling a Treant in WoW. The story would have been more condensed and shorter but side quests would have been more important to your personal roleplaying and would help shape you into your class fantasy as a smuggler bounty hunter ect.  Specializing in certain fields such as smuggling or being a trooper would benefit you more than being a hybrid of a trooper and smuggler.  Think like guilds in Skyrim.  You would gain additional options in the main story based on your direction in side quests and such. There would be story raidsdungeons for sure like the current system with a soloable option.  I would also want repeatable randomized content like LOTROs skirmishes.  These have a longer lifespan than dungeons in my experience.edit I would also have more horizontal and less vertical progression.  Yes gearing and levels would be there but I think the leveling process kills realistic expectations of characters hence the current level synch system so it would be reduced.  This would allow for more content to be endgame content without cheating and reducing stats for old zones.phew hopefully thats all I got,swtor,cxvtbfq,2,t5_2qxih

The reasonable position to take however is the one that is inclusive of everyone players who want to spacebar and dont get to still get to complete the content players that dont want to spacebar and get kicked for it dont get to complete the content that is not an equivalent result for each of these parties.Honestly this is not that hard to understand its simply not looking at it from a selfish perspective.  As it stands you have no reason to complain currently players who want to complete FPs are in the majority and have all the power to votekick who they please.

EDIT the chance of Revan being used now that Kylo Ren looks a lot like him is probably very slim which is disappointing. As a Force user and a character Revan would have been as compelling a character to audiences as Vader was in the original trilogy when the Force Sith and Dark side were more mysticalmysterious.

6064392,0,t3_3ylopc,Both the bolster system and the any class goes system have been pretty awful for me with the queue.The bolster system does more harm than good when youve got level  characters running into battles in level  dungeons they may have a higher health pool but theyve got a third of the abilities a max level character would have including all their CC the better heals and any threat generating moves for tanks. The any class goes system isnt quite as bad most FPs are certainly doable with  DPS when properly coordinated but therein lies the issue  of the random pugs will mindlessly throw themselves face first at every mob and will only ever stop blindly running forward to insult everyone else when they get their face ripped off by the trash mobs. At least with the Holy Trinity Setup most players understand their role before going in so even an uncoordinated group can pull through the trash up to the boss.Lastly from a story perspective the fact you have access to every dungeon in the game from level  onwards means you can go from busting minor criminals on Courescant to freeing Revan from a Sith prison in minutes which is an easy way to take you out of any immersion you might have built I know a lot of people dont play MMOs for their story but its still a personal gripe for me.One tip I would give is to take another page from Warcraft. When they introduced their PUG raids they put an in game source that players could read that detailed the mechanics of every boss in the latest raidsdungeons one simple sentence Hide from the cyborgs eye lasers. could save thousands of wipes.,swtor,cyej95v,30,t5_2qxih

Over September players were playing SWTOR . more often in November. Most PC games saw a decrease in November. The exceptions being Fallout  CoD Black Ops III and some of Blizzards titles after Blizzcon. Starcraft more than quadrupled its playing time after the recent expansion. With the exception of WoW MMOs tend to be hit worse than other PC games in November. FFXIV and Guild Wars  both saw playtime decreases GW saw a  decrease after only an  increase the month before. WoW saw about a  increase in playtime due in part to Blizzcon.gtFallout  and Call of Duty Black Ops III joined the ranks of the top  and StarCraft II rocketed back onto the chart. Overall monthly play time of all PC games was down . versus October...gtARK Survival Evolved Guild Wars  and Star Wars The Old Republic decreased by . . and . respectively.Trends of Google searches for the nonWoW MMOs mentioned on Raptrs top  games list over the past  days In November SWTOR started out strong the first  weekends of November for Google searches then died down back to about slightlyabovenormal levels. During all that time GW and FFXIV had more Google searches on them than SWTOR. However if you look ahead to December you see a huge increase in the number of searches for SWTOR pushing it past GW and FFXIV for the first time since FFXIV launched in .EDIT Looks like FFXIV and GW were always higher than SWTOR in Google searches since FFXIV launched.,swtor,cyf8bq0,6,t5_2qxih
6069915,0,t3_3yopwl,Great question! We like wellinformed people running raids so thank you for asking. Here are my thoughtsYour current gear doesnt matter as SM Ops bolster your stats. Your rotation however DOES matter. Unless youre using a parser to determine your own efficient rotation you should look at guides people have put online in order to maximize your DPS output. This is more important as you get into Ops and the harder difficulties where there are what we call DPS checks tight windows of time when enough damage must be done before a boss enrages and quickly wipes the raid party. Stims for your stats should always be used and adrenals help for burst DPS.To prepare for HM Ops you need to do these things and gear up with all the  gear you will earn from HM FPs or SM Ops particularly the piece set bonus the Ops drop as there is not a bolster at the higher difficulties. You can also use data crystals to purchase  gear as you accrue them though note this gears stats will differ from the lootdropped ones. Augment all your equipment but be sure you have whatever cool looking armor you want first before dropping that kind of money on the visual pieces and look at online guides for optimal stat distributions to aim for. This stat management goes hand in hand with the idea of maximizing your DPS with an ideal rotation.Aside from that it is essential that you know the mechanics of the operation you are going to play which increase in complexity as the difficulty increases. Look for guides online. I usually spend at least an hour studying up on the mechanics on HM Ops to make sure I know what Im doing or am able to provide a brief reminder to other players that arent sure before each encounter. Listen to advice from experienced players and youll learn as you play as well.If you have any other specific questions Id be happy to help answer them.,swtor,cyf96hp,2,t5_2qxih

6128947,0,t1_cym6766,gt You created a situation that forced players to do homework in order to be a part of your community  now you lament not being treated for that behavior. No sympathy whatsoever.This is absolute BS. Progression raiding isnt something you do casually. You have to do your homework in knowing the mechanics and knowing how to play your class not just going into it like i think I will do a hard mode raid. those people are unaffected by this. The people that are affected are the ones that cant enjoy the game that they love because of the developers complete dismissal of your existence. They can put . of all their efforts and resources into story and the casual player. All that the reasonable people ask for is that . of effort and attention be given to those who enjoy being a part of a team and progressing through new content. If you were playing the game for the star wars and biowares story telling and they only released a new story chapter every  months how would you feel? Its actually depressing that you are even implying that the HM raiding community is the cause for lack of content. Ive taught hundreds of people raid mechanics through my guild I guess I wasnt doing enough for the community. There is a reason why guilds exist to teach mechanics and get people geared. Not going to PUG a group on fleet without any idea how to do mechanics or equivalent gear.,swtor,cymaq5n,3,t5_2qxih

6133483,0,t1_cymh6fm,Game Experience  The story is the same the content is the same.  Quest rewards are different FP and Preferred cannot take lockboxes from quests so gearing can be more difficult.  It used to be that XP was restricted for FPPreferred but I think they changed it so that anyone can level using the priority missions purple icons and keep up with the content.  Subbing Benefits  As mentioned above FP and Preferred players cannot accept lockboxes as quest rewards.  Subscribers get full access to the two previous paid expansions Rise of the Hutt Cartel and Shadow of Revan.  They also get access to the Knights of the Fallen Empire content either as it comes out or up to the point that the sub ends.  Theres actually a whole lot of things to cover so check the Wiki for further details.  Races  Subbing does unlock racesa pure FP player can only use Zabrak Human or Cyborg races unless they buy an Unlock.  However there are still classrace restrictions for subscribers these can be negated by buying unlocks or through the Legacy system by raising a character of a particular race to level .  Cathar and Togruta both require an unlock purchase.  Content Worth It?  This really depends on how much value you place on the restricted aspects of the game.  The core character stories from  are pretty solid the stuff that comes after is fun but less personalized to your class.  The common recommendation is to get a day to unlock the content and see if you like the difference it makes.  PVP amp Raiding  The PVP servers frequently have a population issue.  The instanced PVP Warzones has a community on every server.  Openworld PVP is rare on the nonPVP servers.  Raiding can be done through groupfinder.  Community  Like any place on the internet there are going to be nice people and there are going to be jerks.  Overall I like the SWTOR community especially here in this subreddit.  When dealing with people in group content its usually best to say up front if youre new if you want to watch the cutscenes and if you need to know how a boss fight works.  There are impatient ninnies wholl kick you for not being a magic knowitall but there are also fun people wholl spend  minutes explaining fights and helping you out.  In my experience the attitude you bring to the table is reflected back at you most of the time.  Be positive encounter positive people be negative and you see a lot of jerks.  There are exceptions but well some people are just beyond help!  ,swtor,cymt9mc,1,t5_2qxih
6133606,0,t1_cyms7fc,Youre telling me youve started raiding since level ... so launch?  Or just recently?  You never mentioned at what level... ie group finder hard mode NiM.  And if you have raided since launch I find it hard to believe you can simply overlook BHsTroopers in general since last tier was all about the BHTrooper and not a whole lot has changed in that regard.  The current iteration of end game raiding has brought the difficulty ceiling way down for most HMs again there are exceptions like Master Blaster Cora Styrak and mechanically Revan to the point where you can pretty much bring any class and be OK.Sorc heals are really strong right now.  I would put ops on par with mercs and it really comes down to personal choice and the healer behind the characters.  In fights where everyone can remain grouped up like Malaphar ops shine.  The extra tricks Mercs have come in handy though... most notably Hydraulics.If youre looking at raw parsing capability Pyro PTs parse less than IO Merc.  In an ops setting I would bet most PTs run Adv Prototype since its hard to keep a pure sustained push on bosses.  In an Ops setting despite the difference in raw parsing power running Arsenal makes more sense than IO right now.  In . IO was super strong and you only ran Arsenal for bursty fights Lurker Commanders for example.  PTs are still really strong in an ops setting.As far as Arsenal mercs surviviability... speaking strictly ranged classes here they have great survivability better than the other ranged classes for sure.  Heavy armor and their utilities and cooldowns make them very mobile and durable.  In fights like HM SS if you avoid the crap on the ground which you should a merc can have very little dtps throughout the entire fight just from the passive mitigation alone.  Recent changes to Sorc utilities have helped with their mitigation though which is good.,swtor,cymtrqf,3,t5_2qxih

Even as strong as Mace is its really odd to think that  Jedi Masters died in the first  seconds and he managed to last in a sustained fight. Now of course there are limitations to a fight with actual actors but in the Clone Wars where Palpatine fights Darth Maul and Savage Oppress we see the full range of exactly what he can do in combat against experienced Dark Side users.spoiler I dont think theres any way Windu would have won if Palpatine was giving his .,swtor,cyowmpo,1,t5_2qxih

6166812,0,t1_cyplju9,Maybe not. Still Bioware made me at least somewhat curious with previous trailers. Like the Sacrifice trailer. This one seems pretty underwhelming. Maybe thats because of the cut or the cinematography in it. Maybe its the fact that Kaliyo is a really blunt and uninteresting character. Or maybe its because we had to wait almost three and a half months October the th  February th for this chapter and its not really introducing an all fan favorite character. It seems as if that trailer is off. Maybe I would be more excited if it was a bit faster or if NadiaVetteRisha were in it. But this trailer seems very...static. Thats probably the word Id use.Ill also repeat what I said before I am a story person first and foremost.

6198707,0,t1_cyu4wmf,In that case Id guess that your mission tracker is emptywhen youre next in game press L which brings up your mission log. Youll see which missions are the main ones again highlighted in purple. If there isnt one you somehow dropped the mission or youre not supposed to be in the fleet yet. I once accidentally clicked my Fleet Pass sending me there long before I was supposed to go there. Because my main mission was still on Hutta I didnt have any mission trackers showing on the Fleet map. Either way if you know where youre supposed to go bring up the map and highlight the various symbols you see. One of them will be the shuttle you needshuttles I think are generally in the cardinal points on the wheel of the map North South etc. I grant that its not as intuitive as it could be but sometimes thats par for the course in MMOs.

There are two kinds of group content flashpoints dungeons in other games and operations raids in other games. Flashpoints with story elements have solo modes. Youll miss out on some story bits from the operations but at this point in the games life theyre side stories.

Id strongly recommend you DPS spec for class missions and then respec as bodyguard for FPsWZs. Theres literally no advantage to being heal spec anymore because your companions can do it all for you. With that said bodyguard merc is easily my favorite class in the game. Its really underplayed but if you play it right youre hellishly hard to take down with heals  heavy armor.

You do not like the direction the game is going and so have decided it will fail if it does not remain a traditionalstyle MMO. At the end of the day Bioware gets to decide what they want to do with the license they are paying for. You get to decide how you are going to spend your money. That is really all there is to it. Bioware is not going to change its plans unless the current direction makes them less money then the previous direction. You can either enjoy the game asis or leave. We all get the same choice but all the singular complaining and speculative doomsinging will not change anything. It is all about the dollars.

6451254,0,t1_czmkimj,Their income was reported to have come from subs buying stuff from the CM but that data is old. Even though it keeps getting rehashed in every argument every so often. I doubt its changed though since the new expansion brought up sub numbers to an all time high since FPs launch and then the CM fluff is of course waved in front of the players all the time so theres that. Preferred players is a case thats not talked about often enough though. Its always either subs or FP which is its own entity compared to the other . Preffered is in a rather fine place but the credit limit is terrible this late in the games cycle isnt as encouraging to sub as people who often have been subs since launch claim and could use a few tweaks because if anything retaining an actual player population should be BWs focus once the Star Wars fever is gone until the next movie. FP.. Its supposed to be a demo. You can see   class stories in their entirety. Sure youre handicapped the entire way through after level ? but you can do it and I did twice in a month when FP launched which had a HORRIBLE progression rate compared to now.

6484808,0,t1_czpyvd2,I very very much doubt that popular by default was even kinda slightly intended to be AKA I cant like this because others do. That saber was the main weapon of a major antagonist of a major movie and people like it and its known that people like it and its being added to the shop because of that. Because its absolutely known that people like the saber and will want it because they like it its popular by default.The observations arent that far off they added an item that they knew people would want into an RNG pack in the hopes that people would spend money on it to get the item theyll wantlike  and people will spend money because they like it  which is fine. Doesnt change the fact that that is the reason theyre doing it and there was no implication at all that people were sheep or that people couldnt like what they want to  the point was that its a shitty way for them to try and sell the RNG packs.

All the running around was a bit tedious you did the same thing too many times IMO and even with a very low influence companion I could afk during the fights if I wanted.  The back  of the chapter was a bit better.

6609208,0,t1_d02wpwv,I can score and be ready to pick up the ball with most classes in queshball. It isnt a teleport but without being slowed you can just run to it. The person who scores actually has a big advantage here because they know exactly when they score and can be the first person moving to the spawn point. I think what may be happening here is the position your client thinks the character is and where they really are becomes out of sync and the game corrects it in a visually jerky way. This is supper annoying and happens to me all the time. I think they fell off the ramp but they are really still on it and about to score.  The stealth thing which I believe is caused by similar serverclient sync issues is most apparent in voidstar and when I am on my stealth classes I use it to my advantage. However I have never seen a person be able to complete a cap stealthed. The trick just seems to keep them invisible for a few moments longer and therefor with less time for someone to notice. You also have to exit stealth and cap immediately you cant cap from stealth.  PS OP I think I may have been in the match today and I do not remember any remarkable caps.

6639684,0,t3_46kz6m,Swtor is Legends. But in generalnot just in reference to tor the people in control of what is is canon have pointed out it is stupid to ignore that people have already fleshed out a bunch of the universe. They arent looking to recent the wheel just give it a consistent design. So moving forward they will likely pull a stuff from Legends material  la carte. So if there is already a decent explanation for something they will pull that in but that doesnt mean all the things surrounding it when in or a lot of the detail has been lost to history. gtthe latest announcement of Revan being one of the next Black Series figures.Thats actually because he was voted in.

6643183,0,t1_d06eobd,The kind of fight knowledge that is required differs between roles.  DPS dont have to know when the boss will attack a tank with a big hit nor do they have to know about any stacking debuffs that require a tank swap.  Further still they dont have to know where the boss has to be kited in order to avoid buffs on the boss or debuffsdamage on the raid.  Tanking is easy in this game because all of the content is old and there are plenty of guides out there telling you exactly what to do in a fight.  Tanking is at its most challenging and is most enjoyable when you have new content and you must figure out the mechanics for yourself.  Couple this with being part of a competitive raid scene.  Tanks will be the cause of the vast majority of wipes in new encounters.  They are under the most pressure to learn the fight as quickly as possible if the group is competing for server or world first.  Being able to do that while being able to adapt your advanced class to the fight would involving a pretty high skill ceiling in my opinion.,swtor,d06gnwa,1,t5_2qxih

Every single raid weve brought in PUGs weve tried to recruit them. Some have joined only to not show up for another raid or to simply stop logging in altogether within a short period.Do you ask your self why? For you its m or nothing. Also swearing all the time through mumble is not too welcoming. Telling your raid team they dont have the skills to parse as high as your top dps IO mercenary star is definitely the worst of them all.

6869747,0,t1_d0uuhzi,gtbig part of all Season  staff was complete for sure but they keep working on the rest if all were done by now packed and ready they wouldnt have any problems at all wouldnt delay that poor EC  times...they still keep working on it and Im pretty sure the core staff is working on season  content thats the reason theyre so slow with fixing bugs and again that poor EC not because of maintenance mode and milking leaving customers dry.Obviously they are working on some details.  That goes without saying.  But the core staff and the rest of them regardless of what they are working on are too few.  But based on your own words how would you know this...gtthey keep on releasing new chapter first week of month thats a time limit and they stay with it  times already and they didnt change release date of ch . Theyre cutting part of content thats not ready but respect shedule of chapter releases.Think bigger picture not just the last two months.gtIve heard that shit since first month after release when people started to ask for more endgame content.If you actually heard that in the first few months then they were prophets.  But the complaints from launch and the complaints today a far different.  Sure to the average Fanboy they just sound like hate regardless but there is a big difference and the complaints are coming from a far different group of the player base.  I would not exactly call KoTFE huge.I think you are misunderstanding what people mean by maintenance mode.  Or maybe you have your own idea of what it means but you are not talking about the same things as others.  gtIs it some kind of masochistic disorder? to imagine that everything is bad and game is constantly  years already dying but still keep playing it?Why play?  This goes back to the lack of understanding between complaints at launch and complaints today.  You seem to have difficulty understanding why some would complain about a game they play.  Your attitude appears to be less about understanding and more about just not wanting to hear complaints regardless.gtBesides you any of us know nothing about how many people work there and what theyre doing nowInteresting that you say this yet your entire point here is based on your own speculation.  You seem to be saying the complaints are unfounded and based solely on speculation and then go on to speculate yourself that everything is fine with the game. gtAnd the last one....lack of content especially when people insist on the only content that THEY find interesting and ignore other content ingame isnt a maintenance mode. Theme park MMOs ALWAYS lack content no matter what. Players consume it x  x x times faster then its being created nothing new here.People can only play the content that interest them.  To suggest that people should play content for which they hold no interests is not a solution for no new or little content.  But you just contradicted yourself again.  You suggest there is not lack of content and then state all theme park MMOs lack content.  So if they all lack content then SWTOR is lacking content.  But lacking content in the broader sense of all MMOs is not about maintenance mode.  It is the content that is and is not provided for this game that suggest a type of maintenance mode.If you want a better understanding of what my discussion is all about I can help you understand but if you are only interested hearing nice things about the game I cannot help you.,swtor,d0uzwi2,-1,t5_2qxih

6888749,1,t3_4a3rcb,Ive never seen someone say leave if youre new to the game and I generally like queing for lowbies and midbies rather than max level PvP.I understand the frustration though of why people act the way they do its because everyone who has been around and stuck around is tired of all the new casuals that came along with the release of the new movie so everyone is or was on the star wars hype and that and the people who came to play KOTFE from advertisements.I honestly dislike the way the game is right now too many new players that dont know what they are doing at all and Ive had new players shit on me and wont even take advice or help or even want to learn and Ive played since . Just as an example I qued up for PvP and had this marauder using a single saber shit like that irks me..

That should solve the gameplay issue.Other than that they are all good stories I wouldnt start with agent as that has callbacks to several other stories and gives a better experience when youve seen more of the game.  Id also wouldnt start with bounty hunter for the full imperial playthrough as the character is more of an outsider in the story than the other three similar to smuggler.  A good story but if you are only doing the full side mission imp side once it is more appropriate on a Sith or agent than the BH IMO.,swtor,d0xi0sp,3,t5_2qxih

6995886,0,t1_d199444,RNG to some degree is inherent in almost all forms of reallife gambling. The only difference I believe is when player skill can actually come into play.A person can know quite a bit about poker but that doesnt mean that random odds arent going to screw them over and a person might be adept at playing real life slots doesnt mean that those same slots dont have odds that are set against them and for the most part as random as they are programmed to be. What Im getting at is that youre just as much gambling on those ingame slot machine as you are on a regular slot machine just that you dont run the risk of losing your actual real life dollars on the ingame one. Since the ESRB has a rating for simulated gambling its entirely possible that they dont want that slapped on the rating though its possible that it wouldnt dependent on whether or not if they would have to reclassify the game.

The survey from November wasnt for HKthemed sub rewards it was likely to determine the stuff we get for Season . Theyve also had a job posting up within the last couple of weeks for a position that will most likely determine Season s and future promotions based on user feedback and metrics.Whether we like these sub reward assets or not I am mostly ambivalent on the matter though some of the individual items are okay they were designed and decided upon quite some time ago and the marketing team has historically been obstinate with its decisions. That may change with the new employee or it may not but the fact remains and downvoting doesnt make it any less true that HK rewards were already set in stone.Edit Id also argue that Pokemon and Pandas isnt so bad aslove them hate them or dont care either waytheres actual content with Pandas and WoWs take on Pokemon utilized actual game mechanics whereas WoWstagram and Let me take a selfie... was considered content that justified a summer point release. If were going to make comparisons here WoWstagram is worse than HKthemed subscriber rewards which is not content just a thankyou to subscribers.,swtor,d1gzggl,3,t5_2qxih

7074068,0,t1_d1hwt59,I started playing ESO a few months ago and could barely get into it. Its pretty dry as far as MMOs go. It isnt even the same kind of MMO as SWTOR either thats like comparing apples to oranges.I dont particularly enjoy the style of MMO ESO is trying to be which I said at the end of my post. It just strays too far into Guild Wars territory for me. Lots of flash little substance or thought involved.I hardly consider it an MMO as opposed to a glorified single player game that you can just play with other people until you get to cap. When I play an MMO I want to actually need to interact with others to do dungeons and to have defined roles within a group. Not having a Templar that just happens to be using the healing spec and a Dragon Knight with the tanking spec but no one actually needing responsibility to do their role.And yes that is the inherent problem with the UI. Its clearly a console port. The UI is ridiculously unintuitive to use on a PC without modifications.,swtor,d1i7j7z,1,t5_2qxih

7115208,0,t3_4d0m8t,The problem with speeder design is that theyre a direct clone of mounts from WoW but it made sense for them to jump since theyre animals. I admit it looked hilariously stupid AF the first time I jumped on hovering speeders they dont even bother to add an animation. Get used to it thats about the general quality level of this game. So much potential always falls short in annoyingly stupid ways due to lack of strong design lead.The abilities used to come slower but leveling was made much faster. Many also had to be manually unlocked in a talent tree so it was a bit more involved for the player to pick them and the game used to offer an actual challenge of sorts meaning that the abilities you used were important. Now days just use whatever you like the look of I guess it barely matters. I honestly havent been able to stand playing except for the new story content since they changed it its just mindnumbingly grindy now no actual input from the player needed or any mastery or progression involved combat is just a time gate between story. The chapter bosses of each story used to be a significant achievement but now... hah.The world being dead is a problem theyve always had and theyve never implemented any suggestions to fix it.

7158245,0,t1_d1rrqy4,In theory I agree with you but this worked for me somehow. Seeing a coldfury kinda Sith meet with irondetermination Jedi was a very interesting dynamic. My character has always been cast as dark side but he makes those choices with no emotion. Seeing light and dark as circular instead of linear is powerful in my opinion. Even if you want to argue that its dead wrong. But Im undoubtedly biased in that regard because the characters of mine that have stayed compelling across several years of play and various levels of activity are without exception the ones who live in the blurry regions.

They would have to be rebuilt from scratch when the guild reforms on the new server.  Many guilds worked for months to first buy their ship and then collect the Encryptions and Frameworks to unlock additional rooms.  For some people its better to leave and keep that achievement intact than give it up and start over again.    While its possible to sell the guild itself and thus have some starting funds on the new server theyd never get the full cost of their investment back.  ,swtor,d2bm88h,7,t5_2qxih

Leveling questing and normal flashpoints have been utterly guttered in particular. Its now just a mind numbing slog to cap albeit a faster one.Class balance is disappointing as hell. Its not even close when it comes to healing these days. Run Sorcerers or get shit on. The gap is much larger than it was when I left the game three years ago.The cash shop has meant weve stopped seeing new gear introduced in any meaningful numbers. Some sets have even been phased out only to reappear on the cartel market in some form. The whole thing is just really tacky.Anyway I could go on for quite awhile. SWTOR has far more problems than just the slow development of endgame content. While Im pretty content with the game I cant say its really any better than I left it.

I regularly play an alt conclementscapper in PvP and I would gladly trade some the trollish gameplay style for the ability to be a legit DPS.  RuffianLethality needs a serious buff to Cull and perhaps shorten the duration of the dots to make them hit harder. In PvP I play RuffianLethality as sort of skank healer Its not usual for me to get mil in damage and mil in healing in the same match.

With the hyperinflation on cartel goods from both exploits and easier credit generation in general people would rather sell stuff like renames and discounted stuff postsale to get more credits out of their coins. You cant sell escrow transfers for more than k which limits you to .k per CC using the most efficient one to sell k transfers. Im getting k per CC right now from other stuff. I used to sell escrow transfers all the time but until they make it worthwhile again Im out.,swtor,d318nb0,1,t5_2qxih

7628599,0,t3_4jt3zv,What. Its literary one of the easiest fights in the game.Its literary so easy you start it and afk until the balls pop up at which point you rescue the NPCs and then you can go afk again and make a cup of tea or whatever.What you missed is defeating Revan find out that the Emperor is revived despite your attempts to stop his revival.Then you go to Ziost where hes masspossessed everyone and having them kill each other since he gains power from their deaths which culminates in him doing a ritual that completely consumes every living thing on Ziost.All in all a few nice cutscenes a lot of lore and some chances either to smack talk LanaTheron or support and connect deeper with LanaTheron.Nothing that should actually effect your KotFE playthrough.,swtor,d39bwxw,11,t5_2qxih

7669958,0,t3_4kcj0r,Liked  Kira I found her romance to be pretty sweet actually and her story the fact that she is a child of the emperor and her personal questss and the fact that you have to hide it is pretty interesting and that she is very involved in the story especially in chapter  makes for a great romance. Risha this one had great banter even before she becomes a companion and it reminds me of Hans relationship with Leia especially because she is a princess too.s It is also quite interesting that you have her with you for a long time before she becomes a companion. Elara probably my favorite thing about the Republic Trooper story didnt like it that much at all P but her romance is really sweet and the relationship seemed very well paced and developed. Vette I love the warrior story and I have done it quite a few times as DS LS and neutral and I have done her romance quite a few times as well. I love her personality and her personal quests were all awesome. Lana because she is the most well developed romance after the main stories and her pragmatic ways are pretty interesting. She and Marr are probably the most interesting Sith other than Jadus.Bonus I wish Watcher  was developed more she was really interesting.Least favorites Nadias was too short and underedeveloped. Ashara didnt quite fit with my DS Inquisitor P Raina and Kaliyo because Raina had that part where she kills her fathers and Kaliyo because she seemed kinda crazy and I didnt like the part where we hunt down her exess. I am kinda glad the IA had so many romance options just on the planets because I didnt quite like his companion romances.Didnt do any male companions romance but I like Torians personality and dislike Quinn in general.,swtor,d3e13cn,2,t5_2qxih
7670401,0,t3_4kcn7v,The class stories companions animationsvariety in class trees every aspect of the sound voices music combat ambient background effects  this is one of the best sounding products Ive come across. Getting the feel of Star Wars completely right. The vanilla launch completely had an Original Trilogy vibe done right throughout the game but kept it in the Old Republic era. Though KotFE purposefully parallels many events in Ep.  it doesnt feel like Star Wars in several important ways.The writing in general. It was so comprehensively done putting together all the classes planetary arcs side quests companion conversations FPs random NPCs general faction lore etc. It took a while to piece the entire story together if you cared to follow it carefully. Im not sure well see a Star Wars game again with such depth to it. The many FPs and initial WZs were made with great care and detail.It would take too long to continue and end up being way too long a post. SWTOR got a lot more right than it did wrong and to this day I dont think it was given a fair chance by many of its initial players. Perhaps BW simply overestimated how many people were actually interested in the KOTOROld Republic era. If all it would have taken for more of the original MMOheavy crowd to stick around was a group finder and several more Operations thats just really sad given how much went into making this product. ,swtor,d3e2whj,3,t5_2qxih

7791381,0,t1_d3riqz4,Games like Destiny and the Division are short term games and are written as such. Already the Division has died off. The only reason Destiny is still kicking is because they have pushed out a few new raids and other endgame content. But each instance of Destiny is not written to hold a crowd for as many years as SWTOR or other MMOs because Destiny  and the rest of the new games they have to develop will be coming out. The whole thing with an MMO is that people join in for the story but stay for the endgame. If the endgame is non existent the Division or untouched SWTOR people start losing interest and cancel their subscriptions meaning the publisher has less money to try to win players back.And I think you were entirely missing my point. I wasnt saying Bioware needs to focus exclusively on raids or that the story content they are currently pushing is crappy. What im saying is that the story is helping them revitalize their player base with a whole bunch of new players but they need to hold those players if they want to keep the game running. ,swtor,d3rt42h,2,t5_2qxih

7869582,0,t1_d40lvj3,NO. The economy does NOT suck on Shadowlands. I have  s on that server. Ive spent literally hundreds of millions of creds on that server. You are simply clueless as to how economies actually work in reality or virtual.As a buyer you have ALL the power. If you dont like the price for an item you dont have to buy it. You can wait for the item to go down in price. Over this past weekend I bought  Annihilator droids. Paid only  million each. Its all I was willing to pay. I waited until I got one at my price on each one.GTN is wonderful. It can also be maddeningly frustrating. Its the last bastion of a truly free market on the planet. Theres NO economywide inflation. It does not exist. The people who say it does are flatout wrong. Are there inflated prices for some items? Absolutely. Thats true in ANY marketplace. But again you as the buyer have ALL the power. The seller MUST cater to you in order to sell hisher item,swtor,d40m3u8,-14,t5_2qxih
7874809,0,t1_d410za8,you might be right but i dont care too much about this game to be honest. sometimes when i cant fall asleep i enjoy doing some storymissions on my lowlevel alts but noawadays i play this game only occasionally to hang around on my main character and do some stuff like new storychapters or some warzones for achievement purposes.however i cant get over the fact they still havent brought back some items they removed from the game long ago like the centurion force masters armor and the fact they still havent figured out a solution for crossserver pvp and stuff. i was really into this game for quite a long time but this game feels really dated and i want to move on.,swtor,d41791t,1,t5_2qxih
7878139,0,t1_d41hhqv,Youre missing the point.OPs talking about how prices have inflated to a ridiculous degree over the past  months hence most things are now unaffordable for people like him where they werent even close to being so before.Hell things are now unaffordable for anyone who doesnt have the time or energy to grind heroics all day because there sure are many people who do. gtIf you want something you might have to actually put in the worktime for it ................................Yeah that rhetoric doesnt work.Between the exploits many billions worth of stolen credits buying up all expensive items and the ease at which you can now earn them legitimately the value of the credit is lowering significantly. Augment prices and some other craftables are still low because who the hell buys them anymore anyway? Endgames dead. No need to aug every single one of your characters anymore. Plus the crafting revamp made gathering mats one hell of a lot easier.See a trend? Easier. Easier. Easier.Even the exploits are getting easier to abuse.

7889954,0,t1_d42w90s,Since youre new to this comment chain Ill explain it to you. Think of the model as a frame. This frame gives the object its shape that it. Then there is the texture which is also commonly referred to as the skin. The skin is what gives the model a certain theme colour.All the Tier  PVP sets have the same modelframe. The only difference are the textures. Imagine painting yourself blue. Youre still the same your nose wont be bigger or smaller.Hence the commonly used term  reskin.This is why that guy got downvoted so much.

7902082,0,t1_d4498nn,Yeah I made a post a day ago about that saying it would have been cool if the only way you could get to the Arcann cutscene would be if you get knocked out giving him more damage and HP than even a  Ops player in BiS could survive. My counterpoint to the Zakuul Knight though is that just because we can take them down by the dozens doesnt mean that the Jedi and Sith can. We took Jedi and Sith down by the dozens too but only strong Jedi and Sith made it into the Revanites right? Companions are a big part of the BioWare storytelling experience though. Thats why Mass Effect and Dragon Age are so big and what made KOTOR so big. Theyve done a good job writing them this season IMO and Ive played every BW game from KOTOR on. There is a culture shock with KotFE vs. the usual Star Wars fare though. Seeing Jedi and Sith be someone elses bitches is not something people immediately think of with Star Wars but I think after Ch.  and  and making Season  more Republic and Empire oriented in a ME type of way will greatly improve things on the traditional Star Wars front. ,swtor,d449omt,1,t5_2qxih

7985758,0,t1_d4dhuat,jheiv already gave an excellent reply so Im just gonna tell you what I did when I was FP.  I found that leveling a crafting skill is expensive so dont bother with it.  For medpacsstims just look in GTN for cheaper prices than the vendor. To save on using medpacs when you get a companion make it attack the mob st.  To do this display its full action bar and find  an icon that looks like a fist.  Click on an enemy then click the fist icon.  The enemy will attack your comp instead of you.  One way to increase your comps damage cheaply is to increase your presence.  The cantina sells drinks that increase presence like spiced nerf milk corelian cocktail etc.  These cost around c or less.For now try to build up some spending money. Drop biochem by clicking on the x next to the skill.  Get a gathering skill like scavenging archeology and bioanalysis and sell the mats on the market.  You can do this around lvl  which allows you to go to fleet.  If you join a guild and they have a furnished stronghold you can use the guilds GTN.  If you get scavenging and are imperial theres a good place by Kaas city to collect laminoid and aluminum.  Its on the left side of the city and has a lot of droids.  Kill the strong ones and collect.   laminoid can sell as hi as c.When I tried a new server I would ask if anyone wanted to help out  Hello new to server trying to build up cash.  If youd like to help plz buy  from me on GTN.  Id price  mat around c.  If folks want to help they can buy it.  It doesnt help to trade since FP cant trade so if other players want to help out they have to buy your stuff on GTN.  Ive ended up with k within a week.  Sales will show up in your mail but dont collect more than your credit cap of k.  You can keep it in mail for  days.  Unlocks to look for on GTN once you have more credits  GTN slot unlock  so you can sell more stuff.   Crew skill unlock  get another gathering skillMake friends with subs so you have someone to ask if an unlock costs more than your credit cap.  If you really like the game and want to sub I suggest getting an UNOPENEDUNUSED swtor game box around  from ebay.  The code in it will give you d of sub.  Then use a ref link like Alortania suggested for another d.Have fun!,swtor,d4dob41,2,t5_2qxih

If you are just looking to play through some SWTOR story then spending . will get you KotFE  and if you wait until July st the . should get you access to all  Chapters. So your . expenditure will give you  hours of story content. Think of it like spending the money to go and see a movie or buy a Blu RayDVD  it is just money you spend to entertain yourself for a short period of time. Ultimately the real decision here is are you playing SWTOR because you want to be immersed in the story or are you playing SWTOR because you want an MMO that allows you to use Lightsabers to beat something to death? Those are two very different reasons to play. Either way you are not marrying the game you do not need a lifelong commitment to play it.

8084934,0,t3_4pvfst,So for starters Im planning on going to Eternal Level at a minimum but I will be looking towards doing the Legendary Level.So my first two classes will be Mercenary  Bodyguardgt My main is a Commando Healer so Im pretty familiar with the class mechanics.  Ill be leveling as Arsenal since its such an easy rotation.  Plus if I get a good Dark Side guild for Ops and such my gear will be largely transferrable. Vanguard  Shield Specgt Ill be recreating a character for this one.  I dont play my Vanguard currently but love the character.  So Im kind of using this as a way to get reacquainted.  Really looking forward to getting back into it with this one.  Leveling should be a breeze with the amount of AOE they can dish out as Plasmatech.  And after the event itll be a nice pair to my Commando Healer main.Both of these will be nonDPS at .  This is to help with the speed of Queues for FPs and Ops.  DPS will be a dimeadozen so any class that has a secondary skill will be highly valuable for getting those achievements knocked out at the end.  For the last  folks Scoundrelgt Already have a Gunslinger so Lets get some more options!  Stealth is always nice for running dailiesheroics. Jedi Sagegt Dont have one so its time for some Balance Love! Also will work as my backup Republic character just in case the OPs groups I find need some Heals instead of my VGuard.

8100206,0,t3_4q65ie,Your guide must be from before .  a number of changes have occurred in . that probably make the guide outdated.First of all as of . Makeb now requires that the player be at least level  to begin. So you wont be heading there for a few more levels even if you wanted to. Moreover pre. Makeb used to have a bunch of exploration bonuses buffs etc. which made it more efficient to level with than the normal class story. This is no longer true so there is no reason to rush to Makeb.Secondly if you are concerned about gear then running heroics will give you lockboxes with two pieces of gear that are around your level. They will be random so youd have to run several to fill out a set but it is an option if you feel you are undergeared. This was also introduced in ..If you are here for the story then I would recommend ignoring levels and just going through the story  story fights are reasonably easy now and if youre having difficulty it is most likely a mechanic you are failing e.g. failing to interrupt a heavyhitting cast rather than having gear that is a few levels below. If you yourself are falling a few levels behind the story which doesnt seem to be the case heroics will help you close the XP gap as well as get you some gear.,swtor,d4qjb5x,11,t5_2qxih
8101898,0,t3_4pvec9,Isnt the first thing Valkorian says to you Oh I think a mistake HAS been made ... but by who? when you walk into the throne room and accuse him of being Vitiate?As far as Im concerned right now theyre different entities. Maybe he has an idea of who Vitiate is but the sudden and complete  from everything hes been doing from the very beginning of the game Which would by the way have consumed everyone on Zakuul as well had he been successful in fueling his ritual in the Knight story indicates theyre not the same person. If anything it seems more likely hes just a very powerful Force user thats good at lying and just blatantly bullshits you and Marr when you meet him for the first time. Theres nothing to say he didnt plumb your mind for your memories and stuff before or during Chapter  by the time you awake its been five years after all. Thats more than enough time for a powerful Forceuser inhabiting your mind to figure out everything he needs to know about you before manipulating you into doing what he wants. Theres also the fact that despite having referred to him as Vitiate for presumably the entirety of their life as an Imperial citizen Lana inexplicable stops explicitly referring to him as Vitiate and instead calls him Valkorian despite the fact that Valkorian is allegedly just an alias and not his true name which Lana and the player knows. Calling him Valkorian infront of Koth and Senya for example makes sense but infront of everyone else and in private with the player why would they if we know Vitiate is their real name? The player character is also guilty of not calling him Vitiate which is especially odd for the Jedi Knight or Sith Warrior considering they had a lot of contact with them.,swtor,d4qq5sl,1,t5_2qxih

I know there is far less people on the fleet as there used to be but It was sometimes laggy during the Life Day event and there wasnt any fighting. Im not sure the servers would allow a smooth experience for everyone on the fleet. What is the point of an event if half the people there do not participate and are just getting in the way ? Not great for immersion.I think the Rakghoul Plague was great and no one was really forced as there is vaccine available everywhere even relics... things could indeed have been handled a bit better. Im not sure a lot of neebies knew about the vaccine and Im also not sure the vaccine was handled right with pvpers. From my point of view what makes a good event is immersion. I can remember people grouping to defend warlords against ennemy attacks on Wow and it was fun. I think what should be made is   . make pvp and mission terminals and why not vendors available for strongholds so players who doesnt want to socialize can stay at home.. crank actual events up to eleven with things happening on the fleet. Why not with special GSF and pvp missions ? Doesnt matter what as long as things happens and people feels compelled to come in and band together on the fly.

8307755,0,t3_4tbd4p,What I really want to see in KOTET that they absolutely dropped the ball on in KOTFE  This is a fucking MMO. They need to respect that recognize that there are people who want to do the entirety of KOTFEKOTET in a groupas a pair and allow the story pointsmajor decisions be determined for the entire group by one person by dice roll. As it stands it is very difficult to do even parts of KOTFE as a pair. I personally greatly enjoy doing all the content in this game with my girlfriend and starting with SOR and especially KOTFE its no longer possible. In the name of story. Fuck that its an MMO.   You mentioned this in your post but the amount of trash mobs in KOTFE is astounding. They are an incredible drag on doing KOTFE more than once because they agro at the slightest breeze and because everything is IN PHASES you cant go past them you cant avoid them you have to kill them. And if an area looks clear guess what the adds will spawn in once you trigger them.  Its incredibly boring incredibly tedious. And as you mentioned with bosses the amount of CC the mobs have that takes control away from me is insane. The Heskal fight is the primary offender in my opinion.  Bioware needs to look at League of Legends and take note of their approach to antifun game mechanics. Because there are a fuck ton of things in KOTFE that are the opposite of Fun. Theyre not challenging theyre not interesting theyre not engaging theyre just the mother of all chores. Too many stuns way too many bosses who become invulnerable. Edit I will add that chapter  the GEMINI Deception was really well done in this area lots of things to do that dont involve killing nnth skytroopers.In conclusion aside from base mechanics being a huge pain and the content being excruciatingly solo in an MMO environment I did enjoy the content and look forward to what they have in the future. But if they wont address the gameplay elements and instead continue their asinine focus on story over gameplay you can bet I wont be replaying it. Ive sunk thousands of hours into this game. To this day over four years later I enjoy replaying the planet quest chains flashpoints you name it. But the main feature there is I do it with friends and they make it fun.No friends and SWTOR isnt particularly enjoyable in the long term. I dont replay RPGs. But I can play MMOs indefinitely.

Note that the Star Wars name brought people in initially and around TFAday... and then most left very quickly afterwards in spite of all the cut scenes that get spacebard through more often than not.  The people that really dig the voices there are some to be sure and that stay subbed for it are likely a niche.  Forcing all dialogs to be voiced absolutely has tied the writersdevs hands.  Ever notice how no one ever mentions our characters names and any other details about them are rarely referenced?  Continuity story customization and even conversation AI would be much easier andor possible without tying everything to voices.

8502311,0,t3_4w5xtg,It would be interesting if the game would allow a Jedi to choose certain Darkside abilities and viceversa for Sith and Lightside. Perhaps using a Darkside ability would cost  Dark point each day it was used  and Sith earn Light points for using a Lightside ability. CrossFaction abilities might be an interesting way to go if the game takes another level increase with KotET  each level grants  CrossFaction abilityYou could also do interFaction abilities. So a Sith Warrior can take Lightning and an Inquisitor can take Force Choke etc. I always thought it would be cool for my Juggernaut to popout some Lightning every once and awhile  without using Heroic Moment. ,swtor,d64cbss,2,t5_2qxih

8541040,0,t1_d6953um,Im...not sure actually.I do know that there are some things like legacy gear but to be honest Ive never looked closely into it or how it works...Your good gear will come from doing heroics which should also be foolishly easy do to the fistfuls of steroids that your companions have been given also companions are multispec now meaning that they can be healers or tanks or DPS interchangeably.You will need next to no help leveling your new guys  believe me on this ever since . its been unbeliveable. You can finish the starter planet at  and CoruscantDromund Kaas at  if you do all the quests. Throw in heroics and maybe a bit of pvp and you will positively blaze through the levels. The downside to this is that when it comes to story bosses you will kill them far too easily my opinion here I like fights to be challenging especially for story purposes.Companions no longer require gear as such so anything you give them clothing or weaponwise is purely cosmetic. Dressing up your fav soldier or jedi apprentice in empty orange gear is just the same as giving them purple gear. Makes giving them outfits a lot easier etc.If you sub and put on the exp boost items that you get from story quests youll level up faster still. To give you an idea of how stupidly fast this can get I decided to load up everything I could on one of my sith characters and hit  max halfway through Taris which is just the beginning of Chapter  in the story. ,swtor,d6975qq,1,t5_2qxih

RotHC and SoR  classic MMO era Mid to preKotFE gt declining revenue negative SWTOR mentions or no SWTOR mentions whatsoever to investors.  KotFE era PostKotFE gt increasing revenue increasing subscribers positive SWTOR mentions to investors.  Time will tell what happens with KotET.  Maybe KotFE was one last hurrah and everyone will be burnt out by the expansions formula.  Or maybe BWA will screw up execution for KotET.  Or maybe KotET will continue to do well as KotFE has.

8632526,0,t3_4y2e8p,Jedi Knight really ties into the story best many people have said it seems the expansion was made more for that class than any other.I like Consular best from the Republic although thats in the minority. You spend more time doing actual Jedi stuff diplomacy primarily then youve had in pretty much any other star wars game.Bounty Hunter is interesting but neither they nor Smugglers seem to have a good hook into the expansion.

8726504,0,t1_d6wbjim,Yeah it may be the wrong approach.  I think from a business perspective their problem was that previously focusing on pve endgame content was not working.  PreKotFE in the RotHC and SoR era SWTORs revenue declined for  years in a row and it was getting to a very bad business state.So that approach didnt work. Maybe they could try again and just try to execute better but I imagine they were already trying their best.  So from a business POV it makes sense to try something different.Now the experiment with KotFE may also be a failure.  In that case that means the precious traditionalgroup pve endgame focus wasnt working and the new SRPG model isnt working.  If thats the case they probably need to try something new. Or maybe they can go back to group pve focus again if there is a larger base to work with now.,swtor,d6wgeor,1,t5_2qxih

Balance is not equal parts light and dark its about an individual having selfishness because all people do tempered by selflessness This is the lesson of the Mortis arc from TCW.  And if all people are in balance there is only the Light Side which is synonymous with balance peace and harmony.The Dark side isnt evil but it is selfish and not peaceful which frequently result in evil.

8755468,0,t1_d701cat,Fair enough but as always there is a big difference between incompetence and the endorsement of genocide. Plus I believe you could make an argument either way that it wasntwas a big deal that they trusted him. Sure he was imprisoned by the Emperor but hes also a practically mythical hero from the Republics past that saved them what  times? I think you can make a case either way that it was fair or unfair to trust him. Since the situation is mostly open to interpretation of whether or not the Republic knew of his plans I think of it from a Doylist perspective did Bioware intend to paint the Republic as progenocide on the level of the Nazis? I think no they were trying to paint Revan that way to illustrate how far hes fallen. Thats the impression I got and thats the impression Ive gotten from the people Ive talked to who ran the flashpoint. They viewed Revan as a genocidal megalomaniac but never got that same impression from the Republic or Jedi in terms of them being complicit. However I think they were trying to paint the Republic as a questionable yet wellintentioned democratic nation. The brutal past the espionage treatment of prisoners and war criminals and the points you mention like supporting resistances and hiring privateers are all questionable things that democracies like the US do. But could you imagine George W Bush Barack Obama andor their cabinets and military advisors ever approving of such a genocide at present? I say no. And I doubt the Republic nor the Jedi dedicated to striving for peace and justice and defending the innocent though they are absolutely dogmatic as many have noted would ever approve of such a thing either at present. The JediRepublic of the past which was far more dogmatic? Yes thats how the Sith Holocaust happened which as I should note is lacking in documentation and is vague going by Wookieepedia. But I never would think these institutions as we know them now would approve of such a plan.,swtor,d703azk,1,t5_2qxih

8866998,0,t3_51okeb,Uh you might not have been around when they introduced the Interface Editor which might let you fix whatever issues you seem to have with the UI.Theyve made many balance changes to each class and have added several abilities over the years but the combat is relatively the same target enemy use ability etc.But I dont really understand what you mean by improvements when you provide so little context. Like you were pretty vague about what you disliked about the game previously so its really difficult to answer your question. EDIT Some other changes that may pertain to what youre looking for. Theyve streamlined stats. Instead of Aim Cunning etc. you just have Mastery. Theyve made a lot of gear Adaptive. Between those two it means you can use pretty much any armor you pick up regardless of your class though endgame gear is still tailored to your particular class. Theyve changed how companions work in that you no longer need to provide gear for them. Their stats will stay current to your level and their influence rank. Theyve thrown out the skill tree and introduced the Utilities system. Idk tell me if Im getting close to touching upon something youre looking for.,swtor,d7dot2s,1,t5_2qxih

8948165,0,t3_52t63s,I think RotHC was done really well if you first play the Republic and then the Imperial story. The latter is the better of the two by far but it still is worth doing them in order. It also helps Makeb was a really nice fully realized planet the last one seen in the game the only departure from the original game being most of the quests were on terminals and datapads instead of voiced questgivers though there were still a few besides the main story ones. The only portion of the story that has now been messed up is the Staged Weekly which was altered with . very significantly but you still get most of the expansion story just playing through one character on each faction. Also for reasons unknown all the daily quests on the planet became onetimeonly missions with .. Still kinda pissed about that since they were different on each faction last time that happened on a scenic planet and were generally wellmade. ,swtor,d7nfqwc,1,t5_2qxih

9016127,0,t1_d7v6xcp,Like I mentioned elsewhere thats not a bad idea. If youre looking for absolute maximum DPS its all Power. When you start to switch out Critical for Power one augment at a time the math gets weird. DPS goes up a tiny bit at first and then it starts going down after . But thats just damage per second. If you want to get decent crits for higher survivability then I think going for  and putting the rest in Power is probably a good trade off. Honestly it doesnt matter much either way as youre looking at a  difference overall. The only real reason to add crit is to hope for crits on Serenity Strike for bigger heals. ,swtor,d7vljpi,1,t5_2qxih

9311981,0,t1_d8wcjet,The thread he is referring to gt Hey folksgt gt One of the things we talked a bit about on the stream is that there are gearing changes happening with Knights of the Eternal Throne. This thread is meant to give you a few more details on some of the things that will be happening in KOTET along with being a place that I can address questions or concerns you have with these changes. First here are the details on how gearing will work at level gt  Once you hit level  the source of endgame gear will be Command Crates from Galactic Command.gt  Most activities in the game will earn Command Experience Points CXP which will earn you Command Ranks. Each time your Command Rank increases you earn a Command Crate.gt  The higher your Command Rank the better gear that will drop from your Command Crates.gt  The highest difficulty Operations and Uprisings along with Ranked Warzones are intended to be the fastest ways to earn CXP. This means they are the fastest way to get the best gear.gt  Both PvP and PvE gear will come from Command Crates. Their gear is now shared as Expertise is being removed head to this thread to discuss PvPPvE itemization specifically.gt  Gear will no longer drop from bosses as all gear will come from Command Crates. All cosmeticunique drops will still remain on those bosses Stronghold Decorations Wings of the Architect etc..gt  Players will be able to craft comparable item level gear without set bonuses.gt That should cover most of the basic changes coming to itemization in KOTET. I know this is a lot to take in so please ask any questions you may have in this thread and I will work to answer what I can!gt gt ericAdditional postsgtgtWhat happens to Priority Ops?gtPriority Ops will no longer exist. They are sort of replaced in that Operations can be the daily bonus which will award bonus CXP for doing them.gtgtIs there a cap to command rank? As in for example you reach level  command rank and you can progress no further?gtgtEDIT Also will any of this affect gearing prior to level ?gtThere is a cap. When you hit the cap you continue to earn CXP and fill your bar so that you level. When this happens and you are at the cap you will get a Command Crate but not level up.gtNo effect below level .gtericgtgt questionsgtgt. Just to clarify you only have to hit level  to access command ranks and not complete KOTET story correct?gtgt. Is there a max level for command ranks?gtgt. Once we hit that level will there be any other way to obtain rewards that we didnt get?gtgtThanksgt Correct you only need to be level  to access GC.gt Yes there is a max level still in fluxgt Yup check this. See previous postgtgtalso what happens to all current commendations? do they turn into points or just rendered worthless?gtCurrent Commendations will be going away we will have more details in the coming weeks on their conversion.gtgtFirst of are these random drops that is to say that if Im extremely unlucky I cant get the best earpiece for my char at all?gtgtSecondly are you saying that if a player grinds Hs for long enough he can get Nightmare gear?gtYup the drops will be random. The item type is determined by your Advanced Class and the item rating is determined by your Command Rank higher rank  higher item rating. Keep in mind that you can always earn more Crates and that you can disintegrate any duplicate or unwanted items into CXP to get your next Crate faster.gtYes. All endgame gear level  can be earned by doing almost any activity. However someone doing Nightmare Master level Operations as an example will get there substantially faster than someone doing easysolo content.gtgtSince bosses will no longer drop gear in operations will there be lock outs on the operations?gtYup lockouts will still remain in place. Although they dont directly drop gear they will still drop their other cosmetic rewards and will be one of the best sources of Command Experience Points.gtericgtgtBalancing will be the key. If doing Opses rewards say x the Galactic Points than anything else thus effectively dumps way more crates on you faster then it will still be totally worth to do Ops and gear the fastest this way.gtBonus aside it is the goal that fastest way to earn CXP will be through the hardest difficulty Operations and Uprisings along with Ranked Arenas.gteric,swtor,d8wd1jr,13,t5_2qxih

To get a basic PVP gear set you had to run at least  weeklys if you use the small weekly about  won games. You also was able to trade pvp coms to a different toon which makes gearing very fast if you already have an pvp char with many unused coms. I really hope BW will change the command rank to leagacy wide. So you can do action regardless on which alt you are. This would have a huge advantage if you run a NIM OP an you are command rank  you will get sm or even worst gear. If it would leagacy wide you will get NIM gear cause you already hit rank x.,swtor,d8wx481,1,t5_2qxih

9353332,0,t1_d90x9jc,I agree that tokens seem way better.  RNG can be so annoying.  Just as a footnote though as a math geekgt Basically to get a  chance of getting the  set piece that you need to complete your set you would need to open  crates.gt .        gt If you assume there are  pieces in the loot table youd need to open FIFTYNINE crates to have a  chance of getting the set piece that you need.gt         This might be painting too dire a picture.  The expected time to get your last gear piece is  more rolls if you assume  gear slots.  And if you assume  gear slots the expected time to get that last gear piece is  more rolls.  Setting an arbitrary confidence number eg  can be a misleading way to think about expectations when the average is what youre most likely to encounter.  One should look at the actual expectation then note that the variance.And as for fully gearing up  filling all slots?  For  gear slots on average youd need to open  crates total.  For  gear slots on average youd need to open  crates total.  Rather than burning time writing up the reasons for this all myself Ill just point to the wikipedia article on the wellstudied math problem which covers exactly this topic as I think the article is pretty clear and easy to follow with or without a lot of formal mathematical training  Let me know if you or anyone else reading have questions on this though and Im happy to try to help break it down further.

9368459,0,t3_58vhhr,While this looks and smells like a troll post I want to point out some things youre overlooking. The way the game is designed people dont need gear. You can level  with starting whites. You can level  without picking an advanced class. If youre not doing ops or pvp youre honestly not doing content that demands even level  gear you can be in the level  blues a boost token grants.The big issues with Galactic Command are the following... RNG Gear. Weve been here before. At launch PvPers had to deal with RNG gear boxes for Battlemaster Armor. I played the entire stretch of .. I never received Battlemaster Belt and Bracers I did however get the rest of the armor. Were going to see more duplicates before we have all  pieces.. But you can give that armor to another character you say. Not really. A set bonus for a juggernaut is not going to do anything for a Sorcerer. . But you can give the mod and enhancement to the Sorcerer. True. But according to the developers crafters will now be able to craft the gear with the same stats just no set bonuses. Why would anyone bother with RNG mods and enhancements when the  DvL characters everyone just made have max level crafting. Ill just vaporize duplicate gear thanks. Worth noting you cant give alts the ears implants and relics either thats  out of  slots that are untradable!. Its unfriendly to alts and late players. Lets pretend  months of this system is a reasonable time for someone that plays a couples hours a week to get fully geared. Now we have a group of  players who do ops working through hardmode and nightmare mode. Month  one of the healers drops out. A dps switchs to an alt to be a healer? Nope he has  months of GC XP to grind for gear. Recruit a noob? Better hope theyve been grinding GC XP for  months. With the way the game is designed today a guild can get an altnoob fully geared and raid ready in about  hours if they have to go on a gear run.,swtor,d93ip47,1,t5_2qxih

Pure FP are actually content for other players. You have to remember what SWTOR was like before the FP transition when all the servers were ghost towns. It didnt matter that there were subscribers as there was no one to play with.Most of the arguments are strawmans and assume SWTOR exists in a vacuum. Cant afford to play is really There are other things that worth buying. It should also be considered that Bioware should be focusing on converting FP to paying players. Note that this doesnt subscriber. By just straight locking out FP its much more likely to have them ditch the game than to stick around.

9424958,0,t1_d9anjbt,Cheers very much for your reply ElRunninW. The thing is that Im not really one to reroll. I labour over making a character whose look I like then stick to it and aim to get very good at it. Its just how I roll with these things really.Its more a question of if the class is going to be challenging enough. I sort of dont understand the soul of the mercenary spec if that makes sense? If its a matter of ranged over melee then I do prefer ranged. But from what I consistently keep reading its just not a good class that its objectively lacking the diversity and dynamic edge of the PT.I just really want to know if the class has its thrills and is challenging or if its just a case of spamming missiles in a very limited rotation. Because if not Im better off going with PT and resorting to operative healing instead...

9488798,0,t3_5aris0,That is only partially correct. Once you start the KotFE story via accepting it on your ships missions terminal  you get a big warning that your story missions will no longer be playable your story missions will get canceled and you cant pick them up or play them anymore this includes the class story as well as the stories of the previous expansions.The Chapters take place on new planetsinstances but you can leave the chapters and go on all planets like you used to. I think it cancels the progression of the chapter if you leave in between but you can log off and continue later.

9549328,0,t3_5botnr,Yeah theres nothing wrong with disabling bitraider. If it wasnt a viable option they would have updated the launcher to make bitraider the only way to download the game and updates. There typically arent as many problems patching when using the nonbitraider client. It is very straightforward the data downloads it installs you play. It doesnt affect performance.If you want to install the nonbitraider client but you dont want to download all the game files againCopy your game folder CProgram Files xElectronic ArtsBioWareStar Wars  The Old Republic to a safe place on your drive or any drive you have space on. Delete the bitraider folder or content in this folder.Follow the directions you found in the link you posted about removing bitraider and the directions in the comments called GET BITRAIDER OFF YOUR SYSTEMCopy the launcher.settings file that you modified as per the directions to a safe place on your drive.Copy the contents of CUsersyour Windows user nameAppDataLocalSWTOR to a safe place on your drive. You will have to turn on the Explorer option to view hidden items to do this.Open the launcher. It should begin updating itself to its current version. Let it finish doing downloading and installing its own launcher files. When it begins downloading the actual game filesassets shut it down.The launcher will have wiped the content in CProgram Files xElectronic ArtsBioWareStar Wars  The Old Republic so now copy the backup folder you made at the beginning to its correct location. This has the old launcher.settings file in it. Delete that one and now copy the new one you made to its place.Open the launcher again. It should begin recognizing the files as having been all downloaded but not yet installed and then it should begin installing them.Check if the CUsersyour Windows user nameAppDataLocalSWTOR has changed. If non of your GUI setting files etc are there just copy the backup you made to their correct place.Thats it. This should save some bitraider headaches in the future.

9890431,0,t3_5h1rw1,I was not aware LOTRO went into maintenance mode. They havent done big paid expansions in a while but there are regular updates that add new large regions with regular quests dailies and progress in the main storyline. Last year they actually added an instance cluster with a new raid after sticking with levelscaled instances flashpoints and Big Battles think new Uprisings for several level cap increases. They recently released a new housing area in Gondor and even added a new pvp area after only having one for eight years of the game  now THAT was a big surprise.Some art and boss mechanics may be recycled but come on  this has always been a part of that game. Maintenance mode would mean no new content except for major bugfixes  LOTRO covered the entire Gondor with Dead Marshes and Ithilien in territory and most of the Return of the King in terms of timeline in the past couple of years. Thats actual content by the way where new areas are fully explorable have Reputation factions new daily quests currencies to barter for both cosmetics and statted gear. And while old instances and raids ARE scaled up so you can run them again for new rewards theres usually at least a few brand new ones in the mix too.,swtor,dawqvdi,18,t5_2qxih
9891981,0,t3_5h0off,Rex There is a bit of a hard truth to the answer here.  If you are lonely and feeling inferior hiding within a game world is probably the least likely way to change that.  If you have those feelings you need to address both of them in distinct plans of action.  Identify ONE yes just one thing you want to improve about yourself and do everything in your power to do that one thing.  After you accomplish your goal you will feel like you can be so much more and that feeling of inferiority will start to diminish.  I suggest fitness here as it will help with a lot of other things... primarily self image and overall mental health physical exercise gives a great boost to the brains chemical composition.Also you need to seek real connections with real people but in order to do that... you will need to be selfconfident enough to engage in that type of social setting.  Start with the little things plan them out accomplish them one at a time and you will end up all the way at the finish line before you know it.I havent posted on rswtor in a while but Ive been lurking as always hoping the game takes a turn for the better... but I still miss the people I connected with in game and on rswtor.

That being said it is worth a  month sub to clear all the content as others have said its no worse then playing a single player game thats honestly decent in that regard. After that if you feel like you want to keep playing then do so. Problem is there are plenty of other more viable MMOs to play at the moment thats worth your time. But none of them are starwars or even scifi MMOs which is what keeps this game on the up tick. ive been playing MMOs for  years now and I still get a kick out of healing with Merc or Operative and some of the best class questing ive ever seen in an MMO.,swtor,db6rjcv,1,t5_2qxih

9978918,0,t1_db88kzz,Ill upvote your dissent but I think its wrongheaded. As someone with a family restaurant...your analogy hits home.You had a bad time at our place? Didnt enjoy it? Tell the manager and shell comp it offer something else maybe. Or just dont come back for awhile. Make us suffer a little. But to go online and tell the world that we used to be decent but now we suck for everyone that thinks like you? Thats hostility that doesnt jibe well with a premise of loyalty through good times and bad.So what? People have a right to bitch boycott organize protests even try to ruin businesses in acts of revenge. And online forum bitching is no big deal admittedly. But in the case of SWTOR weve seen this cycle of violence repeat about  times in the  years. Ive subbed since prelaunch and have  over time  grown my own list of wishes and complaints. Most of them were addressed right up through the latest change back to a focus on story. PEOPLE WERE BEGGING FOR IT. But always other people have wanted more endgame more NMs better gearing principles and insisted that they are the loyal base of the game.I dont know why BW or EA should be expected to listen to the loyal base however construed. On the contrary other people are pointing out that to make money pleasing the endgame minority might be impossible. Certainly when everybody pined for the secret space game that became GSF they wanted what they wanted. They got it. Then they wanted something else and GSF falls by the wayside. Its still a rather enjoyable part of the game for me and is one reason BW has continued to get my money.,swtor,db8a4xi,-1,t5_2qxih

It just means theyve got a little more startup time on the WZ farm.gt Not being able to do this in exchange for no more loot drama ever? I say way more important sorry. How many times across all servers and guilds in one sample week theres a gearing run for a newbie where everyone passes tokens to him versus how many loot conflicts frustration due to constantly lost rolls ninajs on all servers PUGs etc? A dedicated team will carry a newbie through DF HM farm craft them a lot etc. Still many options on fast catchup versus bringing back loot token issues for EVERYONE.Its a lesson in learning who to trust or would be if we had legacywide ignore.  Theres another strong reason to leave it in guild recruitment and learning how to do something like business relationships.  If people learn youre trustworthy with the raid loot as well as a good raid leader theyve got a very good reason to join your guild or just run with you more often.  Friendships are extremely important for the longterm health of the game because making and expanding networks of friends is essential for retention of players in endgame.  So is keeping these networks of friends together which is why removing the ops passes without replacing it was such a stupid move.,swtor,db9lrym,1,t5_2qxih

10021518,0,t1_dbdkb2n,Yeah somehow amidst his brooding folks tend to overlook that Kylo Ren pulls off several tricks that weve only seen from the most elite Forceusers Dooku level at a minimum and even manages a couple that weve never seen onscreen before.  Hes also the only person in the entire sextet of episode movies that continues fighting after taking a serious injury much less after taking even so much as a grazing shot from a lightsaber. ObiWan Kenobi went down like a sack of potatoes after Dooku scratched him a couple times in AotC.  Kylo gets sliced what...two or three times...after tanking a bowcaster to the torso?Kylos kind of a beast but because hes got emotional hangups and gets beat by Rey in the end he gets dismissed as whiny boy.  The fact that Kylo Ren got beat by Rey shouldnt be a surprise or speak too strongly against his strength and skills...the fact that he was still fighting at all at that point puts him above a large array of characters in the saga in terms of determination and durability and his demonstrated Force abilities are on par with what weve seen from fullfledged Sith LordsJedi Masters in previous episodes.,swtor,dbdty2r,2,t5_2qxih

Enslaving them either openly or through diplomacy. Even the Republic was trying to conquer Ziost while the emperor drove everyone on the planet insane and they hardly give a hand at evacuating the civilians. In the entirety of KOTFE exactly no one except Arcann and Lana who realized the true risk of Valkorion inside you. Now KOTFE Arcanns ruthlessness is legendary but his main goal is always to destroy his father and youre his fathers vessel running around like you dont have a crazy madman who could kill billions instantly. And Im borrowing a ME line here If all life in the galaxy vanishes because he hesitate what choice did he have?Arcann might have been a tyrant but he isnt stupid. He kept the galaxy intact during his reign which you sleep through and his right to the throne is far more credible especially to the people of Zakuul. The exiles is just a small percent of the total population on that planet and as everyone in that expansion told you Zakuulan are generally naive and overly pampered people who worshiped Valkorion like a god anything Arcann did is too much for them to handle anyway. Arcann was already dethroned by Scorpio his own sister usurped his throne and name herself an Empress because his brother didnt let her kill their own mother. Zakuulans and the galaxy fared even worse under his sisters reign. Shes a mad woman who kill everyone around her just because she can. After everything she had done youd think Zakuulan would be fine again with a new overlord who killed their beloved immortal emperor?You are free to not think Arcann as awesome as some people here does.

10174239,0,t1_dbx5xpt,I understand that the Empire is full of Sith. I feel as though you arent understanding what I am getting at which is that the original emperor Vitiate was power unlike anyone had ever seen before. The only reason his position was never contested and no Sith tried to kill him to assume his power is because the Dark Council had previously tried to do such thing before and as a consequence the Emperor killed all of them. What you are suggesting is that Acina surrounds herself with other powerful Sith beings who very well could challenge her right to rule and attempt to claim the throne for themselves. It is not in their nature to bow down to a being whom they could overpower and Acina would be defeated if they were to combine their efforts which would only lead into more and more infighting. I hear the voice of Darth Revans holocron saying This is the nature of the dark side.The only reason she was able to claim the mantle of Empress is because those who were in the Dark Council fell to Arcanns assault save for Marr and the Inquisitor. Had the Dark Council been around none of them would have let her try and claim the throne for herself.,swtor,dbxb18o,1,t5_2qxih

10199800,0,t3_5m24yy,Someone correct me if I am wrong but is MASTER the equivalent to NiM so im not sure how that would be the same as Story. Story gives you a bolster to a recommended stat rating which decreases the higher your gear rating is. Once you hit the HMNiM equivalent that bolster is gone and gear actually comes into effect along with class and rotation knowledge. More mechanics get introduced for each difficulty so there are slight differences and base mechanics eventually gain the ability to oneshot you depending on the raid. Now for me I love doing the Nightmare Operations for titles achievements mounts special stronghold items and just because.As far as your question of just doign STORY no because like I said the higher your overall stats are the less of a bolster you get to the point where SM is just a walk in the park which it really is anyways.I hope I am not way off what you were asking in this post.,swtor,dc07d35,3,t5_2qxih

10233310,1,t3_5mih50,In a nutshell ...PreKotFEET SWTOR was a true Star Wars MMORPG from character creation to end game. Its last expansion Shadow of Revan began the games foray into soloonly quest dialogue interactions with NPCs but the players could still play through every other aspect of the game other than space combat together ... including the quests. With it came the games last release of a new end game Operation. Post KotFEET marked Bioware putting the MMO part of the games MMORPG designation into maintenance mode. It saw the entire story amp questing system after Shadow of Revan become exclusive to solo play. Want to level up through the games last  levels worth of story with your friends? Too bad because you cant. And the ENTIRE GAME was level syncd and bolstered into a onesizefitsall crate grind for end game. Advanced group play was removed from the ENTIRE games leveling experience and recycled into end game not replicated ... completely relocated so we could have group content to play at the level cap.  In WoW vernacular dungeons became solo story instances and got grouped together by continent for when that continents story was completed. Translated there isnt a levelappropriate dungeon anywhere in the game any more. Additionally dungeons heroic dungeons and raids were all recycled into timewalking dungeons timewalking heroic dungeons and timewalking raids. But instead of timewalked backward everything was bolstered to and tuned for the level cap. They not only became part of end game they became the entire end game. Except that there hasnt been a new dungeon heroic or raid released since Mists of Pandaria. Bosses dont drop loot any more either. So the games long standing and traditional read tangible intuitive and consistent end game progression system was trashed for a tabletbased singleplayer RPG RNG lottery system. gtPreKnights of the Fallen EmpireEternal ThronegtThat next expansion happens to be Rise of the Hutt Cartel an expansion that takes place on the planet Makeb and our first real look at a third party influence that challenges both game factions and the start of what eventually leads to the separation from the personal character stories. All tho this is true that we do lose a bit of the originality of each class through generic stories for each faction we still maintain some of the personality through the introduction to the expansion via conversations. Tho once into the expansion the messages get pretty generic and aside from the titlesachievements your character holds at the time. Its not until the next Expansion that we really start to see some of that personal character story telling that we had in the initial chapters.Its not until the next expansion that we see the beginining of the end for the MMO part of SWTOR.gtWith that said Shadow of Revan was what brought us that nostalgic feeling with the way your character catches up with their past. Huh? You mean the short class quests that took up about  minutes of the entire expansion?  gtThis was achieved through your adventures on Rishi prior to the Revan encounters on Yavin. You learn about what exactly happened during your absence from your initial contacts their fate and where your standpoint with them wasis. Overall you really gain that feeling of personal immersion into the story once again only to fall back into the generic dialogue for both factions.Ya ... it was a good  minutes though.gtAt the end of it we saw a lot of Quality of Life adjustments from BioWare that really helped. Such as the ability clean up for some of the classes that were overwhelmed with abilities. Bullshit. Those Skill Trees allowed us to customize our characters abilities. The only people who were overwhelmed were the ones maintaining it on the back end.gtThe cost of learning those also was removed which added to the clean up. Have to admit that was a nice surprise.gtWe had weekends of Double Experience gain which targeted those who could only fully devote time to the game on the weekends and eased the tedious level grind at the time. I still dont understand how after four years of SWTOR becoming the poster child for altoholics the leveling game all of a sudden became a tedious grind. No actually they were rushing players through the best part of the game to the part they needed to market the most. gtWe saw Cookie cutter builds vanish with the introduction to the discipline systemActually the Discipline system introduced cookie cutter builds to the game.gttho its still rather Cookie cutterish. No its ALL cookie cutterish.gtLearning abilities became simple with the automatic learning and removed the need to find the nearest trainer.That was also a nice perk But thats all it was ... a perk.gtPost Knights of the Fallen EmpireEternal ThronegtKnights of the Fallen Empire introduced you BioWares venture into the Episodic style of story telling. It was a new and interesting way to venture into a story involving your character It brings you into the realm of an outsider taking everything youve worked for and putting it all to past. It wasnt new. It was an attempt to recapture  year magic when what we already had was magic. gtYoure in a new world full of new faces and a few you already know but the main catch is that everything youve done holds no meaning to the antagonist of this expansion. Youre tasked with with the familiar goal of toppling a new tyrant in the galaxy on a larger scale than that of which youre familiar with. All the meantime youre discovering what has taken place during your absence and learning what challenges you have ahead of you. BioWare really outdid them self with this expansion both bringing new and familiar aspects to the game. Tho BioWare did have some hiccups along the way it really was an interesting style to tell the Star Wars story and put your current character into a whole new story.Interesting style? For who? Solo players? This is a fucking MMO for chrissakes! When my wife and I cant level through a MMO expansion together because the game flat wont allow it ... THAT is a BIG problem. I have KOTOR on my iPad if I want a single player Star Wars story experience. Having a MMO ram solo down our throats is incredulous. gtKnights of the Eternal Empire You continue on the story of the outsider toppling a new tyrant only in this expansion youre better informed better equipped and have newold allies to help you along the way. The only catch is that youre struggling to topple a whole new tyrant that was in the shadow of the former. In this expansion youre met yet again with the conclusion to a question from the initial class chapters and that story is closed. Rinse and repeat. We get it.gtAll the meanwhile youre finding out more to the past of characters you come in contact with in the previous KotFE chapters. No recycling the entire game for end game wasnt enough. Our companions got recycled too. Took them away and locked them behind quest gates then had us grind to get them back. The comp retrieval terminal in Odesssen became my best friend in the game.gtWhile also being introduced to a few new ingame mechanics that are pretty interesting them self. Overall BioWare outdid them self with KotFEThe SWTOR MMO died with KotFE ...gtand raised their bar even higher going into KotET. ... and was buried with KotET.gtWith that said BioWare still had some drawbacks.Had?gtWith the latest expansions We saw the introduction of several additions to the games original functions one of the most noticeable ones being the Galactic Command feature. No idea what youre trying to sell but Command Crates were never part of the games original functions. The games only attempt at a system even remotely close to this was the Battlemaster crate system at launch and it failed miserably.gtIt integrates all of the core features into one interface while granting players a new way to gain endgame items. Tho somewhat tedious the new system is a decent addition to the new style of gameplay most of the newer player base is gravitating towards yet at the same time still proving enough of a challenge for the older player base. Lo and behold ...gtgtsbadley Bookmark this thread. Bioware will start a new MARCOM campaign extoling some coolworded sweetspot in the Galactic Command system where the game really starts to rock ... Pardon my French but ... horseshit. Most of the newer player base is gravitating towards it because its the only thing Bioware is giving them to gravitate toward. Thats Bioware trying to sell intelligent people on the kindergarten concept that having A A or A to select from promotes freedom of choice.gtIn addition to the galactic command feature we were given several new instanced raid style dungeons that are easy going at the lower difficulty setting while also proving somewhat as a challenge to some of the players at the higher difficulties.Not even close to what the players have been asking for. And please tell Ben ... the next time he feels like revealing to the entire gaming world in back to back Livestreams that both the blame and the responsibility for BWAs lack of MMO end game content rests squarely on their customers not knowing what they want ... to go suck an egg. He essentially called his customers fucking idiots on global television and laid the blame for their lack of production squarely on us.Theres a reason why rswtor has been lit up with bad juju for over a year.

10330845,0,t1_dcdy4cm,see now youre just making a completely unhinged argument in your constant need to shift gears as opposed to addressing any of the valid counter argumentsso now.  your argument is... that the system sucks?   because the only way to play the game now is to someone ignore all the really easy ways to get gear.   and somehow acquire  gear.   and ignore the loot crates you get anyway?I mean this seems similar to the stupidity of people who whine about cmd crates always having garbage gear.   and then they say right after that.   they disintegrate all the greens and blues  because theyre only minor upgrades.  also now we have introduced this new phantom issue of people avoiding the system to have fun?      so... youre like nearly to the point of having fun and not worrying about something that doesnt have to be worried about.  except youre still angry and upset.   and so instead of being zen ...youre acting like a pouty child in a corner.   its also false to say that the system doesnt encourage participation.  a bar that fills up is inherently engaging.  its a very simple noncomplicated system.   much less annoying and soul sucking that acquiring widgets and keeping track of widgets only to cash them in to get an item.   and then have widgets you have zero use for...  nope.  new system.   one menu.  that launches vast majority of game content.   and  xp bar to fill up  which grants a loot box.   which goes again to why they probably tried to go to this system.  of course armchair butthurts will just be angry.   but the Devs probably have a much better grasp on their budgetary constraints  and insight into how many people actually meaningfully engage with their previous system.  I would wager.  the numbers of people who ever got above  gear was staggering.   primarily because on one wanted to constantly run ops.    some people just dont have the time  dont feel comfortable.  or dont like playing with groups.    So these people never really engaged the previous system.    And then theres the people who would  but the content was old  so the idea of another grinding through old content  just to widget farm for gear... was no good.    Same with PvP.   PvP is less inviting when you know  if you havent focused on it.  theres people who have and theyre at a sizable advantage gear wise.  that having an entirely separate gear mechanic for one narrow aspect of the game  is pretty off putting to large groups of people.    whether its for cxp or noti know some people are more willing to try pvp because theres no more special gear for it.  PvP and GSF  are more popular than they have been in awhile.    even though there is basically zero point to Ops.   putting Ops on the daily bonus.   and people do Ops.  so its pretty retarded to make a claim that the system is either being utterly ignored.  is best to be ignored.  or somehow doesnt invite participation.  and again.  this entire track of argument that the devs are stupid or that they somehow implemented a system that isnt fun or rewarding.   is less about the actual system and more about people who are simply angry and frustrated ... and so again.   its more about being angry.   and less about anything specifically wrong or bad with the current system.they litterally have given us as players  the freedom to play as we like.   to do whats most fun to us  and still make progress towards endgame gear.the simple truth is.

They stopped communications on forums almost no bug fixing and total ignorance of the feedback from the community. When i compare how it was in the pre. times its a  to  difference. They focus mostly on the Cartel Market and put even rare things which were drops in ops into the game for people to get easily. Old rare gear is not available as tokens from DvsL etc. They are simplifying and making the game way to easy. There is just so much to say.

Now you can wear artifact level gear as Preferred providing you unlocked it via the Cartel Market. But trying to run story content past SoR with only orange slotted gear and lvl  parts can be difficult.

The story experience in this game is still good. The fact that KotFE and KotET werent all that great doesnt detract from the fact that the first eight class stories and Makeb both factions are still quite enjoyable and entertaining.The issue is that SWTOR is also an MMORPG. Someone who wants to publish a review of a product should take that into account when writing the article. Its alright that he subjectively enjoys the fact that SWTOR doesnt force him to play with others but group content should definitely be discussed in a review that focus on SWTOR.

I disagree slightly about the currency because Im still stuck in the mindset of liking a separation between PVP and PVE in terms of rewards and gearing. Id also add the obvious more ops. I dont typically do them but others do and honestly from a MMORPG standpoint it is a bit ridiculous. Using the current most popular MMORPG WoW they released an average of over  raids ops per expansion for a grand total of  different ones with the smallest being for  groups  people. SWTOR has . Id be happy if they did half of what WoW did... Note  Several of those WoW raids were  boss raids with minimal trash which barely count in terms of design difficulty.Everything else you said  Agree .

If you hit the merc with  stuns they become stun immune once the first cooldown wears off giving you no tools to deal with them when they pop the second cooldown.

Pilots can use that while charging their railgun shoot you and then instantly move back behind cover which may look like theyre shooting behind asteroids.Finally  server lag.

You can also then use someones Referral Link and get  bonus days of Subscription time  thus having  days of Sub for .. With the massive XP Event going on right now until April th you can literally leave a planet after only doing the ish Class missions and still be overleveled. Advancement is insanely fast. So I would not recommend a longterm Subscription. You can Subscribe  or  times a year  generally when new Expansionscontent is released  and just purchase various Unlocks with Credits while Subscribed to remove most of the Preferred limitations. Unless you are really only wanting to focus on endgame Raiding and PvP there is not a lot of reason to maintain a Subscription. ,swtor,ddyejok,4,t5_2qxih

I played at launch as well and I come and go from the game as well. Right now is a good time to get back into it as a sub. They have the  XP and CXP event going on for another month so its a great time to level new characters. TLDR So if you like the game and apparently you do Id say yes...

10967958,0,t3_5wm2yu,A couple things that will really help Summon everyone to the same instance of the fleet or wherever the entrance is do a ready check and have everyone jump in at the same time. Once youre in youre in.  Dont try to leave and come back make sure you have all your gear and stims.  It may work coming back in slight chance you cant get on the same instance. Hopefully you wont need to exit and reset the phase so dont say all die on SOA. Start from the beginning do not try to use a lockout. If you must use a lockout such as Revan only then get it any day before you need to use it.  For instance if you get a lockout on Wednesday after server reset on Thursday morning everyone should be able to get in no problem. If you bug the instance youll probably have to wait for server reset for it to get fixed. If youre trying to use M SNV to get your surviving Styrak achieve I wish you luck.,swtor,deb9mv2,1,t5_2qxih

10971398,0,t3_5wo087,I think communication is something that is vastly underestimated in GSF and is something that can affect the battle more than players realize. Simple things like calling out which satellites to take at the start if a gunship is approaching your satellite or maybe team members overextending in team deathmatch and telling them to come back can make a big difference when it comes to control and domination of an areanode. As someone who recently got more involved with GSF as well matches can seem like deja vu when I scout rush to B then find the whole team went to a side node or split up. So if you can and this isnt totally aimed at you OP say something in chat. It can make the whole gearing process go by quickly when your team plays together and wins games.,swtor,debmekr,3,t5_2qxih

Has absorb shields the only healer with them a big ground targeted aoe hot and uses Force as a resource linear akin to mana.The other healers below use energyheatammo as a resource which all work the same way. It has nonlinear regen if you go below  or for heat above  then it regenerates more slowly. If you end up below  and dont have a regen cooldown available its tough to get back above so you have to keep track of that. Sorcsage have to manage their force amp force regen also but theres no cutoff like this.OperativeScoundrel This is the hotbased healer the primary hot stacks up to  times and thereafter can be maintained by other means. The worst burst healing the best aoe healing. Has a massive aoe channeled groundtargeted heal.MercenaryCommando Has the strongest burst healing and has heavy armor. Also has healondamage shells with  charges that last  minutes that you can place on people e.g. you can place them on the whole raid before the pull.Popularity is usually st sorcsage nd mercmando rd opscoundrel but all are definitely viable and have their strengthsweaknesses.,swtor,dej05ze,5,t5_2qxih

Ill just add this its tough to do anything besides the original chapters as fp if you want to do anything past level  including new expansions ops and unlimited pvp its worth it to sub.Since max level is now  youll be missing key abilities that make you a better tank this is probably why youve heard its impossible to be a decent tank without the remaining abilities and utilities.,swtor,df5exaq,1,t5_2qxih

11246709,0,t1_df5zfs6,gt You usually have  or more buttons that give you meaningful choices on what you can do for your team or to your enemies and most of them are at least situationally useful. Melee fights get really fast.To me this gets at what makes SWTOR PvP really compelling and fun.  We lose sight of it in complaining about the day to day crap but what keeps a lot of people around for years is that the combat model is complex enough to provide a really high skill cap without being inaccessible or super twitchy.  I use  abilities every match.  Similarly the warzone scenarios support a variety of tactics so that play is varied and you need to be constantly thinking to get and stay ahead.Overall I think the trajectory is downhill in that both the combat and the tactics are becoming more homogenized and of course the latest expansion has ruined gearing but I think there are good times to be had for a while yet.,swtor,df6sq5y,1,t5_2qxih

11269675,0,t3_60otlm,I enjoy doing flashpoints.   I like seeing the story once or twicetheres very little to nothing they could do to to make me want to do them via GF.  tactical flashpoints.  forget about it.   For any flashpoint that isnt brain dead easy.  its guaranteed to be a shit show.   Even for some that are brain dead easy.  you sometimes still wipe.   No tank  or no healer.  It just doesnt work.   its infinitely easier  booting someone and running a healer companion.  This above all else... makes the prospect a nightmare doing them with randos.   All fun of the encounter immediate evaporateswith no option to skip cut scenes.  when i dont want to see the story.  its physically aggravating to be forced to wait on someone else.  They would need some autoskip  option before launching the FP.   or  drastically reduce the time to make a choice.  ie.   seconds tops.   If you miss that window.  youre immediately locked out of all other choices. and with lootcxp as it is these days.  youd have to drastically and insansely increase the cxp to make it worth the time.   im talking like k  per run.  As theres no guarantee itll be quick  or take hours.    So yeah.  Ill run FP with guildmates  casually on coms.  for Conquest.   but aside from that.   nope nope nope,swtor,df9eg0p,2,t5_2qxih

11670374,0,t1_dgimp5g,To add to what uSWTORVEGA said some classes outperform others is really not a huge factor.  If you are good at your class the  DPS difference will not be as noticeable.  Sure a Mercenary is the top DPS right now but I can parse far better numbers with my Operative because I enjoy Operative DPS quite a bit more and know the class inside and out.  I perform far better with her than I do either of my Mercs for DPS.  I enjoy it far more too.The other factor is raid utility.  Mercs are king shit right now but if youve got  Merc DPS and  Merc healers youre missing out on the other raid buffs that Operatives Marauders and Sorcs offer.  Plus there are other benefits  Juggernaut may not have the DPS that a Marauder does but they can temporarily taunt the boss while the tank is being revived.  A Sniper might put out more damage than an Operative does but an Operative can stealth out and rez someone when battle rez is on cooldown.  Its more than just Who shoots the most stuff and has the biggest numbers. ,swtor,dgiupge,2,t5_2qxih
