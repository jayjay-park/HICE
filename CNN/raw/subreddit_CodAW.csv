The Xbox One and then internet have very finite limitations. You cannot exceed these limitations. Your examples dont translate to Call of Duty the way you think they will. I challenge you to research computer and game design and the limitations it faces.Its a very simple concept. You cant both make your match making searches more specific and faster. Its impossible. If you disagree with this Im sorry we cant progress in our conversation. These are engineering basics . There are limitations and in an optimized system you cant have your cake and eat it to. Youre giving up certain qualities to achieve others but youre suggesting have all the best qualities and none of the bad. The real world doesnt work like that. If you cant see why that is Im sorry we cant continue. I dont have time to teach you design principles or explain every nitch detail about why it wont work the way you want it to or why its bad idea for Call of Duty. Youve got all the ideas of a business person or someone who hasnt ever tried to implement them. I challenge you to read up on computer and game design.

1280441,0,t3_28jcbp,When it comes to sniping in COD recently I say keep the class because you really cant make a FPS game without sniper rifles thats just common sense in regards to the quickscoping make it to how it was in BO the quickscoping was there but it took a lot more skill to pull off than how it is in BO. I know a ton of you will jump to defend the quickscoping but you guys know for a fact that sniper rifles in BO are way way too overpowered plain amp simple. Another idea that I keep seeing being tossed around is giving the snipers their own lobby which I think is a fantastic idea. You want trickshots and quickscoping kills for your YouTube montages go there to get them stay out of the lobbies where casual game players are playing and dont want to deal with the quickscoping. ,CodAW,cido0bt,1,t5_31g7o

Relative to the other weapons it had the most dominating snipers.CoD  is the most difficult game to snipe in at least on console. The zoomed in scope rendering was laggy the hit detection was strange. I think its certainly harder than in BO.

1624960,0,t1_cjjymwo,Well if they do give mod tools and include Radiant which is the mapping tool anyone could make a map and if its good enough it can be included as DLC. Take CSGO for example every couple of months they release a couple of maps that are voted highest on Steam Workshop and obviously they playlook good. If any of the developers were to take that ideal they could make even more money. So why dont they do it?In Black Ops  Treyarch hosted official servers with default recipes same go with other servers. MW for example had dedicated servers but you didnt gain XP... so they could also take that idea but frankly that should be for mods only.Also joining your friends using the Join Game or Join Party can easily be accessed when theyre in a server parties also go with you in a server CSGO.,CodAW,cjjzpmz,2,t5_31g7o

And the cool stuff isnt to make kids happy. In reality kids are not the primary player base wether you like it or not.

1704113,0,t1_cjtvf19,So give me some examples? Give me things that are fun for everyone that a competitive player would banremove? You keep talking about how its all about money when its not. gt You think the game should only have gun skill and should only be certain kinds of guns and people should only run certain kinds of perks and people should always move etc. You seem to not realize that you are a COD snob. That guy who after getting killed by an IED says OMG FRIGGEN NOOB!I never said any of this. The game has more than gun skill. You can use any gun unless it provides too strong of a TTK for any other gun to compete Think FAL in BO. You can run any kind of perk. There are rarely perk bans in competitive and if there is its for an extreme reason Like Danger Close. Since you gave me one example Ill go after that. Yes when I spawn and walk  feet and hit an IED it annoys me. Spawning and throwing an IED at a common walkway provides nothing to the game. It annoys me and it brings no satisfaction to you. It is an impersonal kill that you did not do anything special to earn. IEDs are only fun for the user. They do not bring joy to the people who get abused by them. The game should be fun and fair for everyone. One person who dedicated themselves to throwing C and planting IEDs with danger close because they cant be bothered to go into a gunfight with another human is cowardly and boring. I would be shocked to see if theres a single person in rCoDAW who is devastated by the removal of C. And If that person exists I hope they dont buy AW and hold their ground. The community of CoD will be a better place without them.Advanced Warfare has just as much fun for casuals stuff than any previous CoD. The difference is the casual community doesnt give a shit about anyone but themselves. If they could they would give themselves permanent danger close and  Cs and  IEDs and juggernaut and one hit riot shields etc. Anything that they might consider fun. Even if its overpowered and ruins the experience for everyone else in the lobby. The competitive community doesnt feel this way. They want it  fair between both sides. If that means the removal of a few perks guns or equipment then so be it. The game will be much more enjoyable for everyone. This subreddit is almost entirely people like you. Very rare to see any competitive stuff upvoted. But you are being downvoted because people dont agree with you. The same people you supposedly are a part of.,CodAW,cjtyrjf,2,t5_31g7o

1731778,0,t1_cjxcunn,Well here is a rough description. The map will have  to  control points spread out across it ABCDE. One team will spawn near the A control point and the other will spawn near the E control point. The control point nearest to your spawn is your home control point.When the match starts the control point that you will need to capture first will be the C control point the control point directly in the middle. Lets say that the team that spawned at A captures it. The next control point that will be contested will be the D control point. Lets say that the team from control point A captures the D control point. They then have to capture the E control point the home control point for the opposing team. If they capture that control point then the game is over.Part of the reason the game mode is called War is because it is sort of based on TugofWar. Its not a great explanation but I hope it helps.

1746549,0,t1_cjz2l9v,I like riot shields. I posted this below but Ill share it again here... let me be honest with you I suck at Call of Duty. Ive been playing since CoD and I have always sucked. I have terrible accuracy I have far more deathstreaks in MW than I do killstreaks and I pretty much get annihilated every match. Were talking  kills  deaths minimum.Im like Jim from The Office playing Call of Duty. Scene for reference.When the riot shield became available it opened the game up to me in a way that otherwise didnt. I actually started enjoying the game because I was able to participate in a way that made it fun and challenging. No I dont camp. My strategy has usually been to alternate between classes. I really liked in MW being able to switch classes on the fly using OMA. Additionally when playing multiplayer I would work with my team. I would serve as the distraction or Id run into an area first to ensure it was safe to enter.The riot shield actually made Call of Duty fun for me. And you know what? Most of the time I still died more than I got kills. People would destroy me so Im not sure why there is such the hate for them when its basically a free kill. The difference is this time Im having fun too.,CodAW,cjzb9v6,3,t5_31g7o

I know a guy who gets motion sickness from playing on any FOV under  and I think Id be a little annoyed if I shelled out for a fancy monitor to play at a higher frame rate that the vast majority of titles allow for and then have CoD say nope sorry. Sure maybe theyre not vital to the game but what if they decided we dont need any resolution over what consoles have or we dont need keyboard support bit of an extreme there or no rebindable controls beyond a few presets? After Ghosts which was a terrible PC port it doesnt surprise me that people are concerned and wanting to know about the state of the game Im not even going to buy it until I know that the PC version is of reasonable quality. Quite frankly the defence it doesnt sell as much doesnt stand well. You dont see crossregional games sell differently because they sell less in Australia. You dont make BluRays in America and DVDs in the UK because there are less customers and less sales. When you create a product as part of a professional team I think its fair to expect a technologically functional and competent product  whether the actual game itself is good or bad is irrelevant but by releasing on PC they are committing themselves to making a functional PC release which does necessitate some of the above features to be at the current industry standard. ,CodAW,cknqu0c,13,t5_31g7o

2032662,0,t3_2i2daw,As someone that has played every CoD to be released since CoD Ghosts is definitely at the bottom of my list. A few reasons that its near the bottom of my list is the competitive aspect for me is nonexistent. The game in general feels very noob friendly Thermal sights tracker sights Amplify perk and a handful of other things As somebody that has played CoD competitively and quite seriously the CoD series has continued to get more and more noob friendly in my eyes but thats just my two cents.,CodAW,cky72gk,-1,t5_31g7o

Lets leave it at that. Stealth was absolutely necessary and not taking those perks meant you were at a huge disadvantage. The fucking fivepoint instantkill superdurable dog. Awful time to kill made engagements more about who saw who first rather than who saw who and chose to take a shot but only poked them once and is now in a gunfight. Bad maps.

Also playing the objective is not the only way you can help the team.

2277182,0,t3_2larsk,First congratulations on an excellent game launch!  Now the only improvement I can think of thats actually can be truly seen is an option for a bumper jumper control scheme for us console players.  I like the button layouts but Id like to be able to switch it so that crouch and jump are on Left and Right Bumper for Xbox or L and R for PlayStation.  Also I think it would be great to be able to see what attachments a weapon on the ground has.  In Black Ops  it would tell you that a weapon had  Red Dot Sight Select Fire and FMJ.. This was great because the in game model didnt show two of these attachments.  In Ghosts if a weapon had two attachments good luck figuring out what they were!  It was scary to grab a weapon from the Ammo Crate because it could be semiauto for all we knew.  Otherwise this is a great game!,CodAW,clt6fcs,1,t5_31g7o

One would think with an extra year they might have time to work some of this stuff out. Another point to bring up would be running Alphas and Betas like other games. Test out the servers and matchmaking. Do tweaks before release. Sure release day the numbers will be much higher but at least they have some data to work with.

2305844,0,t3_2lmx0p,Thats like saying There will be pickles then offering you cucumbers. Sorry but they lied. Servers arent dedicated.  Lets look at the definition of a dedicated server  A dedicated server is a single computer in a network reserved for serving the needs of the network. For example some networks require that one computer be set aside to manage communications between all the other computers.  This is not done in AW. Having an alleged mix of dedicated and listen servers completely contradicts what dedicated servers are. Some people who are near the dedicated server sites might benefit while others wont. Most of the time they wont. If youve been playing recently youll notice how poor the performance is and its obvious that its only been using listen servers thus far.  So in conclusion. If they said We will have a mix of dedicated servers and listen servers which some of you if any will benefit from. Then I would agree with you. But they didnt. They said there will be dedicated servers. And they lied.,CodAW,clwpw3r,3,t5_31g7o

Doubtful... but lets assume hes not lying here. The person James says that  million people bought BO and only  million accounts registered for the hiscores.The person who replied states that his friend played a single game of BO multiplayer and sits at .x millionth place instantly invalidating the James statement. Not only that but thats on Xbox alone. Incorporating the sales of the rest of BO on other consoles amp PC its pretty evident that those facts were completely and utterly false.The only opposing argument was that a multiple people play on the same account and over multiple consoles and b the leaderboards were wrong.

Im not sure if this is a feature or if the population is strong enough right now to make that a rare occurrence but either way Im happy with it. Ghosts was terrible about that. Id get dumped in a match full of campers or noob tubers leave out of frustration and get put back sometimes even two or three times. It got to the point that Id just close the game and restart it if the same map came up because it was faster than waiting for it to load so I could leave the proper way. I really dont think that not getting put in the same lobbies over and over again is redeeming enough to call this the least annoying COD though. Id give that title to BO. I get a hopeless feeling on certain maps that no matter how much time I spend playing Ill always be getting killed from behind or from above because somebody got lucky timing. I know I get that same luck against other players but it isnt consistent enough to allow for any sort of confidence. Ive got a feeling that things will change over time but for now this game is annoying simply because I cant get any control over the maps and there are always threats coming from just about every angle. At least its fun though. That makes the bad stuff easier to put up with. I havent wanted to pull my hair out nearly as much as I did with Ghosts for the first four months.

You dont have to run it on every class.

Also the perk system is better.  You can customize your play style more.  The killstreaks are half and half.  And lastly the guns are great.  Every gun is fun to use in Ghosts some what.

2587439,0,t1_cmwb08m,I think I addressed this adequately in my post when I said The problem with SBMM is that it in its current state it is favouring skill over connection. This should be fixed so that stable connection is the most important criteria to be met. Then SBMM should be applied so that when  players with relatively similar connections are looking for a game they are filtered by skill level.If SBMM was working as intended then it wouldnt be sacrificing your connection just so that it matches you with an equally skilled player. It would find a pool of players that all have similar connections and pings THEN apply skill filtering. Im sure that SBMM coding doesnt use lag as a means to balance player skill... its just that currently it is searching for players that are as good as you regardless of the fact that they arent geographically close to you hence giving you lag.,CodAW,cmwbduo,1,t5_31g7o

Youre essentially saying what Ive long suspected when it comes to these type of threads. Its not that it was a killwhore on YOUR team preventing you from winning due to his evil agenda of kills and zero flags but actually that you are upset there are guys spawn trapping on the other teams racking up kills....So its not about your team its about the enemy.

I have a life I have a wife and kid and job and I dont have the time to even enjoy the games I have let alone fuck up others time.

Better players realize that someone behind them should almost always kill them so having a sensitivity high enough to maybe possibly turn around is pointless.

Otherwise to me and many others you come off as lazy and tacky.  Its the same feeling I kept getting about SHG with those Christmas themed Supply Drops this week.

2760744,0,t1_cnhu2g6,. Sliding gives you the typical red circle as if it is an Exo Movement. I believe this to be because of the burst of air that is used to propel you forward as you slide. Melee does not relay the red circle like normal Exo Movements. . The use of your Exo Launcher doesnt show you on the enemy radar no matter what you are using. . Essentially yes. There is still a very very faint outline but it is easily over looked. . I dont think cloaking is really necessary and it has varying effects.

2760902,0,t3_2roxeh,I can see where you are coming from but CoD isnt really an immersive game like Destiny sought out to be. CoD has always been a wham bam thank you maam styled game. But I totally agree looking at the cars on Comeback certainly makes one think that they really dont care similar to sweeping the dirt under the rug. I think with AW they made a refreshing step to make something different. Maybe with a little more time they could have ironed out these wrinkles we see. But time Is money and companies are rushing stuff out too quick. When games get delayed I usually get happy. BF was shit for a long ass time and still feels crappy in some regards. With next gen coming out and competition so on its not surprising that the game isnt as polished as it should. Cracks me up how many people post saying I know a programmer and they say its an easy fix first of all people who say that kind of stuff is full of shit. They have guys making major money trying to make these games if it was easy it would have been done long ago. ,CodAW,cnhwjxp,6,t5_31g7o

2791383,0,t1_cnld4w6,Well.My Problem with the Propipe is you said burst is for range. Im fine with the ProPipe having more damage over range im fine with it slow fire rate in a full auto mode if we had one. But at this fire rate as soon as they start to move its really hard to hit the burst and yes if i hit  out of  shots at range i need a second burst where if i had the Dynamo at range i would deal less damage and needed  Shots but i already need a second burst if i miss ONE shot at range.But the Burst of the Dynamo fires way faster so i can get the second burst also faster.The ProPipe is a close range burst weapon in the range from  inches the propipe is the best variant for the AMR anything further In my honest opinion the Dynamo outshines the Propipe if you cannt land every shot of your burst Which is honestly spoken pretty hard in AWAlso about the NoobtubeI dont like it. Yeah i got quad feeds with one tube yes its a beast in HC Dom but i prefer having Red Dot QD and ARSilencerRapidfire on my AMR i can play better this way. Maybe its a matter of preferance but as someone who loves the AMR and has the Propipe In my Opinion and Playstyle the Propipe is worse then the stock because it fires to slowly for meAlso i only liked the Chicom from Bos SMGs,CodAW,cnldbwa,1,t5_31g7o

Me personally its just harder to get  and  games compared to games past. I dont see these huge differences of  then  since I use more than one custom class and adjust.If I see enemy wants to sit back or perch on rooftops Ill switch to AK and play more of a slower paced aggressive style. Other wise Ill get in and out of their spawnswithout breaking them with silenced SMG.

2864337,0,t1_cntnjp9,That sounds like the ridiculous sense of entitlement most people around here have. The game is not created the Cater YOU. The game was created to try to appeal to the vast majority. Me and my friends enjoy playing CoD but have never been too good at it especially in Black Ops . What you cry out to be a nuisance to you and a game ruiner serves as a great feature for others. I enjoy AW because its the first CoD since MW where I actually have a positive kd. But please forgive my enjoyment that is causing you to whine so profusely and stop you from pub stomping noobs like me throughout previous iterations of the franchise.,CodAW,cntocja,6,t5_31g7o

2869811,0,t1_cnuaft5,thats not true.  some people are naturally more skilled have better handeye coordination reaction time etc.  in addition to that not everyone has the time to put in to practice and get a ton better.  You will get infinitely more benefit from practicing against players near your skill than you will if you are watching a kill cam for  of the match.  Call of duty actually always has had SBMM maybe just hasnt been as advertised.  I have put in a lot of hours in CoD over the years yet ive never had a Kd more than . or so in any game.  . in this game.  It makes wayyyy more sense just to match up similar skill levels as there is no tangible benefit of not doing so apart from the very skilled players who get to stomp the bad players ,CodAW,cnuar1p,1,t5_31g7o

2877215,0,t1_cnv29y8,Thats the problem a  hit to kill at all ranges with the slowest rate of firehighest fire time of any of the ARs excluding the MK which shouldnt even be in the game at this point is a massive disadvantage for this weapon. SMGs and other ARs have similar hit to kill stats but with much higher rates of fire and dominate the short to medium ranges. Snipers have much lower rates of fire but are much more powerful over longer ranges. The AE just appears to be a weapon with minimal advantagesreasons to use right now. That said I still like to use it with the attachments I mentioned its a fun gun....just needs a small buff to bring it up to par.

I would recommend adding Toughness but it wouldnt be viable with your class as you would have to drop Blast Suppressor or Scavenger the former being vital to a stealth playstyle and the latter being used as an ad hoc Sleight of Hand.

You only get to choose from  total perks unlike the  you have now and you are limited to two from each tier of perks.  Each tier contains  perks.

3286111,0,t3_2xp6yw,I think people are just struggling to adapt to completely new gameplay.  You can soundwhore but you have to learn the new sounds.  When you hear footsteps boost to cover ADS and turn.   The closer a boost is the more detail you can hear in it.  if someone boosts literally right next to you there is an audible buhmp tick hiss but if they are further away all you hear is the buhump  It is all about details.  Do you get flanked more in this game?  Try using the map to cover your flank routes.  Always know where you are going to hit for cover.  If there is an area where you cannot hit cover quickly enough dont go there.  I personally have the same KDR I have had in other CODs and it is continually going up.  I have memorized maps movement sounds and flank routes.   Granted it took longer but believe it or not there are still only  ways to get to any given area on a map.  Example  Horizon.  One of the better tiered maps.  It has  levels.  SnipingHigh Points Ground level Bunker tunnels and Bunker Ground levels.  The center of the map has  locations you can enterexit from.   of Which require a boostTier increase. The rest of the map is a circle.   So from the outside of a circle you can control  Exit locations for middle.  You can hear the boost to determine if they are exiting via the top tiers and you can rotate to various outside control areas.  Same thing can be done for comeback riot Terrace.  Instead of viewing the maps as traditional  lane designs think of them as  circles that overlap and work to control the choke points at which you have to travel to change map control areas.  GT BCBxSocio Vex . KD  . WL.  Note I am not the end all strategist just sharing what has worked for me.  Try to see this as a completely new game.  What was done before will not work here. ,CodAW,cp2ucn5,1,t5_31g7o

3336512,0,t3_2yb791,I use it more than toughness I avoid TDM like the plague and mostly play Hardpoint. Threat Detection UAV alone is enough to make me too paranoid to not use low profile on almost every class. UAVs are a near constant presence and in this game people can cross a map fast enough to get you while youre attempting to shoot it down with the surprisingly slow feeling stingers seriously it feels like they take ages to hit anything that isnt a person.      They honestly should make some modules incompatible because threat detection alone makes the UAV one of the strongest streaks in the game. If youre a rusher sure the default UAV doesnt affect you but the TD module means any enemy youre hoping to take down will have their sights on you before you round the corner. Using Low Profile I dont have to worry about that.      It just gets irritating that I already feel like Blast Suppressor is almost required but then I feel like this other perk needs to be added... I hardly touch toughness even. Even in other UAV heavy CoDs Ive been able to comfortably pass up the stealth perks on some classes. Its why I use so many perk greeds.,CodAW,cp8l6em,1,t5_31g7o

Maybe spend an hour in that and you might just have a little fun while youre at it.  Or dont and just keep complaining until SHGActv moved the maps over in a month.

3440913,0,t3_2zlvjo,Except if youre a hardcore mode player. This game has been nothing but a middle finger to all of them the whole time. Why have gamemodes like Hardcore if youre not going to bother listening to feedback about them and basically give its constituents the middle finger? How you might ask? Using an uncontrollable killstreak like the bombing run or especially the walker tanks gets you kicked out of any match you use them in because of teamkilling. So basically your team loses its best players whenever this happens. If this sort of bullshit was STILL happening in normal modes thered be chaos on the forums about it. They must know by now that this is an annoying problem but still refuse to even acknowledge it. Why? Who knows maybe they just dont give a shit.  You STILL cant even select your killstreak reward ingame. You have to guess. It took months MONTHS! To finally see custom appearances finally implemented into the game for HC modes despite the fact COD offered buyable microDLC to everyone meaning if you were a HC player who bought the lightning helmet and eco fuck you it doesnt get worn in matches. It was only FINALLY fixed recently. HC players who spent the same amount of money as you did for DLC or a Seasons pass dont even get the decency of a DLC playlist. They were thrown a moshpit list which was essentially Sledgehammer telling them to fuck off.Now Ill reiterate my point If youre going to keep offering modes like Hardcore then properly support them instead of making the HC crowd feel like theyre unimportant or second class players. I dont care what the population count between core and hardcore is. Support your game modes you offer not just the ones that are convenient for you. Some peoples complaints are just trivial and for the sake of bitching but let me just say that the complaints I just listed off about HC modes are legitimate ones that would piss EVERYONE OFF if we were all stuck playing them. Any time an HC player has something to bitch about thats as bad as these complaints here they deserve to be heard. Not because theyre the annoying vocal minority but because their game modes truly SUCK this Call of Duty and its not fair. ,CodAW,cpkhn9d,2,t5_31g7o

Running a suppressor to eliminate the muzzle flash on the already funky irons on Insanity makes a ton of sense I will definitely be using that. So far Im up in the air as to whether this gun NEEDS a foregrip like a Steed does I will play with combos but I think a stock would do me more right vs. foregrip. I always always run extended mags on BAL or AK....having said that has anyone had any experiencesuccessfailure with using dual mags instead of extended mags on Insanity? Either way I can almost always see myself running scavenger with this weapon Ive been burning through even extended mags way too fast...Im hardly super accurate in general but I feel like theres a steep learning curve with this weaponirons.

3517541,0,t3_30jphd,I believe that Exo suits were a pretty late addition to AW and were a reaction to Titanfall.    The reason is because there is no way they played these maps and thought the pacing and spawns were acceptable. A lot of the maps are also way too similar open outskirts with a building in the center or they can be traversed in seconds.    Theres also things like Exo abilities hardly being in the Single player and the lack of weapon balancing in multiplayer. Of all the elements that are in AW Exo abilities were executed the best and everything else was a bit wonky.

The setting from right where the mission where you enter the ship begins where you go from the bridge to the ship. The map could have two levels one level being the bridge and the other being the ship and you could boost and boost onto intermediate objects to get from the two. Maybe you can have like one lane that runs under the bridge to get from side to side with out having to jump up or down or have the bridge as either the edge of the map or the center.

3873756,0,t3_34spdt,Hardpoint  try learn rotations and do what your teammates arent slay if they are in the hills play the objective if they are kill whoring also would suggest a trophy system class or trophy and overclock if you like CTF  try rotating back to your flag after you spawn this kinda stops both teams pushing one side then turning it into a cat and mouse chase eachother round the map that usually happens. Also once again you can push whichever side of the map the random people on your team arent doing. Uplink  try not to be too focused on the ball ie too many people in ranked will have  enemies up around them and just grab the ball and die. Try and slay around the ball first and be smart. You can also throw the ball in particular places which make it reset for  seconds use this when you are up points to waste time or do give your team a chance to recoverslay and get map control. examples are on top of garage on detroit or through the black hole in glass on comeback Search  prob the hardest to give tips. Firstly atm for some reason everyone suddenly thinks theyre a pro sniper and will have an overkill class with a thermal mors. So be careful of that and dont use it unless youre actually going to be useful and get a first bloodpick. You can try playing really slow and waiting for your opponents to make a mistake or get too aggressive or try and get super aggressive and cut bomb pushes off although this might be hard without people on your team to back you up and trade kills but it kinda depends what suits you. Nades are a helping hand on defence to stop pushes. On attack in ranked people seem to hardly ever get bomb down so trying to force a play and grabbing bomb and planting fairly quick works a lot. As I said search is prob the hardest. Other than that watch some pro stuff on yt or learn from better players that you come up againstwith!

4036526,0,t1_crfbvnm,Its kinda viable and it kinda isnt. First off it has ads spread which it shouldnt. Second of all its a marksman rifle that rewards the fastest trigger finger which I get but imo thats not smart balancing. There is also the awkward fact that the mk needs a hk range and more damage to be viable and once that happens the epm becomes less useful. They could solve this conundrum by giving the mk more damage and a hk range and while we are at it increasing the recoil slightly giving the epm a hk range that is further than the mks but also adding a decent amount of recoil to prevent trigger finger and modded controller abuse.This way people who want to use the old spammy epm can use variants like the bonafide or the legit wgrip both of which would have the same short hk range as the mk.,CodAW,crge7jx,1,t5_31g7o

4226971,0,t3_39b61t,Wow you guys all seem to be way too defensive about this game. Its not a bad CoD but in my experience most just dont like it as much as the old ones. Theres a reason that Treyarch has made it extremely clear that there will not be exos in BLOPS and that they are doing their best to keep all gunfights in the players current FOV. AW is the most random CoD to date. The exos allow you to fly across the map in a matter of seconds making map control a thing of the past. SBMM definitely has something to do with players inabilities to feel like they are as good at this game as they were at past CoDs but the maps and mechanics are more at fault in this regard imo.One thing that is nice is that AW definitely rewards gunskill more than any previous CoD though.,CodAW,cs21ur2,2,t5_31g7o
4228030,0,t1_cs206fh,Knifing is still pretty stupid about as stupid as it has been in previous games. I havent actually seen a CoD game get knifing right. Its inconsistent as fuck. You can punch a guy two inches in front of you and miss and then when he turns around after continuing to run and punch you from two feet away you die two feet might be a bit of an exageration but punching is still pretty noob friendly. If you were talking about actual knifing exoless then the only what that it seems to work is by having a tac knife on a pistol.Plenty of people still use the Oraclelike effect on their UAVs because not everyone uses Low Profile. There has always been a Low Profile type perk since at least MW Coldblooded Ghost Assassin Ghost I forget what it was called in Ghosts ironically not Ghost so not really been a factor.RNG can go to hell.I hadnt actually noticed the less camping thing but now I think about it youre right.As for explosives the majority of explosives arent overpowered correct but Im goign to have to disagree with you on semtexes and frags. Danger Close and two lethals will most likely fuck anyone up. Hell one probably will if you cant dodge quick enough remembering that if youre even slightly damaged and that grenade indicator is even slightly red it always seems to kill you.Gun skill. Oh gun skill. This is a fun one. The problem with AW is that firstly the basic guns are inconsistent even against the same gun same attachments none variant. Oh I got three hit markers including a headshot I like that they added this but it makes it more infuriating when they sponge but you can go ahead and shoot me twice in the foot and I will take that death. Saying that the reverse can happen. Or I could get three hitmarkers at close range with an SMG but then someone with the same SMG with come along and two bullet me from halfway across the map. And dont even get my started on Variants. They dictate this games gun skill. If you are heavily antivariants like myself I refuse to use them unless I pick them up then you have to seriously step your game up because  of the people you come up against will be using variants. And probably badass Elite variants. That they probably bought. Thus making AW the first pay to win CoD to ever be developed. But even if they didnt sink a couple hundred of your chosen currency into ASDs then they got lucky with RNG which admittedly is not their fault. But gun skill is significantly lower among players using variants than players using nonvariants. Im not saying that a ten year old newbie can come on pick up a Steed and wreck shop but the gun skill required to kill most people with variants isnt as high. But even when coming up against people without variants I feel the guns are jsut too inconsistent and Im probably rambling a bit now but in previous games if you had first shot chances are you were getting the kill depending on the gun they had whereas in AW you can get first show with a BAL down mid street of Detroit get second shot they turn around two shot you while you get your third shot off while they are using an ASM. Becasue SMGs outgun ARs at range. Sometimes.But I completely agree about the learning curve unforgiving skill gap etc. I came to AW a week after it released so a week after most people had already learned the mechanics and after playing all CoDs since  all Halos bar  Unreal Tournament Titanfall Destiny a bunch of other FPS games and I sucked. Hard. Usually FPS skills are fairly transferable. Titanfall Destiny and Halo have a pretty diverse skillbase and are harder to get into when youre used to CoD but comapred to AW theyre peanuts and it seems that even now after more than half a year people are still largely sticking to previous playstyles while having trouble adapting to AW.Personally another reason I dont like AW over other CoDs its so easy to rush spawns in under five seconds on most maps theyre so small. I mean I take complete advantage of this because either no one expects it in Ranked or no one expects you to expect it and it just happens so fast no matter what the map is.TLDR AW is worse than previous games only pay to win CoD developed cant wait for BlOps .,CodAW,cs2682x,4,t5_31g7o

I first used the base IMR loved it got the Thunder Tusk and Boar Strike pretty soon. Used the Boar Strike forever and loved it even though its arguably worse than the base variant. I even sold at least one Impact before I realized how good it can be thanks to this subreddit and the helpful stat chart. It truly does depend on playstyle.The Impact takes one less shot to kill at  units which is just over  feet. Most engagements in AW take place well within that range. In fact the base IMR does more damage from  units. The Impact is my favorite variant because I like to use the IMR for long range work.

I understand that it is a hard feeling to stomach where you have paid to have access to all game content but that is not the case.

I still abide by the no more single items in drops just leaves us with  item and a CP. I only get doubles now and one item is always a care pack or rapid supply.
