10703844,0,t3_5t2u9m,When we were there frontier was awful in a house of five the first month was decent speed but after that we couldnt even watch a show on Netflix. They told us to turn off all the phones in the house if we wanted to watch a movie and literally not use any other devices at the same time. Sorry but that isnt going to happen with a bunch of college kids. We liked rise broadband it was twice as much but we never had a problem with it being slow although it seems like once a month or so there would be work done on a tower somewhere and we would be without it for a day or two. ,Elko,ddk0st9,1,t5_2t25o
