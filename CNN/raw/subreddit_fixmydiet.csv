3444024,0,t3_2yjs57,Alright mate heres the deal. Dieting sucks. And you gotta do it forever. Thats why they say its a lifestyle not a diet.You can make it easier for yourself though. Cut carbs as much as possible. Now is this the only way? No. Is it the best way? Certainly not. Cutting carbs will help you with two things though taste and cravings. All those calories you ate as carbs are now free to eat as protein or fat. And for the taste you WILL reset your taste buds. It will take you anywhere from  days. You see our taste buds acclimate to our diet. Meaning if you eat a lot of sugar each day youll need more and more of it to satisfy your taste buds and with that your cravings. After  days of no or very low sugar only from fruits everything will taste too sweet for ya. It helps a lot.Wow Im ranting so much. Anyways there is a palette of veggies to choose from. Experiment! Also with fish. Try fish canned in oil. Drain the oil eat the fish. Convenient high protein. Try to drink only water sometimes milk. Not smart to drink your calories if youre trying to lose weight. Your meals should be high protein meats eggs  find a way you like them internet is your friend beans fish moderate fat nuts and seeds and some animal fat is OK low carb find veggies you like eat loads of them especially green leafy ones cut out potatoes and corn! berries are best fruits apples are okay tooEat two or three times a day but make it count meaning you can eat like a king big meals instead of six times a day but each meal is like a spoonful of food and then you have to wait for the next one.Your hormones will get used to this type of diet and youll learn to listen to your body you wont be hungry often sometimes you wont even feel like eating your second or third meal because youre so full from the last one.tldr find protein sources you like there has to be a veggie or  you also like eat em together for each meal sometimes throw some fruits and nutsseeds in there youre good to go.,fixmydiet,cpkuecx,1,t5_313s4
4504841,0,t3_3ch3sz,gt You might notice a lack of vegetables. I really really hate them.WITHOUT JUDGEMENT seriously Theres a certain honesty and childishness in your post  its an innocent sort of thing but I point it out not to embarrass or shame you but to encourage you to finish developing your adult tastes.  Little kids hate vegetables.  Like you they hate em.  Adults like them not because theyre adults  not because they should  but because their parents sat on them long enough to force them to eat their vegetables  every day  long enough for them to acquire a taste for them.    ITS OKAY!   But you are your disciplinarian now and maybe you should work on this.  Small portions  keep it achievable.Mix stuff you dont like with stuff you do like  gradually build from there.  Go ahead  throw some broccoli florets into the spaghetti sauce  not a lot but a tablespoon or two.Google  how to learn to like vegetablesSome good tips there.,fixmydiet,csyhidn,2,t5_313s4

5752113,0,t1_cx9ot4j,Possibly.  I would just check your bodyfat  with a caliper and see what it really is.  If it is  try to get down to  amp see what the change is like then go from there.  But to get rid of most of the fat in stubborn areas a lot of people will have to get in the  or below range.And actually  lbs gives you a BMI of . with Normal Weight ranging from ...   So thats lower end of normal but you wouldnt be into Underweight range until   lbs,fixmydiet,cxa3s4i,1,t5_313s4

I would bulkcut the same  lbs repeatedly for  years weight changing  lb per week max in either direction  months per bulkcut cycle until you have built a good amount of muscle mass then try to cut down further below  at that point.  Sadly it takes years of work and all you can really hope for in a couple months is to drop a small amount of body fat.Also this is a point of controversy but you may not want to make soy such a cornerstone of your diet.  It does not affect all people in the same way so it could be completely safe for you.  But there are some reported cases of over consumption leading to feminizing effects in men so keep that in mind at least.gtSoy Protein Powder gtSoy protein is a mixed bag. While research has shown its an allaround effective source of protein for building muscle its also a source of ongoing controversy for men.  gtAccording to some research regular intake of soy foods has feminizing effects in men due to estrogenlike molecules found in soybeans called isoflavones. gtFor instance a study conducted by Harvard University researchers analyzed the semen of  men and compared it against their soy and isoflavone intake during the three previous months.  What they found is that both isoflavone and soy intake were associated with a reduction in sperm count. Men in the highest intake category of soy foods had on average  million sperm per milliliter fewer than men who did not eat soy foods. gtOn the other hand a study conducted by scientists from the University of Guelph had  men eat low or high levels of isoflavones from soy protein for  days and found that it didnt affect semen quality.  Furthermore literature reviews like those conducted by researchers from Loma Linda University and St. Catherine University suggest that neither soy food nor isoflavones alter male hormone levels.  gtWhat gives then? gtWell there isnt a simple answer just yet but we do know that soys effects in the body can vary depending on the presence or absence of certain intestinal bacteria. These bacteria which are present in  to  percent of people metabolize an isoflavone in soy called daidzein into an estrogenlike hormone called equol.  gtIn a study published in  researchers at Peking University found that when men with the equolproducing bacteria ate high amounts of soy food for three days their testosterone levels dropped while their estrogen levels rose.  These effects were not seen in women regardless of equol production or lack thereof. gtRelated to this is a study conducted with women by scientists at Sungkyunkwan University which found that in a highestrogen environment isoflavones suppressed estrogen production and in a lowestrogen environment they increased estrogen production.  gtResearch has also shown that soy protein contains substances that inhibit the digestion of protein molecules and the absorption of other nutrients as well as several known allergens.  gtWhile there is research that indicates soy might have special benefits for women such as reducing the risk of heart disease and breast cancer other research casts doubt on these findings.  And to the contrary studies have shown that soy can even stimulate the growth of cancer cells.  gtYet another issue that we have to deal with when we eat soy is the fact that the vast majority of soybeans grown in the United States are genetically modified  percent according to government data . gtThe subject of genetically modified foods is incredibly heated and too complex to fully address in this book but the safest bet at the moment is to avoid genetically modified foods as much as possible until more research is done on the potential longterm health effects in humans. gtSo all things considered I think you understand why I generally recommend for men to avoid soy if at all possible. There are just too many unknowns for my liking.Matthews Michael .
