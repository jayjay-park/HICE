Off and on I had been working with him for about  months broken up between March and September of last year. The last shoot for the soap opera though was the straw that broke the camels back. After that I didnt hear from him till a few weeks later when I finally decided to contact him to find out about my paycheck. He refused to talk to me except through his son. Apparently they were able to finish the show without me. Last I heard they had the premiere of it where they charged  a ticket and for  you could do a meet and greet with the cast.I suppose I shouldve seen this coming seeing as the first week I was editing his talk show for him I asked what had happened to their last editor and his son said He just stopped showing up one day.,Filmmakers,cege7wh,1,t5_2r1ip

46023,0,t3_1uktp7,Ill talk about mine.I was planning on shooting a thriller as my last film for my final semester in college. I had the screenplay finished with actors crew location lights everything set in place. I also shot footage prior to the shoot dates of a character getting his head bashed in with a mallet scooped mashed tomatoes seedless watermelon and food coloring into a mannequin head. I was happy to get this portion out of the way.The day before the shoot I had my Jeep packed and ready to go. As the next day came I woke up to messages from the majority of my crew telling me they werent going to be able to make it. I lost my boom operator sound mixer st and nd AC gaffer grip and AD all in a matter of one hour through text messages. I called around hoping to find people to help me but I was unfortunate to not find anyone. People were either too busy or committed to other shoots.Dont panic I thought to myself. Just utilize your available crew. Nope things turn worse. An hour and a half before we were suppose to depart to the shooting location my lead actress calls me and tells me shes not able to do the film because she was experiencing anxiety and panic resulting in her cutting herself apparently shes had problems in the past. At that point I didnt know what to think anymore. I was worried for her safety and did my best to talk to her. In the end the shoot officially fell through. I thought losing crew was a punch in the gut but having your lead actress bail completely changed everything. I also had to take back a generator I rented so I could get at least some of the money back.I had understudies on hand for safety but they werent able to do it either after I explained to them about the possibility of this happening. My lesson learned from this ALWAYS HAVE A BACKUP.Instead of pacing with my thumb up my ass I jumped onto my computer and began typing a brand new script that was similar to the concept of the original screenplay but the story location and characters were different. I wound up losing another one of the actors because he didnt want to do a different script. He really liked the original and I dont blame him. Thankfully my other lead actor was a good sport from the beginning and still wound up doing this brand new film. Another actor who is a friend of mine also came to the rescue for a particular role.The final crew count during the filming process was THREE  three friggin people myself DP and gaffer. Aside from directing I also had to run sound slate and even acted as DP when my director of photography had to leave. My friend who was acting as gaffer really helped pull this through. He ended up jumping on a secondary camera and filmed scenes himself while I helped him set up lights as we progressed.Thankfully we finished the film. I am still very bummed that it didnt turn out what it was originally supposed to be. I still wound up using the footage of the head getting bashed in because it was too awesome to not use. Nonetheless I was pleased to hand in a final project which allowed me to graduate. Now I have a great steady job in the media and videography field as well as a story to tell of what to donot do.Here is the film if you are interested Kill Or Be KilledIts decent at best in my opinion. But I was happy that I walked away from it with something rather than nothing at all.Also I found out the real reason my actress bailed  she wanted to go see a hiphop group that was performing out in the universities quad on the day of the shoot.Fellow filmmakers by all means please help each other out.

56057,0,t1_cekmiku,Actually no the RAW format for both Arri and Canon are similar.  Both are raw sensor data nonbayered noninterpolated.  If its just a single frame the D will have much better quality but it wont get anywhere near the Arri when video is involved.The difference is that your D doesnt record in RAW video natively but rather in a highly compressed MJPEG or another bit  codec depending on which version you have.There are ways to record in RAW with the D but the D really isnt designed for video which is why it needs to line skip to get down to video resolution.  Its got all these extra pixels that cant be made into video efficiently.The Arri Alexa for example is a K sensor .MPs you can get a full raster RAW image of that .MPs and have a supersampled K video.  ,Filmmakers,cekt8th,9,t5_2r1ip

Its less about running through the script and more about allowing your actors to come to an understanding in regards to your vision of the characters as it relates to the script. Good directors will use rehearsals to focus on the directing of the actors and achieving performance before ever being on an actual set. Rehearsals allow you to improv without burning up valuable time on set to see what works for you and what doesnt. Do whatever you feel you need to do in rehearsals to get the performance youre looking for and then practice practice practice so that when the lights are on cameras are rolling and you call action everything happens as second nature.,Filmmakers,ceonnlk,6,t5_2r1ip

138059,0,t3_1vnvsi,In any discussion about film theory it helps to be specific about what youre implying if anything. Explaining the relationship between filmmaking and a slew of ways of understanding the world we live in is not something you do in a couple sentences. As a former academic I could write  page essays on the relationship between film and each one of the things you listed on its own. But...Ill try and answer your question succinctly.  Filmmaking is an art and like other artists filmmakers draw inspiration from all forms of life experience. Sometimes the lessons we learn from the failures and successes of our own life endeavors are physical but if were lucky theyre emotional. Abstract. Mental. Its these successes and failures more so than the physical adversities in life that yield what I like to think is the most important qualities a filmmaker can have perspective amp wisdom.  Its one of the many reasons a filmmakers work generally becomes more informed and complex as heshe gets older  you get a better sense of the way the world actually works. Not in terms of your career or business per say although if youre doing it right those improve as well but because you know people better. You know their motivations better. You know the nature of things and the truth about relationships. Youve been through the ringer of life have come out the other side and been fine. As a result I look at filmmaking as a way to learn about life and the people you come across in it. You spend your time exploring looking for the interesting people and stories so that when you get to know them you can realize their beauty and incorporate it into your filmmaking into your style into the signature that is your art work. All with the goal of creating something beautiful that can connect with people and make an impact once you put it out into the world. Filmmaking is a profoundly noble endeavor in my opinion.,Filmmakers,ceu5l8c,2,t5_2r1ip

Youre telling me thats wrong?  Of course there are other ways to do it  I am not arguing with that.  YOU are saying the need to back up to get a shot is NEVER there.  Which is just wrong!  If youve never had to do it to get the look you wanted then YOU are the one lacking experience!Yes a wider lens would solve the problem some of the times.  Other times a wider lens will distort things in a way I dont want it to or not give me the perspective I am looking for.  Sometimes just sometimes to get the look I want I simply have to... wait for it.... BACK UP!LET ME BREAK IT DOWN FOR YOU I never said it was impossible to get any shot with a smaller frame size  I am talking personal preference in solving an inconvenience I commonly encounter.  Thats all.Just like every post you make you presume to know the person you are talking to their experience and their intelligence.  Which ironically just discredits yourself.

By investing gradually I kept my debt at the constant amount of . and made sure that I wasnt getting in over my head by investing in gear that would be over the top of my client load at the time. As I got more work I made more money and then invested more of that money into my business. The approach I just discussed can also be balanced with the If you build it they will come approach but the allin approach can be disastrous if not executed properly. I know Im straying off subject here a bit but I have seen a lot of artists go under by taking a k loan from the bank and then not getting the work they dreamed they would after making such a substantial investment. For all I know you may already have a ton of experience an amazing reel and a solid client load to boot so this may all be irrelevant advice for you but I figured Id say it anyway just in case.

When there are real light sources in your shot use them to influence your behind the scenes lighting as well.Here are a couple examples that immediately come to mind for concepts that are very creative but wouldnt necessarily require a burdensome budget just a simple light kit.The Weekend Wicked Games TFK twigs Papi Pacify Left Boy Black Dress Lindsey Stirling Shadows Secondly Id suggest going handheld rather than grabbing static shots for your closeups. Youre recording some stringwork that looks great for a shot or two but quickly becomes boring as your audience continues to watch. Do a take where you grab closeups of EVERYTHING.

354745,0,t3_1y571c,Back when I was PAing I worked on a reality pilot that was being produced by Rob Lowe here in Washington DC. Typical PA stuff throughout the  day shoot until the final day in the afternoon. One of the producers pulled me aside and asked me to take my personal car to pick up Rob from a restaurant take him back to his hotel to change and then meet at the final location of the day.I pick Rob up from Legal Seafood and get stuck in DC traffic. I ended up being stuck in the car with hime for about an hour in total and had the coolest chat with him talking about the business and my aspirations of being a TV writer. At the time Robs autobiography Stories I Only Tell My Friends was in the works and while he was with me his agent sent the dust jacket summary of the book to him so that he could proofread it. He asked if he could read it out loud to me so I could help him catch any errors. Heres the summary that he read to meA wryly funny and surprisingly moving account of an extraordinary life lived almost entirely in the public eyeA teen idol at fifteen an international icon and founder of the Brat Pack at twenty and one of Hollywoods top stars to this day Rob Lowe chronicles his experiences as a painfully misunderstood child actor in Ohio uprooted to the wild counterculture of midseventies Malibu where he embarked on his unrelenting pursuit of a career in Hollywood.The Outsiders placed Lowe at the birth of the modern youth movement in the entertainment industry. During his time on The West Wing he witnessed the surreal nexus of show business and politics both on the set and in the actual White House. And in between are deft and humorous stories of the wild excesses that marked the eighties leading to his quest for family and sobriety.Never meanspirited or salacious Lowe delivers unexpected glimpses into his successes disappointments relationships and oneofakind encounters with people who shaped our world over the last twentyfive years. These stories are as entertaining as they are unforgettable.It was while he was reading it to me that it really hit me who I was sitting next to. It was a really surreal experience and one I remember to this day.Heres a photo from the shoot Robs on the left obviously and Im the guy on the right hauling the monitor,Filmmakers,cfhjb5h,7,t5_2r1ip

446173,0,t3_1z69im,One of the reasons that an XLR cable is effective at eliminating Electromagnetic interference is because it is a balanced cable two signals sent simultaneously  degrees out of phase.  However a balanced cable only remains balanced if the connection is outputting a balanced signal.  . mm connections are usually wired for stereo and thus are not balanced.  I couldnt definitively confirm but I doubt the connection on either the videomic or the recorder is balanced since . mm is usually intended for short cable runs.  The best solution would be to find a cable using shielding techniques to reduce EMI and RFI.  The best way to do this may be to use adapters and a high quality XLR as they usually have good shielding or to find a well shielded .mm of appropriate length.TLDRThe best option would be the more shielded cable.,Filmmakers,cfr0eh5,1,t5_2r1ip

701525,0,t3_226733,I agree with whats being said below cameras are a hard thing to return your money on. The cost of the camera its depreciation insurance that covers rental and maintenance expect a lot of it on a camera that is primarily used for rentals make it a losing battle. Also REDs are especially a bad investment for rental. The market is oversaturated with guys with Epics that know nothing about the industry. Here in LA I could get an Epic rental for a six pack of beer any day of the week. How can you compete with that? In the camera market the only people I know making money are those with F or Alexa since most owners of those cameras respect their investment. No one with an Alexa breaks the market price on rentals which keeps everyones rate high and even when they are doing favors it sure as heck wont be free. All that said if you want to DP having a RED might help you but that doesnt sound like your position.I agree with what everyone is saying about the Movi being impractical as well. Pretty soon everyone will have a Chinese knockoff for .Lenses are a pretty solid investment but do your research as a lot of lenses are becoming obsolete as companies like RED make larger sensors. A lot of wide lenses for MM PL mount cameras dont cover the entire Dragon sensor for example.Personally I have a small GampE package that goes out constantly. Its  kinos  tungstens and a handful of kstands cstands a combo clamps and a car mount. Ive had it for about  months and Im about to break even. The only up keep is paying for spare globes and the insurance is very reasonable.,Filmmakers,cgk0l1v,2,t5_2r1ip
708263,0,t3_22998o,congrats on your first film! hope you didnt get your bike stolen!Feedback audio is terrible and ultimately prevented me from really getting into the film. seriously theres no point in shooting with such a high quality camera if your audio is that bad.i like the story but the acting is pretty rough. the thief guy couldnt provide a second of reality on any of his lines. he was baaaaaaad. the main guy was ok but he looked super confused and uncomfortable in every scene. the lady that helps him was good...seemed natural and brought a good energy to her scenes.there are a few rough moments in the story that really pulled me out like how hilariously bad the thief is at riding a bike in that initial chase scene...why is he so slow? that was really goofy.who the hell just leaves their bike perched up against the wall of a building without locking it? that guy deserved to get it stolen you couldve condensed the first  into like  seconds...i was confused about that first shot it made sense looking back but you dont need that. just get right to the first chase scene. I like the old switcheroo you did with the story but the transitions were pretty rough and there were some necessary moments why see the guy talking to the gal in the gym? just cut straight to them planning things in the apartment. try to really focus on getting to the punch. this couldve been done in half the time...there wasnt any big development for the characters or anything worthwhile about the performances so just get straight to the action and think about tightening up the overall structure of your work so every moment is absolutely essential. ,Filmmakers,cgks6zj,6,t5_2r1ip

766980,0,t1_cgrce0a,The other way to look at it is...Filmmaking is a passionate industry where despite the fact that its a business and the day to day can get monotonous deep down people love what they do. This is especially true in film school. So when people are working those long days they expect to have a little fun. Filmmaking isnt accounting or law afterall. I wouldnt really call it unfair. No matter how shy you are you have to push yourself to be social. In entertainment your next job comes from someone you met at your last job. If you never talk to anyone if you never make connections how will anyone come to think of you for that next job?Now there are certainly people in the industry who are complete bastards. They tend to get stuck at the bottom but if theyre REALLY talented they can move up. So thats the alternative to being social. OP says himself he doesnt feel like hes adding much to set. To me thats a bigger problem than not being social. Whatever task youre assigned knock it out of the fucking park. Find a way to be indispensable. Go above and beyond even on an unpaid student film.

I was the one selling the camera and the potential buyers were the ones that worked in suchandsuch state so would be unable to come pick it up.  So they say theyll overpay for the device just so that Im not inconvenienced and that theyll send the money in paypal.Granted any time I get on craigslist Im incredibly skeptical of whats happening.  So I looked up possible scams involving paypal and craigslist and. what do you know there are about  to  common ones for paypal alone.  Most of which actually requires they send you the money and it hits your account!  Then you send them the camera and they immediately issue a report with paypal saying that they didnt receive their product.  Paypal automatically retracts the funds from your account if this happens and gives it back to them.  So guess what youre out of now?  A camera AND your money.Needless to say I just pawned it because while they are scammers themselves at least I can see the cash upfront  and really I was tired of shifting through the crap that is false promises to buy.So you learned a lesson the hard way.

1009306,0,t1_chitroe,Well you could probably do an encyclopedic style paper where you give hard definitions to each topic. It could be interesting but probably wont be.I assume you want to do this paper because you like movies. If thats the case then I suggest you pick a movie you really like. On the off chance you choose a movie like Boondock Saints I am going to tell you that you shouldnt do that in advance.People might be like deathbyspoon is a dick. Whats wrong with Boondock Saints? Well the short answer is everything. I like the Boondock Saints but in terms of craft its towards the bottom of the barrel. You will run out of things to say very quickly and will get bored and drive yourself crazy trying to make up some bullshit. And more often than not you will end up realizing that the movie you are trying to talk about in an interesting way is not very interesting.So. Heres what Ill do. Ive put a list of directors and movies below. For the directors IMDB them and see if you recognize any of the movies they made. If you really like one pick that and start to apply some of the concepts that I mentioned above in the previous post I will also add to that list at the end of this post. For the movies do the same. If you see one you like choose that and apply the concepts.Heres the list Kubrick     Full Metal Jacket Polanski    Rosemarys Baby Spielberg  Jurassic Park any Indiana Jones movie for that matter any Spielberg movie. This dude knows his craft and is extremely entertaining. Just dont do War of the Worlds. You will be very disappointed. George Lucas  Star Wars Episodes IV through VI. These movies are dated in terms of visual effects  learn the difference between visual effects and special effects  and have been totally fucked with but they are also examples of great filmmaking. This could be tough though. If you choose this be prepared to talk about art direction and visual composition. Also get the original versions Han shot first. Nichols  The Graduate PT Anderson  Boogie Nights. This dude is a fucking genius and his early movies are really really entertaining. Cuaron  Y Tu Mama Tambien Scorsese  Goodfellas Sofia Coppola  Lost in Translation. People will say deathbyspoon what are you? A fucking retard? Not only is this movie is boring as fuck but out of the seventeen thousands people that are working in the film industry related to the Coppola family why the fuck would you choose Sofia? Shes the poster child for spoiled Hollywood princesses. Choose Francis Ford Coppola or Nicholas Cage or Jason Schwartzman or Spike Jonze or even Roman Coppola. Just not Sofia. My answer to you mouthbreathing nerds is this movie is an incredible feat of cinematography. The based god and director of photography Lance Acord who also did a number of Sofias exhusband Spike Jonzes films including Adaptation and Being John Malkovich is a compositional genius. His use of depth of field is second to none. And he was doing the shallow depth of focus like  years before PT Anderson made that shit trendy with The Master. This is also an incredibly romantic and awesome movie. Dont hate. Ridley Scott  Alien. This movie. Tony Scott  Enemy of the State. This movie is so much fun. It was doing surveillance NSA conspiracy way before Edward Snowden blew up the spot like hipsters in Williamsburg Brooklyn. Plus its got the best cast ever. Seth Green Jack Black AND Jamie Kennedy as NSA tech geeks? Come on. So good. James Cameron  I dont know. True Lies? That movie is awesome. Terminator  or  would be a safer choice. Like Spielberg before him hes a master of craft. His movies sometimes seem frivolous but if you know what to look for his craft is all there composition sound art direction.The Godfather Pulp Fiction Schindlers List Fight Club The Matrix Seen The Silence of the Lambs WALLE any Pixar movie not including Cars or Planes Good Will Hunting Fargo Platoon Network  Days Later TrainspottingIn terms of CONCEPTS The first thing to note is that this stuff is really obvious. Good craft isnt complicated its motivated. What does that mean? It means that there should be a good reason behind everything in a movie. If the camera handheld there should be a reason. It could be that your supposed to feel like the viewer is there. It could be because when the camera is a bit shaky that creates a sense of excitement and tension. when looking at lighting pay attention to shadows. Are there a lot of shadows like this  or is it naturally or evenly lit like this  Miseenscene  its all the shit that you see in an individual shot. Is there a candle? Thats part of the misenscene. Does someone ask for a candle thats offscreen? Thats not part of the misenscene. Composition  where is the camera? Ex. If its looking up at someone you are supposed to feel like the person is powerful. Imagine you are a child looking up at Arnold Schwarznekekgjekrjerk.  Read about the rule of thirds. Learn what it does. Learn why people break it.  Sound  Sound is half of the movie. Its important. Sound design is a major part of how we interpret a film. Imagine the same scene in two ways. An atomic bomb exploding on a city killing millions of peoples. The first version has the sound effect of an explosion. The second has Wutang Clan Aint Nuttin to Fuck Wit playing over it and the sound of laughter in the background. Im not sure what the effect or context of the second version would be but the point is that it changes the scene dramatically. Art direction  sets location costumes makeup and hair etc. I dont know really anything about this. Narrative  pay attention to themes and motifs. Just write them down as you go along no matter how insignificant. It will end up being important  of the time. Im tired of writing. If you have questions ask away.,Filmmakers,chj0kt5,2,t5_2r1ip

1018571,0,t3_25qfm9,I have fairly extensive experience with this situation. The production company I used to work at tried to shop shows to more trusted reality show producers. First of all good luck. There are literally thousands of shows floating around. If a production company puts the word out that they are interested in reality production every idiot comes calling. They all have an amazing idea.If the company youre talking to has no previous success then forget about it. There are really only a handful of companies out there that do the majority of broadcast shows. It is an extremely difficult business to get into. If this production company makes a sizzle with you thats not the end of the sale. You will need an agency to rep your show to the networks. Thats called getting optioned. From there you still have to get bought by a network. The first season of any show usually struggles to make money for the creator. I was part of almost a dozen attempts to create a reality show. Most of the got optioned none sold. If I remember correctly the profit from getting optioned didnt even come close to covering the sizzle production budget. What I really learned is that the networks seemed to be interested in certain topics. For example for awhile they loved little people so we got all these shows about dwarfs doing stuff. Then they loved cake bakers then big families now its rednecks. If you really want to find out what the networks want you need to hire a rep that can get a strait answer from the networks. Just creating your great idea out of the blue is probably a waste of time. If you do sign a contract to make a sizzle I suggest you get an Exec. Producer credit and  of the gross. ,Filmmakers,chk2hhu,2,t5_2r1ip

1057294,0,t1_cho9dma,I think it boils down to Need RAW? D. Dont need RAW? GH.Ive owned both currently have a GH. The RAW workflow was just too storagetime intensive for me. If you pair up the GH with the BMCC Speed Booster not the regular m one you get a .x magnification which means a .x crop Photography Full Frame equivalent in K basically Super and a . stop of light increase.Speaking from photo full frame terms since were comparing to the D this means with a Tokina mm in K mode you get a mmf. constant zoom plenty wide and fast for me. With the infamous Sigma mmf. thats a mmf.. Sharp too and an absolute dream.I mounted an old preAI Nikkor mmf. and got a mmf.. If youre into portraits and bokeh its pretty darn sweet.ISO  actually looks really clean as long as you have the right settings. So far the internet seems to have a really bad grasp on how to set it up properly which is understandable and if you have the wrong settings as everyone seems to be using  looks like CRAP. If you boost the pedestal to  leave the HighlightsShadows at  turn down NR to  and keep intelligent dynamic OFF  is GREAT.ISO  is still very usable depending on your standards. You might want to apply Neat Video in post but honestly the noise although fairly apparent is small in size and looks more grainy than noisy so it doesnt bother me. Either way I havent found a situation where  is necessary when you have f. on your side.If I were OP Id go for the GH. The EVF and fully articulated screen are a HUGE advantage for video. The D always pissed me off that I always had to look straight on to the back LCD it felt extremely limiting. Of course on set you might have an external monitor but Im a run n gun type of guy so I find even external monitors to be limiting. The EVF helps with bright sun and steadiness pressing it to your eye gives you a solid third contact point and you can rotate from the hips to create smooth pans and tilts.In brief yes the smaller sensor means the lowlight isnt as good and crop factor is greater. However this is compensated with a speed booster so this resulting faster glass is amazing and Super crop works perfectly fine.No I dont work for Panasonic and both cameras are great. I just dont find myself needing RAW or ultrashallow FF DoF.,Filmmakers,chogw25,5,t5_2r1ip

1167453,0,t3_27gx4n,Within a few seconds of looking at an image your brain gets used to the absolute luminance and tint. You cant fully trust your eyes so you need to pay attention to your scopes.I rarely ever look at the histogram when colour grading. The waveform RGB parade and vectorscope are where its at.Waveform lets you analyse objectively the luminance and contrast. It represent the light intensity from left to right the left area of the scope actually corresponds to the left area of the frame. Put a blacktowhite gradient in your app and the waveform will be a diagonal line from the lower left to the upper right. Play around with the liftgammagain controls an pay attention to what happens to that line. Try different images and note the kinds of patterns that are generated in the waveform monitor. The waveform is useful for matching the luminance and contrast of multiple shots. Use it to set your black levels. Typically all shots within a single scene should have the same black level which is how low the signal gets on the waveform. Go from one shot to the next while looking at the waveform. Are the black levels at the same height? If not adjust the lift on the problem shots. If there are very light areas in your shots such as a sky match the topmost part of the scope by adjusting the gain.RGB Parade This is simply  waveform monitors sidebyside one for each colour channel. Does it look like your image has tinted blacks? Look at the RGB Parade if the bottoms of the signals dont fall in the same place just adjust your shadows colour balance until they do. Unless you want tinted blacks of course. You can do the same for your highlights and midtones but only if you believe these should be neutral. If the lightest area of the frame is the sky then it is perfectly normal for the blue channel to be higher than the others. Vectorscope Gives you an idea of overall saturation and tint. Anything that spreads from the centre is tinted and the further it goes the more saturated that colour is. The direction of the spread indicates the tint. No part of the signal should ever go past the small boxes BCGYRM. If the whole signal is off to one side then that tells you there is a colour cast. Maybe that tint is desirable so dont neutralise it entirely unless you want a very dull looking image. The sky is typically a BlueCyan mix. You can easily identify which part of the vectorscope corresponds to the sky. If its too blue or too cyan it will look wrong. Adjust your highlights colour balance until it looks right both in the preview and the vectorscope. Skintones looking off? Take a look at the vectorscope to see if they are indeed too red or too yellow.,Filmmakers,ci0yiog,6,t5_2r1ip

First off I want to say keep shooting shoot all the time.Dont post everything you shoot online though I have to say that posting things like this could give people the wrong idea about your skills especially if they see it like a year down the road when youre better. I know what is going through your head. You are probably pretty pumped to have a decent camera and you are really excited to finally see that depth of field you have been loving. . Shallow depth of field does not make random shots a film. Or even make it worth posting.. Just because your video is in . doesnt make it cinematic I know that you totally get off on this ratio because I do too. But just spend more freaking time on a film. This should not be posted its just a bunch of half effort shots.. Your tripod shots are by far the best shots and they are completely framed wrong it made me literally want to tear off my computer screen because you were cutting peoples heads off. . Rack focus is cool but only if its motivated.. Stop jizzing all over your logo seriously dude just cuz you have a logo doesnt make this at all good or at all professional.. Think of the people on here watching it not your friends on Facebook saying woh man this looks great because they dont know at all what they are talking about. They may as well be illiterate when it comes to this stuff.. Tell a story.. Stop with the logo and thinking your starting your own company.. Stop with the logo shit.. Watch a Terrence Malick film.. Learn about deep focus.. You may like these videos because you know the people in them or your back yard seems familiar to you think about the people who have no idea about your life. Think about how they will only know what is framed in your shot and what you show them.. If you dont show it it isnt there. I imagine these films you make are interesting to you because you are like oh thats my yard or thats my friends car. WE DONT KNOW THAT.. Stop with the fucking logo.LAST. make something and put it on your desktop and wait a month... if you still like it and think its worth sharing on here then share it. Odds are you will be like jesus I cant believe that was me a month ago.Keep making films though. You have a basic idea of it but dont try to be something your not. Dont let this be a hobby.

1502025,0,t3_2bebmi,I wanted to add a piece of advice to the closed set rule.  Make sure in all this planning of the scene you dont get so fixated on the sex part that you neglect the other jobs.  My grip buddy was on a shoot where they kept wanting to tweak the lighting setup in the room.  He kept having to come in do what they needed and then leave.  Eventually they just accepted that a grip needed to be included in the closed set on that particular shoot.Also a lot of times there are close ups of individual actors in the scene just referred to as coverage.  You can do those without the other actor there sometimes allowing them to just get comfortable and perform on their own.  The same scene I referenced above had the girl request to redo all her coverage because the guy was a huge creep that was really awkward decently famous actor.,Filmmakers,cj4jwgt,3,t5_2r1ip
1503874,0,t1_cj4d7bu,A place to start would be meetings for various associations. Here in Dallas TX we have the Dallas Producers Association Women in Film Texas Association of Motion Media Professionals and then theres software like FCPAvidPremiere user groups. Loads more. All of these have social events panel discussions meetups product demos and so forth. The caveat here is that people who go to all of the meetings are usually not fat with paying gigs. Theres definitely desperation in the air at many mixers as people are on the hunt for scraps but those people usually know some people. I mean if youre looking for a formula there isnt one but if youre competent at your segment of the craft and people like you itll happen but only if youre fresh on the minds of the people who are above the line. ProducerDirectormanagement types.Talking to the people at the meetings will get you leads to whats shooting around town. Offer to intern if you dont have history. Internships are for learning and at first you have lots to learn. Most internships arent paid but as long as youre learning youre getting value out of it. Once youre not learning any more get paid. If the internship is just driving around and not spending any time on the set tell them youre doing this to learn to grip or electric or camera or sound. You already know how to drive and if thats all theyre going to have you do then you want to renegotiate. Of course be honest and forward about it without offending.

There isnt one filmmaker and that is what that term denotes. Its a process a collaboration and a willingness to let others take responsibility for other aspects of the film. Sure there are people that take on many of the responsibilities of making a film and who exercise tight control over all aspects but that film still would never have gotten made without the knowledge sweat and determination of the  other people that made that idea a reality.

1820449,0,t3_2fdy98,Ok Ill throw in my two cents As someone who hires in the industry as well as makes a living in it I honestly dont care about classes or workshops and neither does anyone else Ive ever talked to. Its great to have taken them but unless you became certified on some special piece of equipment like the steadicam or you now have a Pro Tools certification it really just tells me you showed up on time and left when the class was over. Same with a college degree honestly. What matters is what youve made and what your credits are. If what youve done looks a lot like the project Im doing Ill hire you. If it doesnt I wont this is why demo reels should show a wide range of genres IMO. You can have a style just make sure its versatile then its easier to get hired. Interships on the other hand are ok to put on a resume because it proves to me that someone was able to stand you for three months every day and thats at least a good start. tldr  dont put classes or workshops on your resume. You can but you really shouldnt.  Lesson  is name drop like a mother fucker but thats another lesson for another day.,Filmmakers,ck8jthe,2,t5_2r1ip

And those are so few and far between the good ones are anyway that its hard enough to get in that way.My method is something that anybody can do even without a college degree.

Most times its totally nebulous and its whatever is left over after everyone else is paid.

1874240,0,t1_ckefii3,Theres definitely some cultural misunderstandings going on here and I think over anything we should stress the importance of lurking. Before commenting on any online community it is really important to lurk for awhile and get a feel for the type of community it is. You almost have to become an online anthropologist learning all the customs of the people before you embarrass yourself or face a cultural shunning. I lurked reddit for months before even creating an account and then only sparsely commented because there was such an expectation for high quality comments This was in . I only know of this stedicam forum through the post and havent lurked it myself but from what Im picking up they had a tight community of posters who had developed over time a level of expectations for the types of posts and the purpose of the community. In this case professional or semiprofessional stedicam operation using high end equipment. I wouldnt be surprised if many of the regular posters have met once or twice in real life or heard about the forum through industry talkstedicam training workshops etc. They are essentially using the community to talk shop and it just happens to be publicly accessible. Granted they could create like a secret Google or Facebook group or something to do this if they dont want outsiders in but its nice they dont because it makes their knowledge more accessible to others who want to be that serious about that specific craft.They make a newbie section again with the expectation that most people who come to the site probably heard of it through non Google channels so they are expecting higher level questions so they can pass on their higher level knowledge. Of course what theyre forgetting is that Google does indeed exist and they are searchable. So this completely green guy pops in after what I assume is a Google search for stedicam forums and doesnt do his due diligence of lurking the community and getting a feel for the types of people that post there and what the expectations of the forum are. A big cultural misunderstanding follows and one or two people who might have had bad days or might just be jerks end up getting offended and are short with him. So I dont know I think the problem wont have a clear answer. On one hand youve got a guy who is looking for advice and searches out a newbie forum that he just assumes is for random casual discussion asks a question and gets shut down hard. On the other hand youve got a community of people whove built a culture of higher quality professional expectations and some outsider walks in and doesnt recognize that this culture even exists and starts asking questions that would be better suited on another forum given the cultural purpose that they have molded this particular forum to. So Is it the posters fault for not lurking? The forum admins fault for not clearly designating what the community is for? The communitys fault for being offended? Or is it all of the above and none of this actually matters? I vote all of the above. Either way I think its ridiculous that were here sitting and arguing over a misunderstanding on a forum and using it as a representation of the film industry as a whole. ,Filmmakers,ckf1fa0,1,t5_2r1ip

In hindsight Id have preferred for that money to go towards equipment rental for a short film.If you want some personal kit to mess around with make sure youre either buying kit that can pay for itself or that youre not spending enough for it to be a problem. I recommend a cutoff point of around k or .kk. Any higher and it becomes the sort of money most people I know couldnt just write off.If youre only planning on shooting some shorts absolutely rent your kit. For the price of purchasing a camera package you can rent a pretty hefty one and a lighting kit.,Filmmakers,ckw2jnh,5,t5_2r1ip

2040455,0,t3_2i50x0,gtWill the built in aperture ring on a lens make any difference in quality than using the speedboosters aperture ring?Keep in mind that if you go with the Canon EF Speedbooster you wont have a physical aperture ring.  The EF Speedbooster is an active adapter that will control the aperture electronically via the camera just like you would with native MFT lenses.Nikon Speedboosters are PASSIVE adapters no electronic contacts.  That means the mechanical aperture ring is necessary as some lenses dont have a physical aperture ring.And yes the Speedbooster has a superior aperture ring for motion picture because its a clickless ring that wont be found on lenses designed for mainly still photography.   gtIs canon L glass better than Nikons high end lenses? This really isnt important.  The real question you should be asking yourself is what KIND of shooting youll be doing.  For example are you shooting a documentary with a lot of handheld work?  A Canon Speedbooster would allow you to use image stabilization... essential for handheld work on DSLRtype cameras.To me thats the main difference between the two.  The more expensive Canon Speedbooster is an ACTIVE adapter which allows use of image stabilization as well as autofocus though autofocus is useless because its pretty slow.The Nikon Speedbooster is a passive adapter which is cheaper but turns all lenses into allmanual lenses.The optical quality of Canon vs Nikon glass is fairly similar at least for the focal range youll be using for videography and they have nearly identical rd party lenses anyways.  ,Filmmakers,ckz6qu8,2,t5_2r1ip

2139321,0,t3_2jev7x,No idea on number  but heres my two cents on the others.  There are two ways to write action films either avoid cliches or embrace them.  If you are trying to avoid them research realistic action tropes.  Guns are really loud.  Explosions cause hearing damage severe burns and can stun people even outside the fireball range.  Make your action scenes flow from an actual plot and treat it realistically.  A man cant fall  stories into a dumpster and walk away unscathed.  If you want a scene like that have him set up the dumpster in advance like with a mattress or something.  Then have him jump butOh! He managed to get stuck with a used hypodermic needle poking out of a trash back.  Sucks to be him.  That sort of thing.If you are going for the allin clichefest approach just copy the biggest s and s films you can find.  If the audience is having fun they wont care.. Avoid CFLs or other fluorescents as the cheap ones will strobe on film.  Get LED bulbs.  You can actually buy them in Daylight and Warm that are remarkably consistent and close to the Kelvin ratings of film lights though not as bright obviously.  Make use of bounced and softened light.  A bedsheet or a shower curtain can do a great job controlling the light in a scene.  Use natural light as much as possible.  You wont find a more convincing light source than the Sun so if you have a limited budget write your script around giving as much time outside in broad daylight as possible.  You can still flag or diffuse as necessary to keep some control.,Filmmakers,clbr73i,2,t5_2r1ip

They do have some color tint mainly green but if youre trying to get your first lighting setup these are great. The color tint can also be adjusted via color correction. Theres of course other options such as the Yongnuo YN which are known for having less color tint and of higher quality plus they have barn doors!. You can also diffuse the lights with umbrellas. Although there arent really any preassembled kits to easily add to cart with these lights its simply just getting three of these lights three light stands  flash brackets  umbrellas and of course  batteries. I recommend the NPF for they last forever and the offbrand batteries you can get at good prices. It does not come with batteries but can run off of AA batteries if needed. You can also get wall outlet adapters if needed. Also LEDs dont get hot so if you are in a room which gets hot really fast you dont have to worry about that. Either way you go you will have a fantastic time with lighting. ,Filmmakers,cli5ira,2,t5_2r1ip

2303573,0,t3_2lizaj,High frame rate films are ridiculous and not a new idea at all. Frame rates vary from area to area however in the USA we most commonly know standard fps as . One of the earliest forms of motion picture cameras the kinetograph ran film at about  fps.The problem with the high frame rate is that it creates an unnaturally sharp image without an motion blur. This is the difference between a movie and a soap opera. Watch one of each and youll notice that the movie looks far more natural than the soap opera. This is because soap operas film at a frame rate of about fps in order to give them a different look however this look is quite removed from how we see in reality. High frame rates remove motion blur and thus make it less realistic and less immersive. You can even notice the difference on televisions today. Go watch a vhs or standard dvd of Forrest Gump on a tube tv. Now go watch the same movie on an HD tv while it airs on a channel like FX. Theres more crispness in the television version and less blur because HD television output is digital speed fps.,Filmmakers,clwfscv,1,t5_2r1ip

When shooting in really contrasts situations you need them to extend the dynamic range of the exposure  get more detail in shadows without blowing the highlights out.Why so big? Why not use lights? A larger apparent light source reflector creates a softer look to the light. The edges of the shadows arent so harsh and everything looks more creamy and natural instead of harsh. Plus the power requirement for light banks that would give a similar large broad bright light source would be insane and these reflectors are often simpler to set up and change on the fly for different angles. ,Filmmakers,clwkjht,3,t5_2r1ip

2426884,0,t3_2n9d2m,It concerns me that youre thinking of investing in a camera and you dont know how crazy different your three choices are.A Canon D is adequate for very low budget filmmaking but its not a great solution and the quality is not great. Its very slow to work with because its not designed as a motion picture camera. Image quality is not great.Blackmagic cameras make pretty pictures but there are a number of technical compromises such as poor ergonomics and crazy moire. They also arent very solidly build so easy to break. They can make pretty pictures but they arent terribly fast or reliable.Depending on which RED you get they can be fairly reliable. They are definitely quirky and some are much better than others but they are the only truly professional camera on your list.So... is there a noticeable difference between all of these? Very much so.,Filmmakers,cmbo4qm,2,t5_2r1ip

I noticed some nice movement in the beginning and then the camera got out of the way. Id like to see you try to make the audience wonder how you did an effect rather than just constraining the frame to part of the bag or part of the cupboard door.

2480271,0,t3_2nytf8,A good concept but you had some exposure problems that couldve been easily fixed. You also wouldve benefited from some of your own light sources instead of relying on the natural light so much. For example the shot of the two guys carrying buckets ? at  seconds would have benefited from an additional light source lighting their front side. Be careful when youre pulling focus as it can become unsmooth really easily. Ive found tying a string to my focus and pulling it slowly helped with that if you dont have a steady hand. The documentary style did work in your favor in certain spots for instance the shot at  seconds through the glass adds some nice personality to the spot. Remember that if your lighting changes in the middle of a shot that you have to fix the exposure. The shot at  goes from being nicely exposed to being way over exposed. Your main problems are over exposure focus and lighting. Touch those up and you have yourself a solid piece Id say.,Filmmakers,cmib5h2,3,t5_2r1ip

My job as the video producer is to shoot and edit announcement videos eventmission tripretreat recaps and a variety of other videos for teachings and promotion. After a TON of research and advice from pros I decided to go with the C. Its an amazing camera thats so much fun to use and is ready for anything I throw at it. I wanted stable footage while also being able to change the most important settings on the fly so I decided to go with a full Zacuto rig. Now I know what youre thinking. EXPENSIVE AND SNOBBY. Theres so many other cheaper alternatives! Welllll you get what you pay for! The rig is amazing! FocusISOAperatureREC control and stabilization all without taking my hands out of position. And paired with a Ninja Blade I have a  touch screen color accurate monitor that allows me to focus way better than the C screen all the while recording to an SSD in uncompressed ProRes  instead of AVCHD. I have a highly gradable image that looks fantastic. I love using both the Clog and WD Range profiles. I got the tripod adapter plate allowing me to quickly move from the shoulder to sticks and vice versa. Its awesome. The Zacuto rig is as solid as a rock and will last me a long time. Because I put the Ninja Blade onto the rig instead of an EVF it takes a little bit longer to disassemble and reassemble but I not usually in a big hurry anyway.The only problem Ive ran across is the Atomos battery. It sucks! It takes hours to charge up for around  minutes of use! So Im getting  Watson replacement batterieschargers for longer shoulder mount shoots. That will be essential when Im shooting all of my event recaps.Other gear not shown Sigma mm f .  Huge lens with amazing image quality.

2847969,0,t3_2spv06,Let me start off by saying that that is great stencil work and although I work with spraypaint a lot I cannot see myself doing it that well.I love the constant motion but the constant aperturefield of focus was stagnant and when combined with the constant vignetting  whether it was from the lens or added in editing it slowed a good amount of the progression that you built up nicely with the motion.The times that it as slowed down really got to me because if you are creating any sort of montage or nonaction based scene and using slowed down footage it is best to zoom in on the subject so that it fill the screen and is interesting as it currently just interrupts the flow. You could also time it to the music to make the slow motion make sense.Lastly a suggestion not a critique but you might want to consider using a hyperlapse rather than a timelapse on the shot that includes the people working on the art in order to keep the flow rather than present it in a choppy manner. Hyperlapses are pain to make but worth it in the end.,Filmmakers,cnrtafl,2,t5_2r1ip

2866026,0,t3_2sv7rg,Depends on what you need it for. Do you need long tracking shots smallmacro slider moves or a bit of both? I got myself a  Igus slider several years ago a Google search will give you more information than you can handle about these sliders its robust durable as hell and can handle pretty much anything other than a large procinema camera in weight perfect for DSLRs and can get about any length youd like up to a few feet. Its heavy though. Ive also used Matthews doorway dollies before and they are incredible for hauling gear tofrom locations theyre really well built and can be used on smooth surfaces as is for any distance of dolly shots. But theyre expensive you need a grip to push and you need track if youre on an uneven surface. Ive used an inexpensive slider from Konovo that is great for small run and gun work its smooth well made and lightweight. But it wont survive longterm wearandtear. Ive also used both the actual Dana Dolly and a DIY one I made. This is by far my favorite allaround dollyslider as I can use it with a crew or by myself if needed its silky smooth and you get the best of both worlds longer tracking shots are easier but you dont NEED extra hands around to set it up and use. But its heavy to lug around by yourself and takes substantially more time to set up than a traditional oneman slider. All depends on what you need it for ,Filmmakers,cntv97a,1,t5_2r1ip

One note on your timelapses I know you spent a crap ton of time on them and I love the techniques you used but it was too repetitive in the video. Pick your favorite  or  and keep it at that. And in conclusion I think that the song you chose and your editing made this reel more than the cinematography did. I imagine you dont have the rights to this song so I would be very careful distributing this reel. If you do have the rights to the song please let me know how you got it because this has been on the top of my playlist for weeks now! I want to leave this on a positive.

Ive only directed a few small shorts with friends as castcrew and minimal equipment and I had everything planned out in my head but nothing on paper. No shot list no script notes no prop list no way of organizing anything. And because I was doing everything myself it was always a disaster. Know your script by heart know what gear and props you need for each scene and each shot within that scene figure out blocking and lighting at your location beforehand and make sure you give yourself and the rest of your crew ample time to get everything done and more. Basically if you can plan it then plan it. But anticipate any possible problems and have a backup plan for everything.gtand shooting to both improve the qualityLighting. Even if youre not using any lights at least have some white poster board or reflective surface to bounce light off of to make your images look better.gtand general aesthetics of the shorts?Thats a very broad question and I dont know how to answer itgtShould the script include camera position and proper framing?gtThe actual script shouldnt but it would be a good idea to have a shooting script which could just be the script with handwritten notes in the margins to match up with your shot list. Know what shots you want to get and do some framing tests with a standin for the actors before the shoot day if possible. With low budget shorts good shot composition can make all the difference.gtIs more equipment necessary or should I stick to what I currently have?Learn to use what you have now and make the best movie you can with it.

3039407,0,t3_2uxqfc,You can do a lot better for . And for filmmaking you might want to reconsider buying a DSLR.The Ti and all DSLRs have reflex mirrors that get in the way for video.  These mirrors block the cameras viewfinders so you are forced to use the LCD on back of the camera for critical composition and focus.  This is OK indoors but outdoors in bright sunlight you may not be able to see what youre shooting.  Most Canon shooters are forced to buy a loupe otherwise known as an LCD viewfinder or an even more expensive Electronic Viewfinder EVF.And no Canon DSLR below the  Canon D Mark II can record full HD fps video for incamera slow motion.Plus you have to modify Canon cameras with third party Magic Lantern firmware to give them basic video features such as audio level metering and manual focus peaking.Thats why at this price point I recommend the Panasonic G.  This camera records continuously for hours instead of the Tis  minutes very useful if you ever want to record a play a speech a concert or other event it records at p for slow motion it has a builtin intervalometer for timelapse it has builtin audio level meters and focus peaking it is compatible with Panasonic power zoom lenses there are no affordable power zoom lenses for Canon DSLRs  and it has a viewfinder that actually works while youre shooting video so you dont have to buy a loupe or EVF to see what youre shooting in bright sunlight.For less than the price of the Ti bundle you can get a  on sale Panasonic G with the mm kit lens  a  Amazon Basics tripod  with a quick release and fluid drag head for smoother pans and tilts and a basic .

3164325,0,t3_2wbowj,First off I loved your film. It seemed inspired by Hotline Miami Winding Refn and  anime like Akira. The most obvious strong suit is the visual aesthetic which is why they gave you the best cinematography silver tripod award. Lighting is incredibly hard to do to make look nature and to be consistent with other shots and within its own narrative but the crew managed to make an awesome looking film. Looking at some of your other comments this is your first action film. As your first venture into that genre you did exceptionally well with that transition. However it highlights what I thought was the weakest part of the film the choreography. For the sort of pace your aesthetic demanded the choreography was just a tad bit less than those dope beats were suggesting. It would have been awesome if it were tighter wound and the hits felt like hits which some did but not consistently. It was just shy of being one of the CMF greats. If only you had teamed up with the team that did this it would been a perfect homage to those influences that inspired you. Awesome job overall hope youre able to make it out to LA!,Filmmakers,copzbyp,2,t5_2r1ip
3168848,0,t1_coq830h,Thanks for your comment. I agree part of why the film is compelling is its shot on extremely relatable cameras. Everybodys got an iphone and a webcam. It humanizes the subject quite a bit. Im talking in rd person haha. This was all unintentional and then became intentional. All of the footage was never shot to be seen by anybody in public it was simply for my therapist and my therapy. I never even thought to shoot it well. When I realized I was right in the middle of making a documentary  months into shooting I also realized my cameras were telling the story perfectly. Pretty wild.And pretty ironic but one of my strengths is actually speaking in public and on camera. Seems SO counterintuitive for a stutterer but thats just how it is. Stutter and all.

3212390,0,t3_2wwq9z,Technicolor cinestyle is definitely the way to go just be careful when color grading the footage because canon DSLRs shoot to a pretty low bitrate  bit  H. codec that kinda sucks. Cinestyle will probably take care of this but make sure to always have sharpness very low or all the way down. Turning sharpness up in the camera looks terrible. It is important to always shoot at a shutter speed of  or  which is the standard for fps video unless you want otherwise for creative reasons. I would not suggest ever just holding the camera and filming. You need some kind of stabilizer such as a shoulder rig to shoot acceptable handheld video. I would not suggest plugging a mic directly into the camera and if you dont want to sync get something like a juicedlink xlr preamp and your audio will sound nice I would still recommend recording audio externally for better quality. If you have any other questions shoot!,Filmmakers,couyqpj,2,t5_2r1ip

3294669,0,t3_2xviw4,You have made mistakes but you are not out of the game. Buy a book called My First Movie. Its a series of interviews with different directors about making their first films. The big takeaway is that nobody gets there via the same path. You feel far from living your dream right now but thats not the end of the world.When I got out of film school I felt very similar to you. Its about  years later and Im writing this from the house we rented as the production office for my first feature film. Its a documentary which is not something I ever thought Id be doing but we have funding and I am loving every minute of it. There is no traditional path.You cant blame any one thing on the fact that you dont have a five picture deal at Dreamworks or whatever. You just need to make work. You need to write and direct some films. Id say the easiest thing you could do would be get your hands on an SLR that does decent video and teach yourself to use it. Sounds like youre ready to drop your snobbish attitude toward the various specialties on film sets. If you have your own camera you can at the very least direct MOS films and music videos. Start doing that. If youre in a college town find some bands that need music videos! Find some local business that needs a promo video. Do the first few for free and make it your business to do an amazing job.I lived on almost no money for the first three years after film school because I didnt get any jobs other than the occasional PA gig. But I had a camera and I was directing music videos for free. That was my path but there is no traditional path.If you are first and foremost a writer theres no excuse for not writing. Youre too tired after work to write? Get up early and force yourself to do it for  minutes a day. Your job is supporting you but its also standing between you and your dream if its stopping you from doing what you want to do. You have to write.If you need to spend a few years goofing around though? Thats not the end of the dream. Im way less successful than some of my classmates and Im way more successful than others. Ten years from now that could totally be filpped around! I have friends who seemed to not even be trying to make films after college who are now getting buzz at festivals for their short films. The right opportunity just had to present itself to them. I am glad that I never thought to look down my nose at those people when they were serving me coffee or moving home for a while because in a few years they might be able to hire me! Maybe thats the path. You can never know.Stick with it. Stay talking to your therapist and take care of your brain. Its scary but if you believe in yourself youll get where you need to go. Just be prepared for where you need to go not being exactly what you pictured when you were  years old.,Filmmakers,cp3thm6,40,t5_2r1ip

3301492,0,t3_2xviw4,I remember feeling much like you felt when I was just out of school.  Take this from someone whos been there. And came through the other side looking ok and getting stronger every day.So  Introversion is something you are born with and can manage.  Shyness is not.  Shyness is a symptom of deeper emotional problems. Right now youre suffering anxiety based on the dissonance between your perceived identity THE GREAT DIRECTOR and the reality of the world TOO SHY NOT SUCCEEDING.   I believe your panic attack is a way for your unconscious mind to express its emotional needs which you are shutting down because you believe they get in the way of your Great Director identity.  And I believe your shyness is a way for your unconscious mind to prevent people from seeing the true you because your unconscious mind feels emotionally wounded  unstable  needy  not ready to form relationships.   Therapy might help you a lot.  It helped me.In terms of the broader picture you need to let go of the idea that youre A Great Artist and start accepting that you are A Human Being with flaws and needs.  You need what everyone needs food shelter love sex emotional fulfillment acceptance friends community selfactualization.  And every work you create is a reflection of this humanity and must approached humbly every task learned patiently from the ground up and success must be allowed to happen when it happens.  Make peace with the idea that you could quit filmmaking altogether and still have a great life.  When that happens you will not stake your entire identity on every interaction you will feel confident and calm instead of desparate and then it will be easier for you to form relationships and pursue your dreams.  What do you do when you need to eat?  You go to the damn store and buy some bananas.  What if there arent any?  Buy some damn apples and dont cry about it.  Making a film is just a complex task that can be broken down into simple tasks.  Remove the emotional stakes from it expect failure and success in roughly equal portions and live your life.  Thats how it works.In practical terms  when you feel a bit more stable  get your ass to LA if you can work a shit job in Chicago you might as well do it in LA where the actual industry is.  But dont work fulltime work at a bar or coffeeshop where the hours are flexible and make yourself available for films and never say no to an opportunity if it will result in a a valuable relationship b a valuable skill c artistic depth or d rent money.Good luck.,Filmmakers,cp4lhit,2,t5_2r1ip

The content that has the most potential to be interesting to an outside viewer highest production value most notable performers most different and diverse footage is near the end. Generally speaking the best content goes first second best content last and the weakest is buried in the middle.Way way way too much of it is low budget music videos and party scenesI have no idea what his contribution is segment by segment nor any context to the projects. Sometimes thats an L sometimes thats the credits sometimes theres a card to break it up. Thats where the ingenuity comes in.From a creative perspective I was underwhelmed by the editing style and he couldnt even cut on beat for a reasonable section of the video.If hes doing this just to show off a little on Facebook fine whatever...not exactly a reel but whatever. If hes using this to generate any kind of additional work or to move forward in production a different approach may be necessary.Its clever to try and make a reel into some kind of a short cohesive video art project...but this is violating a few of the reliable guidelines for reels without providing an adequate payoff or utilizing a proper justification for the rule breaking.All the little details ken burn effect the clear age of the editor and the style of edits being made with music fades screams this was made in iMovie to me...and even if its not made in consumer grade editing software it has that look and feel to it.

Anyhoo yeah either PM or keep posting in the Sub so we can all grow. Either way.Just remember to maintain a laser focus on the conflict of your story and how that conflict can only be addressed by the unique combination of traits and motivations that is your character.an entertaining film is not really about showcasing a real true to life its about showcasing adversary and achievement...or the lack thereof. Efficiency of storytelling is the heart and soul of the medium. So every set piece and scene shouldnt be wasted energy it should all always drill back to the character at hand and their most immediate and interesting conflict.Through that lens youll find much more interesting ways to communicate dissatisfaction.Hell you could simply montage things like the piling up of fast food wrappers in a car. It doesnt have to be grand but it does need to be specific and unique to your overall story. So while its an example it shouldnt be a fit for your film. You need to determine the quiet moments that let the character breathe for yourself and you cant do that unless you understand your character their motivations and the problems they must face.,Filmmakers,cpho983,2,t5_2r1ip

I would suggest borrowing or renting kit and figuring out how to use them properly before moving towards purchases because its expensive to do it right but even more so if you do it wrong. . Moving towards professional audio means spending money.  isnt going to get you professional audio. It will start you on your way it will get you good enough results but it will be no where near professional.. Heres my bag its semipro at best and a work in progress Rode NTG  Sony wired Lav  Ktec boompole  Sound Devices MixPreD  shockmount   cables  Sony headphones  and Tascam DrmkII . This is a very basic very limited setup. Its kind of a jackoftrades bag getting decent results but not specialized for a particular task. Its not really a matter of shotgun or lavs...you need them both at different times. Wired or Wireless Lavs can be a huge difference in cost yet a huge advantage to productivity . A shotgun shouldnt be used indoors so you might need a hypercardioid short mic for that task and that can easily cost .Professional audio is something...well better left to the professionals. Its a crew position that is fundamentally important yet universally underestimated. When the chips are down and you are putting real money towards projects the best and first investment is getting a professional soundguy. Having said that rant over...Rode NTG or Sennheiser ME going into a Tascam DR or Zoom HN is where  of amateur filmmakers seem to start. . ,Filmmakers,cprm70s,2,t5_2r1ip

The acting is nonexistent no characters to speak of and the editing was subpar.  I dont know how old you guys are but keep at it with practice and more focus on a story youll do better.  Overall you can take away a great learning experience from this for the editor and director especially.  For your next project definitely get people who actually want to be on camera and add something to the story instead of your classmates who lets be honest are only there for the novelty of being in a movie.  Also seeing characters just outright murder another character even though its blatantly fake just made it dark for no reason.  Why was there random gunfights between gangs?  The whole thing just had a terrible dressup feel to it and it was really cheesy.  Also the girls need some better clothes.  Its bad enough girls are allowed to dress in shorts that high up to their thighs in school but they just couldve been handled better.

Any differences it may make are going to be too minute for anyone but pixel peepers to care about. If color accuracy and fidelity are truly that important for your project you wouldnt be shooting on a c anyway youd get a camera that could actually reliably record that kind of color accuracy. The c is simply not the best camera to shoot a big budget visual effectsheavy movie for wide theatrical release. And a  recorder isnt going to change that.The real benefit for the external recorders are that they allow you to record to different codecs. Saves time saves hassle.Its cheap. Its worth picking up.

No one can tell you whether your idea is good or not every single idea is great and terrible at the same time.Its all about the execution. Honestly everyone has an idea they want to talk about. Who cares? Make something of it.Here look Heres an idea. A guy meets a girl and they walk around for a while and talk about life.Sounds boring as hell right?Well...And honestly if you never say Im worried someone will steal it again you will be much better off.

If all you have going for you is that your idea is unique youre boned because it isnt unique. And even if it is which it isnt that doesnt mean itll be good.Here are my current ideas for screenplayss action buddycop homage movie. Classic action hero beat cops take down a Chinese cartel in s NYC. When the mentor cop dies the younger cop has to deal with taking the lead mentoring a rookie of his own and discovering whether he was really a hero cop or just riding the coat tails of his mentor. All in the style of great s action movies.Scifi action movie. A retiring ill hitman is hired by Death to perform contract kills in exchange for a few more years of life. But when the other side shows up he doesnt know who to trust or whether contract killing is really the way to a better life.Superhero action movie I like action movies sue me. In a world where superpowered individuals have forgotten their duty to protect and obsess themselves with battles of superiority amongst each other the leader of the superteam loses his powers and copes with becoming a regular person seeing the destruction and damage hes caused while trying to relearn how to be a hero to protect those in actual need.Those are my ideas. Want to steal em? Go for it. Want to write a screenplay from them? Have at it. Ill write a better one. I honestly do not care if any one of you wants to rip those ideas from me and try to make something of them. Even if you make something awesome from them Ill make something different because its all about the execution. And then we have TWO awesome s buddycop movies in the world! Winwin.Just go make something. Then ask for feedback. Shoot me your screenplay when you have it and Ill give you my advice.

Redoing the work will deliver a better result but it will never deliver the cheapest.gtWHAT?!? Are you serious that you think no one cares about what lenses they shoot on? You have that backwards. I said the buyer doesnt care. You dont add significantly to the sale price by using better lenses. Remember cheapest not best.gt Now find me a place that will rent you a on average   lens for  a day. That I do seem to have missed. A quick search found Radiant Images offering the mm at  day. gt Now you would want a minimum of three lenses in your kitNot if youre doing it as cheaply as possible you dont. Three lenses costs more. Minimum is minimum. Cant shoot with less than  lens. Any more than  lens is not the minimum.gt You put aside  for camera rental and  for lenses?? Yes I did. Choosing the red was the only consideration I made for sale value. Everything else I kept minimum.gtAnd who is operating this audio equipment? Sure you can rent a boom and a zoom for  a day.... but your shitty audio will let down this film quicker than any other department. This is where the money SHOULD be going.Minimum is minimum though. Who said I would boom and stick it? Minimum is stationary mic hidden in shot.Come to think of it I can drop that price a bit. The line in amp on most smart phones is actually not too horrible and lavs are available targeting exactly that. Pretty sure those lavs can be bought for less than  each.  on screen talent max  lavs. Might be marginally cheaper.gtAre people packing their own lunches and bringing a canteen with their own coffee? WHERE IS THE CATERING?!?! Again. Minimum is minimum. Yes they have to bring their own food. Minimum wage laws say that only a certain very tiny amount can be taken out for food against minimum wage. I cant do food for that price so they bring their own.gtAlso a RED package without lenses doesnt cost  a day to hire. Yeah I missed on that one too.

3715484,0,t3_32xf26,I would echo a lot of what youve already heard here regarding ths being a very strong film for someone in high school. Ive seen far less cohesive pieces done by supposed professionals. That said the music choice is overwrought early on and sounds like youre trying too hard to tell the audience hey you should feel sympathetic here. Mixing it up and definitely choosing points in the film to have no music would help to ensure that the times you do use it will have maximum impact. Its constrained due to relying heavily on talking heads and so having as much archival broll as possible will help give a sense of whats been lost or whats at stake. For myself I kept being annoyed by the lighting for the limbo interviews. I wouldve at least had a backlight so they separate from the black background.But the bottom line is that this is a very VERY strong student film. You have a lot to be proud of here.

3834330,0,t1_cqtafto,Thank you duckbitt!For what was different about it I responded to a different question over in the other thread on rmovies and Ill quote that response below because I think that it sort of applies.gt There were a lot of firsts for me on this movie which was both rather nervewracking and incredibly exciting.gt The biggest revelation was probably that preparation is even more important than I expected it to be. I knew that I would be nervous going in so my team and I worked really hard to have a strong plan for how to approach every scene well in advance. Obviously on the day things change because of the realities of your schedule your location and various things that you couldnt have foreseen or perhaps just overlooked.gt The biggest challenge might have been just learning to deal with the grind of shooting a feature. I cant speak for every first time feature director but I really didnt sleep very much during principal photography. Id say that on average I got about two hours of sleep per night during our shooting weeks and then just crashed on the weekends. Id stay up at night going over dailies and preparing for the next day.gt That isnt such a big deal when youre talking about a short where youre shooting for a few days or perhaps a little bit over a week but when youre doing that for six weeks straight it takes its toll. Thankfully we did all of that careful preparation or it would have made executing the plan much more difficult.As for what I enjoyed I just love filmmaking man! I love the fact that its so collaborative. I love stories. I love photography. I love design. If theres one thing that this process hammered home for me its that making movies is what I want to do with the rest of my life. If I wasnt entirely sure before No Stranger Than Love then I know it to be true now.EDITSorry I just realized that second part didnt really answer your question properly. I guess I like the opportunity to tell a more detailed story with more interesting character arcs a more complex plot and a broader range of themes and characters. In a short you generally have to be very specific or you risk having a film that feels unfocused. With a feature you have more license to explore a range of interconnected themes.,Filmmakers,cqtci63,1,t5_2r1ip

3846923,0,t3_34ere8,I dont have alot of experience with Kickstarter but I feel like the story of the movie is incredibly ambitious considering the budget that you have in mind even if its a short. I dont know if you own your own studio or soundstage or know people or friends that already have the resources but when I hear a story of a noirgreek mythology genre fusion along with motion capture technology I dont think k will cover the entire production. And I dont know if this is true or has been proven but when people see a kickstarter that has a lowmodest figure people are less inclined to donate or they think the quality of the final product will not be good or the people involved are not committed Im not saying this about your kickstarter and Im not attacking you. But I feel like if youre going to realize a very creative and visually distinctive movie then you should go for broke because you dont really have anything to lose regardless. Im not saying ask for millions of dollars but maybe ask for at least K or moreJust thinking about the costs and ignoring the obvious requirements bumps up the budget like catering securing locations hiring production trucks. There are alot of little things that when combined rack up costs to a significant amount.You also need to boil down the synopsis of the movie in a very easy to understand and palatable way so that anyone who watches it can understand regardless of their knowledge of film. When I watched it I never got a clear idea of what the story was. I probably misheard it or didnt fully understand but if Im not getting it then there are probably others who dont understand it either.Also this is a very minor thing but seeing the photshopped pictures I can tell that you borrowed it from Sin City  and the other image from another movie. For me personally when I see that it kind of raises red flags in my mind. When you could have easily drawn or commissioned an artist to do that for you. Your pitch video is very good and is well edited and you know alot of interesting people that can help you and its smart that you highlighted that in the video. I dont know why more people arent donating. Have you thought about going on other peoples podcasts or shows and promoting the movie there?

3953855,0,t1_cr6xres,gt I hear this a lot. People hear VFX and automatically assume  per shot. Its just how everyones been trained to think. Ive worked on microbudget projects and delivered shots for as little as . Obviously I dont want to set my prices that low for everything but Id like to get over the preconceived idea that vfx are unaffordable. Any thoughts on that?Im one of those people. Didnt even ask about pricing because I assumed I would be laughed out of town. I certainly understand where youre coming from in terms of pricing. I want people to understand I will work with lower budgets but without destroying any chance I have at making a living wage. Im sorry to say I dont really have a good answer to that problem. I think the line VFX for Independent Filmmakers on your website gets the point across well enough. After that Im thinking the only thing you can really do would be to find out what they need and get as much info on how much money they have to work with as possible.gt This is a really good point and one Ive been considering for a little while. Its a real Catch. Filmmakers dont use VFX because they dont know how and filmmakers dont know how to use VFX because theyve never done it.gt A solution that Ive considered is creating a free video or video series about how to work with a VFX artist or supervisor. It would give a highlevel overview of the process of VFX from preproduction through postproduction from the perspective of what a director or producer could expect how they can plan their shots and what will be required by the VFX artist or studio. Would you watch something like that and if so what specific points do you think it would need to cover?I actually think thats a really fantastic idea.

4094437,0,t1_crmwhch,Greetings! Its true New York is far away across the pond but I may be visiting the New York Comic Con this year if things go well. Id be holding an armor making exhibition there.Anyway you dont really need anyone to personally teach you the craft as long as you have a pair of hands a capable brain and Internet access. For working cold sheet steel  most of armor parts all you need is a pair of scissors two or three hammers a hardwood stump a heavy metal ball some sort of an anvil a railroad track is a popular choice. A drill or a sharp metal punch would be necessary for making holes and an angle grinder helps a lot with the finish. Its really just common garage equipment if you dont have those tools already you can get them real cheap.You dont need a lot of space for the work but the noise tends to irritate the neighbours so its best to locate your workshop in a garage or a cellar.Feel free to ask me about anything you want to know.

Be aware that youll be there for long hours and the temperature may change so be prepared and efficient even in your attire.. Colors Dark colors please. Avoid busy and bright prints on TShirts and the like if you are wearing them. Basically you dont want your clothes to reflect light on set unnecessarily. . Onset jeans are perfectly fine but a they may be too hot and b you still should present yourself professionally so go with jeans that are in good condition.Note Im not a female filmmaker but have run internship and PA programs on sets.

So the SEC was created and these are the rules that developed over time.

So they are altering them a bit to make some small exceptions for crowdfunding.The way kickstarter works now is a work around.

Thankfully I was Union on some features but worked internationally on another.  hour days  days a week with only an  hour day on Sunday! What a weekend! Worked those hours for a few months. The only thing that kept me going was regular exercise every day and yoga  times a week. And I still crashed for  months when I got home. If the producers making the schedules actually knew what it took to deliver those files they would be able to budget their time better. But sadly you get a lot of producers and coordinators that cant be the artist so they walk around with the clip board telling real artists what to do. Its pretty broken business model.

4185952,0,t3_38s1x1,They are just tinted glass that comes in a variety of densities. They take away light either before the lens or between the lens and the sensor. They allow you to control your exposure without having to use the aperture shutter speed or ISO that is without changing your desired depth of field amount of motion blur or amount of image noise and dynamic range.Say you want to shoot at an f because it gives you just the depth of field you want and at s shutter speed because that gives you just the right amount of motion blur and at ISO  because thats your cameras sweet spot for low noise and highest dynamic range. But now your image is  stops overexposed! No problem just throw in an ND . sometimes called x ND for still photography gear and that will bring down the exposure by  stops.Neutral means that it affects the entire spectrum of visible light equally i. e. you wont get color shifts ideally even with heavy filtration. Unfortunately with sensor ratings everincreasing these days the traditional filters often dont cut it anymore in the nearinfrared spectrum if you take away a lot of light small color shifts add up so you may have to throw in an additional IR filter occasionally. ,Filmmakers,crxefeh,18,t5_2r1ip

You need to worry about it.Put the generator as far from the scene as possible with the exhaust pointed away from the action but not toward hard surfaces that will reflect the noise back at the set. Put the largest objects between the generator and the set possible think building grip truck parked car wall berm stack of apple boxes....Building a tent out of moving blankets may take you back to the good old days of pillow forts and sleepovers but they honestly do very little to help. Furny pads are for stopping sound reflections not blocking sound. You would be better off hanging thick rubber mats from cstands rather than furnies.Do not leave the generator on a cart. Itll rattle the cart and make even more noise. Put it on the ground preferably on soft soil rather than a hard surface.Only use the genny if you absolutely have to.

4398987,0,t1_cslgld5,Something to keep in mind not knowing how or what youre applying these effects to even for anamorphic films of the period the opticals would often be done in a spherical format.  Main titles or visual effects because of the multiple optical steps in the process.ILM routinely did effects and opticals for anamorphic films in VistaVision which is a horizontal mm more like regular stills photography Lazy  for perfs rather than the vertical perfs of normal cinema mm.  They even added motors to conventional stills cameras for some miniature work for space considerations as well as availability of actual VistaVision cameras.Doug Trumbull did higher quality effects miniatures and opticals for anamorphic mm in the mm format like for Close Encounters and Blade Runner.  When all these digital lens flare effects started to show up largely thanks to Lightwave and John Knoll you saw a lot of folks doing homage pieces to Blade Runner but they mistakenly put in anamorphic flaring on the shots with visual effects while in the real Blade Runner you dont see any of that because these were done spherical mm.,Filmmakers,csli0si,2,t5_2r1ip

The original post stated a super clear delineation between what a dp and director do. I wasnt talking about anything else. People in each department know not to step into other departments jobs like moving lights etc. but the question was whether or not the director and dps jobs overlapped and the answer was a firm no. This is simply not true and there is a fluidity to the dpdirector relationship that is usually established prior to shooting but even then the director has sway on the set of course and he can be as involved with the camera as he wants to be. This sub is filled with people like you who think theyre the big shot among a pool of little filmmakers who dont know what theyre doing and have to be arrogant and start fights like this.

4600160,0,t1_ctaferp,I agreed with Chris Reed that if you have to worry about spicing up a shot for it to be on par with the rest of the film it probably means that the shot is not essential and can be scrapped in favor of making the essential shots better. You mentioned post production as an argument to script and shot list discussion  which implied you were a fix it in post guy. If you were active in the field youd probably agree with Chris because the more you have to add to make a single shot look good the more the rest of the film suffers. Anything other than that is misconstrued information due to me being on my cell phone making it difficult to base a discussion around an analogy that doesnt really fit. Lastly  I dont think Im better than most of the people here. I do think Im better than you though. Its not my hours. Its your attitude. What makes a community work is constructive discussion.

A simple Thats fine followed by a zip archive of a selection of the music and original SFX stems made things clear enough for us. It wouldnt hold up in court but it was obvious from our producers interactions with them that they were just up for doing us a favour and obviously going so far as to save us the effort of recording sound from the game ourselves suggested that we had their blessing. Requesting a formal agreement would have been a bit ungrateful in such a situation.Which is why Id further recommend trying to have a phone conversation with the relevant party more doable with smaller outfits so you can judge their mood and make your usage intentions perfectly clear then an email exchange to get a written confirmation. No doubt theyd have been miffed if wed taken their music and made it the theme tune to the film so not taking the piss is also a golden rule and of course if theyve really made your sound editors week by giving you the master recordings a special thanks in addition to the normal credit is just good manners.,Filmmakers,ctcq7cy,2,t5_2r1ip

I dont know anything about the film scene around Philly but its my understanding that Craigslist and Mandy.com are two websites for job hunting that are popular for you Yanks.  Snoop around Reddit and Facebook for filmtype groups to join.  Then once you get on set ask the other PAs how they find work and swap phone numbers with em.I would also recommend contacting your local film unions which are probably DGA and IATSE but again my Canadian knowledge of these thing is imperfect.

4777873,0,t3_3g8oz0,One thing to keep in mind is that a cinematographer is second in command on set.  They have to run the camera sparks and grip departments.  And because of that they have to command respect  and the only real way for that to happen is by paying their dues in the trenches and working their way up like everyone else had to do.  So whether you have a degree or not you will have to start out as an intern in a camera department then climb the ladder through the grades over a period of several years  because otherwise the crews are just not going to respect you.  Other than that the best advice I can give is to start building relationships with directors or people who are aiming to be directors because if they find someone they can get on with they will be loyal to you.  Film shoots are horrible if the director and DP dont get on so the director will always favour someone who they like working with.  ,Filmmakers,ctwsjbk,2,t5_2r1ip

If it hadnt been for the title and description I would have no clue what this video was about. Get creative with the subject matter! Use different angles and please please dont just show me  different shots of flowers getting picked  at the very most might have been fine. Also why did you only show one of the guys? I feel like this was a huge piece of why the theme of the video was lost.Using copyrighted music is also a bad idea if the video is going anywhere online there are tons of royalty free music sites on the internet with music you can use.For your next video focus on the story behind the video more.,Filmmakers,ctzzf8k,1,t5_2r1ip

Mind you the wires are supposed to be able to hold incredible amounts of weight. When the snap came and the wires got fully extended the wire fucking broke.

Every single thing that exists now every market that exists was created out of nothing.  Think about it.  Yes the game that was created does require biological survival tickets ie money but happiness is most important.

Imagine how nice this world would be if everyone was doing a job that they were interested in and care about?Before anyone says Everyone cant be rockstars.  Thats not even an answer.  I once watched a guy a cement layer work with his trowel on this tiny pillar that was attaching an vestibule to a sidewalk to cover up the bolts.  He did this for over an hour sitting there on the ground in the sun with a cigarette hanging out of his mouth making it completely smooth and perfect.  He loved what he did and he took pride in it.  Im sure he could have a chance at a bigger salary working his way up from behind a desk at some insurance agency or something but he really loved what he did.I watched my dad die of cancer last year and although I was already in this mindset I definitely have doubleddown on that fact.  That man never took a vacation ever.  He never called out sick.  He worked for a handful of companies as a technician his entire life minus his time at West Point during Vietnam.  The last company he worked for for  years.

5105639,0,t1_cv1drm8,Respectfully disagree.  This film is fundamentally less about the character and more about desire ambition and will.  Our main character is clearly different from the beginning but that doesnt mean he doesnt change.  More importantly our perception of him changes.  In the beginning I thought maybe he had aspbergers and had developed a slightly too perfect set of social skills to hide it.  By the end its clear that hes a complete psychopath.  In the beginning hes virtually aimless just an unemployed weirdo trying to make money and survive.  By the end he is passionately committed to his new art and will stop at nothing to succeed at it.  We are simultaneously delighted and horrified by how far he is willing to go to get what he wants.  In the beginning we think he doesnt understand how people work by the end we realize he understands exactly how people work but doesnt see them as anything but a means to his ends.  This is the tale of the rise of a villain and terrifyingly shows how caring about and respecting people is the primary obstacle to success in the modern world.Interestingly both Whiplash and Nightcrawler are about how humanity gets in the way of creating great art and must be sacrificed to create perfection.,Filmmakers,cv1f4pe,9,t5_2r1ip

5177221,0,t3_3lvijz,Hey GoofnargI watched your short and enjoyed it. I have some comments please take them to heart as I think your film will benefit from it. . Delete your short film from the internet NOW. Any festival that matters will not accept entries that have been premiered online. . Do not submit to shortoftheweek.com  yet. Generally speaking short films have a life expectancy of  years in the festival circuit. To clarify  film festivals will accept short films made in  or . So in your case only submit until after  to online platforms such as shortoftheweek.com if you want to compete. . Rerecord your actors voiceover in a proper sound studio or have it mixed by someone to get the reverb out and to make it warmersounding. . I think youll do yourself a favor if you work on your short films grading. I like what you did with the color palette and if you grade properly it will stand out even more. . Im not too sure what to think about the daydream being in black amp white. I like the scene very much but I see daydreams as something vivid. To have it shown in black amp white is contradictory to me. I know you did this to stress the difference between the real and the imaginary but my humble suggestion would be to see what happens when you show it in color. Is it more absurd? Does the audience still understand what is going on? . I dont know if more people helped you on set decoration lighting sound catering ... but I advise you to credit those people too.In all I really do like your short film and I am only giving you this advice because I think you were able to capture a story in a concise and straightforward way. It is a bit quirky but not too much and by no means is it selfindulgent. Good work!,Filmmakers,cva1mrl,5,t5_2r1ip

5184877,0,t3_3m0b20,Your question is very vague. Filmmaking can be defined in many different ways and artistic and technical goals within the medium can usually be achieved in a variety of different ways.That said Ill try my best to be helpful still. A mm lens would be very wide and a poor choice as your only lens. Im guessing you are using a camera with a . crop factor since you mentioned that you are on a budget and considering a lens for the Canon EF mount. If that is the case and you are only going to have access to the one lens you plan on purchasing then I recommend something that is around the mm range. That focal length on a . crop factor camera will probably be useful in a greater amount of situations for you.Lowbudget  General Filmmaking Lens SuggestionsCanon EF mm f. STM LensCanon EFS mm f.

5314785,0,t3_3ns6kp,Man I really dont want to be negative but I have been doing this a long time and I can tell you with absolute certainty that resumes dont mean shit in this business. What you really need to do is to figure out how to stand out from the crowd what specifically can you bring to the table that the other students or potential interns cant.Also just so you know those companies are not looking for people to work on set they are looking for artists or managers or office interns or people who do jobs for the company off set. The reason I know this is because the majority Probably close to  of the movies commercials or whatever these companies produce are unionized productions and about the only non union people on those sets are PAs and crafty unless its LA in which case remove the PAs from that list.The way crew is hired is usually the hire up I.E. Producers will pick a director the director will pick hisher AD staff and DP DP will Hire his gaffer and key Grip Key grip and gaffer will hire his crew and so on and so forth all the way down to the PAs and Interns usually hired by the AD staff. Anyway all this is to say that they probably are not going around to schools looking for set PAs so if what you want to do is on set hate to say it but dont expect that from this. Expect that they are looking for people who want to work for the company in their headquarters doing office stuff not necessarily creative stuff.Anyhow I wish you all the luck in the world but if you really want to get on set find out where the productions in your town are and try to get into the production office to meet with the production coordinator or even better an AD. Tell them your a film student and you want to work for free as an intern. If they make you an office PA offer to take the football folder with deal contracts call sheets and Misc shit for people to sign to set it will give you an opportunity to meet everyone on set and to network. Its how I got my start and in less then a week I went from office PA to Lighting technician. Also pro tip grips love beer and so do sparks bring a six pack to the best boy of ether department and you will have instant friends. Tell them your super interested in learning and if they have any openings your really eager to be on set. Trust me this shit works you should also look into joining IATSE or another union like  or something. Its a catch  nightmare but if you want it bad enough there are always people that can help you out. Also in the future the same people you gave a six pack too could be the same people who help vote you into the union it all comes around. Good luck           ,Filmmakers,cvr0yig,5,t5_2r1ip

The only vendor I can personally recommend is for DCPs  a filmmaker Ive spoken to but have never worked with no bias does really great quality DCPs as a side business and charges a pretty low rate from what I understand.Lastly  if you dont have the budget for it dont bother getting EampO until a distributor demands to see proof of it. They often ask for it without actually needing it since they all have waivers of liability in their distribution agreements. Depending on the size of the film not budget but how likely it is to make significant money this may actually be a requirement but with smaller releases it tends to be more of a want than a need if youre totally tapped if  if you have the cash its a great protection to have in place.,Filmmakers,cw2115o,2,t5_2r1ip

Sure you can pick up a DSLR for peanuts but the recording medium was never the expensive thing in film that was and still is the skilled labor of cast and crew.Also its completely different form the Music Video revolution which created a large demand for a new kind of film with budgets to make them. You can very easily draw parallels form producing or directing a music video to doing an ad or a feature. You cannot do that with the kind of content the internet demands. If you really think that running around recreating a video game in the flesh is the same as working with actors to craft a narrative your naivety about what a film is excludes you from participating in discussions on them.The interesting things on the internet right now are sketch comedy that could lead to a new way of doing funny but not bloated features and TV shows.

5533813,1,t1_cwin76y,I also think the film looks like a lot of fun however I understand what therangekind means when they say it doesnt appear to be technically good. First of all. No disrespect not only does this legitimately look like something Id want to see it really looks like itd be a great movie to watch with friends. And kudos to your friend for accomplishing this. What I can only gather from the trailer is first of all the trailer is just like any other trailer with loud noises and a bunch of cuts of the best parts of the movie. It doesnt possess a mystery leaving me wondering what there is to expect which I suppose would be inappropriate for this type of film anyways. It also seems like the story isnt very compelling looks like good fun but not something Im going to go home and think about the meaning long after Ive seen it. Visually speaking it looks as though they could have taken the look of it a little further more colours would have given it a more unique look maybe. Also the way things are shot seem to just be pretty generic. The camera only really capturing what needs to be seen nothing leaving us wondering how the fuck did they shoot that?. A lot of people forget that the camera is just as much a main character as any of the cast and the way in which things are shot can be so impactful to the story what the audience anticipates and of course how pretty things look. So far from the trailer it doesnt look like theres a lot going on in terms of the cinematography. On top of this I can only expect the editing to consist of basic scene transitions and maybe just maybe a dissolve. Films are a very unique and marvelous way to tell a story and all the things that make movies different from a book or a game arent being fully utilized here again at least so it seems from this very short snippet of the movie. However this story should definitely be told through a movie because of its accessibility and ability to be experienced with mates. And in that regard it looks like it will be a good movie one that perhaps will go on to cult status but even in that category theres still nothing cutting edge it seems. The visuality of it is nothing we havent seen before the story is one you can forget about the characters dont provide opportunities for oscar award winning acting and the cutting of scenes seems to be just pasting them together. However your friend has accomplished what I can only dream of doing myself one day and I have nothing but respect for them. Please take my harsh criticisms with a grain of salt maybe Im just a pretentious douche that watches too many silent films but I will definitely be watching this with my friends and a few beers one night. ,Filmmakers,cwizrtd,1,t5_2r1ip
5555051,0,t1_cwlbml3,Yeah... film was magic. I remember talking to Greg Heschong DP on the set of The Tracy Ullman Show a LONG time ago. I told him I thought of film as magic expose it today see an image tomorrow and it almost always looked better than expected. He agreed and that surprised me that someone whod shot it as long as he had still felt that kind of awe was pretty inspiring.I got pretty good at it my spot meter was my best friend and I knew what I was going to see the next day. I never did much fancy processing though and I wish Id been able to acquire those skills.Now I try to do this with HD light using my meter alone and wait to look at the monitor until I think I know what its going to look like.

If your investor wants to brag to his buddies about how hes a film producer lay out the statusbragging rights benefits and the parties theyll be invited to. If theyre a big john carpenter fan and youre doing a horror movie lay out how indie horror films have revolutionized American media. That kind of thing.Bios of the key players for sure especially any name talent. Numbers as accurately as you can get them for films with similar budgets and similar concepts that have been profitable including what they made and how. Expected shooting schedules and most importantly a detailed plan for how the money will be spent. Your investors want to know youre not going to mismanage their money and blow it all on production and not have enough for post or distribution.Also absolutely include any major ways youll plan on cutting costs.

Consider a unit that comes with the necessary inputs to avoid building your rig piecemeal. The Canon C comes to mind. Pair that with a DSLR offering from their brand in the   or  categories and you have a secondary unit that can shoot video and take photographs if needed.Mind you thats just Canon. You can rig up with Sony or Panasonic which have other offerings youll need to build on but can also provide K and better low light solutions.AudioDepends on how youre looking to capture your audio. If youre thinking boom you can package in with the RODE NTG series the  being a good budget solution.Also if youre looking for an external recorder youre going to want something compact. Offerings from Zoom and Tascam are great solutions at a reduced cost.This is a channel unit paired with the mic I previously mentioned  less some of the accessories but may help build a cheaper package. Also consider purchasing a lav kit the Sennheiser kit I linked below is industry spec. You can also buy the lav kits less the handheld if you dont require that.LightingBased of your requests youre going to most likely best with LED kits. As per standard setups youd be looking for two or three large panels and a couple of led keys. Also consider a LED RingLight which provides a great uniform wash for closed set talking heads. Youll have to do some research for the pieces and prices that do best for you.BagIm going to suggest Lowepro.

If youre not waking up to the motivation that is nausea extreme discomfort of the limbs and a girlfriend crying that your drug dealer doesnt have his phone on yet you arent doing it right. If you arent sticking the same needle in your arm from  weeks ago because you need every dime you have for gas and dope you arent doing it right. If you dont know a couple thats pregnant but cant stop because of physical withdrawal you arent doing it right. If you arent being evicted because the money you make goes to dope you arent doing it right. If you havent had a pet you had to let go by a lake in the heat of summer knowing it would have to survive the frigid winter you arent doing it right. You are trivializing the terrible decisions others have made. There is no way to research and know anything about it if you stop yourself before you live through the terror.  years. Try that. Then follow up with another three at least in a methadone clinic. Listen man I wish you the best. There are victories to be had in absolute physical addiction but they are all related to the dope in some way or form. Your movie cant help anyone though.

6222946,0,t1_cywfuwr,Oh man so many things...The image quality is superior in every regard. Its got higher resolution technically they both generate a p signal for record but the C Mark II has a K image sensor and the D Mark III line skips during image acquisition and the difference is abundantly apparent as a result and better colors and more latitude. The image is cleaner at higher ISOs and it has a better signalnoise ratio throughout the ISO spectrum. If you need even better image quality you have the option to run HDMI out to an external recorder changing the signal from Canons AVCHD bit  to Canons XF MPEG bit  mb...the same signal in the C.Its superior ergonomically too. The camera is so much more balanced than a D Mark III. The body is made out of magnesium alloy so its rugged and built like a tank to last on set but its still light and totally easy to use without the need for a rig or rails or a shoulder system.Lastly it has all the bells and whistles that youd expect from a purpose built video camera  XLR in for audio recording. Focus peaking focus check magnify while recording autofocus in camera waveform monitor and vectorscope this is a huge one and p. The C Mark II is better in basically every single way except price. Also theres more in the menus since theres increased functionality but theyre still the Canon menus  so if you have experience with the D Mark III youll have no problems picking up a C Mark II. Theyre very similar in the way things are organized and where functions are.,Filmmakers,cywzcg7,2,t5_2r1ip

They are not. These guys may have done all the dirty work themselves and rendered at home. But that is not a synonymous of cheap. If you translate their man time to dollars... the expense is fucking huge. Sum to that the personal drama... the time invested in such endeavors is time you take from or add to your day job.

Even if its a joke its a bad joke.  Better to just say unpaid than make a joke about how little you value the work of actors. The idea that compensation is based on how you feel about the finished product rather than the hard work of the people who participated. The biggest thing though in my opinion is the complete lack of effort put into explaining why anyone actors or random Manchester clubs would want to be a part of this project.  If youre not going to be paying people then you need to give them some reason to want to be in it.  Any reason to think its going to be a good finished product that actors will want on their reel previous experience? great concept? good location? love the script etc?  Is it a passion project of yours?  Are you a cool guy and good to work with?  Not saying anything persuasive just reeks of entitlement and that actors should be jumping at the chance to be in your film just because youve decided to make a facebook post.When you look at all of these things together it paints the picture of someone who really doesnt understand or value the amount of work that an actor puts into a film and thats why it sounds like a nonfilmmaker.  Anyone who had spent even a day on any kind of set should know enough not to have this attitude.,Filmmakers,czq1zlu,8,t5_2r1ip

6532890,0,t1_czv18dy,The biggest element of the analysis found in the video was one of color. How beige was used to show the complexity of morality. Now if you have seen the movie you will agree the movie is absolutely about at least in part how morality is shades of gray. Now with the analysis if you do not think in pre production the director the DP the costume designer the production designer etc did not sit together and think of the themes of the movie and how to show them visually you are crazy. The video does a great job showing how they used beige to show people and situations that were not morally black and white. That interrogation room those non decorated houses were clearly a choice by the director and everybody else.Now I agree with you when analysis videos go too in depth and shows the sequences of shots all meaning something incredibly specific it is not realistic as those are not the main priorities you would have in editing. Having it cut well with good pacing would always go above it. But for this video I thought the vast majority was interesting and spot on and to say people are foolish for thinking a good director manages to implement visually the theme of his films in his works is just plain naive.,Filmmakers,czv1wy4,1,t5_2r1ip

This spot shows craftsmanship and care.  A lot of aspiring directors could watch this and take notes.   Im a real life director you can tell by my internet flair so I thought Id give some advice to a scrappy up and comer.   Location.  It feels a bit lifeless.  Extras really help bring energy to a commercial.  This way it looks like there are people in the room with your actors and to the audience it will feel like a restaurant.  You chose to open on the patio which is a great decision.  But when you look at the shot there are only two people in it.  Which to my eye feels a bit off.  Take another look and I think youll see what I mean. Camera.  I love the stylistic choices that you and your DP made.  The footage was there you recorded it onto some media and I can imagine there was several gigabytes there that you had to work with.  So congrats on that its a vital step in the process.  My issue is that it doesnt look like it was shot in k.  k is a big thing because its a higher quality of resolution and youll want to make sure that your commercial is future proofed.   Sound mix.  All of your levels were good and I like the realism that you and your sound designer brought to it.  I really felt in the moment with the characters.  Cars passing background music city ambience are all great tools to take your audience into your world.  My only note is that I think the eating could use a bit more foley.  Next time youre in the studio really let your foley artists play around with the materials and just get creative with it.  I want to feel the juicy chicken and sound is a great way to do that.   Subject matter.  Your use of an interracial couple homosexual nonetheless is prescient.  Race and sexuality will be big talking points in the future so your choice to include them shows me that your finger is on the pulse if not even ahead of the pulse.   Graphics package.  Id probably have a talk with your graphics designer.  There are things like drop shadows and strokes that can make your graphics pop against the background.  I could see what they were going for here minimalist flat and those things can work.  But you need to feel comfortable telling your crew and staff what youd like and I feel like this one might have slipped through the cracks. Run time.   seconds is fine because your ad buyer can just buy one  second spot and one  second spot.

The patent is available for sale but building an enormously powerful enormously fast enormously scaled SSD is not overly difficult. Use one of the most advanced file systems on it and enjoy. At maximum density that . inch form factor could store around TB with speeds around GBsec. I want to use that drive.Use a base station that is basically a blazebox of SSDs for transport.gt  ProRes to CFastIm just against both of those for recording.Prores will never be able to compete with actual RAW.

CFast is simply universally worse.gt  user LUTsAs long as it is meta data only never actually changing the stored data.

By building it directly into the camera the offsets can be taken into account precisely. This level of integration would also allow for touchscreen focusing that would never make a mistake.

6867122,0,t1_d0ud0xk,It certainly is bad if you are conscious of it. If your work just happens to end up looking like someone elses that can be fine as you were clearly influenced by them. But if when making your shot list or on the set you are thinking to yourself ok how can we make this a Tarkovsky shot? then you are divorcing yourself from your own intuition and trying to take on the intuition of someone else which you cant do and ultimately you just end up looking like a cheap copy. It is absolutely VITAL to have your own style whether that means a truly original style or simply an amalgamation of styles guided by your own intuition. The point is if you TRY to be someone else you will fail. ,Filmmakers,d0up63b,1,t5_2r1ip

I did experience that for years. Just like the people who the Duplass brothers are talking to nobodies who have a visionpassion for film and want to make it. Its the same in architecture. If you want to make it youre going to have to create a lot of useless shit and stinkers before youre capable of producing something worthwhile.Or engineering. Step into a  engineering class project where they are trying to make a model or design something. Its . likely going to be shit. Does that mean they shouldnt proceed with the project? I would say no because they need to go through this in order to learn.In short the Duplasses are not talking about professionals aiming to pump out shit after shit. Theyre merely saying if you want to be good at something hard youll have to be shit for a while and dont let that shittiness get you down.

When a movie relies on plot to move the characters from one scene to another in a story it feels forced tedious and inconsequential. What Kubricks a master at and what great filmmakers seem to agree upon is that character is better at driving the story forward. In other words how the story moves forward is a result of how a character would deal with a particular set of circumstances. If your character is deep and nuanced and heshe is making decisions based on internal logic that the audience knows and understands then no explanation is needed and no external plot devices are necessary to move himher forward.

And after the last verse the chorus could have been really impactful because the audience now knows the true meaning of the words of that chorus.  Just a suggestion not a critique on that video.

7970776,0,t3_4oam3b,The way you need to view this is angle of view not focal length. Focal length is a property of the rear lens element to the front lens element meaning that the focal length of a lens never changes but the sensor size determines the field of view that the image taken is. Crop factor is based off of full frame format mm film sensor is x factor. So theres no crop factor change between using a DX and FX lens but the issue you run into is image circle size. A lens produces a circular image and only a portion of it is used for the rectangular sensor. This is why you can use FX lenses on a DX body but not vice versa without using the .x crop mode the image circle produced by a DX lens wont cover a full frame sensor and would create massive vignetting.   Now how a speed booster works is more complicated. The smaller sensor on your Blackmagic is about a third the size of a full frame sensor which FX lenses are designed to cover. Imagine taking a picture with a full frame body then cropping it to a third the size and youll get the idea. This is shown much better in visual representations on field of view comparison websites.   Speed boosters scale down the image circle making it so that more of the circle is covering the sensor essentially reproducing the effects of a larger sensor. If you have a DX lens at mm itd be the same field of view as a FX lens at mm if you used both with your speed booster so youre not going to get a  ratio.  Disclaimer The technicalities behind image circle and crop factor gets argued so much in this subreddit my description of it works fine to understand how the concept works but theres always some flaw with technical explanations so dont take what I say as the  truth in how speed boosters work.,Filmmakers,d4bzo7h,1,t5_2r1ip

Buy all the screenwriting books you can and use them on your screenplays. That will help you just as much as the course. You can still write your little heart out but I would eithrr try to pull your portfolio together and  get into the  editing program or go into TV production where youll learn a little bit of everything. The plus side to going the editing route is  youll be able to participate in the thesis film.  of the students in the film production program are horrible writers excluding screenwriting who dont get to participate which will give you an advantage above the rest if you choose to submit a script for a thesis.,Filmmakers,d4jgxm4,1,t5_2r1ip

8180845,0,t3_4rd2ec,Cool that you broke the fourth wall literally. Reminded me of the Truman Show and Stranger than Fiction. I liked the cinematography change up for each different story. It shows you understand the dramatic purpose of the handheld camera and the importance of a fluid steady shot. But the only point of contention I have is that the narrator since he controls the story why does he decide to change the story for Jack? He says something along the lines that Jack is happy and shouldnt be killed off. Why bother even reading the story? It makes it sound like the narrator isnt omnipotent but than that is contradicted at the end of the short where he controls the people who attack Jack.I would have liked to see the juxtaposition between the narrators emotion in each story. Maybe one day he is feeling rather malicious so he decides to kill off Jack. Another day he wants Jack to fall in love etc. etc. But obviously the short is professionally done. So besides the storys inconsistencies it was pleasant to watch. ,Filmmakers,d505lmf,3,t5_2r1ip

8249904,0,t3_4saxjz,Owner of a teleprompting company here. We get many calls from producers asking do you have an Interrotron? We then have to explain no but we have the same thing.  Interrotron has become one of those words like Xerox Kleenex Jacuzzi Zamboni or Frisbee. I forget the term for it when a product name becomes what its known as. I tell them is just two teleprompters hooked up to each other and wed be glad to help. Its really just a glorified skype call thats local. If you watch the closing video of the Micrsoft E briefing announcing their new console thats our most recent public stuff using the high end gear. I think this could have been easily done with an EyeDirect which we own as well but they wanted all the toys.There are many ways to achieve a faceintheprompter.  It can be done where the directorinterviewer isnt even on set. In that above video I mentioned sometimes the director was in town and the subject was out of town and vise versa even as far as Sweden.  We would send the hero camera and hero audio to the director via skype and whatever camera they had on their end mobile phone or laptop is what the talent would see.  The sound from the remote source was sent to the audio guy and he pumped it through as small monitor under the camera on the floor.  If you wanted you could just use a laptop camera and put that in the prompter if you had to do it quick and dirty. Just place the laptop camera in front of the client monitor as best you can to keep the directorinterviewers eye movement to a minimum.Ive run out of typing time for the moment.

8317187,0,t1_d5h1tk1,Nowadays since most theaters are digital there arent really full on projectionist jobs anymore at least in the theater I used to work at. I initially applied just as a regular employee whos duties were to work the registers at concessions box office and usher the theaters which basically meant cleaning up trash after each show. This is actually the only position that the theater I worked at hires people for besides managers. Then after a few months I asked management if I could start getting projectionist shifts and since I was a good worker they gave it to me. The only difference that came with that though was in the beginning and end of each of my shift I would have to run upstairs make sure the LMS the computer that all  of our screens were connected to and had access to was green meaning all the shows were loaded up and ready to automatically play on their own. After that I would have to come downstairs and still be on register etc. theater chains are a business at the end of the day and if they could have a computer do the job of a projectionist they will. I can honestly say that I was only up in booth about  percent of the time during my shifts after I became a projectionist but they were damn sure the best moments of each of those shifts. Realistically the only career you can get today at these bigger theater chains that has to do with projection would be a tech. Techs go around to their designated theaters and work on issuesupdates and basically things that normal projectionists wouldnt be able to do. ,Filmmakers,d5h7dpi,1,t5_2r1ip

8348437,0,t3_4txhcb,Hi! I just graduated from  years of film school and Ive been freelancing for awhile now. The answer isnt as clear cut as you might hope. I mainly focus my time in sound work but I also work in Grip Lighting and PAing of course. In my opinion the best director is one that UNDERSTANDS the facets of a large majority of roles on set. Its about leadership as much as it is vision the director is the lead on the project and as such needs to be a good leader. In my opinion good leadership comes from understanding respect and passion. So I believe if you want to be the best director and producer you can be you should at least dabble in as many roles as you can enough to fully understand that jobs role and its major impact on the film and common setbacks that role runs into but most importantly to understand where that role fits on the ladder so to speak. I often guide a lot of the underclassmen that are still in school and tell them the same way Im explaining to you. Its fantastic that you want to direct the industry needs directors as much as it needs other crew but its important to remember that going to film school and learning HOW to direct is not going to get you a startup job in the industry its just fact. You are right you need some sort of concrete skill whereas directing is more abstract or at least a verbalcommunicative skill that will get you started. This is why most people start as a PA thats where I started thats where I still go most of the time. Im honestly a little shocked and annoyed that your experience PAing seems mostly negative I havent had the same experience and it frustrates me that there are still people out there working that way. Regardless I know this has been long winded but TLDR Its important to have a working experience of at least some of the major roles on a film set so I would definitely recommend going out for those roles but you should not skimp on your learning about directing. Directing is actually a skill that can be taught and must be learned. I think PAing is still a beneficial experience perhaps you may have to tweak how you approach it to get the best out of it. If I can be of any more help feel free to message me. I kind of rambled here.,Filmmakers,d5l3vkz,7,t5_2r1ip

8454798,0,t3_4v9ccj,Very nicely lit guys the piece looks beautiful.  My thoughts...From a performance perspective it felt really rehearsed really static. It didnt feel like your talent was listening to each other the lines just felt like lines. The accents were good but they didnt feel present in the moment for me.  The biggest thing your actors can do is to listen to each other in a dialogue scene like this. Give them all a motivation I know its cliche or tacky or whatever but they need it. I think you could have used GASP a bit more coverage and it would have solved lots of things. Right now its mostly your wide shot and then you cut to each persons single if theyre talking.  I think if you used a few more shots and over the shoulder shots it would have been a bit easier to understand the geography of the thing.  You also go RIGHT into everyones closeup and it immediately kills any weight your closeup may have had.  Lets say you go from your master shot to a bunch of  shots but only punch in for a CU on moments that matter this doesnt mean dialogue could just be someones reaction then youve used a CU to tell story instead of just identify whos talking.Its subjective but I think this would have felt better handheld the  tilts the waiter and the tilt from dudes knuckles up to his face felt really bad almost comedic and would have worked better handheld or by using  shots instead of tilting to get  shots in . Theres also a few bad cuts in here that cross the  degree line and really confuse the space. Research that its hard with so many characters I get it.I didnt mind the music but I guess it is a bit heavy handed. The scene may have felt better if the music sat way back in the mix or it felt like it was coming from a distant speaker that was actually in the space yknow? Could help give the location a bit of texture.Thanks guys it was fun to watch this and provide some thoughts. Keep making shit you guys are going to kill it.,Filmmakers,d5ydvbv,2,t5_2r1ip

New York however immediately departs from that when you consider the population size and the fact that NY has dropped as a major production hub. Suddenly they include Austin probably just because thats their favorite place but it has no production size or value and the residents who work in film there are probably far more casual about it.

That said Im convinced I didnt get into USC as a straightA student because my application video sucked. I had been making videos for  or  years but it was pretty shoddy. I think theyre tough all around.If youre going to apply do not apply to just the big name schools. Look at the Hollywood Reporters list of the top  film schools and look at some of the other programs available. I essentially only got into  school and got rejected from all the big names USC etc..

And Im not the best guy to ask about audio but what I can tell you is the primary difference in a better recorder will give you more options to get better sound in varying environments. If course youd need a mixer who actually knows how to use those advanced functions goes. In terms of objective quality a dedicated recorder will have better preamps which gives you a better signal to noise ratio. In addition youll likely be able to recorder a wider range of volumes. Thats about all Ive got for ya someone more knowledgeable may be able to chime in. But I do want to say that again this doesnt mean recording into the camera is the wrong choice.

9138808,0,t3_55fkga,Depends on what youll need more reframing options and sharpness or flexibility with the colour grade. If youre going for a natural look bit with a C is amazing. The canon cameras already have a natural look out of the box especially with skin tones. Alternatively if you want to do something visually stylized the extra colour information may be invaluable in creating your look. That said you should do a majority of your colour work on set with through the cinematography lighting costuming and production design.  Honestly it depends on the project but if the DoP and colourist are talented  bit is more than enough for most projects. We shot a short last month on the FS in HD  bit  hr film project and it absolutely wasnt restricted by its format. We intentionally chose only HD not k as we needed post to be lightning quick.Also consider your bitrate for each resolution as well as overall data rates.

Reverb in audio takes an audio signal applies a few filters reducing the gain mostly time shifts it and adds it back to the original signal. This process is applied iteratively until the signal being added back in is below a certain threshold.Audio frames are far simpler than video frames a single sample of audio is a single scalar value compared to a video frame which is a large D tensor but theres nothing that prevents the application of the same idea. Take a series of video frames adjust the gain to decay the signal timeshift them and add them back to the original stream repeat until the added frames are essentially all black.,Filmmakers,d9mrvx1,7,t5_2r1ip

You say you want it to be more Filmmaker friendly but what exactly does that mean? Right now it looks kind of like a sharing platform like YouTube so the rest of my feedback will be tailored to that idea. If so are youre using the old movies as placeholders for other users content? I like the description when you click on it and the colors are very fun. I think the yellow may be a little obnoxious but maybe if you changed the hue a little to a sun kissed orange color itd be more inviting. I dislike how you have to sign in to access the movies but you did say its in early development so the lack of features will be fixed later I assume. It looks great and functions well so far!

The only exception is when a particular production has a workflow in place that requires it of you such as using a colorcoded pagerevision workflow requiring features specific to FD.I use FadeIn. Its only  its a vastly better writing environment and reads and writes FD files so you can send anyone an .fdx file whenever they need it. Why vastly better? FD has not only such backwards design thinking that they not only JUST THIS VERSION provided a fullscreen distractionfree screenwriting mode but they have such snobby contempt for their user base that its only available in the Mac version. This to me is disqualifying. The interface on PC is shockingly ugly and distracting and antiquated after years of revisionsanother disqualifier.FadeIn has a fullscreen interface is FULLY crossplatform in features and not just in file compatibility readswrites FD files and has personal support from the creator. I emailed a bug report once and not only did I get a personal reply he fixed it in the next release. He even provided me a custom discount code for my students despite the fact it was already fifty dollars less than the academic version of FD. Support FadeIn.

That makes problems when the off axis sound is reflections of the sound in front of the mic.  It can sound all washed out due to parts of it getting cancelled out.  A hypercardioid diaphram condenser is probably the best choice.  Sennheiser MKH is pretty close to the standard but they are pretty pricy.  An Audix SCXHC is another good option and the Rode NT is perhaps worth looking at as well.Your best option for room treatment is probably some cstands and blankets.

10067368,0,t3_5jxskn,Starting with the positives the cinematography outside was great and the performances felt like that if they were given some material with greater depth than they would have really shined so the actors were great. Moving on to the aspects where improvements could be made is that you should consider reediting the opening sequence where he is in the house. It felt like dragging and the shots were unnecessarily long. Secondly the indoor cinematography could have been much more natural perhaps you guys didnt have the time to do it right or whatever the case it feels like the movie was shot by two different cinematographers considering how great the lighting was outside which was Im guessing available lighting. Thirdly the sound design could have been richer and the dialogues could have used less processing. When you prcoess the dialogue too much you can hear a sound that resembles the sound of water draining down the pipe so perhaps you can go back and do some ADR or reclean the dialgue to make it sound natural. Overall if youre willing to shoot a film with just three crew members than it means that your willing to go through the pain of making small films and then moving on to better things so keep it up and good luck. Also try to move away from shallow love stories and consider diving into thought provoking characters with intriguing storylines that would make the audience feel like that they wish they were more like that character. P.S  Keep making films expecting to some great stuff from you in the future.,Filmmakers,dbjsuoe,2,t5_2r1ip

10082639,0,t3_5k6erw,Sweet.For best results I recommend getting an audio recorder and syncing your audio in post.  Many cameras especially those under  have fairly low end preamps.  Your audio ends up sounding like the people who call into radio stations.  Hissing weird buzzing and clicks etc.  Plus most cameras dont have very good audio controls at all and in almost all cases other than extreme close up shits the mic is about five times too far away if mounted on the camera which makes it almost impossible to get the best audio.The Tascam DRDMKII is a staple of inexpensive recording.  However the new Zoom F or F are strongly worth considering.  I have the F and it is quite satisfactory.,Filmmakers,dblscsf,1,t5_2r1ip

I know its far from perfect and theres a lot of stuff I wanted to do lower thirds audio behind my parts etc. but in the end I just ran out of time as I thought it more important that I just get it out there rather than just sit on it for ages.  You might even hear my daughters in the background at one point I could have cleaned it up but didnt notice it until right at the end and by that time just couldnt be bothered haha.Its something Ive wanted to start doing for a long time and took a lot of courage and takes! to actually stand in front of a camera and do it.

What youre really doing is providing a direction for the story and the blueprint for the characters and plot and once you pass it off basically everything can change. With literary works its totally different  the author is in complete control. What is possible on the page in a novel a play or a short story is far greater than what is possible on the page in a screenplay simply because those first three dont go through a process of refinement and creative collaboration to bring the vision to life on screen. The words are destined for the page and I think some writers enjoy that type of freedom.,Filmmakers,dbyrh0a,1,t5_2r1ip

I have always understood the plate shot as that which is the back ground.  In your case the barn.Color separation is how Green screen works.   Or Blue screen or Tope screen for that matter.  Basically you are telling the system to replace all Green Pixels in one image with the pixels in the other imageFlicker gags are just that.  Lighting tricks that make a flicker of fire or a tv screen or what notAs for movement you would need to ask an expert at this.  I would suggest you keep it simple.  Say you have two folks at a table eating dinner.  He has a wine glass.  You see it in the shot of him.  You do not need to see the wine glass in the reverse shot of her.  Same principle applies.  Establish in a wide shot that they are stepping into a ring of fire.  Then complete the scene using tighter shots so you do not have to fuck around with the effect and spend time on the performance which is why you are there to begin with,Filmmakers,dc33wo1,2,t5_2r1ip

Someone mentioned it felt like an overlong commercial and although I did get a commercial vibe I dont think it was necessarily too long. I just think you couldve done more to elaborate what was happening. Especially with the other girls you claim to be burglars who showed up late that could have been more clear.

If you want the moonlight to look cooler an hmi is daylight balanced so will appear cooler if your camera is tungsten balanced. If you cant afford an HMI theyre expensive to buyrent you could use a tungsten fresnel like a k BJ or a studio k especially if you are plugging into house power. The studio will have a slightly larger fresnel and will yield a slightly softer hard light if you are using it with no diffusion. The k BJ has a smaller fresnel and your shadows will be softer. Sometimes its nice to put the light through some curtains of a window so you get a little dappled broken up look to the light and not just a hard source pounding through the window. You can use grip gear insideoutside the house to further alter what a curtain is doing if you want to selectively darken parts of the frame or whatever. Sometimes its nice to mix warm lampcandle light with the cool night light coming in. Sometimes just going by warm lampcandle light is the better approach.

10498065,1,t3_5qad9m,Il be that guy. Here in Canada because less women chose to work in this field most of our filmmaking bursaries like the NFB for example are considering or have already implemented female quotas... usually . Yay forced equality!Dont get me wrong I think women are just as talented as men they dont get hired less because they are less skilled. They get hired less because there are less of them! This is an extremely extremely competitive field and quotas are extremely discriminatory in my view. Now men face unfair competition in an already difficult field. We are no longer only fighting for a tough to earn spot but now we have half that chance while women have a portion higher than the portion they represent in the field.Real equality means having a neutral process not advantaging one sex to compensate for other factors! The fact is that less women are chosing or sticking to the field... if you want to fight that fine do it by promoting it.

10682413,0,t3_5srtoh,Ive won some awards in Utahs  the past few years including best film. My greatest recommendation is planning out hour by hour what youre going to be doing. Our schedule went a little like thisWednesday Team meeting before the competition. Lay out the ground rules set hierarchy etc. Tell people they cant get emotional tends to happen on these competitions. Assign set duties and potential casting options. Find out where HQ for the competition is where youll have gear meetings editing etc.Thursday Prep equipment at your HQ. Charge all batteries make an inventory list label all equipment to whom it belongs. FridaySunday Get theme and other stipulations.  Brainstorm vote on final idea for the film. Write your script while others scramble to find costumes props locations.  Read script with actors make second draft finalize script.  Rehearsal schedule your next day of shooting. Saturday is an all around shooting day. I recommend if you have night scenes DO THOSE FRIDAY NIGHT. Make sure youre done by  or  PM. Then start editing. Make a rough cut watch it together take notes watch it again make changes etc. Do ADR if necessary find music work on your paperwork to be submitted with the film.If it all goes well you should be done a couple hours before your deadline. Go to the drop off location and relax. Everyone does it differently but in these kinds of projects when youre on a huge time crunch thats what worked for me. ,Filmmakers,ddht67z,1,t5_2r1ip

10721923,0,t1_ddl611m,Once again think about why you didnt get that grant. Nowhere in your response to me do you concede or even make mention of your project and why it might have failed. Instead you resort to frustration with equality. You dont seem to be interested in looking at your own failures as a filmmaker you seem more interested in venting frustration at the fact that you cant find more opportunities in your immediate vicinity.By the way people do invest in short films. Have you even given it a thought or have you just assumed they dont? There are people out there who want to give money to filmmakers and artists to make work they want to see work they think is important and work that could potentially offer a return on investment in some manner either in money or in their reputation as a producer or arts donor. Have you thought that maybe you need to start saving up money to relocate to a city or country with a better infrastructure for artists and filmmakers or just a more robust industry? Have you thought about the quality of your work and how that may be affecting whether or not you are able to get money or at least interest in your work? Have you thought about making connections with other filmmakers to get more work in the industry? Have you even thought that maybe life is just fucking hard as hell and that the industry is hard as hell but that you dont have to deal with racism sexism or homophobia like those who are not like you? Yes class plays a role in privilege. But youre still white and youre still a man. Grow up understand that simply by the virtue of the color of your skin and your gender you do not have to deal with racism. You do not have to deal with sexism. Those barriers do not exist for you because the industry is and always has been dominated by white men. Grants like the ones you were lamenting exist to fill a void and they are not the end all be all of film funding. Im not telling you that life is easy for you. Its not. Its fucking hard. Getting a job in this and many industries is a pain in the ass. Getting funding is even worse. Being poor makes it even more difficult. Hey I live below the poverty line myself. Im on food stamps and assisted housing. But I like you do not have centuries of racism and sexism ingrained into our society that prevents me from getting the same opportunities as others. Remember a rich black woman still has to deal with racism and sexism. Remember checking your privilege is not about saying that white men have it easy. Its about understanding that in a difficult scary unfair world some people dont have to deal with certain barriers to success that others do. I hope you can at least understand this.TLDR Life in general is hard and unfair my friend. But for some its even harder because of their skin gender and sexual orientation. ,Filmmakers,ddlvy0k,4,t5_2r1ip

But there both not actual video cameras as their primary purpose.What Im looking for is a workhorse something thats sturdy where I dont have to carry a bunch of ND filters etc. Basically something that is less likely for me to miss a moment.

Also something to learn the features on of a pro piece of equipment.Does that clear things up more?

11274622,0,t1_df9xs71,Well for starters its not up to the host site to determine what a writers work is worth so by suggesting that they should only cost around  is already diminishing the work of the writers. Secondly even if there were a way to decide which scripts are great good mediocre poor or awful who would be in charge of deciding that? I would assume that someone employed by the site would create these distinctions meaning they would be based solely on the opinion of the individuals in charge of generating the rankings again ultimately diminishing not only the worth of the writers but also potential buyers by trying to tell them what is great mediocre or bad. So exactly how does one generate a reasonable scale for potential buyers?Thirdly short films often dont turn a profit so why would anyone want to dish out money towards a script that likely wont turn a profit? Not to mention that if the script is available to read on the site than anyone could potentially just rip the story and tweak it enough to make it their own and therefore not need to pay for it. Conversely if the only basis you have to go off of prior to purchase is a log line then how exactly would you be able to tell if the script itself was good or bad. Could be a dynamite log line for a shitty script so youre essentially throwing money at a  chance of getting some good material. There would literally be no guarantee.Fourthly who would be in charge of managing the site and making sure that each and every script submitted was an original work by the submitting author?

11362503,0,t3_6245h9,TV and Film work radically different in terms of the process.  Hard to ELI but Ill do my best to be clear and anyone else can feel free to chime in.As far as TV goes  You start with the pilot script.  The pilot can come out of a few different scenarios.  Most common  a writer writes the script on spec meaning that no one has asked for it specifically and no one is paying himher to write it.  Another scenario is that a writer takes a general meeting with a development executive at either a production company studio or network and pitches them ideas.  If the executive responds well to one of those ideas they may ask them to pursue that idea further resulting in some kind of development deal in place to write the pilot and get paid for a certain number of passes etc.  This happens mostly with established TV writers who are known quantities and the deals vary depending on the interest of the studio or network.Lets say the writer has written a spec pilot.  They send it to their agent andor manager who will give notes feedback etc. and then once they deem it ready they send it to producers TV studios and networks.  The order of operations here can be fuzzy because it really depends on the politics and the business relationships of the people involved.  Also the script can start any of the  places but will eventually encompass all three in the life cycle of the show.  i.e. you can pitch a show to a production company and ultimately if the project progresses far enough theyll take it to a studio and a network.  Similarly if you pitch to a network eventually they will send itassign it to a studio and a production company.  This all boils down to what these three individual entities actually do and how they make money.A TV networks revenue comes from advertising which is why they care so much about ratings because thats their value proposition to advertisers i.e. we can guarantee X number of eyeballs watching our channel during this specific hour etc.  They pay a license fee for the show in order to air it but they dont actually own the show.  The network because theyre the one trying to attract the end customer i.e. advertisers and viewers are usually the ones who do all the marketing and advertising for a show.The TV studio is the one who gets paid the licensing fee and who actually owns the show itself i.e. the negative.  They make their money off of the network license fees and also off of any other ancillary revenue derived from the show itself including merchandizing and DVD sales.  Hence why the decline of DVD sales has been such a big issue.  This is also where syndication comes in since its another opportunity for the studio to make money by doing license deals for older episodes of a long lasting show.  The studio can also make money by packaging the show called a format and selling it internationally in different territories.  Because the studio owns the show theyre the ones who have the ability to shop a show around to other networks and streaming entities if it gets cancelled by another network.  The studio is the actual entity who pays for the show usually with debt financing.  This means that the studio pays a lot of money up front for the show and then the show recoups that money and makes a profit over the course of its life.  Currently most shows arent actually profitable until  seasons in.  The studio is also the intermediary between the network and the show itself.  Both the network and the studio will give notes to the shows producers over the course of the shows life.  Ultimately the studio is both a buyer and a seller of content meaning that creatives pitch them content which they ultimately turn around and sell to a network who is the distributor.The relationship between the studios and the networks is evolving.  The ownership rules i.e. who owns the content originated from old antimonopoly actions taken back during the beginning of industry.  However now more and more networks are starting to ask for partial ownership of the content which some studios are OK with and others arent.  Complicating it further is that many studio are owned by parent companies that also own networks.  Technically they operate as separate business entities so ABC Studios can sell to anyone including Fox the CW AMC etc but often if ABC the network buys a show they will have ABC Studios produce it for them.  Complicating things even more is the advent of SVOD subscription on demand services like Netflix.  Netflix started out by licensing shows the same way a network would.  Now however they are starting to pay for things outright the same way a studio would in order to retain full ownership.The production company is the actual producing entity of the show meaning that theyre the feet on the ground physically making the show.  Sometimes the production company is the company of the writer who sold the show but oftentimes its the company of a nonwriting producer who developed a show with a writer and then took it to the studios and networks.  Some production companies have exclusivity deals with studios and networks called a Production Overall Deal or POD.   So youll have studios and networks going to production companies with which they have a deal to produce their shows etc.Film operates differently  Distributors pay the owner of the picture again the negative for the right to license the film out to different entities.  This could include theater exhibition called Exhibitors VOD SVOD DVDBluRay etc.  Most distributors want to take as many rights as they can to the film but its not uncommon for filmmakers to break up the distribution rights between different companies.  So you may have one distributor focusing on domestic distribution i.e. in the United States and then youll have other distributors handling distribution in their respective countries and territories internationally.  Similarly you may have one distributor with the theatrical rights and another with the streaming rights although this is a less common arrangement.  Its up to the filmmakers to decide how these rights are divided.  Distributors will often pay an advance to the filmmakers for the film.  This is an advance on revenue generated by the film similar to a book deals advance.  This money usually goes toward paying back the films investors any outstanding debt on the film and then to the producers and anyone with equity shares in the film.  When the distributor makes money from selling the film in various ways it goes against the advance and any expenses the distributor undertakes in regard to marketing and advertising for the film.  Usually after all expenses are paid off the distributor keeps  of revenue then passes the remaining  on to the filmmakers where it gets split as mentioned above.  All of this is deal specific so different contracts may specify different rates and splits.In the indie world production companiesfilmmakers and distributors are usually engaging with one another directly.  Additionally the ownership of a film can be more fluid in this space compared to TV which doesnt really have a real indie scene yet because of how the TV ecosystem operates.Studios are productionfinancing entities with distribution arms.  So they will finance a film meaning they own the film develop the creative content with the writer director and producers of the film and then distribute the film.  They will also handling the marketing of the film.  So essentially studios are a onestopshop for film production.  Studio film projects can be generated internally from their own development team or they can be generated externally by writers pitching project or producers trying to bring projects in.  Generally speaking if you have financing a production arm and a distribution arm youre a studio.As with TV the production company is the physical producing entity run by the films producer.  Producers will bring projects to studios with the hope that the studio will buy it which means that it gets financed and made.  Oftentimes agents will try to assign different producers territories on a hot script meaning that different producers will each be bringing in the same project to different studios ideally the studios in which they have the best relationship.  Whoever gets the project sold will be the producer and company attached to the project.  From the agents point of view this helps the project have the best chance at getting made.  In the indie film world production companies often bring in their own financing meaning that they retain ownership of the film themselves rather than handing it over to a studio.Anyway that got kind of rambly.

My point is that the camera is not objectively bad at all you just have to know what youre doing and know how to get the best results out of it which sadly so many people dont they just grab the camera and think k! that means itll look good no matter what! kind of in the same way people think the as II will fix all their lighting issues. It wont. I still believe the GH is better than the D because of the battery life focus peaking k video and I think there are better color profiles in camera to choose from.

11476876,0,t1_dfwvg95,When did I say they were inherently more criminalistic? You cant just make shit up. What I said was they are producing thugs and criminals. They are. There is an epidemic of singlefather households and no police officer or white person is holding a gun to their head and forcing black fathers to leave except in the case of arresting pot users which I fully agree drug laws need to be reformed.did I say all blacks are criminals? or that they are genetically predisposed to be criminals? Fucking of course not. But there ARE issues in their community that they need to fix and stop blaming others for. Sure there are corrupt cops and yes they need to be reformed. But we can only do so much. At some point we need to stop apologizing for white oppression in the US and just say to black people OK time to get your shit together. Black dads stop leaving home kids finish highschool stop doing drugs work harder etc.Here is a fact for you in  black men were  times more likely to commit murder than nonblacks. As long as this is true OF COURSE cops will profile them. The burden is on the black community to get their shit together. Not racism common sense. Get past the victim shit get past the feelgood virtue signaling of BLM fuck the political correctness and lets start actually elevating the black community. By telling blacks that all their issues stem from the cops from white priveldge from white supremacy you will CONTRIBUTE to their victim mentality. As long as blacks feel like the victim in the US they will NEVER rise up and have success. I dont think Im racist. I want the black community to do as well as possible and be extremely sucessfull. I just think my strategy is more effective than yours and so many other liberals. The left just wants to wave around fairy dust like white priveldge and police brutality to distract the black community of their real issues issues only they have the power to fix.  This way liberals can continue keeping blacks and POC as their political tool. Here is a quote from Fredrick Douglass that I will leave you with What shall we do with the Negro? I have had but one answer from the beginning. Do nothing withus! Your doing with us has already played the mischief with us. Do nothing with us! If the apples will not remain on the tree of their own strength if they are wormeaten at the core if they are early ripe and disposed to fall let them fall! I am not for tying or fastening them on the tree in any way except by natures plan and if they will not stay there let them fall. And if the Negro cannot stand on his own legs let him fall also.

I kind of made a big deal out of nothing there.Shooting flat is done so that your camera doesnt throw as much valuable information away when recording and compressing your clips. Once its recorded you cant bring it back by lowering the contrast in post. Creating a uniform flat image for all your footage can help in grading but only if its to a known standard. For example if you have Sony footage and Arri footage in the same project you might want to apply a LUT to the Sony footage to approximate the Arri footage or vice versa then you can apply one look to all your clips. But if youre grading individual clips anyway theres not much point. Also this would all be done in one step before encoding so that the footage doesnt have to be compressed twice. ,Filmmakers,dg96xie,1,t5_2r1ip
11593178,0,t3_65bl7p,Im assuming this isnt paying your bills at the moment  theres nothing like having to make the rentbuy groceries to focus the mind!Joking aside take a step back.  It can be very easy to get into a creative maelstrom.  If you have an idea  write it down and tell yourself youll come back to it.  Often when you do it doesnt seem like such a great idea after all and you could have spent dayshours in a creative frenzy working on something that doesnt have legs at the expense of something that does.Maybe imagine its your job which Im guessing you hope it eventually will be.  A client has asked for x ideascript to be finished by x day  theyre not going to be pleased if you were to tell them that you didnt finish what you needed to because you had  other ideas and those took priority.   Think about what it is thats dragging you away from the ideas youre working on  do you like the high of coming up with ideas?  Great.  Then maybe writerdirector which Im assuming is what youre doing isnt for you  maybe you should focus on development where you get the high of the idea and writing it up and then pass it on to someone else to flesh out.  Is there something thats stopping you seeing an idea through  do you lose interest worry about whether its going to work?  How would you feel with directing when you have no input into the script but your creativity comes with bringing it to life?   It sounds like you dont like the difficult bit that involves the grinding hard graft  and thats understandable.  I work in TV and know a ton of people who thrive on coming up with ideas but hate the how does this actually hang together and how do we make it work part.As I say take a step back.  Really try to be honest about why youre doing what you do.  What do you want the outcomes to be for you and the stories you want to tell?  What are your loves and loathes about the process youre going through?  Once you do that you can focus more on being disciplined in the way you approach projects.,Filmmakers,dga3fgo,2,t5_2r1ip

It starts half way through the film and the change in perception is unmotivated.You will be hard pressed to find a movie that pans dialogue or sound effects. The problem with moving these sounds from the center is that they will appear to no longer come from the screen but from outside of it. The only movie I can think of that panned sounds and dialogue is Gravity. I remember being in the theater and hearing George Clooneys voice panned hard left. It sounded like he was talking from the theater next store and not from the screen. This took me out of the movie. Think of our sound stage as being leftcenterright. The screen is in the center. When dialogue is panned to the center we focus on the screen. When we hear a sound that is panned hard right or hard right our attention drifts from the center to the sound and away from the screen. ,Filmmakers,dgclbp9,2,t5_2r1ip

11689706,0,t3_66t2jd,This was originally shot with the intent for it to be demo reel footage for all involved and wasnt even intended to be cut together to work as a film but I made it work as best as I could. Just want to get people to take a look as all filmmakers do. The original stage play this scene is taken from is called Taking Liberties with Peter Rozig and the author is K.K. Gordon.,Filmmakers,dgl1o48,1,t5_2r1ip
11695008,0,t3_66uett,The biggest difference is that professionals are there to do a job and get paid.So suddenly your costs go from maybe a few hundred bucks per shoot to pay for food and a few other expenses to a few tens of thousands at the snap of a finger.  Suddenly your volunteer extras are wanting  or more per day suddenly your crew is expecting to work with full equipment trucks not just whatever motley assortment of gear youve got in your backpack.There is a lot of money that goes into even just getting to the point where professionals will work on something.  For example I normally do Grip Ive finally got about a dozen things on the resume all of which have been done in conditons that I have been told others would straight up walk off the set and never work with these people again.  Stuff like showing up and theyve got four power bars linked together instead of a proper stinger or not even having a roll of tape for cable management let alone proper cable management equipment such as a yellowjacket.So for example when you tell an amateur youve got some equipment for them to use they might be thinking of a backpack and duffelbag worth and when you tell a professional they might be thinking of a  foot trailer worth.  You also have to start dealing with union regulations which can mean a whole bunch more expenses on equipment and personnel.  I dont think Ive done a single amateur production that would not have had the union crew walk or charge massive penalty fees due to some violation or another.  Stuff like the gaffer didnt show up  and the camera operator didnt mention that they shake like a meth head with palsey so you have to ask the DP to do all three jobs.At the start your best bet is probably just sicking to money and developing relationships with the rental houses.  Maybe a couple hundred bucks.  Put the money in spend some time on set learning how stuff works and only then start making a plan for things like equipment investments.,Filmmakers,dglnbj0,2,t5_2r1ip

11768552,0,t1_dgtnzkv,gt Youll need a cinema lens because they have fixed focus the subject will remain in focus when you zoomthe word is parfocal. fixed focus means that you cant change the focus distance.,Filmmakers,dgtzveo,2,t5_2r1ip
11776456,0,t1_dguk0ol,Look at something older and second hand. Older millers are very sturdy and dont command the same prices a satchler will.Besides that... if you can only afford a monfrotto... even look at their  back when they made fluid heads. Get that  a ball base and some sticks. Just dont invest in bridging technology. it is crap.The majority of the nd hand tripod market is manfrottos  years old because people get rid of them ASAP after they realise how useless they are when it comes to smooth pans and tilts and even being able to balance the camera.... shit even the legs suck for a quick setup.,Filmmakers,dguwcx9,2,t5_2r1ip

11797810,0,t3_689g1n,I would do x letterbox. You want to eliminate all possible things that can go wrong. Dont put up any slate color bars or anything that you dont want to have pop up on the day. You might give it a breath of black at the head just to make sure the first bit of the video isnt cut off when they switch to it. One second tops. I would stick a bit of black on the tail too to give them time to punch out. Adobe Encore can do a menuless DVD but I always use a simple menu thats just the movie title and a play button. That gives them a spot to know theyre ready to go. The menu is up there they hit the play button and punch it up to the projector. Thats easier to deal with than putting the disc in and having it take off immediately. ,Filmmakers,dgxblvv,1,t5_2r1ip
11808940,0,t1_dgykqjf,You need a camera lens tripod recording media and lavmic. Normally each one of these items costs at least  for a decent one so youre already in a tight spot. If this organization is paying you  dollars to do multiple interviews and beauty shots over more than a day theyre being incredibly cheap to you and probably dont expect a super polished product. My best advice is to shoot on a smartphone and spend the money on renting a good mic for your interviews. Audio quality always trumps video quality at this level of production. ,Filmmakers,dgyl1p3,1,t5_2r1ip
11809900,0,t3_68hq9g,I loved it! Subscribed to your channel as well. Curious to know what camera you are using. Im a complete amateur at filmmaking so it might be out of place for me to say this but I have a suggestion for future films of yours. Looking through your Youtube channel it seemed that one technique you used in alot of shots was to change the focus. While this looks awesome at first Changing the focus during the microscope scenes of this plant film were amazing it got repetitive after a while. It looked great when looking at cells under microscope and then it was great when looking at the plants with moisture on them but as it continued it seemed to get repetitive so I would advise not to abuse this technique too much. I was doing something similar in my films My Leica produces this effect pretty well. But all in all I thought the plant documentary was really good! Good luck on your filmmaking adventures!,Filmmakers,dgyoypa,2,t5_2r1ip
