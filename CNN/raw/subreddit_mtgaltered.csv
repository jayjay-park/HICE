1822898,0,t3_2fdqu1,I dont want to sound like a downer but a lot of REALLY REALLY REALLY good commision alterers charge around  an alter  price of the card if they have to provide it. And im not saying your work isnt good. But some people I know of that dont visit this subredit who I think do some of the BEST work in the community strata strike Hes why I got into this hobby only charge  a card and spend several hours per card they make. The trick is they do LOTS of commisions at once so they are painting  to  cards at a time and rotate to work on each card while each other card dries.  So while I know your time is valuable and precious a lot of people out there just do more bulk in less time and offer lower prices as a result with just as good if not better quality.I really like your island. I think its nice. But Ablarga is right. Market is saturated and its hard to get commissions  sell your artwork. People on ebay constantly only get  to  dollars for their alters and they too are nice alters. Just saturated market with unsaturated buyer base.,mtgaltered,ck8ujyq,3,t5_2tv58

Fleetfeather Cockatrice is just really cool art on its own and you extended it very well.If I was going to critique anything I would say try to be more careful around the edges of the areas you arent painting.

3378068,0,t3_2ysd5x,Its a fine alter. Add some more dark shadows to the grass in the foreground on the bottom right.I also suggest using a thinner brush and a light grey instead of white for your signature. Ideally it should not distract from the artextension,mtgaltered,cpdbppe,1,t5_2tv58

The colours look good and I like what you did with a bit of the foreground on the right side. Something thatll help not go over the borders you DONT want to cover is some paintersmasking tape. Take a minute and cover up things like the nameplate and border or the text box and border when youre going to be working in that area and go crazy.
