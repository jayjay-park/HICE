52755,0,t3_1umvyb,I dont think this really fits with the theme of what the writers have been trying to show with this season in regards to Katherine. They have clearly been hinting that Stefan and Katherine have a connection they did end up sleeping together and they did clearly hint that Katherine was going to actually fight to survive after she had previously tried to kill herself because of Stefan. Couple that with how the writers of The Originals have been slowly pushing Haley and Elijah together and I just feel like having Elijah coming back for Katherine throws a needless wrench into everything.Besides how many episodes have we seen Katherine and Elijah together? How many episodes have even devoted a significant amount of time to the two? Maybe five?I get the writers like love triangles in this show. But this would be bringing up a love square.,TheVampireDiaries,cekfpuy,2,t5_2sctw

She may stay away from witch and vampire business that doesnt concern her and her friends but when lives are on the line shell speak up.Shes been the anchor for quite a while long enough to know whats normal and what is not. Hundreds if not thousands of vampires werewolves and witches would have died between her becoming the anchor and Katherines death. Im pretty sure each and every single one of them passed through her theres no reason they wouldnt. There is absolutely no way she didnt know something was wrong and there is absolutely no way she wouldnt mention it.Something else had to have happened.

592714,0,t3_20x2uw,I dug Stefan in the first few seasons but once she became a vampire I knew it had to be Damon. I think they temper each other fairly well of course thats when Damon isnt being self destructive. I think once they settle into the relationship and he realizes that hes really not going to loose her he can chill out and just revel in it.Stefan was good for her at the beginning  he helped her through the death of her parents and later of her Aunt and others of course. He built up her self esteem gave her the confidence that she had lost with her parents death. After she became a vampire though I think Stefan lost touch of who she really was.Early in the first season she says to him that he has never met the fun Elena and I wonder if the sad quiet contained Elena was who he fell in love with as opposed to the sassy confident Elena that Damon caught a glimpse of before the crash and if her vampire persona is more true to that original Elena.,TheVampireDiaries,cg7n8xr,19,t5_2sctw

2342313,0,t1_cm17vw2,Here is exactly what I saidgt  I find it very problematic for anyone to say as I was told they did that what Damon did was not what it actually was and speaks largely to rape culture here in the US.I NEVER said the show in and of itself was promoting rape culture. I was stating that people seeing what Damon did as not being rape as promoting the culture that is people have a particular perception of what rape is and anything outside of that single image isnt rape. When someone is under some undue influence and cant give their consent to have sex having sex with said person is rape. And the fact that people dont view it as such perpetuated rape culture. Many people say Caroline wanted to have sex which is victim blaming and the same thing happens in real life all the time.Again its okay to like a show but its not okay to completely ignore things that are problematic with it.,TheVampireDiaries,cm18098,0,t5_2sctw

3081817,0,t1_cohb07p,gt If everything happens in order then Damon will probably convince her to turn it all off towards the end. After all Damon is the poster boy for turning off his humanity and telling other vamps to do the same.On the other hand the whole fiasco with Elena probably taught him what a bad idea it was.  He sincerely regretted making her turn it off.  And same with Stefan Damon was not a fan of Stefan without his humanity.  He knows now that it doesnt actually help it just delays the problem.  Plus I think even Damon knows that this is the last thing that Liz would want.  I do think Caroline may turn it off regardless.  There was a bit of foreshadowing when Liz temporarily died and she saw Carolines face covered in blood.  But then again that was when Caroline felt responsible for her death which now wouldnt be the case. ,TheVampireDiaries,cohffk0,7,t5_2sctw

3649080,0,t3_325z9k,In my opinion no.  I already felt like most of the stories were coming to a neat ending.  The brothers are at peace Stefan and Elena are close friends and Damon and Elena are happy together.  So the trianglethe whole premise of the showis in balance.  Damon has completed his redemption arc hes finally found someone who truly loves him and hes become accepted into the social circle.  Stefan has overcome his hatred of vampirism and his blood lust untangled himself from his doppelgnger destiny and found a new love.  Elenas arc is a little messier but the direction theyre taking her right now seems to be positive for her growth. Do we really need a season ?  No.  Season  has been quite repetitive already.  And a show should end before the fandom gets to the point where theyre calling for cancellation.  Last season we were already there.  This season we all questioned how they could renew it for a seventh season.  Now with Nina leaving youve got a large part of the fandom saying theyll stop watching.  The ratings werent terrible by C.W. standards but they werent great and theyve been decreasing since the Pilot.  Soon theyll be bad.Weve all noticed the decline in quality.  Season  improved to a degree but its fallen back into some problematic patterns of behavior.  The lead actress and main character leaving the show should have been the ideal moment to close up the story lines.  Especially since shes not the only one well have lost Jeremy Tyler and Liz as well.  Pauls been dissatisfied with the show for a long time and is sticking it out for the directing opportunities too he might be the next to walk.  Networks need to learn that its better to quit it while its on top.  The C.W. doesnt like to do this though.

4002986,0,t1_crc8z0s,On the originals they give a bit more backstory. Originally all the different werewolf bloodlines only have one power i.e. fangs or claws etc. They joined the bloodlines together with a magical marriage to transfer the gifts around until there was only one type of werewolf.So it is entirely possible that originally no one had venom and a witch created it within one werewolf. They then spread the gift through the marriage ceremony. They are very specific that the gift transferred dont need to be inherent in the person from birth for reasons of spoilers plot.,TheVampireDiaries,crckl7d,1,t5_2sctw
4024097,0,t1_crckt5b,very true..I didnt mean to make it sound like Bonnie could be both..I was thinking she would give up her witch powers amp turn into a vampire even though its the last thing she wants if it could save elena...but obviously that didnt happen haha,TheVampireDiaries,crez6qo,1,t5_2sctw
4085659,0,t1_crluxq5,She considers him the love of her life her soulmate.  Telling him to be happy and not desiccate next to her coffin around doesnt equal telling him its cool to sleep with andor fall in love with her best friend or anyone else for that matter.  Shes going to wake up just as committed and in love with him as she was at Alarics wedding.  Put aside shipping for a moment and put yourself in her shoes would you really be okay with the love of your life sleeping with your best friend while you waited?  Elena isnt dead and she and Damon are still planning on getting married and having kids.  Theyre not broken up their relationship is on pause.  I know that realistically if it goes into season  or  theyll throw a love interest his way but its not necessary in season  and its unrealistic for Damon.  He stayed completely emotionally committed to Katherine for  years until he discovered her betrayal and his love for Katherine is overshadowed by his love for Elena by miles.  Damon also knows for sure that Elena loves him and only him and she wants a future with him as much as he wants it with her.  If they stay true to who Damon has been shown to be throughout his life hell remain loyal to Elena.gt Regardless If were going to be moral then maybe we should talk about how right it was for Damon to insert himself into his brothers relationship before he and Elena got together?He was inappropriate at times but he only made a move when Stefan and Elena were broken up and Stefan was physically there and interacting with Elena.  He did his best including potentially sacrificing his life on more than one occasion to get Stefan back for both himself and Elena.  Thats not the same.Also there is a guarantee that shell wake up.  While you can argue that Kai couldve been lying the writers made a point of putting Elena in a coma rather than killing her off for a reason.  They want Elena to get her endgame and Nina wants to do it too.  Theyve all but admitted that Elena and Damon will reunite in the series finale hopefully with Stefan and Caroline alive as well.,TheVampireDiaries,crlzo1i,1,t5_2sctw

I just think the overall flow and tone of the episode is kind of disjointed with jumping back and forth between epic intense ritual scenes and then low key MattCaroline scenes.I guess I just figure that Elena made it very clear that she didnt want Damon to get involved. Although to be fair when she made that decision she didnt know that Caroline was the vampire Klaus had chosen and was under that assumption that all her friends would be kept safe by Elijah. She would have ended up losing someone whether Damon intervened or not.

10877057,0,t3_5vezby,I think you definitely need to watch season  and . A lot happens with every character in those seasons. Season  is a rough season though just a warning not awful but lower quality than other seasons. Then you could honestly just read recaps about whats been happening these last two seasons because quite frankly its not much of anything that I would think would affect the finale. Only these most recent couple of episodes have really been game changing things for the finale so you could maybe just watch those to catch up too. There have been a couple of large developments from the last two seasons but not anything difficult to explain. ,TheVampireDiaries,de1w33t,1,t5_2sctw

10917379,0,t1_de5wber,Tom Avery was supposed to be Elena Gilberts fated love since they were both around the same age. Tom Avery was Stefans human doppelganger in Season. Elena was going to become a doctor and Tom was already a paramedic in Atlanta Georgia. I imagine thats how they would have met. But the TravelersEnzo killed Tom. Or at least thats how I always saw it. ,TheVampireDiaries,de61txk,2,t5_2sctw
10918837,0,t1_de65flm,Heck now Im getting confused lol. The cure is revealed because of the Hunters and the Hunters come on the trail of the Originals. Im not sure Katherine wouldve ever found out about it. Assuming there was no Stefan and that Elenas birth mother and John Gilbert didnt protect her Katherines best bet would be been to just kill her and end the family line. I agree that Stefans past ties into the story a good bit but only in a circumstantial way. No one that comes to town is really looking for him. As far as the last part goes Im not really arguing against how the story wouldve gone with or without either brother. The fact that Damon met her and wiped her memory doesnt really matter. He didnt know her and he thought he was going to open up the tomb and find Katherine waiting for him. I only posed that specific question because your other response made it sound like without Damon Elena and Stefan wouldve stayed together indefinitely. Which I disagree with. My only other point was that I strongly disagree with making Elena out to be some victim who couldnt make her own choices because she was being so heavily manipulated. Thats just not the case. Do they have a model relationship? Probably not. But just because their love isnt all rainbows and unicorns it doesnt make it less real or less natural than what she had with Stefan. Only different. On another side note. If were going to condemn Damon for all his actions which he probably deserves everyone else in the show has to be condemned too. They all have blood on their hands. Elena and Jeremy may have surpassed the Salvatore Brothers kill count when they killed Kol thereby killing every vampire in his line. ,TheVampireDiaries,de6791b,2,t5_2sctw

10925068,0,t3_5w1p3g,What gets me is that this is how they bring her back? Why not just have he get out the same way Kai did and have her laying low until the Cade threat was gone? It would be a call back to the beginning and everything would come full circle. Her being the queen of hell is about the most convoluted storyline ever. Like why? Shes a manipulative bitchbut her strong suit is in evasion and leaving others to clean up her mess  none of that adds up to becoming the queen of hell.,TheVampireDiaries,de6uew3,1,t5_2sctw

10941996,0,t1_de8kl2k,Have some perception. In that episode Elena wondered if she and Damon would ever be able to talk the way that Stefan and Elena talk to each other like friends. Stefan replied that he doesnt think two people could be in love with each other and be friends at the same time............which is stupid because Elena and Stefan were best friends and very much in love with each other.lol The way they talked in that scene was the same way they would talk before and after having sex. This really says a lot about Damon and Elenas relationship and how being a vampire has changed what she looks for in a boyfriend which doesnt say a lot about the core of Damon and Elenas relationship. As I said earlier pay attention to what these characters actually do on the show and not focus verbatim about what they say.In Season  Elena said that she was no longer in love with Stefan because he looked at her like a project after she became a vampire.Yet Elena almost kisses Stefan next season in Season Episode when Stefan lost his memory forgetting that he had made the decision not to pursue Elena because she was with Damon and he valued Damons happiness over anything. All Stefan had to do was make a move and bada bing bada boom! Elena pulling in for the kiss.I know that upsets some Damon fans but I didnt write the story.

10993625,0,t3_5wzje5,They both said No that theyre closing this chapter in their lives. Pauls yes was an off handed comment meant as a joke. Its not surprising that neither are willing to go for a revival theres a reason everyone acts tired like theyre on a badly written tv show and the main actress quit before the series finale and its because everyone is just done. Also if I remember correctly Ian and Kat were going to leave after the eighth season regardless. ,TheVampireDiaries,dee3co9,26,t5_2sctw
10997066,1,t1_deegneo,Possibly the opposite. The writers were never going to have Damon and Bonnie date so  to please fans they were written to be best friends a status that allowed them to love each other without ever being romantic. But I was talking about the writers need to make the mystic falls gang accept Damon and Elenas relationship as the norm despite everyone hating Damon during previous seasons. Alaric became his best friend Bonnie became his best friend and Caroline no longer had issues with him. Stefan and Elena magically fell out of love with each other even though they were soulmates for the first  seasons of the show. All done so that Damon and Elena could be together without dispute. ,TheVampireDiaries,deehf8k,2,t5_2sctw

11067708,0,t3_5y1aee,so whats confusing me about this is where the schools scene fits into this.  Because surely its not happening after right?

But what purpose would there be for teary stefan to bring Elena to school and for her to be all confused if shes already woken up?  I guess I just dont see how those two fit together.

Generally when Damon does bad things its for good reasons. As he tells Klaus  I dont mind being the bad guy because someone has to fulfill that role and get things done. You do bad things for no reason. You do them to be a dick!The only time Damon generally goes out of control is when Elena rejects him and hes drunk and upset. As he was when he killed Jeremy Jeremy who had tried to kill himself who had talked to Damon about wanting to be turned.Damon was ALWAYS on Elenas side. Hed kill for her die for her do whatever he needed to do to protect her even if it was something she didnt want him to do.

11421358,0,t3_631d1o,I think the brothers were the most stable part of the story even while Nina was still there because Elena to me seemed like a fixture that if you put almost any other girl there thats how much of a blank slate she is you would have the same exact results. The only thing that makes her stand out as their love interest is the fact that she has the same exact face as the last girl they fought over so in a sense that takes the uniqueness out of it being her. Now thats not to say she had no importance because she does connect the brothers to the MFG but Damons obsession for Katherine alone probably would have done that because he technically came back to Mystic Falls for Bonnie a Bennett witch to open the tomb however that wouldnt have connected them to all of the MFG but it would have connected them to the most integral. But then there really wouldnt be a season  since that centered around rounding up people for Klaus sacrifice which involved the rarest item the doppelgnger so yes blank slate or not she was important but that even started to fade come next season where the most important aspect of her was her blood and then she again blank slate girl you could replace with anyone and the results would be the same.But thats the thing as someone pointed out to me Elena was always supposed to be a blank slate  she was supposed to be a character who you slipped yourself into so that you could emerse yourself into the world they built as close as they could get you. With that in mind I feel its inaccurate to say its Elenas story because shes mainly there so you can experience the story thats going on around her. Its like The Great Gatsby in the sense that you read it from Nicks perspective  the least interesting character but thats the point Fitzgerald wanted the readers to experience Gatsby and his extravagance from an outside perspective that didnt seem like the typical third person limited and it was brilliant  but is it Nicks story? Nope not even a little bit and thats kinda why aside from the fact that its a teen show on the CW based on a series of cheesy books Elena doesnt quite work as her main function because they spent a little too much time on her. It became her story but Im not quite sure it was meant to be. ,TheVampireDiaries,dfqll63,4,t5_2sctw
