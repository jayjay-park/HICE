11312883,0,t1_dee4rfh,Thanks  I was not going to rip it up since its my only tomato plant. I did continued spaying pesticides and cleaning dead spiders with water until my bother found a lady bug and placed it on the plant. It came back to life. The lady bug ate all the spiders and none of the plant. I already harvest two tomatoes and have  ready to be harvest pretty soon and a couple baby ones. Lady Bug saved the day!,tomatoes,dfeapzp,2,t5_2s4pe
