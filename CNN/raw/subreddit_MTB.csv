79236,0,t3_1uxrix,There are a few other options that will most likely cure the sqealing. Typically a noisy brake indicates that there is a contaminant on either the brake rotor or the brake pads. The most common offender is hydraulic fluid that has leaked from brakes. If theres an intermittent rub then the rotor is likely bent but it can usually be straightened by a mechanic.  If youre loyal to the shop or have paid money for them to repair the brakes you should go back there and have them fix it. The shop should clean the entire brake rotor with a strong solventacetone and rubbing alcohol work best and also clean the brake pads. If the pads are glazed over sanding or filing the pad will give you braking power back. If all that does not work then you still have the option to replace both brake rotors and the pads but that should really be your last resort..Best of luck for a nonsqueaky bike!,MTB,ceng757,1,t5_2qo3d

If youre looking at getting into road biking then your commute will likely be more enjoyable on a road bike especially over  miles.I find road biking uses different muscles  using more of my glutes and spinning more and that doesnt help so much on the MTB.

258777,0,t3_1x2cvk,Well the heavier rider is affected more by gravity so theyre going to be pulled down the hill a fair bit quicker for starters. Theyre also able to put more force through the bike and into the tyres which gives more energy from pumping and probably has implications for grip etc.As with most things Id imagine theres a bell curve and a range of ideal rider weights that equate to best balance of performance with extremely light riders and extremely heavy ones suffering. Heavier riders need burlier components to take their weight and have to overcome greater forces to chuck the bike around lighter ones will get bounced around more and cant generate as much energy by pumping etc ,MTB,cf7kwq7,0,t5_2qo3d

404379,0,t3_1yp4dl,First of all buy some new tires. Staying in control on control in corners is all about keeping traction. Running on bald tires is not going help you in any way.Secondly stand the fuck up. Sitting down while trying to negotiate flat corners is about as helpful as your bald tires. You need to keep you weight balanced over the bike to maximize the traction you get in a corner. When you hit a corner especially a flat corner youre going to need to lean the bike over so your tires bite the best to keep you on the trail. As the bike leans you need to keep you weight centered side to side on bike. This is generally accomplished by dropping your outside foot so that leg is almost straight. You simply cant do this from a sitting position.Thirdly if the trail is super loose there is good chance that no matter what you do youre going to slide around the corner. Sometimes all you can do is put yourself into a controlled slide. This will come as you get more confident but once you get it drifting a loose corner is a lot fun. ,MTB,cfmohw1,2,t5_2qo3d

592470,0,t1_cg7l70u,That is a really old school and biased argument IMO. There is no best bike to learn on except the one you are having the most fun on. Most people here most likely learned on a r because rs are a recent thing. a r might be a tiny bit more nimble but as a beginner you are not going to notice any difference. A  wheel will also hit all of the bumps and rocks in the trail at a steeper angle thusly stopping you and pitching you over the bars. A rs larger wheel will smooth out a lot of the bumps keeping your momentum up and your frustration levels down. The larger rotational force of the big wheels keeps the bike more stable when rolling this will definetely help a beginner who is struggling with confidence.I learned on a nice  hardtail and have been brought to near tears on rocky trails that i couldnt even get my bike rolling on. I also used to ride with a group of guys who all rode rs. I was constantly struggling at the back of the pack on the climbs and walking up and over the roots and rocks after being stopped short. DO NOT RULE OUT A r. Most entry level bikes are being sold as rs because there is a demand for them. I would think there is a reason for this. As it appears above it is also pretty difficult to find a decent r at you price range. Ask around lots of riders here started on a Specialized Hardrock r Trek XCaliber r or a Giant Talon r.  They are all very solid entry level bikes.Most experts might suggest riding a rigid singlespeed  bike because it will build your skills. But are you going to have fun riding that? I might argue No. Youre going to have beat up wrists be walking up lots of climbs getting rattled around on the descents and slamming into rocks. In the long run you might be a better rider for having suffered through all the abuse but in the short term it isnt always fun. This might even discourage you from riding. Dont go on what you read. Go on experience. Test ride as many bikes as possible out on the trails. Rent a bike if you have to. Many bike shops will put that fee towards your bike when you buy it. edit I also love my r and still ride it all the time but just dont rule out a r. They are great too. ,MTB,cg7m8vj,2,t5_2qo3d

1244875,0,t1_ci9ndio,And look I know it comes across me sounding like a bit of a prick being so black and white about it but to clarify a couple of things I commissaired a World Cup earliear this year and in an extremely similar incident we had to DQ Greg Minnaar when he made a mistake cut the tape and didnt reenter the course where he exited. We also had an incident at our National Championships in XCE where I was chief for XC where a rider didnt do a practice run took a wrong turn and went though the tape.  That rider actually removed herself from the race and we didnt learn about it until after. We recently had a rider who at a World Cup which is a selection race for Commonwealth Games was DQd.  Unfortunately a DQ is a DQ not XYZth place so for the purpose of selection when looking at results it has to be considered as a DQ not the place they came before it was issued.So yeah unfortunately when youre talking about the SRAM Enduro Series where its an International competition it has to be pretty strictly judged whether the incident happens to rd place or th place.Yes this may be your first race  and honestly good on you for doing so  but this aint club land where you can be a bit lenient.,MTB,ci9nx0r,4,t5_2qo3d

As for the hassle I cant say for sure.What  can suggest is getting a pair of fine calipers and measuring the width of the older seatpost and compare it with the newer one. The new one might have extra width so slight that it makes a difference.This is a longshot but try freezing the seatpost while leaving the frame in a warm location. Then once the seatpost is cold contracting the metal and the frame is warm expanding it try jamming it in then with grease ya never go in dry my grammy always told me.,MTB,cjmc74i,4,t5_2qo3d

I usually get a few weird looks but once I get working everyone just stands back and lets me do my thing. I can walk up the trail at a normal hiking pace accurately cutting branches right where they need to be cut. Another guy then walks behind and tosses the cut branches into the woods.

The only issue is that I find myself annoyed by having a water bottle as it usually gets in the way while Im climbing and taking on curves. I also dont like the idea of having to constantly stop while riding to take a swig. Im assuming Skratch is something that wouldnt be recommended for use with a Camelback.

An XC bike will climb well when compared to a downhill bike but wont ride at all the same compared to something with  of travel. If you plan on shuttling or riding bike parks with lifts a DH bike wouldnt be a bad thing to consider but thats about the limit of that style of bike. If you want to get out and ride everything a shorter travel bike would be a better investment. Additionally you could go with something that is a true allmountain bike usually running about  mm travel. Its pretty amazing what that amount of travel is able to do.,MTB,ck3jbzv,1,t5_2qo3d

1897567,0,t1_ckht37u,Clutch mech is essential for avoiding drops in this setup using a thickthin ring. DHers may still need a proper front guide too e etc.edit opinion is a bit mixed. the general consensus seems to be you want a clutch mech if you dont have a proper chainguide even with thickthin. if you dh you could go for all . you cant run a normal ring and a clutch with no guide. so the TT thickthin stops maybe  of the drops on its own the clutch will save you from an extra load of drops and a full chain guide with top and bottom guides will stop near  probably even if you have nothing else but adds lots of weightcost. personally id always run clutch just for the quietness. i run TTclutch short cage Zee and havent dropped a chain since.If youre in UK superstar TT rings are great value and so are several others.

The spacer limits the travel so without it the fork will merely compress more not sit higher in the stroke.  There should literally be no external difference it will just bottom out in its stroke rather than hitting the travel limit bumper.An LBS should be able to do it or you can look on Foxs website for the product manual which should have instructions.

2038661,0,t3_2hqlyp,Hey everyone! I just recently got back into riding after a long hiatus. I bought an Airborne Guardian and have been enjoying the hell out of the trails near my home in northeast Ohio. I have two questions for all you people who know more than me!. The trails I ride have a lot of fallen logs that I smash into and I rarely use the big chainring so I was thinking of swapping it for a bash guard. Is it as simple as unbolting the big ring putting on the bash guard and adjusting the front derailleur limit screw? Might I need longer chainring bolts?. My bike came with Kenda Small Block  tires which are supposed to be pretty solid XC tires but I felt that they werent quite aggressive enough for the loose and loose over hard forest trails I ride. I just bought a Specialized Purgatory Control for the front and want to do a ghetto tubeless conversion to run lower pressures. Am I going to need either a floor pump or compressor to get the beads to set? All I have is a small hand pump and I dont think its going to cut it.Thanks for all the help everyone!,MTB,ckyyjkx,1,t5_2qo3d

Replacing one or two spokes when you break them is okay temporarily but they will never be the same as the rest of the spokes and therefore cause inconsistencies in your wheel and can lead to more issues and breakages. You have two options buy a sick new wheelset and spend a decent amount of dough on them to get something nice and new and shiny. pay a shop to rebuild your wheel with new spokes. It will function like new unless the rim is compromised. The only issue I see with this choice is that we dont know how you broke everything the first time. The wheelset may not be up to your riding style but more likely you caught a stick in your spokes.,MTB,clrclmi,1,t5_2qo3d

2290945,0,t1_cluun46,Yeah so it obviously depends where youre going to be riding. OP stated road bike though so thats what Im focusing on.I enjoyed riding my DJ around my university campus and close area as well partly because of the sound those . tires made haha I loved that buzzing but we also had a bike path that wound alongside the river that ran through the city. Easy  km loop that averaged kmh right by my house or if you wanted a km loop that had some climbs you could do that too. My point here is that it depends how OP wants to ride.When I was a teenager I had crazy strong legs Im talking a  lb yo kid that could grab  rims that the  athletic kids couldnt grab and could leapfrog those same  tall kids with ease  I was pretty into parkour more so than freerunning that I developed my riding my mtb around with the seat pretty slammed all the time. km rides on gravel with my knees going over the seat height. That kind of stuff really builds you up. But that wasnt an option for me in the city and so I took to riding the DJ down those bike paths by the water until I got a solid fork bike. That one was from a shed and had the bb bearings in rusty pieces. It gave me a good workout because just moving the pedals was enough work alone not to mention the . tires it still had on with really knobby tread. Then I got the road bike I have now fixed that up and can go kmh with ease.The reason I bike is because I find it fun. I find speed fun  ripping down a hill at over kmh when I was a kid passing cars going to speed limit while on the shoulder of the road is what gave me that rush. It still does but so does a smooth DH trail my area didnt really have any DH sections it was all flatlands trail with maybe m variation max where you can float over sections without even appearing to be off the ground thats always been my favourite even for snowboarding and skiing.My whole point is that people like different things. Im not sure if you arent sure you agree with not being able to do the same workout or about having to love that burn from km of steady pedaling in case I didnt really clear that up thats km of steady pedaling with a view a good speed some nice corners to lean into and only the wind at your back as a competitor lol  so an engaging trail or if you dont really agree with doing what appears to be an eventless route but you cant really disagree with my opinion on what I like haha.  Thats what prompted this long response.So yeah. Gotta love that wall of text right?,MTB,cluvkzo,1,t5_2qo3d
2296995,0,t1_clvm6vx,I wouldnt mind electric shifting at all! I see many benefits Easier shifting. With clutch derailleurs the shifter triggers are really stiff  it takes me more effort to complete an upshift than it did to do a downshift with an oldtimey rear mech. Reliable shifting under power andor stress. An electric shifter will always complete a perfect shift at the touch of a button no manual trim or easing of the pedals required. I consciously have to avoid shifting in rough terrain and during sharp climbs because its never worth the risk of dropping your chain or worse in those situations. No more fiddling with cable tension. Superbly easy installation for one but also basically zero maintenance. Where I live we have high variations in temperature and that really does a number on your indexing. An electric motor isnt bothered it knows where your cogs are.,MTB,clvmhdj,2,t5_2qo3d

2354732,0,t3_2mbf6f,In the interest of full disclosure I work at a prominent Trek dealership and have spent a large amount of time selling both the Marlin and the XCal as well as have helped assemble several Airborne bikes for friends before. That being said if you are wellversed in bicycle mechanics and comfortable with doing a fair amount of wrenching yourself the Airborne is definitely the best deal with the Xcal fairly close behind. The Marlin is aimed at absolute beginners who will spend most of their time riding to and from schoolwork maybe riding the occasional trail here and there. The XCal is more of an actual trail bike designed to start hitting small features and give you more room to grow into as a mountain biker stronger components better built etc. One thing to keep in mind is that if youre not a fairlyskilled mechanic you will definitely want to take the Airborne in to be built or at least checked over by a professional mechanic headsets are tricky before seriously riding it. That can easily add another  to the cost per tuneup. The Treks will be built inspected and usually include at least a number of free tuneupsgear discounts if you buy it at an LBS. Just some points to keep in mind good luck in your search.,MTB,cm2r7ye,4,t5_2qo3d

Its not about being strong enough to pedal a steel bike its that a lighter bike will be easier to bunny hop over obsticals and you will notice it downhill especially in switchbacks and technical lines . no offense but you may know lots about cycling but the road world is totally different than MTB . good luck making the transitionEdit also FYI riding single speed on the trail may be fun and silent but it WILL destroy the carlidge in your knees fast.

In most cases theyre rolling on bigger wheels too.Most hardtails have moved on too Theyve got all of the applicable improvements above.You could bolt newer components on to a  year old frame and get all the benefits the come with them. You can also use things like angleheadsets and offset shock bushings to modernise the geometry a bit.

2529966,0,t3_2onm7c,This comes up a lot here but its really important regarding the answer to your question. A lot of people use DH to refer to any trail that descends the hill. DH refers to a discipline of MTB where shuttles or lifts are used to ascend the hill and the trails are much more aggressive than what youd encounter in trail riding. The bikes have twin crowns  of suspension travel and are heavy and unpleasant to pedal around. There are plenty of fullsuspension bikes that are not DH bikes that should fit the bill for you. ,MTB,cmoswut,22,t5_2qo3d

If you dont know go with the Remedy IMO. Either way you will be satisfied with both. Just depends what you intend to ride!FWIW I was in a similar boat when I first bought my bike in August.

So you would have the er version of the  that would have a longer wheelbase and consequently feel more stable just like if you had a  with a short wheelbase and then rode a  with a long wheelbase of course its going to feel more stable.

3480744,0,t3_303e0o,It doesnt matter how heavy you are momentum can take over. Loose rocks ground steep sections etc have sent many riders to the ground regardless of weight.You might have to brake a bit earlier or take a section a bit slower. You might have been better off not braking and just bouncing over the section at speedIve seen a LOT of people fall because they lost confidence.Moral is do it just like the rest of us. Theres no reason a bigger person cant have the flow and balance of a smaller rider even if you have to take a slightly different path or brake a bit earlier. Falls happen its part of the sport dont let one fall where you arent even knocked out of commission dissuade you.IMO unless you cant lock up your tires as it is right now larger rotorsbrakes are just going to make you lock up more often.

Especially on a full suspension bike. Suspension is very hard to assess especially if you have no idea what youre looking for.  Also to window shop at a LBS and then buy used is a bit odd. It makes sense but its a bit strange. I say bring  and plan on buying new. this will get you a fantastic Hardtail r that will cover  of your bases. Most likely you will come in under  but acessories will put you back up there. Hopefully the shop will have last years model on heavy discount. Look at bikes like the Trek Stache. Specialized Rockhopper pro Evo. Crave. Etc... you dont need full suspension. Especially for what you are talking about.

3716430,0,t1_cqfgvtm,if youre curious i wrote about this at im not the worlds greatest mtb rider but i am a physicist and i was curious about the basis for that advice which is in mmtbs.  in that article i try to explain my best guess.the tldr is basically  if you start to slide then you can push the bike particularly the tyres in to the ground to regain grip.  you do that by launching yourself up and pushing the bike down  equal and opposite forces etc etc.  and you can only do that if the bike is underneath you.  so that is why you lean the bike more.its a fairly subtle point because its only important for a moment.  a sudden response to a loss of grip.  the average forces during the smooth part of cornering dont really care that much except for the angle the tyre profile makes with the ground about how much you lean the bike relative to the body.,MTB,cqfwe3i,1,t5_2qo3d

3784511,0,t3_33qnhc,these days you could ride a er without much trouble. that said wheel size is not the most important factor.given the terrain in petaluma id first decide on how much suspension if any youll need. im not familiar with the area so probably talk with the local shop first to see if a full suspension bike is worthwhile. with a K budget you can get a real nice hard trail. if you go full sus then you have to decide how much travel is appropriate. generally the more time you spend climbing the shorter travel you want. though now theyre making killer fs midtravel trail bikes that do great on long climbs. they may be a bit out of your budget though. once you decide on suspension format then i think you can decide on wheel size. i feel the er works best if you go the hardtail route. the bigger wheels rollover ability somewhat makes up for the lack of rear squish. that said at  and having ridden all the different sizes i really do feel . is a proper tweener size and retains much of the playfulness of a  without feeling like riding on shopping cart wheels. i prefer it over .,MTB,cqnnwck,1,t5_2qo3d

The Treks brakes are definitely superior but thats the only concrete edge Id give it.  The Rockhopper gets the edge in upgradeability tapered headtube makes it much easier to find a fork that will fit and suspension travel can be a plus or minus but Id mostly call it a plus.Between the two Id probably take the Rockhopper.,MTB,cqolp14,2,t5_2qo3d

This will help keep weight on your front wheel so that you can have more control but it also keeps weight on the rear wheel so that you dont lose traction. If its not so steep that you can stand up to pedal I find that a slow cadence and an even power output will keep your wheel from slipping. Its probably faster to just scoot up onto the nose of the saddle though. It will be uncomfortable but you only need to do it for super steep climbs. ,MTB,cqq1rbr,6,t5_2qo3d

4188604,0,t3_38t6hr,Do you plan to keep the Marlin after you get a FS? If so I recommend replacing the wheel with something beefy more spokes rated for high loads Velocity Cliffhanger was my choice and it out lasted the rest of the bike...never needed to be trued either and I checked often. I think I spent  or so on the one wheel but its a one time cost the factory wheel required more than that to be kept true in a season. If youre not planning on keeping it buy something used that still has all of the original factory spokes on it spoke fatigue leads to them all going in quick succession so dont buy a wheel that has a few mismatched spokes just to be safe.As for the brakes Id skip the BBs if youre a heavy rider gtlbs and go straight for the hydros.

4503895,0,t3_3crmnc,I bet theyll be able to tell pretty quick if you have some ability here and it seems worth your time.  I worked for a shop doing sales for about four years through some of high school and college.  It was a great experience overall way better than working at Dominos or whatever.  At least for the shop I worked in there were sales goals and such but since I was also a cashier it was a pretty big shop and just part time they didnt hassle me about it at all.  Which was nice since then I didnt have to upsell hard.  The downside was that I usually handed off any high end bike sales to a full time person.  So I sold mostly cheaper bikes and kids bikes.  Well just remember thats probably most of what youll be selling anyway.  But the employee purchase and discounts make it pretty nice for a young person with disposable income who is into bikes.  And meeting the occasional serious rider is always fun.As far as sales skills I think a lot of it just has to do with positive attitude and being socially competent.  That means being unflappably polite and trying to be helpful and at least sound understanding no matter what people say to you.  It also means not selling too hard which makes it sound to people like youre trying to take their money or rip them off.  You dont have to be happygolucky my natural personality is the opposite but at work I can mostly disconnect a bit and keep an even polite demeanor.  If you can keep a happy face on take direction learn the specs well enough admit when you are out of your area and need some help and talk to people in a straightforward and natural way then Im sure youll do fine.  And what bikeguycom said is spot on in terms of getting the basic info on what somebody wants.  Id also add two more things.  First you have to know how to size someone for a bike roughly kids included.  Its hard to master but easy to get the basics down in terms of what height usually goes to what frame size and what a person should look like on the right size.  Second get an idea of what basic accessories people need and ask if they have them and give a bit of a pitch if they dont.  This means primarily helmet bottlecage lock and floor pump.  Most casual riders dont necessarily want tools or flat repair stuff but you can ask about that too.  At least when I worked in an LBS these were pushed in part because they are good to have but also because they are much higher margin than the bikes themselves.  Accessories and service is where the money is.,MTB,csyd8yz,2,t5_2qo3d

4538211,0,t3_3d805i,Locking up the back wheel and skidding is easy and you can probably do it with the cheapest of hydraulic brakes. Locking up the front wheel will simply result in a crash either you will go over the handle bars too much grip on pavement and lack of proper weight distribution ie. not shifting your weight to the rear or the tire will skid and wash out to the left or right side on looser surfaces. These are not scenarios you want to experience when doing any type of riding. The differences between the front and rear brakes are normal something something inertia and physics. The majority of stopping power comes from your front brakes.When I purchased a set of shimano deore Ms now the Ms which are one step below the SLXs I was doing your standard bedding procedures. By the end of it I could speed up to kmh smash those brakes I was prepared to stop and adjusted my weight accordingly which is basically ass out and body just above the rear wheel like you would do when descending and I would literally stop on a dime. Not even so much as a slight skid from the front wheel. The tires hooked up with the pavement the brakes mashed the rotor and I came to a powerful stop. If I had to stop in an emergency theres no doubt about it Id be over the handle bars and kissing pavement they were that strong.Is this what you meant when you were talking about locking up the front wheel? Or are you simply implying that there is not enough stopping power?  Regarding the lack of power which there should be boat loads with SLX brakes make sure youre using the intended rotor for the brake pads and if they are new pads buy new rotors to go with them. And of course the proper bedding procedures.Edit details ,MTB,ct2o78d,8,t5_2qo3d

4653116,0,t3_3ep3zq,Theres a couple of different things going on that you could be seeing so Ill try to describe them and what they are for. . A lot of people myself included find it easier to control a bike off a jump when throwing a little wiggle of the bike into the motion instead of straight launching it. It helps keep your body loose and able to correct your position easier if you take off weird or offbalance. Especially on larger jumps launching straight can sometimes leave you stiffer than you want and if you are off balance it becomes hard to correct and makes a crash more likely.. A lot of people also like to learn to do tricks be stylish and flow better but maybe arent capable of fully committing to the trick so youll see a little halfwiggle of the bike or handlebars off a jump. Those better at jumping will throw whips tabletops etc. which involve large amounts of movement of the bike.  ,MTB,cth3325,26,t5_2qo3d

To add to this theres only one real bike shop in my area and the two times that I was in there I was given very poor help. MEC on the other hand has plenty of stock and wonderful people.So thats my  cents regarding my experience with LBSs of late. The LSB back home is pretty good but theyre expensive because they have a monopoly on the market in that area and subsequently give discounts to many customers  for example my family seems to have a permanent  discount on any shelf item and more for last seasons stuff or tradeins  weve been customers for a long time.As for your comment directly I always laugh at the people who say to not do anything beyond basic maintenance yourself and to bring it to the LBS because you should support them either in addition to or instead of have a professional do it which is a valid point.

So heres the only way to do it without destroying the tire put the wheel upright but sideways in front of you and brace a foot against the lower close side of the rim. Youll basically have to stand on the lower side of the rim so try and be gentle. Grab the tire with both hands at the top of the wheel push it away from you and then put all your weight on the tire to pull it down and break the bead.

5016031,0,t3_3jg2uq,Ive skimmed your post its too long for the time I have right now but hopefully I can be of some help.I built my own wheels back in January this year first time Ive done it and built my own tools as well truing jig nipple driver and dishing tool  I bought this bookand read it cover to cover twice and then used it as my reference when building my wheels. The truing stand design in there is excellent and more than good enough for building your own wheel.I bought a Nukeproof generator front hub a shimano xt rear hub mavic en for the front and mavic en for the rear and a couple of spokes for measuring the effective rim diameter. I then bought the spokes and nipples and set to building.It took me about  hours to build each wheel and it was super fun if really pay attention to spoke twist then you can get the spokes pretty tight and have an excellent wheel. I whip mine off my bike about every  miles and just check they are still true and then pop them back on  Ive not had to make any adjustments so far and I am certain that is because of the quality of that book.Dont watch youtube videos for wheel building this is a job where reading a book and taking your time is worth it  Im now the go to guy for my friends with wheel issues and I can tell when we are out riding who is going to come to me next as I can hear their spoke twist untwisting as we are out riding its that light dink dink sound you sometimes hearOh and I didnt use a tension meter i did use calipers to measure my hub dimensions accurately and make sure you use a nipple driver it makes the whole experience a damn sight easier,MTB,cuqmeho,1,t5_2qo3d

5098999,0,t3_3ku97c,I highly recommend upgrading your tires while you go tubless. A. It is much easier to set up a clean new tire than a dirty one that possibly has holes in it that cant be sealed anyway. B. Those Small Block s are pretty specific tires. Thay are made to be a good all around tire but are best as a fast rolling tire on hardpack dirt gravel packed roads and pavement. If you are doing some legit mountainbiking you would undoubtedly benefit from a wider more agressivly treaded tire like a Specialized Purgatory or Ground Control or Maxis Ardent etc... That should be everything you needexcept use Gorilla Tape Instead or stans tape  but the compressor is key. If you dont feel comfortable doing it it couldnt hurt to pay your shop to do it. It is a technically simple process but can be a total pain in the ass sometimes. Really depends on your rims tires and how well they seat etc... ,MTB,cv0mbg9,2,t5_2qo3d

5494785,0,t3_3qbla5,It depends on what you want. I prefer shorter chain stays and slack head angles in my bikes. That makes them a bit more nimble and enable more stability while descending. Its harder to design a  bike with those attributes. Looking at your two choices the . model would be better suited to my type of riding.But coming from the road you may be more comfortable with the  bike as it has longer stays and a steeper head angle. This makes it more stable while climbing and all straight line riding. It will feel more like a road bike.Its said that a  wheel will have better rollover and maintain speed better than smaller wheels but the larger size hurts your ability to accelerate.All that aside any difference you notice is likely to be anecdotal since youre just starting into mountain biking.,MTB,cwe0ebk,1,t5_2qo3d

5559159,0,t1_cwlt60j,Yes there is a lot of confusing terminology around damping. I see lots of people get confused between Speed and Damping.Maybe try and remember that a Damper was invented to slow down a spring. eg. say you had a car with just springs and no shocks when you hit a bump the spring will compress and then extend and then just keep on bouncing until the weight it is supporting settles down and stops moving. Its not an ideal shock absorber. So people invented a damper which will damp the spring on the compression and then damp it some more on the rebound extension.On most bikes the spring is just an air spring compress air enough and it will resist and push back and the damper is damping the movement of this air spring. For a lot of shocks it only dampens the rebound and not the compression although the Pike has both.So what seaskimmer means is if you want to shock to react fast eg spring back quickly you have to lower the amount of damping. If you want the shock to be slow you have to increase the amount of damping.,MTB,cwm5xp4,3,t5_2qo3d

5751606,0,t3_3ts86u,To answer your question yes there is a risk youd be taking if you immediately admit to building a trail. Youd be admitting to trespassing potentially damaging property and maybe some other not so nice things depending on who owns the land. I would figure out who the owner is and then anonymously contact them first and try to establish whether or not building a trail on that land is even in the cards. If they react poorly then you have your answer without admitting guilt. If they allow you to and if its government owned land the chances are slim but if they are open to the idea then maybe point out that some trails have already been built and that you would like permission to expand the preexisting trail. Just be very careful who you tell about who really built the trail Ive heard of some private landowners going so far as to seek reckless endangerment charges or something very similar against someone building dirt jumps in the trees on their property. Charges were luckily dropped but it was a really long and annoying legal battle which left this person with heaps of legal fees. Bottom line is the final choice about taking the risk is yours but if the landowner is against it it may not be worth the fine or whatever other charges come your way. ,MTB,cxa1ipz,1,t5_2qo3d

The Honzo has a relatively longer reach and slacker head angle. A DH bike goes even further with a slacker head angle and often longer reach. This type of geometry allows for more aggressive riding since the slacker HA will help prevent you from going over the bars and the longer reach will help with stabilitycontrol at higher speeds.Looking at Konas website the geometry of the Honzo is very similar to that of the Process.

6776663,0,t1_d0j5v4r,So basically out of the four bikes you selected three are hybrid bikes Panamao X  and  Novara Buzz and one is a mountain bike Novara Hickory. If you primarily plan on riding on streets with the occasional dirtgravel path I would get a hybrid. The weight of a mountain bike and the bulk of the tires will just slow you down on pavement so unless you plan on doing some aggressive offroading with the bike hybrid is your best bet. That being said I would steer away from the Buzz based on what you said your needs were because it has no front suspension. This narrows it down to the Panamao X. The difference between the  and  is primarily the quality of the components. The bikes essentially weight the same and are constructed almost identically. The number of gears are different but this is irrelevant since any number of gears over  just has duplicate gears. I would test ride both if you cant tell the difference between the two go with the cheaper one. It still has quality components. As far as a seat with a shock yes REI does sell them in various price ranges. You can save yourself some money by asking your local friendly REI tech if they have a post that they swapped out for another customer in the shop as often we will sell these to you at cost. If youre just casually riding you can just leave the pedals the bike came with on. Maybe one day down the road you will be more comfortable and upgrade to clipless pedals they make a world of difference!!,MTB,d0kf2ni,1,t5_2qo3d

6878479,0,t3_49x5ho,I got a new bike last year with SLX Brakes. When the brakes were brand new they did the same thing. They were noisy and lacked in braking power especially the rear. This will change as you put some miles on your bike. After a few rides the noise should go away and braking power will increase. The brakes just need to be broken in. One way to help with this is to do some braking runs. To do this you need to get your bike moving very quickly down the street and firmly hit the brakes but not hard enough to lock the wheels. DO NOT come to a complete stop. Let off the brakes at a high enough speed that you are able to pedal out of it and speed up again. Rince and repeat. Do this  times and you will see a difference. I would also like to note that I am looking to get some better pads or even some Zees for my bike because even though the slx brakes could stop my lb self it still took quiet a bit of effort on my part. Congratulations on the new bike!,MTB,d0vzmjd,3,t5_2qo3d

6953217,0,t3_4awrvb,Warranty factory support and crash replacement. You are right bikes arent complicated but they can still break. If I buy a k bike that once cost k I have a k bike that I paid k for. That means that when something breaks the pricing scales based on the original cost not what I paid for it. If I break a frame I could be out several thousand dollars even if its a warranty issue. At some point I could be dumping the same amount of money into it that a new one would have cost. Its a riskier proposition buying used you could go out on your first day and be out of your several thousand dollar bike. Id rather pay more to try and make sure that doesnt happen and guarantee some level of support from the manufacturer. You could end up being fine with it you may not its impossible to know.,MTB,d14h9o2,1,t5_2qo3d

If you wanted to go to a modern x youd need new ... pretty much everything.  New rear hub new cassette new cranks amp chainrings new shifters maybe new brake levers maybe new BB.  The price youd pay for those parts amp labor would be a big dent in the cost of a new bike.  If specific parts of the old drivetrain are toast you can almost certainly get replacements like a sp freewheel cassette or whatever for pretty cheap.And ublackgoattea is right about the fork a suspension fork will jack up the geometry something fierce.,MTB,d19ktwx,1,t5_2qo3d

7029266,0,t3_4bw3mj,In very simple terms if you put on a fork thats longer than intended for the frame you get a bike thats higher off the ground and leaning back more. Higher off the ground makes the bike less stable in corners leaning back more moves weight from the front wheel to the rear which can make the front wheel more likely to lose traction. Again bad for corners.For some not all cases adding mm to the front end can improve downhill performance at the expense of climbing ability. You will probably void any warranty though. Certainly anything more than mm either way is a bad idea  I once put a mm fork on a mm frame so I can attest to that!Im currently running a mm fork on a frame designed for mm forks btw.

7106026,0,t1_d1lgk5f,Air spring is the left leg. Air functions like a spring so when you hit a bump it can compress which increases air pressure.Damper is the right leg which dampens or slows down the movement. Imagine sticking your hand in a big vat of honey. If you move it slowly it will move with a certain amount of force. Now try to push through the honey as fast as you can. The thickness of the fluid provides more resistance as you go faster and slows the movement down.If you didnt have a damper the fork would act like a pogo stick and throw you up once you compress it. There are also different damping methods. Compression deals with the downstroke of the suspension. Rebound deals with it returning upwards. You also have low and high speed compression. Low speed would be like chatter bumps. High speed would be once you get some air and gravity takes over. If you watch Red Bull Rampage you will notice they do a little  drop and the suspension seems to compress  then they drop  and the suspension compresses the same. How can it do that? The air spring didnt changed but the larger impact activated the high speed compression.This is a bit of a simplification as you have speed and position sensitive dampening as well as many more neat things.My friend had a Fox  and Float . He always praised them as feeling great. Last week he got a new Slash with a Pike and his first text to me after riding it was This thing is a Fox killer.

The point is to get your weight back.For a bunnyhop you throw your weight back to lift the wheel with extended arms but your legs are giving a vertical explosion so you can get your hips HIGH and then bring the bike up to you.They both start similarly the difference is keeping your weight back and low for a manual vs. exploding up for a bunnyhop.,MTB,d34drrl,3,t5_2qo3d

7601780,0,t3_4je5tn,Do not buy the For someone  thats unquestionably too small.  Youre gonna have to jack the seatpost up to get proper pedaling extension which will make your handlebars well below your seat.  Puts more pressure on your hands and lower back which sucks for longer rides makes descending significantly more difficult especially without an expensive dropper post because it screws up weight distribution on the bike and makes it impossible to keep your weight low and centered.  Makes cornering more difficult for the same reasons.Im  and Im between an XL  and an XXL.  Ride an XL with a dropper post and riser bars to avoid some of the above problems.  Used to ride a  when it was the only thing I had....and it was so cramped and awful in comparison.Finding a bike thats the proper size is way more important than the component set or name thats printed on the side.  You can always upgrade little pieces here and there fork tires wheelset bars brakes when you have a frame that works.

7652684,0,t1_d3bxh1d,Regional people will often not participate in public comment forums because those are meant as a way for local people to provide their input not for organizations to bring in the big guns from HQ to give a spiel.  IMBA RD and ARDs will help get the message out but they rarely attend those.  Its not a forum for them.The only time IMBA has pushed TS on us in any way is when giving us pro bono designconsulting time.  Actual build projects IMBA is normally working with someone other than TS for the work.  But that meeting with TS was quite likely for another IMBA chapter.  When choosing between a public input meeting and a meeting with land manager to try to get a build project going Id expect that RD to better off at the trail build meeting.  They often have to choose between events both because of direct overlap or not even being in the right area in that time frame.  Its a balancing act.But I dont know where you are who your RD is what the other project was or even what chapter you are involved with so anything I say is guessing and conjecture.  But having been involved with advocacy for  years both with IMBA and with nonassociated organizations  I can say that not even situation is where you necessary andor appropriate to bring in the big guns.  And everyone has to pick what they see as the best use of their time because everyone cant do everything all of the time.

7693022,0,t1_d3gmnf8,sounds like you are holding on to the bars too rigidly  when you hit a sudden drop cm or so you need to let the bars fall away from you by straightening your arms allow the bike to fall forward. then when the front of the bike touches down you let it come back toward you using your arms as shock absorbers to take the impact.you cant do any of this if you are so far back on the bike that your arms are straight with no bend in your elbows. keep those elbows out then you are ready for anything whether its sucking in an impact or letting the bike out to fall away from you as i described above,MTB,d3gnb3p,1,t5_2qo3d

Id recommend converting to tubeless if you can. It was the second best upgrade I made it my bike.

If you want a slacker bike then it might be ok. However raising the front mm only raises the BB from  to  that e.g. mm  mm.. Youre better off getting a different frame altogether.. If you really dont want to go through the hassle just deal with the lower BB height shorten the rear travel increase shock pressure to reduce sag and pedal strikes and raise the front a bit.

8318002,0,t1_d5h91yq,A dropper refers to a dropper seatpost which is a type of seatpost that is springloaded and can be moved up and down using a remote lever push the lever to unlock the mechanism then use your body weight to push it down or allow the spring to move it back up.  This has been one of the bigger innovations in mountain biking in recent years because lowering your seatpost allows you to lower your center of gravity more easily and move around more freely on your bike which translates to greater confidence and speed on downhills.  Previously if you wanted to lower your seat you had to stop get off the bike use a quick release clamp to lower the seat then resume your ride.  It worked ok if you were riding up a hill then turning around and coming back down but it wasnt very practical for trails with lots of elevation changes so people mostly just picked a saddle height somewhere in the middle and kept it there.  That meant that you were never in the best position for long pedaling efforts or steep downhill trails  just some position that let you do both well enough.  Now you can set the max height of your dropper post to the ideal height for pedaling then drop it out of the way for descending when needed.,MTB,d5hb1mi,1,t5_2qo3d

8543560,0,t1_d697bqi,Partly though it has more to do with the way that coil shocks perform and how that interacts with DH linkage design.  Coil springs have a linear spring rate throughout their travel while air springs get progressively more difficult to compress the deeper they go into their travel.  DH bikes usually have some level of progressiveness already built into the linkage and you really dont want to lose the small bump sensitivity afforded by a coil spring when deep into your travel.  Some of the newer air shocks are getting better on this front but coil is still king.,MTB,d69ijki,4,t5_2qo3d

Like a bmx you would never really sit on the seat except for cruising. . Short travel usually tuned very stiff.

I got a dropper here and ended up taking it off the bike as I was only using it once per ride at the top of the hill all the bike parks here are a big climb to the top and then a big descent back to the car park but I was thinking how good it would have been where I grew up where theres a lot of shorter climbs and descents.

The Timp Peak and the Nebo Peak are easily their best bikes...and the only ones worth buying. As others have said you can get a much better bike at the price range you are floating and ill second My personal experienceI would highly recommend the Nebo Peak  if you want a . for a bit under k. My max budget was USD. This is where I wound upI was flip flopping between a Santa Cruz s and the Nebo Peak.For k less I did get much better components significantly more travel but a slightly worse Geo. The minimal Geo upgrade wasnt worth the extra k at my level of skill. But damn that Santa Cruz looked so much better its really a freaking beautiful Bike in comparison. The only thing I dont like about my Nebo is actually the company branding. Fezzari .

Proper tubeless tires will work much much better and pretty much all nicer tires are tubeless compatible anyway.  A decent shop should put tape and valves in your rims and mount up your tires for ish per wheel plus tires.For a x conversion youll be better off buying a x specific chainring as theyre designed to keep the chain from falling off.  Do you have a speed rear? If so does your derailer have a clutch?  A clutch derailer and a narrowwide chainring will keep your chain on in nearly all situations without a chain guide.

China artificially weakens its own currency for this very reason.However for an individual business weaker currency hurts. All the local staff are squeezed harder since importing becomes more expensive driving local prices up. They have to either drop salaries or rise prices and since this kind of business in particular doesnt require much highly skilled labor its unlikely that they have much scope to reduce wages. Prices have to go up instead.Basically weakened currency can be good at a macro level but not often at a micro level.

Most of these companies dont give a shit.  Its about liability but most lower workers who are there mostly logging could give two shits about you riding or not.  Just keep riding.  Take it in stride.  Just dont be surprised if parts of the trail are destroyed or changed.  Honestly we cant complain.  Buy your own land and make your own trails.

9561196,0,t1_d9rjtn2,gtyou were sayingThe only reason to use double butted spokes is to save weightwhich is completely false as i showed. my argument wasnt that DB spokes are superior in every way and for every use to SG spokes my argument is that they are superior in many ways and that tons of riders use them for DH based on their preferences.Fair enough.  I was generalizing because the question wasnt presented as requesting a treatise on wheel building theory.  But I guess were going down that rabbit hole anyways...gtSpokes failing isnt the normal mode of failure for a DH wheelthats of course as you probably know because crashes are harder and faster so wheels typically dont last that long but people still definitely snap spokes on DH wheelsets.I dont think crashing has much to do with it.  Id say its mostly just because  of travel allows you to run into shit really hard which punishes rims.  Regardless DH wheels rarely last long enough for the spokes to start breaking from fatigue which is what youre talking about with DB spokes.  Most spokes that Ive seen snap on DH wheels are from rocks and sticks hitting them in which case DB vs. SG doesnt really matter. gtLook at any of the factory built DH wheels. Pretty much all of them are using straight gauge spokeslook at factory built wheels of any kind. pretty much all of them are using straight gauge spokes  it saves money for manufacturers this doesnt mean its superiorEh?  No.  There are plenty of lighter weight factory wheels that use DB spokes.  But the burlier wheels generally use straight gauge or some custom oversized spoke like on the Havocs.  To be clear Im not talking about bottom of the line generic wheels.  Im talking about prebuilt DH wheelsets many of which are plenty expensive and arent using SG spokes as a cost saving measure.gtI would still argue that regardless of its intended use a well built wheel with high spoke tensions and straight gauge spokes is actually slightly more durable than a wheel with double butted spokestheyre actually less durable high spoke tensions dont make a wheel stiffer they just make it more likely to crack a nipple. once youre up to a proper spoke tension typically  kgf but it varies increasing it further doesnt make the wheel stronger. SB and SG spokes should be brought up to the same tension.sure if you have a badly built wheel you can over tension it to cover up sloppy building as it will take longer to lose enough tension to start snapping spokes but thats not really an advantage for a well built wheelultimately it comes down to rider preference. if umachvi cares most about stiffness and knows that DB wouldnt be stiff enough sure go with SG. but if they care about a wheel that will last longer and be more fatigue resistant assuming they dont crash it of course they should go with DB.I didnt say high spoke tensions make the wheel stiffer.  I said SG spokes at high tension are more durable.  Spokes break when they fatigue and they fatigue when theyre repeatedly destressed.  When a wheel is loaded it detensions the spokes at the bottom to some extent.  As the wheel rolls forward those spokes snap back into tension.  If the spokes went completely slack that puts a ton of stress on them.  DB spokes help resist this because theyre more elastic and thus it takes a greater load to completely detension them.  But with higher tensions SG can also effectively resist complete detensioning.  The difference though is that DB spokes have an additional stress riser at the butt.  Particularly on wheelsmith spokes that have an abrupt butt that stress riser can eventually become a failure point Ive personally seen it happen on lots of wheels.  Thats not necessarily to say its a more common failure point than the head or the nipple but on a DB spoke its two more failure points that a SG spoke doesnt have.  Which is also why I like DT DB spokes way better  because the butt isnt abrupt and thus the stress riser isnt as severe.But back to the matter at hand most of what Im saying is coming from personal experience.  Ive built and ridden a lot of wheels both on trail bikes and DH bikes.  On a trail bike sure  Ive built plenty of wheels with DB spokes that have been going strong for many seasons.  On a DH wheelset every single one that Ive built with DB spokes hasnt lasted more than a few days of hard riding.  Ive relaced those wheels using the same hubs and the same rims building the wheel to the same tension specs etc. but using SG spokes and they last significantly longer.  And Im not the only one whos come to this conclusion OP isnt the first one on the internet to ask this question.  And the resounding answer to what spokes for a DH wheelset is always SG  w brass nipples.  Itd be one thing if  random idiot on the internet said this.  But when s of riders all come to the same conclusion... maybe theyre on to something.  ,MTB,d9rm3o5,5,t5_2qo3d

9699229,0,t3_5dz5b2,I have a v Bronson with a DVO Topaz. Ive been really happy with it I find that I run about mm of sag which is  instead of . The shock provides a lot more support through the stroke and is very smooth smoother than any other shock Ive used. Its also user serviceable entirely. Ive seen some recommendations on the DBAir. I used to be a huge fan of this shock and defended them against all the people that complained about the reliability. They are fantastic when they work. Mine needed its first rebuild at about  miles and  months when it completely went kaput but I think it needed rebuilt about  miles before when I noticed the LSC dampening went to pot and it became extremely soft. The next rebuild I tried to be more conscious of its progression through its lifecycle and found that at around  miles it was time to rebuild again. Each rebuild is  and you go a week without your shock. I dont defend them anymore. I have friends that send theirs back almost quarterly for rebuilds and Im running at about  per year. Again its fantastic when it works but I have to assume the tolerances on the internals are so tight that they wear out very quickly and it no longer works properly. All that said I would not get another DBAir CS. Its also an expensive shock compared to the others. I would also not do the large volume can Santa Cruz support said that they couldnt get it to feel right. If you do go the DBAir route despite this make sure you get the Bronson specific model which has a few tweaks over the standard shock for VPP.IMO the Topaz offers the same plushness in the rear end but with more support throughout the stroke and better pedaling. The  position compression switch offers a lot more adjustability on the fly as well I found the DBAir CS switch to offer very little in terms of additional pedaling support in comparison. All that said both DVO and Cane Creek are awesome companies in terms of support.,MTB,da8mxhm,4,t5_2qo3d

9778456,0,t3_5f8siy,hey I live there!So some of the two closest riding areas worth noting are the EACP trails also known as trail creek and Heritage Park. Trail creek is a fun little area with  shortish freeride areas a main mile cross country style loop and  beginner trails. The trails are well maintained and are usually busy. It shares a parking lot with a few soccer and baseball fields. There are real bathrooms and drinking fountains here.Heritage park is an older trial just outside of watkinsville about a  minute drive from athens. Its a  mile loop of moderately difficult rooty singletrack. There are dedicated bikehike trails and a dedicated equestrian loop. There are bypass options for some of the trails. The main loop is well ridden in and following signs is not difficult. There are trail maps along the entire route. This trail has a portapotty and a hose. Downed trees are semicommon but are usually cleaned up within the week by our local bike club.There are two main bike shops to visit in athens Sunshine cycles and the Hub. I havent personally shopped at the hub but I did spend some time with the owner helping an injured kid and he seemed like a good fella. The staff at both sunshine locations are knowledgeable and friendly. Sunshine sells Giant bikes and their sister companies Santa Cruz and Felt primarily.There is a plethora of pirate trails around athens as well. The dirt loop is the most well known and is fairly well documented in strava. Id ask around at either bike shop to find out more All trails in athens are maintained by the athens branch of SORBA. ,MTB,daiert2,3,t5_2qo3d

9806139,0,t1_dalsh4u,KMC X for a chain and my bike is a Nishiki Colorado dumpster fire that came with a x Shimano Altus drivetrain. I have slowly been upgrading parts that wear out while watching how much  I put into it. It currently has XX miles on the stock derailleur with the chain and cassette HG  having  miles on them since the change. Replacing it wasnt expensive as I do my own maint. but I would like to prolong it as much as possible. I commute with the bike and got hooked into trail riding so until I get my FS she does it all.

9913744,0,t1_dazqsgq,gt the stuff used for lubricating a bike chain is referred to as lubeYou might call it that the rest of the world doesnt. We call it what the label says it is not what you personally consider it to be.P.S. Lube means a substance used for minimizing friction. Has nothing to do with being bike specific nor does it refer to any particular type of friction reducer.  gti wouldnt recommend repacking a bearing with that spray and im sure you wouldnt eitherOP isnt packing bearings lets be serious. OP is spraying the moving parts with lube not disassembling cleaning and repacking. White lithium is perfectly acceptable to spray on the moving bits. It wont displace existing grease nor is it hydroscopic and it generally dries and self cleans. Again Id like to point out while you disagree you offer no solution or correction. Telling someone theyre wrong without informing whats right is useless.gtyour explanations are great for already knowledgeable people not so great for the people who come here to learn and currently have the most basic understanding of how bike maintenance is performedCorrect information is great for everyone.

Those look like the tread is pretty minimal so you may find yourself losing grip in corners and stuff...  It depends on the terrain and your type of riding though.  Those tires may treat you well for a long time.Personally I like knee pads.  If youre looking for some cross country stuff something like some GForms will offer plenty of protection.

10411712,0,t3_5p1fcd,Avoid Bike and Bean. Total douche nozzles. I used to park in their strip mall lot but last time I was in Sedona October there were a bunch of signs posted saying no trail parking.Anyway across the street is Absolute Bikes. FAR better shop and a friendlier crew. We rented a bike there for my girlfriends daughter. Bike and Bean was very specific on where we could and could not ride their rental while Absolute was happy to show us EVERY good trail nearby. If you chat them up or just buy something small I bet theyd let you park there all day. Just do whatever you can to NOT waste money on a Red Rocks Pass. Fuck USFS. From Absolute you can ride north about  mile to hit Slim Shady. Pretty easy climb and descent after the junction if you continue on that takes you to Hiline fun tough ascent exposed singletrack and a wild descent Made in the Shade absolute shit garbage trail like riding on bowling balls Templeton fun slick rock with a cool descent to Oak Creek and quite a few other trails to the east of A. Good place to get a convenient fun  mi or so. Of course theres lots more stuff in Sedona but accessparking isnt as user friendly.Expect tons of gridlocked vehicle traffic so offputting that I rarely go because of it but if you manage to get to some of the more advanced trails you wont see many other hikers or bikers even on a weekend. Found the hikers to be much better than in Phoenix in Sedona theyre very courteous friendly and accommodating i.e. get out of your way without much guff. Bikers... well you can tell who the locals are. Not particularly friendly and territorial. They must all be assholes from Hawaii.

There is a lot of detail that you are loosing simply because it is too dark.  Although this may be due to the color grading that you did.  Something I have been trying to do lately is running my footage through an equalizer which tries to expose each clip relative to each other. Secondly there are some clips that need to get trimmed down.  I would say that you got this right about  of the time.  For the most part each clip flowed nicely into the next but there were a few parts that had to much dead air.  A good rule of thumb is you always want the rider to be taking up at least  of the screen.  Obviously for wide shots this will be different but if the shot is of the rider riding by the camera you can cut out the long run up and run out.Overall you have some great riding and the editing is pretty good.

Like if you are skidding constantly you are braking wrong. Trail access is still a hot topic in a lot of places and being respectful to the trail and other users just makes sense. Luckily there are a LOT more bikeonly trails today than  years ago. The general public cant really even access them let alone form a negative opinion about bikers. ,MTB,dde26xo,6,t5_2qo3d

To riders with a bit of experience we see the videos for what they are sensational riding and stunts we will probably never achieve and behaviors we might not want to subject our trails to...But to those completely unfamiliar with riding the takeaway might be quite different... I recently spoke to a friend who works in a county position here in WI. He has no experience in mountain biking but having spoken to me and others he sees that developing trials could be a way to stimulate tourism in his remote area... With no experience in riding he reported that he has been watching a fair amount of biking videos as part of his research... I went out of my way to explain that the riding he may have been watching bears little resemblance to the rank and file riders regularly using our trails most of us go out of our way to take care of our trails. We ride respectfully of the others who share our public lands we do not want trails to blight our landscape and lead to problems like erosion we self police and do our best to be stewards of our sport and maintain the privilege we have in our trails...Without our conversation my friend might have entered a county board meeting armed only with the behaviors hed seen in mountain biking films.

10735895,0,t3_5tlcbh,I got some good advice from my favorite LBS and it turned out to be golden. Not sure if youve seen them but balance bikes are the best way to learn NOT training wheels. To save from buying a balance bike and a pedal bike of the same size just get a  inch streetBMX bike and pull the pedals off. All three of my kids have learned this way. Oldest was pedaling   middle one   and I could probably put pedals on the  year olds bike and shed be fine. As for type of bike we took my sons hand me down spiderman bike where the bottom bracket was falling off to the local trails and it was fine. So really anything will do. His next  inch bike was also BMXstyle and we take it out to the trails too. He can roll foot drops on the thing.

I feel like the more I practice pumping over little things like that the easier jumping becomes. If I pump right before a jump I dont really have to think about where my weight is all just falls into place.  You definitely want to transfer your weight back a bit when you get in the air. Something to practice to make that feel more natural might just be getting comfortable doing a few wheelies. For me it helped just get over the odd feeling of putting your weight back that far.

Basically from a practical standpoint you probably have to move about  meters along a trail before the GPS will update position.  So the key idea is that you want to look at your phone twice.  Once at the junction once just after you start moving along the new trail to confirm that you nailed the decision.If you had the phone rotated and somehow flipped around the directions your new updated position will show you on the wrong trail and you have a chance to back up and reroute.You actually have to travel to get the phone to plot a new position.  If your phone is messing with you another strategy is to just start going in any direction.  Once the phone updates the new position it will help pinpoint which direction youre moving in which helps you figure out which way to hold your phone to align it to the ground.,MTB,ddtqowe,1,t5_2qo3d

I wanted to upgrade all kinds of stuff too  years ago but I really didnt know enough about my abilities back then to make an informed decision.I might upgrade my fork to an air fork and get some new tires eventually.  Ive thought about changing my drivetrain from x to x but honestly its probably not worth it.  My first year I had major fear of shifting... and the x makes it tougher but Im pretty good with my x now.These entry level tier higher than big box store bikes are really really good for the money nowadays.

The snowpack in the mountains is actually above average and there are storms in the forecast into March...The front range trails were dry for a couple of weeks but it just snowed here again so theyll take a couple weeks to dry out. If it does happen to dry out youll want to stick to lower elevation trails like Hall Ranch Horsetooth near Ft. Collins or head down to CO Springs or Oil Well Flats near Caon City.

10998296,0,t3_5wxeby,What bike?  also . or  Specialized Stumpjumper FSR . mm front travel mm rear.  inch wide tire. Frame fits both  and . wheels.What kind of riding do you use it for?I dont know what you would call it. I do up to kms  miles in a ride up hills and down steep descents. I chase strava leaderboards for both climbs and descents. Why did you go the  Route?The area where I ride Woodhill Forest Auckland New Zealand is a pine forest that is sand based. So in summer sections become like a beach the wider tire provides a lot of stability when youre bombing a hill and hit some sand. Its something different lots of grip for climbing and turning.Do you own a FS bike or another HT too?The Plus bike is FS. I dont own a hardtail. I use to have a FS er and before that a FS.Do you race your plus bike?No. But it is slower than my previous er see more info below.What are your overall thoughts on your plus experience?The grip and stability is awesome and incredible compared to a . wide  inch wheel. You put the plus bike on a line and it stays there no need to worry about soft sandy patches or roots it just trucks over everything and holds its line. I recently rode another area with gravel trails where it also performed well. Lots of grip for loose gravel climbs and some sections of the ride were damp clay but not mud which it also gripped well on.Speed wise its slower than my previous er. Does not accelerate as quickly as the er I would think because of the rotational weight. I still have tubes in but will be changing to tubeless soon so hopefully that will help. I have not ridden it in much mud yet but think it will struggle. What mud I have encountered slowed the bike down noticeably a lot of drag with the larger tire contact patch. I am considering having a second set of inch wheels for winter mud riding. ,MTB,deemgaz,1,t5_2qo3d

The dinnerplate sized rotors came with the brakes so hence Im using them. One of the adapters was dud so Ive replaced with a new Shimano adapter.  I rode to work on the MTB yesterday and the brakes felt better in the sense that using them for a couple of longer rides gave me more of an understanding of how to feather them as opposed to stopping on a Higgs Boson. The front actually feels a little better with use faster to recover but the rear still has a bit of travel in the lever. Meantime I might try a bleed a friend might have a Hayes kit to see if it freshens things up.

11676292,0,t1_dgj5kep,As an alternate viewpoint to tysontimecock I much prefer the stiffness of the impacts over the flexiness of the freeriders. I find that the stiffness means less fatigue in my feet over long rides its more comfortable Im more confidentplantedstable on the pedals in situations where I have to quickly slam my feet back on the pedals and theyre not quite in the right place and the shoes last a lot longer before the soles become too flexy. Freeriders get very flexy after a bit of use.The added protection of the impacts is a bonus as is the extra shock protection if you quickly have to plant a foot at speed. It took a little while to get used to the stiffer sole but I realized that the feel matters a lot less than I thought it does. I can still feel the bike great its just the edges of the pedal I cant feel as well but I can still feel exactly where I am on the pedal. No regrets never going back to a shoe with more feel.,MTB,dgjivmx,2,t5_2qo3d

Lost the front wheel while threading the needle between trees.  Got thrown down trail upside down and backwards.  Luckily three different trees were helpful enough to stop me from going too far off the trail.  Worst part I dont know what exactly caused me to get thrown like that.  So not the most memorable crash i guess PAfter that I did have confidence questions.  It took several rides to feel back up to speed.  It will come back!
