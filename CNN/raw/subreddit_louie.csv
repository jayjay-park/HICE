938973,0,t1_chastqc,Your spine is a structural masterpiece befitting the million years of evolution over which it has developed. And although additional evolutionary improvements will occur as life and time progress there is nothing in the current understanding of dynamic biomechanics or human evolution that gives any credence to the idea that we havent evolved enough to be able to walk on two legs and remain upright without having pain.In terms of what we werent designed to do it is possible that standing in one place and lifting machinery onto a conveyer belt for eight hours or sitting staring straight ahead at a computer screen all day are slightly beyond natures present design specifications. However standing upright and walking on two legs is exactly what we have spent all our evolutionary past perfecting. Additionally from a practical perspective walking is actually prescribed as a treatment for back pain.,louie,chb0m37,22,t5_2s3kb

1152945,0,t1_chxrbfu,Louie awkwardly trying to rape a women is pure comedy gold according to me.  I felt so much uncomfortable watching it that I burst into laughter and Im pretty sure that was the intention of Louis writing it.  Rape as been a topic that Louis tried to get material out of in his past stand up and it always worked fine.  Seeing it is another thing than hearing it tho.  I think he managed to make it visually funny.,louie,chzbks1,-6,t5_2s3kb

1280223,0,t3_28ppd3,To me she and Louie are both part manic pixie dream girl and jaded brooder. She doesnt let Louie be money she doesnt take things too seriously on the surface but Louie also presses on the pressure points where she doesnt feel comfortable. But most importantly they have an understanding that they dont want to be jaded. They like each other cause they can say whatever they want and know the other will act independently.  Its cute.

2237540,0,t3_2kqvvb,Haha I dont think it was unintentional Louis usually has a reason for everything he puts in his scripts even if theyre slightly insane. It probably made him laugh that one of his friends would recommend a creepy dentist or maybe making an insinuation that Nick LIKES that sort of thing. Weird I know but thats exactly the kind of humor Louis likes to employ. It might have even seemed fitting that his fellow comedian would have a terrible experience and go Im telling everyone to go see him.
