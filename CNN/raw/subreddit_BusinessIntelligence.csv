2776148,0,t1_cnjlusp,Well I am creating it from scratch so there isnt an existing model yet. I am sure its just a technology issue but I just have yet to see anywhere how you create a role playing dimension for another dimension in SSAS.For the measuresfacts you would just go to Dimension Usage in the cube designer and add it that way. I know that you just create the relationship in the Data Source View but I dont know how to create the new columns that I am shooting for which would be something like Creative Start Year Creative Start Month Creative Start Week etc. in SSAS  ,BusinessIntelligence,cnjmzee,1,t5_2qnri

3137798,0,t3_2w2rev,Thanks for another great post.  My organization is struggling with Pitfall  right now which in turn is having spillover effects into  and .Weve got a single source in SQL that is a heavily denormalized transaction level record that is also the main source for tableau.  The problem Ive run into is users want to know for example the current balance of every account that had a transactiontype at least x days after transactiontype with further filters for department location etc.  Current account balance would be the sum of all transactions sharing the same account number but the rest of the query is impossible that I know of in Tableau.  Writing this in SQL is trivial but because of the variable parameters requires a live SQL connection.And of course this is just one of now dozens of special snowflake queries that weve had to write.  Tableau doesnt need to recreate the sql server but having a few more advanced functions available would go a long way in reducing the number of data sources we rely on.  The upcoming level of detail change is one Im particularly excited for.,BusinessIntelligence,con89oj,2,t5_2qnri

4806901,0,t1_cu0c9ay,gt Since DAX cant do everything that mdx can do you think that DAX gets the support to be a more robust language and multidimensional cubes go away in place of tabular.personally I think that you hit on two separate topics...My impression is that no one on the SQLSSAS product team cares about MDX since the departure of their original MDX gurucreator... and as such it doesnt get any attentioninnovationsimprovement.DAX being the new hotness of the teams ADDADHD is getting lots of feedback about we need thisthat... so theyre busy adding capability to DAX... at some point itll get damn close to feature parity with MDX... some things like unlimited hierarchy should be relatively easy.TABDAX is also taking off for two other BIG reasons.... Excel... build it in PPivot import into SSAS... power users can do  of the effort which means the BI devs only spend  of the timeeffort... so the turnaround time and cost for a report is now cut down by . reduction of steps... of the standard loadprocessquery chain processing is no longer necessary... people consider this more realtime regardless of the fact that either cube OLAPTAB can do incremental loads with whatever granularity you want... usually the biggest impact to the update frequency is based on the load step though admittedly SQLs builtin replication can make some of this stuff damn fast if youre willing to pay for the hardwarelicensing.all that said I do like some aspects of DAX... for simple stuff its far easier to build a cube and get my answers... I also tend to see it as more flexible with the data schemas not everything need be transformed into star schema if the relations can be added to the modelsince both engines OLAPTAB can respond to either query language MDXDAX the tooling is really what seems to be making the big impact... and Excel has always worked well with SSAS... so I try to focus as much as possible on letting the users query the data directly regardless of the backend.,BusinessIntelligence,cu0g6xp,1,t5_2qnri

5585749,0,t1_cworhl7,Yes that is exactly what I said. The cloud is still new to many organizations so the process of protecting that kind of data with third parties is very much a work in progress.

10680167,0,t3_5ssiip,Your data would have to be extremely normalized and anytime you rebuilt the cube you would taxing the source system. You could cause locking issues and break jobs that run at night. How would you handle type slowly changing dimensions? In the typical model you have your extract tables that are copies of the source table. Staging tables that reflect the schema and issue surrogate keys and is the step  in the process for manipulating your data to match the expectations of the star schema. Finally you have your facts and dimensions that are loaded from your staging and post manipulation step .If you want to skip all that youll tax the source system more because SSAS cubing is intense. Ultimately not everyone likes mdx queries and using cubed data. You may want to utilize SSRS against tables as well.,BusinessIntelligence,ddhktue,3,t5_2qnri
