4097160,0,t3_37igxp,I have the Note  on Verizon and I love it.I would recommend it more than the Nexus.I have not been able to feel a Nexus in my hand. I gather that its quite a different experience. From my point of view the Nexus is lovely. But truthfully I dont know too much about the Nexus. But I can tell you about everyday life with the Note.I think all Samsung devices but especially the Note are more about the little things. Kind of ironic big phone about the little details... but hear me outYoull use the SPen more than you think you will. One of the little details there is when youre browsing a page you can hover the pen over the bottom to scroll down slowly and place it in the middle to scroll faster.Or take the camera and heart rate monitor on the back. You can place your finger on the HRM on the back to take a selfie. You dont have to set a timer andor awkwardly switch hand positions.Or maybe the multitasking. Its not used as much for me but there is one thing I like the Edgeesque quick menu brought up by holding the back button. It brings up a menu of apps that you choose that you can open quickly within any app only downside is that the apps in the list have to support multiwindow. Say Im texting and I cant remember what the date of next Tuesday is. Rather than hitting home gt apps gt scroll gt calendar or saying Ok Googlegt wait a sec for it to open gt open calendar or whats the date of next Tuesday? second one isnt a bad option though  I can just hold back for a second tap calendar done. Some of the apps in there are things like Chrome Messages Calendar and Camera though there are a lot more.Samsung seems to be all about the little things. There are quite a few more things the Note has going for it but Im taking enough space as it is.I wish I knew how the Nexus was so I could help you compare but I hope Ive at least given you an idea of what the Note is like.The only thing that I would honestly rather have than this is the Sony Xperia Z or I guess Z in June because of the water and dust resistance. I go to the beach a lot and those front facing speakers combined with not really caring if it gets sandy would be so great. I almost got that phone but I chose the Note. The Note is better for every season except summer.Verizons bloatware sucks though.,Smartphones,crnaviz,2,t5_2r1aa

7331701,0,t1_d2b5rsh,Hardwarewise theyre still quality and still not tons of bloat but their support is currently worse than nonexistent. Lots of articles warning customers that they have no warrantee exchange devices in stock and people wait weeks or months with no phones. Plus since the Lenovo buyout phones arent getting updated. Motorola had the best reputation around for keeping phones updated with the  moto X famously getting an OTA before the Nexus  once the Nexus  was out. Theyre not updating phones at all now. You buy a Motorola and you better get comfortable with the firmware because it isnt changing. You will have paid hundreds for a phone that doesnt update when you could have paid less for a Nexus that gets better as software improves And instead of a light skin and minimal bloat you get none at all which is infinitely better. TLDR nice hardware no support or updates.,Smartphones,d2bkblt,1,t5_2r1aa

7659905,0,t3_4k7hbb,The big three flagships for this year all look good S G and .I like the S the most. Its a good size looks good and is a solid performer. Best screen best camera. However it is almost definitely more delicate than the other two and less repairable. If rooting or flashing roms is important to you youll want the international unlocked version with the Exynos processor.The  is my second choice though I havent heard much about it to have a solid opinion yet.The G actually looks and feels better in person but it just doesnt do anything for me. I might have a bias against LG for no good reason though  the G series seems to be solid theyve just never really appealed to me.As for price all three of those are hanging out in the  range but I suspect all of them will drop below  before the holiday season if you dont mind waiting.The Z looks like a great device and seems like it should be on paper but reports of realworld usage are that its just not a well polished device.PhoneArena is a good site with lots of good information and reviews with good comparison tools.,Smartphones,d3cvypc,2,t5_2r1aa
