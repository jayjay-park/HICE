10734461,0,t3_5tijfy,Ive kept the shit talking to myself after someone said i wasnt a fan for ranting TL.  Truth is I was ranting because I thought the roster they made after all the  hyping was sub par.   It is sub par.  I hope we in someway turn this shit back. But what honestly worries me the most are the constant bad managing decisions.    Like I said before the split. Why on earth do you kick Mid Fenix for a worst midlaner when its probably the most important position alongside Jungle?    Why do you keep an import in ADC when its one of the most useless positions and things havent worked out already  seasons in a row?    We can turn this around of course. But TL really should get a Manager for the Roster.   In other sports teams get someone to decide sport decisions. I love Steve but clearly his decisions that have to do with roster arent the best.  ,Team_Liquid,ddn6giy,3,t5_3i8ln

11166181,0,t1_dew0dw8,Did I just actually read thisThe job of the support is not to ward the new wards can ward as much as sightstone on average the reason you buy sightstone is so you can ward AND clear wards.Vision is incredibly important and a sightstone can put down far more wards than a vision trinket which starts of as a  second ward every  seconds.TLs lack of it breaks down two things Weak vision macro and prediction by Matt and the team rarely moving together to secure vision. Say what you will but many of Matts deaths have been him getting caught out while trying to ward. Warding is necessary at all times and if the team isnt practicing moving as at least  jungle  supp to secure vision then the support is the potential sacrificial lamb doing what is necessary but very dangerous.,Team_Liquid,dexob0f,1,t5_3i8ln

They will still put up numbers just on plain skill alone.I love you piggy but this is not working. Lets go into the offseason and give Arcsecond a chance in our last games dude is a monster and has mained MID for a while now.  There are a million ADCs that can fill Doublelifts spot and he need not be an import though Rekkles seems to need a change of scenery too.

Gg is not lcs calibur at all in his role and has had no proof he cam reach that yet ppl believed him.  Gg is a true con that brought no value to the team  no skill no communication and actively made fans dislike him. Piglet even if you didnt buy into his skill was and is the most popular player and streamer on this roster just for branding value to the org. piglet is a world champ. No matter how bad yellowsta is now he had branding value and a baseline experience level as a former champion. Thats what you pay for and tl is not getting conned. Goldenglue was nothing is nothing and became nothing. And we paid something. Thats a con. the org had three adcs at the time fabby jynthe piglet and piglet beat them in terms of perceived value to the team. Goldenglue legit had no competition and just walked in to give us the worst mid lcs performance in tl and curses combined history.Piglets not worth keeping necessarily...but goldenglue was a travesty.,Team_Liquid,df4a7rs,3,t5_3i8ln

11427574,0,t1_dfqtpxv,Goldenglue is the inverse of piglet but worse at it. Piglet has shit early game but generally very good mid or late game if he survived. Goldenglue has a mehaverage early game where he doesnt int like Piglet but useless midlate.If you want to replace Piglet for the love of god put someone with potential at least. Piglet has more potential from his one month of mid lane then goldenglue has had from like  years ,Team_Liquid,dfraxxh,0,t5_3i8ln
11434863,0,t3_638dwn,They have the entire offseason to see. I think that he tried to pick too many champions when swapping roles which led to him not being that good in the matchups and dying as a result.If they try everything and stick with Piglet Ill be fine with that. I just want to see them at least try to look for upgrades.,Team_Liquid,dfs4pbx,1,t5_3i8ln

11564202,0,t3_64i35h,Its not like Hai doesnt have his own drawbacks. Yes shotcalling was a major problem for TL this split. But Id say the bigger problem was that we as a team struggled to win lanes anywhere which makes shotcalling particularly the proactive shotcalling focused on snowballing that NA loves to do especially difficult. GG and Piglet had the same fundamental problems this split weak champ pools and poor laning. Those are also essentially Hais deficiencies. If  were taking the monthandahalf two months? to really get out and find someone quality and  were playing hypotheticals where its plausible for us to grab someone who is already contracted to a playoffcaliber team Id much rather we at the least go out and get someone who can reliably be expected to win lane.,Team_Liquid,dg6t2vg,1,t5_3i8ln
