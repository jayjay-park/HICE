45448,0,t1_cejgogg,I tend to wax poetic about things I miss. Usually. CoH was one of my favorite games of all time.,cityoftitans,cejlsnb,1,t5_2yoad
51219,0,t1_cek8w0x,I really hope that for PvP they have PvP servers in addition to the one solid pvp zone. I remember thinking that a cool idea for a world event in CoH could have revolved around the war walls going down allowing villains to attack paragon city and vice versa.I know we may get duels as a form of noconsequence pvp. Like a hero challenges another one to a sparring match for example.I keep thinking about how cool it would have been if they had not been shut down and went on to do the big outer space update they had planned. They were going to introduce a cosmic power set in the same vein as thanos from marvel new space themed costume pieces missions a space option for origin and a new city to play around in. It would have been a domed colony city in space and would have allowed for missions on other planets. Woulda been soooo cool ,cityoftitans,cek9ffi,1,t5_2yoad
