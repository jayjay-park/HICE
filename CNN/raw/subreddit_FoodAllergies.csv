529739,0,t1_cg0ha6v,I think I just find AllergyFree to be a pretty bold claim. Still I recognize corn isnt a common allergy yet.. and its probably a great book.,FoodAllergies,cg0hlaf,1,t5_2uo1i
2470441,0,t3_2lfbdk,I should have been a little more clear to start just so people knew the blood tests just werent for my knowing but because I have been diagnosed with...Angioedema is the rapid swelling edema of the dermis subcutaneous tissue mucosa and submucosal tissues. It is very similar to urticaria but urticaria commonly known as hives occurs in the upper dermis.Acquired angioedema can be immunologic nonimmunologic or idiopathic. It is usually caused by allergy and occurs together with other allergic symptoms and urticaria.Apparently from what the specialist has told me  in the most simple form is that my body is having an allergic reaction sort of within its own self nothing in specific causes it but if i could find out anything i am the slightest bit allergic go and avoid those things it could help. My family doctor had suggested the blood tests done by a Naturopathic doctor but then I read into the cost and thought I should get some opinions on how accurate it is before spending this money. But then on my last visit to the specialist he referred me to the allergist  now I am unsure if he will do any of the blood tests on me and if it will be covered or not but its worth a shot! At the end of the day even if i knew some things that I have a minor allergy to I will still have to take allergy medication daily and carry an epipen around with me..  ,FoodAllergies,cmh1nbn,1,t5_2uo1i
4113531,0,t3_37r5of,They didnt have an option?  I would first suggest a new allergist that can test for those things.  Second avoid those foods until you can find an allergist that can do a food challenge.  Its set up for you to test eating those foods in a safe environment that is ready in case you have an allergic reaction.,FoodAllergies,crp626h,3,t5_2uo1i

10876234,0,t3_5vcz8x,I have about  allergies and intolerances. As others have said check with an allergist. Also keep a detailed food journal and take pics of the bumps and any other physical changes. Also note how long onset happened when she has a bath soaps etc. The more details youre able to provide the easier it will be in the long run. Also she could have a corn issue which means pesticides etc can be a problem. I truly wish you all the best in figuring this out. And I applaud you SO much for being so on top of this. She has an awesome parent and advocate in you.   ,FoodAllergies,de1t12y,1,t5_2uo1i
