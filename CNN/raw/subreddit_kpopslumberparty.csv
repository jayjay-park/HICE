2496690,0,t3_2o7dbs,I loved it and Ive been craving a more MAMA style comeback for awhile now. I am however like others here concerned about what the marbles in the maze mean... My thoughts A symbol of EXO continuing on as  A symbol for Kris and Luhan getting lost  Kris and Luhan returning Two new additions to EXOThe first two are way more likely and to be honest... I dont like it. Luhan and Kris leaving is such a sensitive topic for the fandom it seems cheap to include it in their next comeback. With EXO the number  is so incredibly important... this scene they included is completely intentional.I think the likelihood of Luhan and Kris returning is slim to none but if it means two new members I wont be that upset. I know itll cause issues much like it did with Suju but Id welcome anyone in with open arms. But yeah ugh... the last idea I had was SM included it just to stir the pot and get people talking. Ill be very upset with SM if that is the case. Im already upset that this comeback seems to be much too soon since they completed TLP. If EXO doesnt get a holiday break Im deeply considering not supporting this comeback. ,kpopslumberparty,cmkgevy,3,t5_2z041
2497321,0,t3_2o7dbs,Its probably shade to Kris and Lu Han not making it out of the Overdose maze. I really hope its not two new members because itd be super unfair to them. Even if theyre better than the former two a la like Yoohwan and Taeha were for Speed... its still unfair to the hypothetical new guys as theyll always see fans who want Kris and Lu Han back.  So... hopefully not that and its just super cheap shade from SM. lol. ,kpopslumberparty,cmkjdt8,2,t5_2z041

3559105,0,t1_cpxqrqg,gt  Okay side note but as someone who before would pretty much strictly listen to the Korean versions can I just say that the Chinese versions of this album are soooo good...Hurt sounds so much better in Chinese seriously listen to it if you havent. Before I always felt like the Chinese versions were missing some backing vocals or something the songs never felt full if you get what Im saying....For me it has been exactly the other way round. I always liked the EXOM versions better but now that theyve lost their second best vocalist and two native speakers! I find the Chinese versions are sort of lacking. Luhans departure has left a large gap. Transformer is the only song on the album where I clearly prefer the Chinese version mainly because I prefer Taos rap in it.,kpopslumberparty,cpxyobn,3,t5_2z041

You know how when youre in high school you think well when I get to college then my life will really start well sometime in college most people realize thats not how the world works and that if they want to truly live their life they have to do it on their own in the now. I had that moment too but then I moved to Seoul. And then my life truly started. Thanks to SHINee and my undying love for them and their influence I have improved myself and my life so much. I am a better me because of them. I think that is why I love them as much as I do. And beyond the SHINee aspect living in Seoul is just da bomb on its own. Youre never bored. The city is super safe and super cheap. I go and buy a liter of alcohol plus some mixers for about  bucks at the local convenience store then walk down to the Han river at night and get fucking smashed and walk home without ever once being harassed. Literally the most interaction I get is when I get so drunk that I start blasting and singing SHINee songs on the river.

10637806,0,t1_ddcvq8i,Do not do this. Imo getting invested in one group only is like eating only one type of pizza. Listen to everything that grabs your attention. Like the pizza your favorite will find you not the other way around. Oh and try and listen to boy and girl group youll be surprised how much there is to find. If you have any other questions feel free to message me have a nice day!,kpopslumberparty,ddd7i6h,4,t5_2z041

Boys With Fun  BTS | the dance is really fun and the lyrics are hilarious and shows each of the members personalities plus the song is also really catchy wasseo wasseo Okey Dokey  Mino and Zico | while it technically has an MV now it didnt when it first came out on show me the money. The songs a bop and has one of the most iconic English phrases ever in a Kpop song I want some cheesecake like same dude same. Transformer  EXO | its just such a different sounding song like right from the getgo youre already confused. Why are their drums? Are we going into war? What are these creepy ass horns? I dont know but I love it. Plus Chanyeols you slow down then you speed up line had me crying the first time I heard it I dont know why but I found it so funny its honestly the best part of the song.tldr  Id show people songs with iconic English phrases that they can randomly quote in a week and be like why did I say that,kpopslumberparty,ddsmuuv,3,t5_2z041

11577756,0,t3_658t3l,Was bored at home and wanted to make a quick collage of SM groups fandom names and colors mostly as a result of learning Red Velvet finally got their fandom name.NCT is not included because neither their fandom name nor color have been confirmed yet. Their fans have been given green glow sticks at music shows so that can be considered unofficial for now.,kpopslumberparty,dg8cfbh,5,t5_2z041

11796625,0,t1_dgx4lcd,Chris guy with the long hair is super talented with pretty much any instrument. We sat down and discussed the mashup while he played guitar and we had the general layout done in about an hour. Chris recorded and put the instrumental together after but Im not sure how long that took lol Glad you liked the camera angles! Chris wife was kind enough to film the video and I edited the MV  ,kpopslumberparty,dgx6rko,2,t5_2z041
