6255216,0,t3_3zax93,The Ilwrath and Thraddashs fate being able to build Yehat or Pkunk ships toning down the flagship in exchange for ship upgrades enemies could have them too for more varied encounters more starbases branching story some rebalanced ships ala Shivers mod perhaps allied colonies actually meeting the Chenjesu and Mmrnmhrm before they are the Chmmr... i would like a lot of things but this game is still nearly perfect.  I kind of hope that the new Star Control goes all out with new features while keeping the core game intact.,starcontrol,cz0nelp,2,t5_2tml9
