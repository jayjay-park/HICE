I participated in one at the end of last year and really wanted to do it again. Right now Im training for a k race in March. I am toying with the idea of joining the  marathon training in March for a race in May. Well see how these next couple of races go tho.It is definitely motivating to run with a group  and our coaches are awesome!,TeamNoisemakers,czmkjz7,2,t5_3bqvt

Well this week I kept close track of how much time I was doing of each instead of total time and it was the first time Ive spent more than half the time jogging!  Its not much but its a baby step Im proud of!Also Ive had four different people comment on my weight loss in the last two days.  That always feels good!,TeamNoisemakers,d07hjif,2,t5_3bqvt

You calorie count so you can look HAWT for those trips you dont. Yes youll feel like poopoo but since youll expect it it wont be a huge surprise and you can get right back on that horse.Keep the drinks low carb if you can and itll help! There was some sort of drinking app floating around here something like Get Drunk Not Fat? I think might wanna check it out.,TeamNoisemakers,d0elhoc,6,t5_3bqvt
