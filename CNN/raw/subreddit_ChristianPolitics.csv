Further theres a little thing called freedom of conscience and this flies in the face of it. Also traditionally in Canada individual MPs have been free to vote on bills regarding moral issues either by their own conscience or how their constituents want them to vote not by the party line.Btw are you a Christian? ,ChristianPolitics,chrygna,0,t5_31env
