I didnt take astronomy so I cant help you there.  The hint lets you know hes not from the same time period though.  Its kind of letting you know that this guy has the same goal but its inclusion in the riddle is just as important as the hint itself.  They wouldnt say it if he was actually a brethren from the same time frame.gtSurely it presents itself to you as well bound in sky blue.Its a sky blue bookgtConsider also of Thales his most renowned and well known achievement in this find your answer as to where you must search.Makes me lean towards geometry scientific method and mathematics in regards to astronomy without use of mythologyAlso if a bunch of people are doing this riddle keep in mind you might not have found it because someone else already did.,riddles,cfk3bt4,5,t5_2qiux

2689295,0,t1_cn9iz5e,The riddle should have been answered with Of the three Tom is the best and Math is not for everyone... But here you go. The teacher says Of the three Tom is the best.  Tom won the first two games. There is no need for a third game as tom has already won the  of out of three. To the riddle your favorite knows who your favorite is the teacher replies Wow your riddles are getting easier! This is a difficult riddle The best answer is Tom as he was able to go last but you could make cases for Ron and Kimas is the case with  you can make a case for every number. This part was just a warning. This riddle  to  is easy in the sense you can get the correct answer but its difficult in the sense you cant get my answer. That is true because there are so many possible answers. And instead of going for the obvious there it goes again one you guys create amazing answers.  To show the teacher an easy riddle Ron shows off at the expense of Kim. After Ron has insulted Kim she says Im not stupid. Math is not for everyone you know this means everyone is bad at math Ron tells Kim to pick an incorrect number. But what Kim is also saying is if Im stupid you are stupid as we are both bad at math. But Im not stupid because you will never admit to being stupid. If you did that that was be stupid.. This is why Ron pretends to be good at math he tells Kim she should have picked a different number as if he knows what number she should have picked.sp,riddles,cn9lzmq,1,t5_2qiux

3001521,0,t1_co8qjdz,Im actually very slow with riddles compared to some of the others who post here but I tend to do best on riddles that require analysis in addition to lateral thinking.  My approach to any riddle roughly follows this pattern Define the problem Identify and categorize assumptions Determine and implement approaches to solving the problem Review solutionsDefining the problem means that I readreread the riddle until I have a clear understanding of the riddle details.  Details like what Im solving for what facts are given what the nature of the answer should be and what special conditions there may be.  Its fact gathering basically as well as making sure I understand the riddle correctly.During assumption analysis I consciously analyze what assumptions I made while I was defining the problem.  Some assumptions are stronger than others inferences for example.  You dont want to base your entire answer on a weak assumption.  However its worth investigating weak assumptions sometimes because they can lead you to better assumptions later.  The most important thing here is to recognize when youre assuming something and recognize how strongweak that assumption is before you start making conclusions based on it.At this point Im ready to start solving the riddle.  Knowing the problem definition and my assumptions I start trying to clarify my assumptions that seem to be the most valuable.  This takes a lot of different forms from logical analysis to googling to talking to friends or whatnot.  Different riddles require different approaches.  By defining the problem and your assumptions usually you can come up with a few plans of attack.  Something like If I take this as my key assumption how can I prove that it fits this riddle and leads me to answer ltxgt?  And you proceed to analyze the facts you gathered from the riddle to get your answer.  The important thing here is resilience.  Your first plan of attack might not succeed but it will hopefully point you further toward the correct answer.  Keep hammering the answer until it fits perfectly.  This is also where previous puzzlesolving experience will help because youll be able to recognize common puzzle types and solve for them faster.Once you have something that looks like it could be a viable solution always sanity check yourself.  Reread the problem with your solution in mind and make sure it fits like you think it does.  Sometimes while youre stuck looking at the trees trying to solve the riddle youll find yourself leaving the forest to find an answer.  For this riddle I recognized that my initial solution was weak but I didnt have any other directions to go at the time so I appealed for a hintsomething that would lead me back into the forest.My best overall piece of advice with any puzzle is to just stay organized.  Best of luck!,riddles,co93t6g,1,t5_2qiux

In order to ensure that he doesnt gain or lose any money we would need to either not bid at all or bid in such a way that we ensure that the exact amount of money invested comes back as profit.Assumption  The only way to  ensure a payout occurs is to have a bid on every slot for if you didnt there would be a chance of hitting an empty slot and receiving nothing. Therefore if any money is bid some has to be bid in every slot.Let the total money invested in all slots be TLet the money invested in each x slot be aT  aWhich demonstrates that if you invest an amount in a x slot and win it will double the amount and win you your total money invested back.Since there are  x slots..T  a  xWhere x is the total money invested in other slots. If a is positive so must be x Assumption Therefore a  a  xThe only solution to this equation is if both a and x are zero.
