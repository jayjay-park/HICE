Here we investigate the Atlantic overturning circulation at the Last Glacial Maximum and its impact on respired carbon storage using radiocarbon and stable carbon isotope data from the Brazil and Iberian Margins. The data demonstrate the existence of a shallow wellventilated northernsourced cell overlying a poorly ventilated predominantly southernsourced cell at the Last Glacial Maximum. We also find that organic carbon remineralization rates in the deep Atlantic remained broadly similar to modern but that ventilation ages in the southernsourced overturning cell were significantly increased. Respired carbon storage in the deep Atlantic was therefore enhanced during the last glacial period primarily due to an increase in the residence time of carbon in the deep ocean rather than an increase in biological carbon export.Study open access North Atlantic Deep Water Production during the Last Glacial MaximumgtAbstractgtChanges in deep ocean ventilation are commonly invoked as the primary cause of lower glacial atmospheric CO. The water mass structure of the glacial deep Atlantic Ocean and the mechanism by which it may have sequestered carbon remain elusive. Here we present neodymium isotope measurements from cores throughout the Atlantic that reveal glacialinterglacial changes in water mass distributions. These results demonstrate the sustained production of North Atlantic Deep Water under glacial conditions indicating that southernsourced waters were not as spatially extensive during the Last Glacial Maximum as previously believed. We demonstrate that the depleted glacial C values in the deep Atlantic Ocean cannot be explained solely by water mass source changes. A greater amount of respired carbon therefore must have been stored in the abyssal Atlantic during the Last Glacial Maximum. We infer that this was achieved by a sluggish deep overturning cell comprised of wellmixed northern and southernsourced waters.,GlobalClimateChange,d4s2hbz,1,t5_32nqw

9077208,0,t3_54lx1j,Study Evolution of global temperature over the past two million yearsAbstractReconstructions of Earths past climate strongly influence our understanding of the dynamics and sensitivity of the climate system. Yet global temperature has been reconstructed for only a few isolated windows of time and continuous reconstructions across glacial cycles remain elusive. Here I present a spatially weighted proxy reconstruction of global temperature over the past  million years estimated from a multiproxy database of over  sea surface temperature point reconstructions. Global temperature gradually cooled until roughly . million years ago and cooling then stalled until the present. The cooling trend probably stalled before the beginning of the midPleistocene transition and predated the increase in the maximum size of ice sheets around . million years ago. Thus global cooling may have been a precondition for but probably is not the sole causal mechanism of the shift to quasiyear glacial cycles at the midPleistocene transition. Over the past  years polar amplification the amplification of temperature change at the poles relative to global temperature change has been stable over time and global temperature and atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations have been closely coupled across glacial cycles. A comparison of the new temperature reconstruction with radiative forcing from greenhouse gases estimates an Earth system sensitivity of  degrees Celsius range  to  degrees Celsius  per cent credible interval change in global average surface temperature per doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide over millennium timescales. This result suggests that stabilization at todays greenhouse gas levels may already commit Earth to an eventual total warming of  degrees Celsius range  to  degrees Celsius  per cent credible interval over the next few millennia as ice sheets vegetation and atmospheric dust continue to respond to global warming.Related Materials Article Why correlations of CO and Temperature over ice age cycles dont define climate sensitivity Study Paleoclimate Implications for HumanMade Climate Change pdf,GlobalClimateChange,d82xlst,1,t5_32nqw
11774386,0,t3_67xawa,Is it really though? The biggest polluters are also the wealthiest no matter the price they can afford their carbon credits. Its the littleguy who wont be able to run a business with these carbon credits the kind of businesses who contribute the least emissions.This model seems flawed to me. It stifles smaller companies under the guise of reducing pollution but it wont do anything to stop the big polluters.,GlobalClimateChange,dguntin,1,t5_32nqw
