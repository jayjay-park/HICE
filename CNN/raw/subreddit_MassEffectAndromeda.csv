Really hoping the modding community will fix the cross eyed muppet look every character has. I dont know if its bad animators or mayhap graphics are just at a point that if they dont stylize the graphics a bit everyone looks horribly uncanny valley.

11239785,0,t1_df5tv0l,I slogged through ALL of Inquisition...in the vain hope that it would get better but the only memorable things were the few hours of main campaign and even that had only  mission that wasnt go here kill this and some of the companion quests like Dorians. The DLC The Descent was also pretty excellent. I remember some vistas some investigating in DLCs but that was it. And for that I invested  hours of nonsense. Boiled down maybe  hours if at all were even remotely enjoyable. I fear that MEA will be similar. I hear them talking about how the game takes  hours to complete but then I look at the quest list and see only  main quests...and Ive already completed  almost. Then there will be around  or  companion quests but as far as Ive heard movie night is part of that per companion. And the rest is filler content. Guess well know more when reviews come out.

11322850,0,t3_61lfiq,Id suggest to spec for vanguard because it gives benefits for going both weapons amp biotics. But instead of spreading your points out specialize in one skill of combat and biotics as much possible before moving on. Put points in a weapon when you know thats the class you prefer after trying the weapons out.  For example In combat put some points in either the passive skill that boosts your combat effectiveness and in biotics put some points in one power until you max that out.   Oh and sidewinder pistol is practically a spamable sniper without the penalty of low fire rate. ,MassEffectAndromeda,dfffcu7,1,t5_38p25

They NEEDED settlements and a CO essentially saying to jump off a cliff... i agree maybe killing was too far.. but then there is the whole we werent therePLUSI was trying not to add to schism the difference between Nexus and Outcasts was the fight for resource distribution. That all happened in desperation and now that my Pathfinder ass has been colonizing all those issues should be resolved and all of us reunite to one group. That is why everyone joined in the first place right?

Some are saying the review is shallow but please elaborate why you feel that way... just calling it shallow and then leaving is well... shallow.  I feel like he did the game justice and it wasnt all pros or cons by any means.Personally I was pretty annoyed that a lot of the wildlife seem to be copypasted from planet to planet I mean same wildlife on a desert planet an ice planet and a rain forest planet come on....  Also I really dislike how similar all of the little remnant and kett outpost are on each planet.  Like I feel like I keep running into the exact same scenario  kett camp or remnant structure guarded by  remnants and nothing more to do than find a container or two even on different planets.  Some of the bigger kett facilities feel unique and same goes for the larger remnant structures but the small stuff used to populate the map just seems shallow imo.Very repetitive if you ask me.   ,MassEffectAndromeda,dfnllzw,3,t5_38p25

11422168,0,t1_dfql6m0,It just feels more fluid and responsive. Its a preference like with most things I guess. I do not feel I can just jump around on hardcore though. I have to evade out of line of sight to be save. I still use cover most of the time and just dash around when I need to which feels great. Sometimes jumping in the air when the enemy is too reluctant to show then quickly dash back into cover. Imo it feels great just depends on your playstyle.  But I also play an infiltrator. Agreed on the powers. You have profiles but I see no use for them until I fully max out my main one. What I also like is that combat is faster because I spend less time slowing down time to get my powers of effectively. As I play now I stealth in get a good shot off then do my tech power combo and shoot a few more times until stealth is ready to reposition. Its fits my playstyle of safety and strong ambush really well and looks pretty badass Ghost in the shell fan Of course there is no best does not matter how good other people enjoy something if its not fun for you. ,MassEffectAndromeda,dfqow65,1,t5_38p25

I was extracting on Silver with my lvl  human soldier at around . Which was nice for gearing up. But I got a Thokin from my loyalty packs which pairs beautifully with Turbocharge.

I get that the game sets sort of a light hearted tone at times but even in serious moments Ryder seems to fucking chuckle or shrug off serious decisions.I dont understand hisher personality.The game tailors Ryders dialogue to the convo choices you make.  If youre Ryder isnt very serious youre probably picking the Casual personality choices a lot which are the jokingnot serious comments.  So your characters personality follows that theme.  If you want a more serious PC try picking the more serious Rational or Professional choices the right side of the dialogue wheel.gt Peebee girl suck.  Whats wrong with Peebee?  I think shes great definitely one of the most popular characters here.gtWhy cant you solve this retarded problem yourself and come back to me when you have something serious interesting and new for me to take care of instead of a slight variation of the same task Ive already done  times.Because theyre not the Pathfinder you are?

It had the  point in throw annihilation and lance and I had to level up for more. The only way to get more skill points is by leveling up with character cards. The only thing at all that the prestige did was give me a slightly higher APEX rating searched around and it looks like only  APEX points.

11646648,0,t3_6666dk,Architects are my biggest beef in the game. Incoming mild MEA spoilersIve always been a sucker for a good boss fight so when I first fought an Architect on Voeld I thought it was awesome. Fuck yeah I thought I bet each a planet has a different remnant architect boss to fight. But no its the exact same boss fight on Eos and Kadara and Elaaden. And if that wasnt bad enough they repurposed the motherfucker for the final boss!

11649748,0,t1_dggdzdm,Youre right my math was wrong. Viability was only increased to  for the most successful gene therapy. I thought it was increased by .From Andromeda wiki Nexus The flagship ark and base of operations for the Andromeda Initiative. Carries members of multiple species including about krogan. I drastically over estimated the number of Krogan that made the journey. It looks even worse than before. Thousands as you put it is flatly wrong.From wiki pre genophage numbers Females are known to produce clutches of up to  fertilized eggs over the course of a year. Post genophage is  in  eggs being viable. So  offspring per year was expected when departing. They kinda put all their eggs in one basket banking on untested gene therapy.Continued In present conditions according toEDI the odds of a krogan successfully giving birth to two females stand at  in . Now the boost in viability is hamstrung by the genophage disproportionately impacting female birth rates.I actually wasnt aware of the  in  chance of female birth. Its also said in the wiki that the vast majority of the  came from one clan. So there werent multiple female clans comprising that population. That means theres no way it was a  split of males to females that made the journey. It also makes risking females sound even more absurd. Then theres still the fact that Krogan make up a large portion of the Outlaw faction. That just doesnt make since. Your apex teams alone put noticeable dents in the Krogan population. So now with the new numbers maybe a female could successfully raise  to  off spring per year but only . females would be born per year high end estimate. This leaves us with the same problem we had when they left the milky way. Life span doesnt mean anything when Krogan rarely die of natural causes. With the significantly smaller number of Krogan that made the journey putting them in one of the major combatant factions stands out as an even bigger issue.Honestly I would have bought it more if the Krogan that came were a collection of individuals that had accepted their fate but wanted to go out on an adventure rather than watch their extinction play out in the milky way. SAM could have conducted gene therapy experiments in secret during the journey. This raises conflict in the story about the morality that a learning AI saw by performing genetic experiments without consent. This explains the dangerously low Krogan population that made the trip and can be a turning point for SAM.  Krogan could not have been expected to survive and restart their civilization banking on an unproven gene therapy.Ive given you multiple examples of why its weak writing to pretend they would expect to make a new home in Andromeda. You cherry picked aspects of the lore while ignoring the clear conflict that your own sources provide. If you like the writing thats fine. Most have complained about much of the storywriting and theres reason for that criticism. For you to come out saying the writing fits perfectly into lore comes across as fanboy type praise to me. Out of curiosity what is your overall rating of the game? On its own I enjoy it but it definitely falls short of my expectations. It especially falls short if compared to the original trilogy. ,MassEffectAndromeda,dggih7n,1,t5_38p25

Why go somewhere just to turn right back around?  I know I would be disappointed to go back to the Milky Way.  MEA only covers one cluster of the system that is supposedly on the outer fringes of the galaxy.  There is still a lot that hasnt been touched on and they left A LOT of room for improvement.  With only reading the synopsis how do you know that the reapers did not have an affect on the Andromeda Initiative?

Having completed the game I can recall four whole reminders that hes the overwhelming love of my life.  theres a scavenger in Paradise to which you can mention a sort of I know Reyes real good wink.  Lexi mentions his name once. Very vaguely and in the slightest of passing.  He winks at you after you win the boss fight. Winks. Just a wink. As he walks away. You save the cluster and he winks at you.  End game he invites you to meet him in a storage closet. Seriously. Not that this happens because your only conversational choices are to rebuke him or gently rebuke him. Committing to him doesnt even change his dialogue when you talk to him on Kadara. I too loaded and reloaded old saves several times before deciding to love not love love him. It really is a shame since to me he is delightfully fun and a good mix of taking his job seriously but not himself. Not to mention that voice...,MassEffectAndromeda,dgt0ncn,5,t5_38p25
