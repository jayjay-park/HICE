7165247,0,t3_4dle45,My son likes to loudly discuss science when we are out and about. Strangers are really bad an eavesdropping so I get all kinds of reactions from people. I love it when they talk to me and my son! He often feels like he is the odd man out because most kids his age dont have his interests or knowledge. Meeting other science geeks in the wild makes him feel more normal. Plus it makes me feel good too! I put work into being a Science Mom a lot of work and it is nice to see that recognized. ,ScienceParents,d1smc4o,1,t5_2wj8p
