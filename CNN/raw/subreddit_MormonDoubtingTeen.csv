2305911,0,t3_2f7fan,Enjoyed your post.  Obviously someone considers you an adult already to ask you to be the baptiser! A lot of us were once TBM  and we survived the rocky exit from Mormonism.Sometimes when making a change it is best to do a  degree flip and that shocks people enough to give you a chance to escape.Another way is to just not show up for meetings.Another way is to not pay tything not accept an assignment doze through the meetings you go to late.Another way is to stop reading any scriptures except the Bible if you are religious and want to continue hanging onto Christ as your Saviour.  Just tell the inquiring minds who want to know what you are up to I am just going to focus on the Bible for awhile.Another way is to go talk to a protestant minister.  Any protestant minister.  They are ALL concerned about the lies in Mormondom.  The nice thing about that is you can shop until you find a minister you can relate to.  They all have something to offer...but you dont necessarily click with all of them.  Pick and chose new concept for exiting Mormons!The horror of Mormonism is there is no middle ground.  How can there be?  They are the ONLY true church on the face of the earth.  WOW.One nice thing so many people are exiting Mormonism that middle ground is beginning to be on the drawing board. Well it can never ever be middle ground if they are insisting they are the one and only.  Feel free to follow my blog which has a lot of exMormon stuff in it but is a blog by a granny.   unearthlylanding.blogspot.comBut here is a post on it I think might appeal to a teenager as yourself.    ,MormonDoubtingTeen,clwq6tj,1,t5_2v8kf
