I am having the basement waterproofed which turns what is basically like a garage space into more of a rec room workshop space which adds another  sq ft of usable space to the house..and the new porch will be  x  which adds another  sq ft.  the new porch will be a basic  season porch not insulated but with storm windows so it wont have snow inside.  Basically i think spending a extra money on the porch and basement are well worth it. It doubles the living space without adding to the space i have to heat.  ,SmallHome,cjdq68c,2,t5_2xfkt

However the horrified response of but how would I keep that clean??? seems to get the message across  Seriously why are you letting them weigh in if they cant be constructive? If they ask about househunting deflect by saying I looked at X houses last week and none of them were right or share some funny story about a strange house trust me there are some doozies in any market. If they suggest palatial estates just say thanks! Ill consider it. Another good strategy is all this househunting is stressful lets just enjoy this awesome winefriends bdayetc tonight. Basically the message is that your circle is welcome to support you emotionally thru this househunting is a pretty emotional process but the decision is yours alone. When you solicit their opinion on specific houses it sends the message that they have a role in the decision as well.,SmallHome,d7362j3,2,t5_2xfkt
