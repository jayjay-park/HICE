1514180,0,t3_2bi10b,If youre going to play factions the fastest way to make money is to mine.  The easiest way to make money is to create a huge cactus farm.  The difference is that you can afk a cactus farm. Your goal is to get creeper spawners. They will be your source of tnt as well as your money makers.  You might consider using the WoodyCraft teamspeak to talk to your friends. Its free and it will let you meet other players if you like.  Be advised factions players and liars and cheats. Some will pretend to be your friend for weeks only to get into your base and betray you.  On the other hand you can do that to them or actually be a true friend and join forces.,woodycraft,cj62uwt,5,t5_2xxic

Either way its only a small inconvenience that is greatly overshadowed by the like you said works of art. Thanks for allowing us to have free entertainment both on Woodycraft and PKA. Ps. Im sure Jackie is  on board with that trip to the Gaza Strip ,woodycraft,cj8mrhi,2,t5_2xxic
