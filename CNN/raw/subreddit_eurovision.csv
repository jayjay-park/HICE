The Asiavision could work because Asia is a clusterfuck of a heap of counties all together and there is a heap of tension between each one. It could be a nice way to bridge the gap between the countries through song rather than blood. Although Asian pop music is extremely artificial so they could make a very plastic version of eurovision and make it work.

But on the other hand as the mouseover text over the downvote button on CMV primes downvotes dont change views. If anything they might spur the person to say something like downvotes? Clearly you guys dont see the value of my statements or something of that calibre.I think that responding to such a statement neednt constitute a warning though. For example what if particularly uncivil comments got a request to be more civil? Something like We noticed your comment may be impolite or unfriendly. Its okay to get frustrated but we would like to ask that you avoid personal attacks in future in order to promote an environment where differing opinions are welcome for discussion.

9761000,0,t3_5ew4d1,As a Swede here is my take on this lineup or rather the artists Im familiar with. The Fooo Conspiracy Their song Build a Girl is huge in Sweden. Total pop hit and I like it. If they can whip up something similar they should do well. They opened for Justin Bieber once. Lisa Ajax She competed this year with a popular song so maybe shell do one better next year? Robin Bengtsson He was my favorite this year with Constellation Prize. Absolutely love that song and am looking forward to seeing him try again. Ace Wilder She has competed twice reached the final twice and came in second place first time asking. Strong contender. Boris Rene Exfootballer who competed this year. Reached the final via Second Chance. Could do well again. Wiktoria Competed this year. Was manys favorite to win. Mariette Came third in  and many people considered her robbed at the time. De Vet Du This group is massive among the Swedish youth. Everything they release gets attention. Them being at MelFest is big. Theyll probably get a lot of votes from fans regardless of their song. Jon Fjllgren Henrik Yes! Swedens favorite sami. A Columbian aised among the Swedish natives in the north herding reindeer and singing their native music. His style is very spiritual and he completely enamored the Swedish public when he competed in . He came in second beaten by Mns Zelmerlw the year he won it all. Charlotte Perrelli Quite tired of her tbh. Totally robbed Sanna Nielsens Empty Room in . Shes already won twice. If she can bring Sweden to another Eurovision victory then great but otherwise leave the spotlight for someone else. ,eurovision,dag9eqb,1,t5_2rsu8

I am not Native however one of my best friends is who is a eurofan and she is pretty pissed at Kerli using what is consider sacred spirit animals and totems in a europop song.

If it wasnt Loreen singing that song but a new upcoming artist that no one has heard of before would you still thing this is the greatest thing ever created in the Earths history? For a musical competition this wasnt the good choice. Its honestly a great artistic performance. It can really be moving but to me this is the kind of things that is crafted for an interval act not being part of a competition in which you have to make a striking impact directly to the viewer.Im really pleased that we got to see this as Loreen is perhaps the artist most sincere with the message of the song but honestly it just couldnt have been competitive.
