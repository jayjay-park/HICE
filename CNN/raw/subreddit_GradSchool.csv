52498,0,t3_1ulghy,Ill just tell you my experience. I had never lived very far from home until i went to grad school. I realized very quickly that my university had zero interest in grad students living in student housing. This isnt uncommon for a grad school not to have housing for its students. technically you are adults and very different from undergrads at this point. I went with a local apartment locator that I found online. They had a small fee but it was well worth it. I ended up moving again and I didnt use them and I wish I had. My last apartment was way better than the current one. As for cooking I always did a little bit of that so it wasnt so hard. You are going to be living off of basically a minimum wage salary so Eating out wont be an option every night. You will figure out what works with you so just be patient. Friends seems to be the hardest part. For some reason in my program the classmates are very competitive and I havent gotten the feeling that we are really friends at all just classmates. I tend to hangout with my neighbors more and people I meet around town. Its really tough graduating undergrad and moving into more adult life. I went through almost  months of complete confusion and disorentation before I began to get my shit together. Luckily I was not in school at that time. Good luck! ,GradSchool,cekeo02,1,t5_2r4r8

176125,0,t3_1w2g6a,I will respond only because no one else has yet.  I work for the Federal Govt in Ed Adm.  We get a lot of x teachers in our ranks.  Your ABD status is certainly helpful.  Getting your PhD is a little better.  Is it in Education?  I enjoy the work a lot.  Many people dont though too.  I think administration is more focused on experience but I dont see why you couldnt consider exploring administration.  I find that an MA or PhD has its own value that presents itself when applying for new jobs.  Once people get to know you promotions are based on your performance and people skills.  Ive worked with at least one PhD who was a complete idiot.  Most are great to work with.  A few are overbearing or constantly talking over everyones head which strangely makes them look stupid in others eyes.  Just for the love of God dont go around mentioning you have a PhD all the time.  In Administration its not coveted the same way or valued the same way.  Remember that every problem doesnt have to be solved.  Administrators are often forced to make decisions they dont agree with.  You are simply administrating not trying to support a thesis. In interviews I dont even bring up my education unless Im asked.  Most hardcore recruiters in the field only give about  weight to education.  I conduct interviews too. The most typical question I ask PhDs are Can you get along with other people?  And what are your salary expectations?.  They usually answer both questions wrong and dont get the job.   You need to overcome the stigma of having not really lived in the real world yet.  But assuming you are pretty normal and do a little research youll be fine.  And slowly as you realize most of us have a Doctorate in something youll start to fit in just fine.   DR having completed your PhD will help you a little.  But not enormously. The value of being ABD is not lost in the world of Education.  I still think you should finish it even while working.  ,GradSchool,ceyhts0,4,t5_2r4r8

The phrase negative results is commonly used to describe for example an experiment that concludes Treatment A failed to have any effect in the patient group. This can obviously be just as important as Treatment A had X effect.The argument in favor of publishing negative results is that it may curtail the falsification of dataresults.Its a very popular topic in the clinical world.

913841,0,t3_24kajd,HiIve just completed my first year at a top PhD program in the history of art. Going from a BFA to art history proper is a bit of a leap but it can be done. Your GRE is the least of your worries GRE and GPA do not carry much weight. Abysmal scores may get you eliminated early on but top scores arent enough to get you in.Getting in touch with a faculty member goes both ways. I only had brief contacts with a couple of faculty members where I am now but I was admitted to another top program with no prior contact. On the other hand a program where I had established very good communications with faculty ended up turning into a waitlist that didnt convert into an admission. As I said it is not something you should bank upon.Frankly Id ask you why you want to pursue art history. Its a good idea to pursue an MA first. Anecdotally I will say that my observation has been that humanities programs PhD seem to prefer admitting people with an MA in hand of late. In my cohort the overwhelming majority came in with MAs myself included. There are some programs that can offer funding. Check out the Grad Cafe websites art history forumthere will be useful material.You should definitely begin thinking about what field you wish to specialize in your proposed future research and most of allyour writing sample.

933385,0,t1_chachy3,I second this idea. This would demonstrate to your prospective new advisor that you are able to generate ideas in the field and it would have the added bonus of giving you a start on a grant proposal. I have seen more than one student in my program just quit their initial Ph.D. lab and move. Its happened late in the second year of their program so their first year in the lab. gtShould I just hope someone here picks me up?No you should be proactive about this. Its up to you to demonstrate to the departmentprogram that you need to remain with them.gtShould I start emailing professors to make appointments?Yes. I made appointments with three PIs outside of my advisor to discuss postdoc options. All three were more than happy to help me out despite the fact that there was no clear benefit to them.gtIs there an appropriate amount of time to wait after hearing the news before I approach others asking if they have a spot for me in their lab?I would say approximately  second. That may sound harsh but consider the fact that your advisor has pretty much already made their decision. It would look worse for you to sit back and wait to get started on this. You want to come across as selfmotivated and able to independently think about your future.,GradSchool,chadpop,3,t5_2r4r8

Let your advisor decide whether going between two projects is feasible for her. One compromise that I can think of right off the bat is waiting until youre done with the st project to start on the nd if thats possible.Im in a completely different field but my department expects students to be working on  different research projects at a given moment.

1130936,0,t1_chwq7lb,Im glad to hear that the proper filling out of applications isnt whats holding you back!No need to apologize for the grammatical errors  they are truly minor and dont impede understanding which in my opinion is all that should matter in an informal forum such as this one. Is there a writing center of some sort available to you? When it comes to a personal statement it can be good to get feedback regarding content from various colleagues i.e. people in your field. However when it comes to mechanics spelling grammar phrasing your best bet is to seek help from someone who is trained and paid! to assist with that sort of thing.When it comes to reaching out to former advisors Its probably inappropriate to outright ask former advisors to contact their colleagues on your behalf. What you can do however is set up a meeting with them for the purpose of discussing your Ph.D. plans i.e. to discuss your research interestslongerterm goals and to discuss which programs would be most appropriate for you to apply to. As you discuss various programs also ask whether there are any labs that might be a particularly good fit. This is where you hope that the former advisor will volunteer to contact the PI on your behalf. You can also ask whether your former advisor would recommend that you try sending the PI an email yourself. In that case youd be able to say in your email Dr. Bigname suggested I get in touch with you. If you namedrop someone they know and respect theyre less likely to ignore your email and later your application. I should note that while contacting potential advisors is acceptable in my field this may not be the case in your field. This is another reason why its worth getting your former advisors advice in this regard.,GradSchool,chwu8yu,2,t5_2r4r8
1158758,0,t1_chzxj52,Haha well Im not sure my tips are all that wise. They all seem like commonsense to me. If youve been as frantically searching the internet as I was last year youll know all this stuff already so feel free to skimWhen one of your numerical stats is low i.e. GPA or test scores you run a big risk of having your application tossed out without being read. A school isnt trying to be mean or unfair when they do thisthey just have so many applications to read that they do everything they can to trim that pile quickly into something manageable for the admissions committee. Theres usually a reason a student has a low GPA or low test scores and that reason will usually persist in grad school and hurt their performance there so schools are not actually losing much when they toss those applicationschances are if they read them in full they would find other signs that confirm that those students would not be as successful in the program as students with better stats.Every once in a while a student has some extenuating circumstance that hurts their GPA or test scores death in the family illness really bad at standardized testing etc. so if you have a deficiency then you need to make all other aspects of your application as AWESOME as possible to drive home the point that your one bad stat is not an omen that youll fail grad school. This is why I suggest retaking the GRE if you have the time and moneyif you improve your score a bit youll take pressure off the need for awesomeness in your other application materials.I had a poor GPA that did get a bit better in junior and senior years. I also had a very poor subjectGRE score. My goals in the rest of my application were thus to show my improvement and show how my poor scores are just a byproduct of my awesome nonmultiplechoice skills. So here is what I did For my recommendation letter writers I chose people that I knew had seen my performance improve. I didnt score awesome in all their classes but with each of them I had had good oneonone conversations during juniorsenior years and from their feedback there and on assignments I knew they could tell that Id really improved my study habits enthusiasm and absorption of material. I addressed my poor stats in my statement of purpose some schools called it statement of interest or research goals statement by being positive and not making excuses. That means instead of saying My GRE scores are not the best but that is because... I gave just the explanation Undergrad School emphasizes welldocumented problemsolving ... epitomized by specific example...  To address my poor GPA I had half a sentence that mentioned my poor performance in early college keep it mild finding this passion drove away the distractions that had plagued my early college years and . sentences that described how awesome I am now my GPA improved during my rd year and again in my th year I learned study habits that I carry with me today etc.. I read everything I could about each school I applied to and tailored my statement of purpose to reflect how my experiences in undergrad aligned my goals and attitude with those of that prospective school. This task actually wasnt so hard since my prospective schools were all pretty similarthey all emphasized research and experiencegaining and close studentprofessor relationships and werent known for being competitive. Be as specific as possibleI pointed to specific projects and challenges Id overcome during those projects. I used those same projects as examples in the previous point so it all tied together very nicely. This goes with the previous point but Have clear goals! Describe those goals as specifically as possible! I applied for an M.S. so I could get experience and focus before getting a PhD andor career in industry so I said exactly that in my statement of purpose. I did everything I could to say how that schools program specifically would help me achieve my goals most of them had one or two unique requirements or curricula.Take all this with a grain of saltstatements of purpose vary WIDELY by discipline. If Id followed the examples I saw that people wrote for med school my application would have been doomed. Its tempting to spend hours looking for examples especially early in the writing process but its best to write a few pages about yourself and your goals then find examples then whittle down your writing until the structure and content is appropriate for your field.,GradSchool,chzz7to,4,t5_2r4r8

1263528,0,t1_cibocy8,I havent had a baby but know a few people that did. Generally the experience fits into one of two categories. The first is that your department is supportive and this generally goes OK. It was a little painful for your fellow students because a lot of the support they got was in the form of easier TAlab assignments or less responsibility on shared duties all of which was really just shifted to other graduate students. Generally we didnt have much of a problem helping out but its not a big department and we were all definitely aware of what was happening. I think this is going to be an issue no matter when you decide to have your baby whether its in grad school or after you start working. As long as you have the right mindset and a good relationship with your colleagues this shouldnt be an issue at all.We work closely with a department that is generally less excited when one of their students gets pregnant. They never openly discourage it but you can definitely tell in the way they talk about it. In their minds they want their graduate students to be devoted to their research. Deciding to have a kid during one of the most stressful and busy times of your life isnt exactly a vote for determination. Some students do a great job making it work and dont miss a beat but some run into problems balancing research teaching and taking care of the baby. Its really tough to tell which of those two situations a pregnant student will fall into and if the professor has a lot riding on the students work then its understandable why they may be a little worried.,GradSchool,cibrgya,1,t5_2r4r8

From what Ive heard the real value of reputable MBAs is that the schools tend to have more industry contacts opening up the way for internships and better networking opportunities. The name will absolutely matter in any hiring process but networking is the biggest advantage. If youre going a nonstandard route for an MBA academic positions rather than ones in business and industry the reputation gap may close for this reason. The cost of your degree should matter more to you as well as in an academic environment I would imagine your salary would peak at a much lower level than MBAs working elsewhere.

Im sure there are a plethora of opportunities but youve got to find something that interests you enough to drive you.Ill be honest your transitions will make any employer nervous regardless of the sector research or business. So youve got to be able to come up with a cogent explanation of exactly why your false starts didnt work out. Further that explanation needs to put the employers mind at ease that the factors at play in previous jobs wont be an issue moving forward.It sounds like you get bored easily and need novel stimulation to keep you fulfilled and productive. If this is true you need to address it and make sure that you can find a position that will allow you to accommodate that trait. I am most certainly this way and have found research positions and fields of study that allow me to do interdisciplinary work. This is great because for each project I have to master a whole new skill set. Finally and I say this only because its worked for me you might consider looking into being tested for ADHD and exploring various treatment options.

1774601,0,t3_2es933,First of all you can ask for letters years after youve worked with someone. That said I think it would probably be better to stop by and talk to them in person if you havent worked with them in a while. A short email saying youd like a letter and asking if there is a good time to meet with them would be appropriate. Maybe offer to buy them a coffee. This way you can tell them about your plans and get valuable input and advice. It will also help them remember who you are just by seeing your face and youll wind up with better letters especially if you were a good student in their classes. You want them to remember you and what kind of a student you were so a casual encounter before they write your letters will go a long way. For which professors to ask Id focus on the ones you took the most courses with and in whose courses you did the best work. Start with professors with whom you did upper division coursework as this is what a grad school will care most about. Its probably not a good idea to email all of them at once on the off chance they all say yes. Email the two or three who you think will be able to speak most highly of your academic performance and see what they say. If they say no or ignore you move down the list.You can get a letter from an employer too but youd probably only want one such letter with the rest being from professors. Its only a good idea if the work you do for them has something to do with CS if they like you as a person and you are on good terms with them. You can ask employers to speak to certain skills that your academic letters wont mention. Your supervisor knows how hard you work and the kind of things youre really good at etc. Their title is also pretty important and again its best if youre very friendly with this person.In the end dont shoot yourself in the foot!

1829617,0,t3_2fiuii,I cant answer everything but here are a few things to consider.Any job feels like you are using very little of what you learn in school. Actually working after graduation is almost another education in and of itself. Saying that work is killing you slowly is a bit melodramatic since you even admit that the work environment isnt bad. I think that a lot of people have unrealistic expectations of work that it is going to fulfill them and meet their needs and live happily ever after when that isnt the case. You work to live not live to work. I wouldnt put too much stock into those lists of useful degrees they are garbage. But consider this if you plan on going for a PE the NCEES for years has been in talks of requiring a masters equivalent for the PE license which can be achieved with a nonthesis masters in a year.Dont go into debt for grad school. You can always get assistantships research projects TA jobs scholarships etc. And if one school doesnt offer you anything keep looking until you find one that does. You may not end up at Oxford but who cares. You may have to live frugally for a while but dont borrow money if you can help it. You seem like most of your concerns are personal not career oriented. Grad school is really just another job. You might hate it as much as your current job its certainly a much more difficult environment than work. I would suggest taking some time to figure out what you really want out of life maybe sit down with a mentor or counsellor to figure things out first. You might hate yourself worse for going through something as difficult as grad school when you could have been moving up a career ladder.And there is no such thing as too late I went back to grad school after several years in consulting and I had no problem getting letters of recommendation from retired professors. Older students are looked at as diversity. So TLDR  get your personal issues figured out first grad school is not a magic bullet to happiness. ,GradSchool,ck9ntvo,3,t5_2r4r8

And I happen to live in a country where many PhD students and postdocs commonly have kids without even having to think about these issues because you get over  months fully paid parental leave that can be split between the mother and father with employment contracts and studies automatically extended.

2081287,0,t3_2inrb3,I recently graduated from my PhD program. I too have ADHD and have trouble working after my medication wears off. Except in rare circumstances like finishing a conference paper I rarely worked more than  hours a day usually less. Like you I also dont take my medication during the weekend or breaks from schoolwork. I also finished in  and a half years so it didnt take any longer than is usual for my department I think I finished under the average but Im not sureI assume you take an extended release amphetamine correct? I would suggest you talk to your doctor about your difficulties and play with your prescription. While meeting with my doctor I tried a few things taking my normal extended release dose in the morning plus an extra half dosealso extended releasearound noon my normal dose plus a halfdose of the nonextended release at noon and both of those where I would take the extra dose in the morning. Ive heard that there are some medications that last all day but take around a month to build up in your system. I never tried these but always considered it. I would make changing your medication a last resort rather than the first one.You arent a bad candidate for grad school it just sounds like youre in a rigid program or your perception of it is rigid. If I were you I would first go to your universitys disability office to get registered with them and find out about their services if you had difficulty walking you wouldnt put off getting a cane or wheelchair because of paperwork you would get what you needed. Mental disabilities are no different.. Talk to the disability office about the difficulties youre having and what you can do to try to adapt to deal with them also about classroom accommodations like extended time on tests. After talking to the disability office talk to your departments graduate program coordinator about what the program can do to adapt to you if you used a wheelchair asking for the installation of ramps and elevators wouldnt be cheating or gaining an unfair advantage it would be creating a level playing field. I would play with the medication last but Im sure someone will tell me it should be a higher priority.I dont know what kind of person you are but going through college I often found that other people with learning disabilities were unwilling to take accommodations because they considered it to be taking advantage of their situation a common excuse was that the amount of extra time they were given on exams was more than they needed. I dont know if youre this kind of person but I strongly encourage you to talk to the disability office to find out what accommodations you are owed and use them. You are in grad. school not to earn a certificate saying you sat through classes like college but to be trained to conduct research. The amount of time it takes you to complete your homework assignment finish an exam or take a PhD candidate qualifying exam is not indicative of your progress in that training. Your department will understand this and if they dont Im sure the disability office would be happy to explain it to them.This is a long post and Im probably assuming your difficulties are more similar to the ones I had than they really are but I think that if you use your accommodations youll be fine. Your departments admission committee clearly thought you would be a good candidate for grad. school so you should too.,GradSchool,cl4dlao,1,t5_2r4r8
2085090,0,t3_2irpee,I came to realize that threatening behavior wasnt my class. Students who are yelling and aggressive are bullies and this is how they get through life. A few years ago I had one student like this and I ended up behind this guy in a line for coffee that semester and big surprise he yelled at the cashier too. They want to belittle and demean you. There is only so much you can do make a very clear rubric explain why points were deducted offer to show them how to fix stuff for next time. Sometimes you do have to admit fault and the best way to do that is say something like look I see your point lets give you  credit for your answers like these and do that. Dont negotiate just make it  credit or whatever end of story.Beyond that everything the student is doing is harassment and bullying plain and simple and thats unacceptable. Its a security issue and a discipline issue. Not your problem or your responsibility. Demand appropriate behavior and if you dont get it kick them out or call campus police.

Contacting faculty directly ahead of time and making it clear in my application that I knew who I wanted to work with.. Recommendations from their close colleagues. I stayed within a pretty specific subfield and obviously everyone knows each other.. Having a strong publication record. This basically comes down to luck time and hard work in that order.. Detailing my responsibilities in my lab job. Id been there for close to  years at that point so Id accumulated a lot of them. Those years were pretty critical since they got me the recommendations and publications that I quite frankly wouldnt have gotten straight out of undergrad. it also showed that I could do the sort of mundane work that grad school requires for several years. And compared to being responsible for an entire lab being responsible for just myself has been easy.. Frankly explaining my low GPA .. It was mainly due to harsh grading in a foreign language sequence that I stupidly decided to double major in. My scores in science were still pretty good.. Not aiming too high.

One day I decided that enough was enough and I just signed up for a date a couple months in advance.  I had done absolutely no preparation at that point but simply picking a test date and completing the registration was a huge motivator for me in terms of actually prepping for the test.If youre a person that finds deadlines motivating I highly suggest just dropping whatever it is you are doing right now and registering for a test.  Pick a date that will still give you enough time to prep for it but dont pick one so far off that you can continue to procrastinate.  For me two months was about right.As far as the actual preparation goes as others have said just do a lot of practice problems and tests and youll be fine.,GradSchool,cngm3rg,3,t5_2r4r8

It makes us sound like characters with certain skill trees andor quest trees.Quals gt Proposal gt DefenseThe quals are essentially comprehensive finals usually harder but sometimes not from the first year courses. We technically have three chances. The results are kind of made in a blackbox so the hearsay is that the professors will also take this chance to fail students who are disliked or not really wanted by any research group. That is its supposedly some moment where professors can correct admissions mistakes..The proposal is the tough one. You have to present your research work to five professors four in your field and one oversight from a different department essentially highlighting everything from motivation and past research in your direction of research to your own progress and basically everything that makes you a qualified researcher for this project. The defense is pretty much a presentation to teach and more of a formality than a hurdle. Professors may ask some tough questions once in a while but our department especially the professors in my subfield wont let a student get to this point if they arent confident in our abilities to pass.

The foundation of science is built upon post docs providing ideas and grad students providing labor it works incredibly well until you realize that were basically lab techs that are paid less than were worth while expected to keep up on the literature.

In my case a boy actually showed up to class the day a required paper was due it was a writing intensive course so if you didnt turn in two required essays you automatically failed without the paper.  He was a shitty student anyway so I pretty much just told him to retake the course next semester.  He went above my head to get an extension which was fine.  I kept my policy of  points off for each day late.  When he finally turned the paper in he included a statistic that I didnt give to my class so I asked all other professors of different sections who gave their class that statistic and only one did and I found that he plaigerised for a girl in a different professors section.  It was clear that he was the guilty party as the girl had turned in her paper on time and she was a great student and he was a shitty one.  I went through all the cheating protocols turned in proof and whatnot and the university took care of it.  For me it wasnt enough that he just failed the class as he should have already failed the class anyway when he didnt turn in the paper the day it was due.  Professors get to suggest a punishment so I suggested suspension for one semester.  The university followed through on this and he failed the class spring semester was unable to take the course again in summer and therefore could not walk at graduation.

3483130,0,t3_3051vu,I helped develop a career development peer mentoring program for grad students at my university so I have some experience with this subject and have spent a lot of time researching and talking about the career paths of PhD students. MOST people who get a biology PhD will not continue on in research especially not academic research. Lots of people are using their PhDs these days to go into science policy patent law teaching lab mate of mine got a SWEET gig as a teacher at a fancy private boarding school consulting industry etc etc. More and more schools and the NIH! are realizing that these alternative careers are not so alternative anymore theyre the norm! So yes its fine to do a PhD without planning to continue on in research. That said grad school is fucking rough. A Neuroscience PhD is going to eat up  years of your life with long hours lots of stress and little compensation. I highly recommend making sure you actually need a PhD to do what you want to do before deciding to get one. For many alternative career paths a PhD might not actually be necessary. If you DO decide that you need a PhD to do what you want to do be mindful of your intended career path when selecting a graduate school. Some programs are more accepting of students on alternative career paths than others. Some programs will actually have lots of resources to help you while some will have none. If you dont want to go into research then during grad school you will need to gain a lot of experience in things other than research e.g do lots of teaching side work in consulting outreach activities writing etc. Some PIs will be supportive of extralab activities while some will not. Also keep in mind that there are different criteria for ranking of programs depending on whether you want to stay in academia or go elsewhere. In academia the reputation of the department and individual lab are more important than the reputation of the university as a whole. Out in the real world its the opposite. Choose schools accordingly. For example a friend of mine wanted to do a chemistry PhD but he knew that there was a big chance he wouldnt want to continue on in academia or even finish the PhD he ended up taking his masters and dropping out of his program. He was a highly competative applicant so he had his choice of schools. He got into the one of the top ranked chemistry PhD programs in the country University of IllinoisUrbanaChampaign  which would have been ideal if he had wanted to continue in academic research. However he ultimatly chose instead to go to Yale University much lower ranked in the chemistry PhD world though nothing to sneeze at but that universitys reputation carries a LOT more weight in the outside world than U of Is does. Having the word Yale on his resume as annoying and silly as that is really helped him secure a job once he left his grad program. So yeah. You can do it. But think long and hard about it before you do.  ,GradSchool,cppavxk,11,t5_2r4r8

If the program is supportive of cross advising or comentorship e.g. you being in a GS lab in some way Id take it. In general Id consider the following questions Which program is going to house my research interests best? Doesnt necessarily mean that they themselves have those labs but if they support collab with places that do thats good my program has several students who are just in Statistics or CS. That said some programs are super insular and DONT support work outside you need to make sure your dept at UW wont be that way Which program has students I feel like I fit in with?

3653522,0,t1_cq8pewl,Sorry I was still having my first coffee I might not have been that clear. By summer program I meant your language school.Keep in mind that you dont need to be in college to keep learning French. You can pick up some textbooks and get a subscription to some language learning software to keep on progressing while you are saving up money. You can also try to find some French discussion groups go to rfrench for more info.gt This is why I was going to get a job here and save up. Do you still believe this would be insufficient? A rough estimate if you live outside Paris and try to be as cheap as possible would be that you need about  eurosmonth for living expenses. For a  year degree that represent around k. Even if you get some financial aid maybe  a month at max you are still looking at a pretty big sum of money. And thats without the visa fees and travel expenses and the language school and university tuition. If you can save up enough go for it tho.I get that you cant continue to study in the US but you have some fall back options you can legally work you have familyfriends you are not on a visa. If anything doesnt work according to plan in France you will be in a much more complicated situation.Your situation truly sucks now. Whatever you decide the plan seems to be to find a job first. Do it start to save up money and reassess the situation then. It might make more sens to reenroll into an American college and go for an exchange program with France. Or you might still be wanting to try the French education system.,GradSchool,cq8q7fj,1,t5_2r4r8

And graduate school should never be the means to any ends because it will never be worth it.

This is academically scientifically and downright intellectually dishonest. You are supposed to be the expert on your thesis topic. You were supposed to be the writer the one who understands and can professionally contribute that information to the academic andor the scientific community at large. This is not scholarly behavior on your advisors part. You clearly did not receive adequate training and are not as qualified as you should be today. gtI discussed with my advisor what to expect. He said expect a few comments from x and some questions from y.What the hell? A thesis is not a research paper for an undergrad course where you can get by not really being aware of the material in half your references when you give a brief  minute presentation in class. It is comprised of new and novel research. When I asked my advisor the same question when I did a Masters he simply said Dont ask me. While your thesis is a subtopic of my area of research you are the world expert on that subtopic not me.

Is the purpose of gathering a larger sample to bring results to statistical significance?  Because if it is you should sit down with the program of your choice and figure out if a doubled tripled or quadrupled sample size would even provide any benefit for significance.  Assume your distribution is the same and modulate the sample size for a students ttest.  If doubling your sample doesnt yield any change in significance tell your advisor that.    Ill give you some advice from the perspective of an advisor mentoring their first student we dont know what were doing.  Mentoring like research is a learned skill and weve never done this before.  What comes off as micromanaging might be poor delegation skills due to the fact that only a year or two ago it was us who was the student and we havent figured out what effective management looks or feels like yet.

Your response comes across as you taking it personally then justifying why youre going to ignore the suggestion then making very sweeping statements about your discipline.EDIT Hit the save button a bit too soon...post continues.Youve got three years of undergrad under your belt  you need to be listening to people in your field that have years of experience in what you want to be doing not telling them how theyre wrong.

My biggest concern from reading this is the difference is income. As you obviously know being a graduate student is a full time job. I know for mathematics what Im doing you get an assistantship where you teach  or  sections of calculus or some other FreshmanSophomore course as your work to the college. For compensation you get like  a month depending on the college which I imagine is a giant decrease from what youre seeing momentarily. What Im getting at here is that there might be a change in life style not knowing your current life style I cant comment on how it will change exactly but be prepared to live on a budget. As your friends in grad school and people of the internet have told you it will take the next few years of your life depending on how far you decide to pursue graduate school.

I can at least empathize with you in some ways and I appreciate the broader lamentation.At my university campus area and the immediate surrounding localities are reserved for undergrads who live several people in one house absurdly tiny studios for way too much money or ultra wealthy late s professionals.I lived about a  minute drive outside of this area.  I drove to campus everyday because walking was not possible there were no reliable bus routes at the times I needed and I dont live in a city where we have a subway or street car.  Walking was doable but awful about  miles with crossing major roadways.  Off campus parking on a side street was also challenging because you needed a city pass.  So my option was to use the parking garages.  I would typically pay month for parking.But guess what I am not a Chinese undergrad in an absurdly expensive car.  I budgeted this nightmare parking situation into my expenses and sucked it up because it was the only option.  As a GTA and at this point a th year PhD student my only options for a parking pass put me at the equivalent of Juniors Seniors MAs  basically anyone and everyone unless they were admin or faculty.  And guess what? Going to a school with  enrollment means those parking lots are full all times of the day.  At my status you cannot get a parking garage pass unless you win a lottery and pay  which is a good deal but again see enrollment numbers.  I have yet to win the lottery.Shit sucks but I mean an  minute walk is free.

All of them had a common set of rules that would include  you earn needs to be relevant to the business  you have to work x number of years with favorable performance standings and  you are expected to balance schooling so that it wont interfere with your current role. Most of the time assistance was around  per semester  X of school bills some had caps while others didt and some of them also had interesting rules such as being restricted to local schools. However it is very possible to earn a masters degree with very little debt if your willing to invest time in the workforce. Just be prepared to take things at a slower pace and work x number of years when the degree is completed.

I try to work around them or use them to my advantage rather than outright change them.  I havent had much success with making fundamental changes in myself.For example one of the easiest ways to both lose weight and save money is bring your lunch from home every day.  Ive tried that in the past and it just doesnt work for me.  Eventually I slip up beat myself up for it and then say fuck it and go grab a cheeseburger or whatever.Now I just accept that Im going to eat out for lunch and I do my best to make healthy choices.  Even if you eat fast food for lunch you can still be healthy.  A packet of Chik Fil A sauce has way more calories than you think so I stick to ketchup.  Sometimes Ill get a  wrap instead of a sandwich and fries but I dont beat myself up if I dont.  Things like that.Also replacing soda with ice water that I bring from home has had a big impact.  Its all about small changes like that.  In my experience when people try to lose weight they try to make changes that are far too drastic.  They always make big plans about working out every day and eating healthy for every meal and when they inevitably slip up they drop right back into their old habits.  Im a big fan of small manageable changes that add up over time to create a healthy lifestyle.  Its not an overnight process.,GradSchool,cx2f2y0,2,t5_2r4r8

Its also important to learn how to plan an experiment set reasonable goals respond to setbacks etc. for yourself.  If OPs description is accurate the PI is using a benchmark of you should be in the lab whenever I am to assess whether enough progress is being made rather than looking at actual progress over time.  If an experiment didnt go well its often smarter to take an evening or at least a few hours to reflect on it before rushing straight back in to repeat it.  As others have said working a lot of hours is not at all the same thing as getting a lot done. A good PI gauges performance by actual learning progress and data production and if there is a genuine problem communicates with students in person and in constructive ways.

Sweet kid but even when she repeated basic instructions back to me verbatim something would get lost in the shuffle when it came to execution. So for example Cut these items out of this document and paste them into this other document became Copy these items and paste them in execution. So there wasnt a way to keep track of what had already been processed in a very long document.

5862464,0,t1_cxnu6r9,Last year I had a problem with a professor in my department similar to what you described. I went to the head of my dept and then a mediator person who is a part of my university more generally. The mediators role was to deal with these exact situations and because they arent affiliated with my department I didnt have to worry about making waves. Anyway the mediator asked me if I had emails I did and informally took notes of the incidents. What I saw as most important was there is now documentation of me seeking advice for how to deal with this professor it only includes the professors name and type of complaint not mine. That was important to me. This way if something does happen like this prof takes up a crusade against me to get me kicked out this has happened before Ill have formal documentation that says they have a history of problems with students and maybe its not just me being a failure. I ended up not going forward with any action against the professor but I was told to keep track of the times they overstepped the boundary of appropriate interactions. If you have classmates or anyone in your cohort who has witnessed these events ask them if they would be willing to substantiate even anonymously your claims that youre being treated unfairly.

6633911,0,t1_d0599yx,I understand your differentiating between whats politically best for you the current student and what is best in an ideal world. This is an important point to keep in mind. But I do feel like the standard I described in which students really can be totally honest about the program is much more common  at least in my experience at all of the  schools at which I interviewed and in the years Ive been at my programs recruitment  and so unless OPs program advisor explicitly said that they had to go out of their way not to say anything even vaguely negative ts unfair of them to expect that the students are aware of that being the standard and thus unfair to reprimand OP.To your point on potentially misleading students by telling them about negative experiences that are not necessarily representative I guess I just feel that thats not going to happen if a you clarify that your opinion may not be representative which you should and b if the pros student does their due diligence ie asks multiple people for their thoughts which is kind of the whole point of visiting. I think its important to hear about negative things that happen in the program even if theyre only the case for a minority of people  because people should have available all of the information when making a decision so that they can decide how to weigh it for themselves rather than having it preemptively censored. If someone wants to decide on a program eg based on the sole criterion of minimizing the risk of a worstcase scenario that should be their right and negative but not necessarily representative information would be crucial there.I guess part of my intuition is also that it bodes badly that OPs program directors are explicitly saying that students should only say good things about the program and appearing to go about taking active steps to suppress negative thoughts about the program. If thats the case I think any experiences in the program that OP or anyone else can provide that deviates from the desired standard of positivity even if theyre not totally negative are especially important for the prospective students to hear. I at least would feel an obligation to tell prospectives about the bad or even just nonideal as well as the good  especially in an environment where things are being cherrypickedspun so heavily.,GradSchool,d05i54d,4,t5_2r4r8

If you go into one and do not succeed in the postdoc zero papers for example it demonstrates lack of versatility and lack of productivity. A postdoc can actually make it harder to get a job in industry. An academic postdoc is meant as a second test of you ability to succeed as an academic not as a stepping stone to industry.

6955852,0,t1_d14qeoj,Thank you for your feedback. My field is linguistics  specifically endangered languages. I want to work in language documentation and revitalization and am very passionate in doing so. As an undergrad I triple majored in Latin American StudiesSpanish and PortugueseLinguistics with a minor in Sociology and have a very strong background that I figured would put me in a great place to start graduate school. I studied abroad twice in Costa Rica and Peru where I had a certain amount of exposure to minority languages and am fluent in Spanish and Portuguese as well as have taken courses in Quechua Nahuatl and Kaqchikel and have strong basicintermediate conversational capacity in the latter. I am currently in my second semester of Turkish in an attempt to further broaden my horizons and get experience working with different linguistic structures.When I applied however I did not have a specific dissertation or project in mind. Perhaps if I took the time to develop something more specific than a subfield and a vested interest in a specific region then I may have more success in applying next year. It just seemed a little counterintuitive to apply with a specific idea in mind as it would be a rather arbitrary choice that would be subject to change the further I progress in my degree. I want to avoid a gap year because Im concerned my language skills will deteriorate all of the information Ive been absorbing wont be fresh on my mind and Im concerned that my passion and desire for working with indigenous communities will fade and be drowned out by the monotony of working a job which will more likely than not be completely unrelated to my work and being disconnected from my field for such a long time. Unfortunately I am seeing little option for me other than to take the gap year though and pray for a funded position the second time around. For someone whos always been such a gogetter though its disappointing and discouraging to find myself in this position.EDIT Id also like to add that Ive previously taken graduatelevel linguistics classes specifically pertaining to language documentation and revitalization.,GradSchool,d14s2gt,3,t5_2r4r8

Not only because of what another response pointed out about conferences but because a German PhD program is not going to prepare you to go on the job market in the US. Im not talking about education necessarily but about professionalization. A very important part of what US PhD programs do is getting you ready for the job market in the US. With the US academic job market the way it is terrible you need every edge you can get. Professors who have not experienced the US job market are not going to be able to help you prepare for it.

7012870,0,t3_4bmayt,As an American doing a PhD in Canada I will see that it is totally doable!  Admission and academics are pretty similar to US Programs. You will be able to get funded but will not be eligible for many sources of other internalexternal funding as an international student.The biggest differences will be in relation to moving. There are a few big things and added stress from living abroad.  Visas especially working while in school can be in major pain in the ass and take a long time to complete and even longer to hear back from. It is much more difficult to find housing you will have no credit and be living far away from where you are looking. Bringing a spouse makes it even harderlonger. You also will then have to import your belongings some things are allowed some things are not and have an inventory of everything you plan to bring into the country.  For example I couldnt bring my mattress into Canada and had a  page printout of all of the items and their value I was importing.  Importing a car can also be a pain in the ass or even impossible  given the country.Depending where you plan on moving you will also need new IDs drivers license maybe? a new bank account car insurancecar registration health insurance etc.  Literally everything will be a challenge at first.  For example you cant get a cell phone plan without a credit card. BUT you cant get a normal credit card because you just moved to the country therefore you are only eligible for securecredit cards or some alternative method Basically just a ton of hoops to jump through. It is important to note that depending on where you live expenses can vary dramatically for example in Canada beer meat and cheese are almost twice as expensive as in the US. It is also exponentially harder and more expensive to visit home and currency exchanges will often be against you.  Also you are always under threat of something like a DUI or other issue resulting in getting the boot.TLDR There is a lot that goes into a decision to study abroad but I dont think you will really notice much of a difference between a US and European graduate program once you are accepted and workingresearching.  The biggest issue will be adapting to a completely new life and jumping through all of the associated hoops.,GradSchool,d1b98va,2,t5_2r4r8

I live in an area with few biotech opportunities and had  local interviews for jobs that wanted STEM advanced degrees that resulted in  offers. One was significantly better than the other.Looking back Im happy I did an internship in industry. Im happy I had teaching TA jobs. And Im happy I got creative with my job applications. I wound up getting the best offer from a company that doesnt traditionally use biotech type people but needed a person with biochem research experience. Im technically going to be working as an engineer but am not a trained engineer. I almost didnt open the job posting because of the engineer title but I am very happy I did.There are places where your skills are in demand and probably in nontraditional STEM PhD pipeline type jobs. There are nonbench jobs field applications scientists make decent money get to know products very well and many transition to management or salesmarketing. Its tons of travel though. Technical writing gigs have a very wide range of pay scales depending on your geographic area and your set of skills. My nd offer was in a traditional biotech company and it was insultingly low. I think they feel like a big biotech fish in a small geographic pond. I also knew I had zero interest in being a post doc or working anywhere that my salary was fundingcontingent. All  of my industry interviews asked about this all  seemed satisfied with my answer that I had no interest in writing grants to pay my salary thus the transition to industry.

Im not in academia and its pretty well told to us that chances of being hired are extremely slim by our overlords however id say  of us end up in the industry cycle pool. So I also didnt mean that if you leave academia that youll stay with the company forever thats just completely unrealistic of the field. Further a good portion of us end up in industry not doing directly related research work.I say things in very broad generalizations so folks actually put thought into their decisions after they graduate or even before. Its extremely rare for someone to spend years in an academic postdoc and think that theyll just fall into an industry position because they couldnt get a professorship. Unless youre being recruited away thats always an exception its not going to be an option for you after you finish up your  year max time as a postdoc at a university. Industry is not there to get academias scraps theyre going to pull the top people like your examples or pull from folks who made an intent to go towards that route. Again I use industry as a collective term.The stats at least the more recent ones are suggesting academic research positions or other nontenured positions are making up for the lack of professorships. The majority of biology PhDs are ending up in academia or academialite positions inclusive of ANY academic position if professorships are making up small sliver of those positions then university and research institutes are making it up somehow somewhere  Thats not to say that industry pharmaceutical consulting other private firms is not a growing opportunity that is also contributing a huge number of jobs to PhDs they definitely are and more so compared to individual academic appointments split tenure and nontenured into their own segments but still majority of PhDs are sticking in academia. With the recent creation of the word permadoc and the push for them id imagine it will continue to grow perhaps w reduced grad student cohort sizes.Theres terrible reporting of this data regardless. As I mentioned in my original response the industrygov. postdocs are essentially not followed or tracked my official job title is biologist I technically dont exist as a postdoc even though I am one.

This is how it works at every institution I applied to for undergrad and when I transferred about a dozen schools. If it didnt fulfill a req for your degree then they might not be inclined to include it on transcripts but if it exempted you from a course they typically have to give you credits or at least a P or some other representation to indicate that. Do you still have access to an online system that reports grades? Maybe it would show up on an unofficial transcript?Either way it sounds like you need to get in touch with the registrars office at your undergrad.

To start a research lab you will need significant experience writing grants papers and learning about the process of managing a lab. PhDMD degrees can be useful but dont specifically cater to this career path. You really do need more than  years to gain all the tools in your toolbox to run a lab and produce toptier papers unfortunately it is just not enough time.In my experience PhDMD students have been focused on highly specialized areas of research even more than the PhD which postthesis exclusively leads to working as a consultant in a hospital system for established research projects.gtI have been told that after completion of such training programs it is reasonably common to be awarded enough grant money to establish your own lab right out of the gate sans formal postdoc experience.Dont count on it. You can never tell the funding situation a few years down the road. Postdoc experience is vital to establishing your research background grant proposals and learning how to manage a labpeople.gtI have felt some level of stigma from PhDs no MD and also from PhD students suggesting that my PhD training is inferior in some way as a result of it being streamlined. Do you share this sentiment? Why?Personally I really did not like it when PhDMDs or for that matter any MD lord their MD knowledge over my head. Something about med school really brings out the worst in some people. Then again I despise anyone insisting on the Dr. title outside of the classroom or hospital.Other than that if the research was good quality it was good quality  doesnt matter whowhat the background is.gtI do not want to delay this any longer than absolutely necessary.Just wanted to highlight this in particular. Please remember that scientific research is a process and not a race you cannot force science to do what you want. Sometimes you can ask nicely and in response you may have your teeth kicked in.

Everyone is taking the side of a student who may or may not make it in a PhD program. Unfortunately it takes some amount of wisdom and ability to not project onto the student to see that its better for the student to quit earlier than later.

9079022,0,t3_54m46x,I recently found out that grad school is absolutely not for me and I will be leaving at the end of this year. I have a few questions and considerations for you Do you have your Masters or the opportunity to get it before you leave? If so try not to think of it as dropping out. Even though thats what it seems like youre really leaving with your Masters. A Masters degree can be equal to  years experience in the workforce and is a great accomplishment! Do you have the opportunity to take a leave of absence? Even if you plan on never coming back it could soften the blow to your family and if things dont work out you could then go back to the program and hopefully learn a little about yourself in the meantime! Not getting your doctorate now does not mean that you never will. Many people find their niche in industry and then go to school for a Masters or doctorate in something they never would have though of before gaining some experience! You should also consider sitting down with your adviser and seriously talking about the timeline that youre currently on to get out of there. I know people in my group who thought for sure they were on a  year track to graduation but my adviser got them out in . If you are closer than you think it may change your perspective.  Finally it sounds like some of the guilt you feel is due to financial help you got from your family. If you are able try to pay your parents back over x years after you get a job as thanks for their support. When you break the news to your family arm yourself with statistics and a plan even if youre faking it.I know X number of PhDs who cant even get a postdoc but the job market for X is great right now...

Ive invested X amount of time toward a degree. At this point I see that leaving would make me happy temporarily but at the same time would mean squandering my investment. Therefore the decision whether to stay and earn my degree is dependent on the value of my investment. In my case Ive invested too much to leave now in the hopes that I would find greener pastures. So I decided to earn my degree even though I lost the passion I once had for my field. I am doing this on the assumption that job prospects would be better with the degree rather than without. Another motivating factor is Ive seen my colleagues leave my program and wind up with positions I would never want.So my advice is this consider the value of what youve put in so far as well as the outcomes of other students who left your program or similar programs.

9260138,0,t3_57654u,You say I noticed we havent really discussed authorship. What are your thoughts on authorship ordering?. To be honest it sounds like they came up with the initial idea and you both contributed equally so its probably not worth creating tension if they think they should be first. It is generally an awkward conversation to have especially if one or both of you have already contributed effort to the project so its best to discuss it pretty much immediately after you both decide to collaborate.  For example a friend of mine who is also a postdoc in my field gave me an idea for a statistical analysis I hadnt tried before and suggested a couple of variables in the dataset I was utilizing that they thought might meet the assumptions of the analysis. I subsequently applied that statistical analysis to test an established theory incorporating both variables and wrote up the findings as first author. BUT BEFORE ANY OF THAT HAPPENED while we were discussing the possibility of applying the analysis to the theory I told him I wanted to be first author on the manuscript.  He agreed and let me know as second author he wouldnt be doing much writing but would help with editing interpretation etc.  Badabing badaboom  we both knew how much we needed to contribute to my project mostly me writing and analyzing him helping with interpretations and editing. If we didnt have that conversation he might have had good justification for nominating himself as first author since he originally suggested the analysis and the variables after I had already done most of the work. Having the conversation ahead of time totally sidesteps that issue and saves you a lot of time and angst in the longrun. ,GradSchool,d8psfjt,3,t5_2r4r8

I had a few days that I felt really stressed that I finished early or I hadnt written as much as I had for other profs. It was okay. Any downtime you have dont spend at your computer.

You say open book but will you actually have them all or might the library recall some etc?If you will have them all easily accessible write your notes about the argumentsyour thoughts NOT the facts. Index your notes in a way that will make you easily find a relevant section. Your notes should have information like Author A writes about topics  and presents facts specifically about X Y Z.  This agrees with what Author B wrote about  but disagrees with what Author C wrote about   because of arguments m n o. I agree with X Y and  because of how these fit together with my researcharguments about other topicswhatever but I disagree with  and Z because ... Then you know what youre getting at and you can look up the relevant sections of Authors A B C easily to get more details. This will save you time when taking notes. You need to know WHERE to find the relevant information easily and quickly and which connections this information has to other pieces of information. In  hours that gives you plenty of time to write the answers as you already have all the dots and how they connect. You can copypaste some of the notes about the arguments  and flesh it out by expanding on for example an argument by providing more facts. As you already have the arguments you are going to make you will be fine and can use to time you have to flesh them out as much as possible until you run out of time. Most importantly focus on the arguments the author makes how other authors relate to that and what you think. Thats the hard part where you normally take time to think. Read the rest so it sounds familiar but dont bother remembering it alltaking detailed notes  just write down what info you can find where. You could even make a tableindex organised by topic where you have a list of which authors provide information about topic  referencing chapterspages rather than whole books and topic  and so on.

But I am with the others in that while personal feelings occasionally come into play it is pretty unusual for a tenured or tenuretrack professor to care so much about a graduate student as to consistently block their paths in various ways. Quite simply faculty have way too much else going on to indulge in this kind of labor.Bad rec letter? Sure. One or two headbutting incidents? Possible. Sustained in the manner you describe?

10268084,0,t3_5n1dq5,There are basically three types of funding for a graduate student.. Funded by the school. This is by far the most common amongst PhD students where the school or the department funds the student. Therefore the student is free to move within the department from lab to lab and is not required to hunt for grants. . Funded by the lab. The student is funded by the grant money given to the primary investigator PI. This is also quite common although far less so amongst the PhD students. The student is NOT free to move from lab to lab and depending on the duration of the grant may be forced to hunt for grants. . Selffunded by grantother sources. This type has funding outside the school system a company might foot the bill for instance or the student might have research grant attached to the students name. This includes the funds the student has saved up. This is by far the most common amongst the masters students especially the cases where the student foots the bill.Basically the professor generally views students as is she going to need my money or not? and thats pretty much it. A graduate student is generally not required to bring in grant money at least not until ndrd year of PhD not sure about masters since a student must submit a solid and concrete research proposal for the grant doing it in year  or  is a bit unrealistic in many cases when the student is still trying to figure out what to do and whom they may want to study with. Many students change topics change advisers even change departments in some cases during their graduate school career. Most of the students around me came in with one professor in mind and ended up with someone else. In your professors case it appears that the professor MAY be able to take in graduate students with the professor footing the bill not sure how much but the professor is welcoming those students who wont be financially dependent on the professor. ,GradSchool,dc7xz6o,11,t5_2r4r8

10701317,0,t3_5sysq7,Theres a balance. Graduate too fast and the next career step is going to be really hard. You wont have the body of work to be competitive for grants and the clock for early career funding starts as soon as you defend. Graduate too slow and you start running into problems and the opportunity cost starts to build up. I know several people that graduated a year early at the expense of getting out at least two first authored papers and that ended up costing them a lot. On the other hand getting out means you start your independent research career and start making money so it depends. Personally I took  years longer than some not as long as others but was fully funded on fellowships the majority of the time. It let me get a lot of things done during my PhD that others didnt have the opportunity for more teaching more collaborations more grant writing more students mentored more of a leadership role in the lab and that has served me very well. ,GradSchool,ddjrf24,2,t5_2r4r8

10738846,0,t3_5tmpp1,And this is why the number one piece of advice to prospective graduate students is that you should never ever take a PhD position that isnt fully funded. Similarly its rare to the point of not being a legitimate possibility to have a visiting position turned into tenure track.So many stories I see like this start out with bad decisions made by poor academic socialization and Im convinced a lot of prospective grad students need to spend more time talking to grad students faculty and looking into something before they choose it as a career. Despite that though most of my colleagues in the humanities try over and over to discourage students from going into graduate school due to the lack of jobs and to not take unfunded offers and just get yelled at by angry students who say theyre trying to crush their dreams. When you sum it up the story isnt that a TT job isnt enough to live on....

10741038,0,t3_5tmpp1,I guess what bothers me about these articles about PhD debt is that they always center the conversation around some cat lady who got her PhD in medieval studies from the satellite campus of a polytechnic or some other certified loon. Its very easy to dismiss these people as idiots because they are idiots and therefore miss the forest of people getting fucked over by how academia works in less spectacular less schadenfreudeinducing ways.The fiscal gears in academia are wound so tightly that it really only accepts young single childless people from elite colleges and therefore probably upper middle class and above backgrounds. By accepts I mean makes it possible for them to survive. Even if you get into a top program with a k guaranteed stipend which is already a huge mental hurdle for even the most competitive graduates of the nations  out of  year undergraduate programs I dont imagine how youd propose to live on k before tax if you are the caregiver to a sick parent a single parent or simply dont come from the kind of background that can spot you a slick  in a pinch. And then the uncertain job market and almost certain remarketing of yourself as a specialist in some field where you have  work experience at middle age especially in the humanities. Outside of the loons that have k out on a journalism degree there are academics in yeah smaller figure maybe credit card debt because they had a baby in grad school or had to take time off for health reasons or struck out on the job market. Or theyre still paying off their deferred undergrad student loans. Those are the stories that need to be highlighted because they are much harder to brush off as dumb people making dumb decisions because there really is an inequality problem in academia that needs to be addressed.,GradSchool,ddnuuyx,14,t5_2r4r8

For example in history graduate students frequently jump directly into the PhD program and may pick up an automatic MA after finishing coursework or passing exams. Or some programs dont offer MAs at all so graduates just end up with a BA and PhD. Still other people spend a year or two doing a terminal MA program to work on language then apply again to PhD programs.

However your PI has so much influence over your progress that I think that decision should hold equal if not more important over your exact topic.

I applied to way too many schools  because I honestly had no idea how I stacked up and was terrified of the prospect of not getting in anywhere. I applied primarily to IO programs with a few OB programs in the mix too. I will be starting my PhD at Michigan State this fall. Lets see how good I am at remembering all of the schools I applied to without cheatingAccepted IO programs Michigan State Wayne State Wright State Central Michigan Akron UNC CharlotteAccepted OBManagement programs UC Irvine Texas TechDeclined IO programs RiceDeclined OB programs Stanford Cornell ColumbiaHavent heard from All IO programs its late in the season so I am probably somewhere on their waitlists but not high enough to have visited the schools Texas AampM Clemson Old Dominion University of Georgia University of Maryland Penn StateOkay I only had to cheat for about  of those so not bad. I am procrastinating and probably giving you way more information than you want or need. Out of all those I visited UNCC UCI and MSU before deciding on MSU. UNCC is actually an interdisciplinary Organizational Science program that might be a good fit for you if your interests fall somewhere between IO business and sociology their program has faculty from those three disciplines as well as the communications department. The people there are awesome and love life.For a really brief bio I am a Psychology undergrad at a SUNY school with minors in business neuroscience and organizational studies and a . GPA. VQW GRE. From my experience what seems really important to schools is work ethic and research experience. I started on research a bit later than most of my classmates but I have been in one lab since January of last year and joined three more labs last fall. I also took  classes last semester and  this one so things have been a bit crazy. Being in  labs also meant that I was able to get  great letters of recommendation so I think that probably really helped me. With this background I was able to get into MSU which is the topranked program but youll also see that I havent heard from many programs that are lower ranked so its a bit of a crapshoot.Let me know if you have any questions about the process especially since I saw both the IO and OB side of the equation. I dont know your background so I tried to speak pretty generally probably at the cost of rambling,GradSchool,dfws11v,1,t5_2r4r8

11583753,0,t3_658g8t,Understanding someone with a thick accent is difficult and understanding everything that is being said through a cell phone on speaker is difficult. Doing both at the same time is IMPOSSIBLE. Put yourselves in their shoes. If you had a colleague with a thick accent and you were talking to someone on speakerphone who kept asking you to clarify would you judge that person or just feel annoyed with the current setup? It doesnt reflect poorly on you at all on the contrary the fact that you asked for clarification instead of just doing the verbal equivalent of smiling and nodding says that you really care about answering their questions as accurately as possible.If it makes you feel better I also have anxiety and had to do an interview for a program in person. The interviewer just one! was BRUTAL to me questioning everything I did as an undergrad. I cried. Still got in and with a fellowship.,GradSchool,dg90x7l,5,t5_2r4r8

People who are in a clique feel they are just talking to my friends. Find a hobby. Find a club.

11623921,0,t1_dgdifz3,Cambridge is a safe bet as I think it is wellrecognised worldwide and will be useful on both sides of the Atlantic. Honestly Columbia is not a school that is well known in my field and neither is Berkeley so that I expect will be fielddependent. Its not that either school is thought to be bad by any means its more just that they are just names to many of the scholars I know. I think it would be beneficial for him  if he wants to keep European options open  to feel out which departments and which programs in the US are considered strong in his field while doing his masters. It would be worth directly asking his advisor I think which programs they recommend just to see which schools are regarded as the strongest.  ,GradSchool,dgdkzvu,2,t5_2r4r8

11769841,0,t3_67d4ap,Im interested to see what other people post to this thread.  In my case I would say that I am not handling it well and I struggle on a weekly basis.I am actually starting to think that mine suffers from dementia.  That or they have been so beat down and torn up by academia that this is the end result.  Either way its not pretty.  Who knows.  You stop feeling bad about it after a while and then the resentment kicks in. Youd think I would know what the problem is this many years in but we have never gotten close enough for me to figure it out.  The advisoradvisee relationship can get really fucking weird.  Its unlike anything Ive ever dealt with before.  I completely blame myself for selecting this person though I honestly felt like I had no choice given my options. My committee is decent but none of them could qualify as a lead advisor for a number of reasons.  On the flip side I feel like I was sold false goods.  How could I have known that I was entering a hostile divided department?  After my experience Im not sure I would advise people to get the PhD.  It seems like a lot of drama for very little reward.  I know many people on here feel differently but I think that its a lot of time and effort just to be beat down all the time.  My parents never went to college so Im a first generation student on all fronts.  They are horrified at what goes on and cant believe that I would even want to stay.,GradSchool,dgu554q,1,t5_2r4r8
11784722,0,t1_dgvqdbs,Horrible things to you? When theyve only just gotten to know you? Well that certainly seems out of order. And the fact that this stuff is  coming from leadership is definitely a red flag.Givengt The trick so far seems to be keeping people focused on the work instead of letting them trail off into bitter cruel tirades about othersI wonder how possible it is for you to insulate yourself from others? Obviously in an ideal world youd enjoy a friendly and jovial relationship with your coworkers but in this situation making it clear that you come to the office to work wearing headphones making excuses to leave conversations once they turn away from work etc. might all be things to make things easier for you. Better to have everyone consider you a loner than a potential punching bag.Honestly if the leadership is a problem especially if this is coming from your PI Id say you want to find an out. This doesnt sound healthy. But if you can at least find strategies to cope for now then you can buy yourself the time to find a good new placement rather than just rushing towards the first potential out.I wasnt going to include my own experiences here because I didnt want to be that person who tells someone who is struggling how good I have it. But I think it is also important for you to have an idea of how different things can be. Im only on my first postdoc like you. But during my PhD I worked in  different office setups with different people over the  years one of which was a massive open plan office with ish people. And being a particle physicist I knew many people on my experiment. I was on speaking terms with at least  collaborators. And now in my new office and new experiment I would say in total I have had the pleasure of working in varying degrees of proximity to  people. And I mean a pleasure. Some people might have disagreements every now and again and yes people might get stressed over the politics involved in funding etc. But people always treated me well and as far as I can see they treat each other well too. There is that real sense of camaraderie that I think you hope for and expect when you are all ultimately working towards the same scientific goal. So please know that there are good people and good collaborators out there I have a reasonable sample size myself to draw from. You deserve to work somewhere where people treat each other at least professionally but I would hope more than that they treat each other well.Edit dear god I didnt mean to write an entire essay at the end there sorry!,GradSchool,dgvu53s,7,t5_2r4r8
11793652,0,t3_6891nj,Find a professor or two that does research that interests you. Take himher out for coffee to chat and learn more about their research. Explain your situation and ask their advice. Offer to help them with their research unpaid or paid and do a great job. Theyll have no issues giving you a letter of reference after a couple months of great research assistance.You have to take some initiative. Pick up the phone send those awkward first emails drop in to peoples offices. These are the first steps to making meaningful lasting connections. Think first what you can do to help make their lives easier and do it. Then youll have no problem asking for a favour in return such as a letter of reference.,GradSchool,dgwumbn,2,t5_2r4r8
11795509,0,t3_68atrg,I think in something like history it really depends on how you work youll have to figure it out for yourself. So lets say you have a book and an article to read for each of your classes per week. You can spend two days on the material for each class or you could spend  or  hours and make the same level of contribution to the discussion in your seminar. It depends entirely on how you work. In terms of a job if you are not teaching you will definitely have time to work maybe not full time. Im finishing up my first year as a PhD student I didnt teach and I kind of regret not working Im really bad at being my own boss and a job might have forced me to plan my time out better. The key is to have some kind of rhythm and routine to everything so that you dont either work or sit around for hours on end as both could make you crazy. Additionally your first year might be the last chance you have to work for some time. ,GradSchool,dgx27e6,3,t5_2r4r8
