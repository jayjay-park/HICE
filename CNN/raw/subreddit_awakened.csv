I am not perceived as a part of my own environment but from every other point of view I am seen as a part of the environment the environmental factors are not identical. See Indras net for a rather useful metaphor.gtIf separation is just a thought unity must also be just a thought. There cant be any fundamental difference. They both must be delusions.Separation is a thought and unity is a thought. The difference lies in how the thoughts originate the thought of separation grows out of the process of labels being attached to perceived parts of a pattern whereas the thought of unity grows out of the physical sensation that follows an absence of such attachments.edit Harris also compares the feeling of self to the visual perception of the kanizsa square if you inspect it thoroughly youll find that there is no square and that its all just a play between patterns in a whole.,awakened,ckk6tut,2,t5_2ubdb

3053928,0,t1_coei3pa,gt This is off topic but Id like to hear more about the kombucha.Im glad you asked. I love to talk about kombucha.gtHow does it taste?I dont know if youve ever had kombucha from the store but it doesnt have to taste like that. I would say it tastes depending on how you brew it like a much milder and flavored depending on how you flavor it apple cider vinegar drink. Theres definitely quite a bit of acidity but its also effervescent like a soda depending on how long you brew it.You brew kombucha in different ferments so the first fermentation is just a mixture of strong tea water and sugar upon which your kombucha SCOBY lives. I do mine in a big container yes thats my kombucha brewing for the first ferment. Its sitting on a seedling mat that helps keep it warm during the winter but thats not necessary especially if your place is typically pretty warm. Just helps the SCOBY grow and ferment faster.Then after a week of fermentation like that I siphon it off into smaller containers into which I put the flavorings usually berries or dried cherries or ginger or elderberries sometimes all together often much different things and then you restart your first fermentation with a new batch. After a few days of letting the second fermentation go with the flavorings I then strain it out into individual bottles which go in the fridge and keep us in kombucha all week long.You dont have to do as much as I do each time especially if youre just brewing for one person. This is just what works for us.It sounds like a lot of work but its really not. Once you get your rhythm down its only maybe a total of a half hours worth of work each week.gt  It seems like it might be difficult keeping the culture alive if you dont clean it properly and such do you have any solid guides for keeping it going?Cleaning isnt really all that big of a deal it turns out that was my biggest concern when I started. In fact cleaning out your first ferment brewing container too often can ruin your SCOBY. You want it to have a familiar environment. If it grows mold or anything bad which is very rare youll know it right away because itll look different. Not that it ever looks pretty. It doesnt. It looks like a monster but its your monster. I recently had to throw away a bunch of my SCOBY just because it was too big and taking up too much space in my container and it was actually kind of sad. I had a whole goodbye my dear dear kombucha ceremony before dropping it in the trash.As for keeping it alive and healthy the only things that really have worked for me are Making sure Im using the proper ratio of waterteasugar and keeping it in a relatively temperaturestable environment at about  degrees. SCOBYs are really hardy so theres not too much you can do to mess em up.If you ever want more guidance or tips on it if you decide to score a SCOBY let me know. Id be happy to share more especially recipes for second ferments  theyre my favorite.gt Im curious about your photography too been doing it at a hobby level for some years. What are you into?Ive seen you mention your photography before and Ive always wanted to ask you if youd share one or some of your favorites. Ive put aside my camera for a while just kind of lost the mojo there in the transcendence but Ive tried my hand at a lot of different things and Id say my favorite is just nature photography and found moments.

3535690,0,t1_cpuzm12,gt There is nothing to surrender to.gt There is no it.I found the first statement to be true and the second to be quite false. In that space there was nothing to surrender to  just the end  and upon turning back around I was distinctly given a choice surrender or dream a new dream. I chose surrender because it was obviously the truth of me that I was surrendering to and all I had for that was immense devoted love.Perhaps you werent given that option yet because you still had interest in the dream that I didnt have. I was done. Done done done done. Especially by that point. No question. No backsies.Its good that way though because your interest in it far exceeds any interest I could have ever mustered. Youre doing it justice that I never would have.But anyway the kind of surrender that Im talking about isnt to an other its to who I am on the other side of all of this. It reminds me of a cartoon where a character sinks into and disappears into a wall behind them still facing forward only its not a wall its the other side of the dream of life long before the mind. My commitment is there. Everything you talk about is in direct opposition to that. Everything most anyone talks about too. Actually everything that exists. Whatever of me is left here lives to serve that side of me and that side alone.gt In the mind we have a perspective.Outside the mind the perspective within it is largely irrelevant. Movement happens words happen colors flash breezes blow. Not only do I not need to have an honest opinion if Im giving an opinion Im lying and I have no problem with that either on any of that I couldnt even if I tried. Its all good.This isnt my dream anymore and Im so incredibly fine with that. I have no idea why Im still here honestly except to facilitate the desires of the aspects of me by way of others who still find perspectives important within the dream.  gt I am not a diplomat who tries to find peace between physicality and that which is beyond it.I guess I dont really understand why war between the two would even be a consideration. Or even why a rejection is necessary. Would it make any sense to deny clouds because the atmosphere exists to facilitate the appearance of clouds?gt So I dont reject rationality and I detest antiintellectuality as much as I detest physicalism.Meh. Thats definitely somewhere that you and I diverge. Id much prefer the company of an antiintellectual physicalist whos genuinely compassionate and unabashedly in love with experience.For most of my adult life one quote stuck with me often which was Never trust anyone whod rather be grammatically correct than have a good time Tom Robbins. Little did I understand why especially given that I was most often the former.gt As long as there is even a hairtip of care or concern for physicality I cant really freely enter and remain in certain transformations.This and the entire story you told in the paragraph before is why I say that you are better suited for the dream than I ever was. I couldnt have cared less about a single bit of it. Theres no need for me to find out how powerful I am I already know. All I have to do is open my eyes in the morning. Nothing could top that.Its a funny thing that happens you know when you find out. When youre given the keys to everything  every last single molecule and thought it turns out you neither want nor need any of it. A cup of tea is more than enough thank you.But thats not what all of this is for you know? Its for what youre trying to do even with the delusions of grandeur and affection for unkindness. Youre doing it right. Your side is life mine is not.gt I realized its just my own hangup! I just think like that. Thats my fetter. There is no objective supposed to.Yep. Actually I went through all of that fairly quickly just before the choice to surrender. I can literally do anything in the world that I want to do was the biggest temptation of all.There is no objective supposed to and you cant do anything that isnt in complete agreement with existence. If you do it its allowed. Period. gt Trying to understand that I dont owe anyone or anything to be a certain way least of all myself this has been the hardest thing.For me that was the easiest thing. Understanding that I also owe everyone everything was the hardest though the understanding was eventually facilitated by an obviousness that was illogical to resist.gt Remember I am a being with a past not one without a past.Yes of course you are. It would seem the difference between the two of us is that I didnt have any qualms about kicking all of that to the curb without a second thought. It was obvious that any of my interest in it was only hurting me in the long run and I was so very tired of putting myself through the ringer for no good reason whatsoever.,awakened,cpvaik0,1,t5_2ubdb
3635532,0,t3_31zzqz,From my understanding Life and everything in it is supposed to be enjoyed but with the understanding that its not actually anything outside of yourself causing the feeling of enjoyment and is rather a means of variety and so its wise not to get attached to any particular thing. The thing that seems to happen with a lot of spirituality is that it people end up seeming like theyre disgusted with the world and get so hung up on trying to avoid attachment that they end up avoiding even enjoyment of everything that is supposed to actually be enjoyed from a place of nonattachment. In Be Here Now he talks about how once you give up everything you get everything. So in a sense the Universe wants us to be happy and have everything we desire but in a such a way that we arent going to make ourselves miserable by clinging and being afraid of losing anything we believe we have. ,awakened,cq6of9y,2,t5_2ubdb

Its based on beliefs of failure and lack of any kind and belief that we are each individually alone and separate. Nonduality shows us that theres a unified nothingness to all forms that theres nothing to fear because theres no one to hurt you no one to be hurt and nowhere to disappear to after death. We can then come back into form with this Knowing and set the tone for our life. It doesnt mean that we are attempting to be controlling of our lives again. Instead we are aligning the will of our individual expression with the balance and flow with the unified totality because that is where happiness lies and it shows in the feelingtone of life.

4300596,0,t3_3a8tns,Im going to start by saying thanks for sharing I havent heard of this author and enjoyed reading the excerpt you provided. Next I need to say that I do not intend the rest to come across as argumentative as its going to come out lol.Right off the bat I dont understand from my own understanding how there can be a short path to enlightenment or even a long path. Or a middle path for the heck of it. Granted I can understand how enlightenment can be looked at as a path but not one with an end to it as short or long denote. To me enlightenment is more of a perspective you have on any given journey you find yourself on or reflect upon in the case of journeys past.gtIn the early stages of enlightenment the aspirant is overwhelmed by his discovery that God is within himself. It stirs his intensest feelings and excites his deepest thoughts.That part I can relate to.gtBut though he does not know it those very feelings and thoughts still form part of his ego albeit the highest part. So he still separates his being into twoself and Overself. Only in the later stages does he find that God not only is within himself but is himself.If the author wanted to include this part as he did I think he wouldve done better to expand on his understanding of ego. Ego can be both a super simple and highly complex concept to get. In only  short sentences the author introduced a cautious tone about the self ego and an accepting tone of the god ego. Maybe he went on to elaborate on this point I dunno because you only gave out a Costco sample size portiongtIt is a matter of transferring attention for this brief period from the ego and fixing it lovingly on the Overself.Am I missing something obvious? Is that his bottom line short path strategy?gtit must be accompanied by the deliberate cultivation of a joyous attitude it must also be accompanied by a sense of freedom its proper physical facial expression is the radiant smile.So dont worry be happy smile all the time and when someone asks you why you are smiling all the time you can tell them that you dont really know because you took the short path found in a book that tells you thats the ultimate destination on the defined road to enlightenment.So as to not end on a argumentative pointgtThe idea that we have to wait for liberation from the ego and enlightenment by the Overself to evolve through much time and many reincarnations is correct only if we continue to remain mesmerized by it but false if we take our stand on reality rather than appearance we are now as divine as we ever shall beI really liked this part.

4375680,0,t3_3a3lg3,I definitely struggled with this growing up. I guess Im one of those indigo people I was totally obsessed with that color as a kid   and I definitely fit the description so well its creepy. I totally agree with you all of our emotions good and bad are messengers for us. Theyre communicating the space between mind and body conscious and subconscious in other words who we really are under the facade we present to the world. This is not something we can escape like many of us keep trying to. Its something we learn from. Its how we learn about ourselves on a more intimate level and how we can set things straight with our true selves. And like someone else said its the counterbalance to the joy and bliss we experience in our lives. There is no reason to be afraid of the negative side or the dark side.We live in a world where people totally want to just mask the symptoms of things they dont like. It seems for every illness we have we just want to medicate it away instead of focus on the root of it. This is not how we grow. Even other types of problems we have in life there is a tendency to just brush it off and hope it goes away but it will not. The longer we ignore the more dangerous it becomes. We need to stop judging our emotions. Who says that one is supposed to be better than another? Something that came from being depressed for so long starting at a young age I learned to celebrate it. To anyone currently suffering Why cant you actually enjoy your negative emotions? Who said theyre something to get rid of? Why do we always have to happy? Why is anything else unacceptable? Who is it thats actually saying this? Theres an interesting intersection between a world that says you should always be happybut  functions in a way that breeds stress. ,awakened,csivia3,1,t5_2ubdb

Youre familiar with Adya so you probably know that he says enlightenment is the death of your psychological mind. The death of that and the awakening of life are two sides of the same coin though. The part of you that wants to kill itself is the psychological mind no doubt because it sees the futility of its existence.Its obviously not the whole story here but because youre more attuned with the psychological mind than you are with the other side  life  it seems like the whole story to you. Attune yourself to the other side the side that expresses the gratitude and then see what happens.,awakened,cssxj6v,1,t5_2ubdb

Why dont you develop the skill and awareness which will enable you to let go of thoughts as soon as they occur? Once you become skillful at that you can then pick and choose the thoughts you wanna get carried away with? You can let go of depressive thoughts and keep playing along with your synchrocoties and whatnots. How about that? Would that work for ya? And to answer the last part of your question. Who knows and who cares! All that matters is what being free from the shackles of thought can do for the quality of your life and everyone around you due to your behavior. And dont worry bro being enlightened doesnt mean you wont ever have a thought again. What it means is that you become wakeful enough to recognize and make an informed decision wether you wanna board that train or not. Therell be no more inner conflict. You will be in harmony with life. You treasure the miracle of life. Be nonjudgmental of others and situations. You enjoy life as God intended. Good luck with your journey brother.

4638204,0,t1_ctek4pj,Im happy to explain my experience with infinity to you. Last night I stared into infinity recognizing it as infinity for the first time. I know now Ive always been able to do this and Ive done it many times before. I just didnt know what I was looking at then but its quite obvious now. For those who dont know you can see infinity better by closing your eyes. I urge anyone to give this a try. Close your eyes and look into the backside of your eyelids. This is not darkness. There is so much going on behind you eyelids than most people care to acknowledge. Pay attention to the  vivid dance of visual stimulation as you stare deeper and deeper through your shut eyes. Did you notice any patterns of movement and the unique differences of shade and depth to them? Keep looking into it. Pay attention to it. Youll see that infinity is right there and you can decisively interact here. Im going to try this again tonight  and see what else I can do.Edit I should reiterate my new experiences had little or nothing to do with drugs. Marijuana may even be helpful for the tutorial described above but its not mandatory. I have done DMT only a few times in the past. Its been a long time for that matter but it is excellent in the way it shows you infinity without much effort required. Ethnogens and Entheogens are really their own thing though I believe we exist along side them for important reasons. There is a god within you and hallucinogens can reveal it to you. Many have been in existence before language and the experience does not require language to be understood. Theres something very beautiful about that.  ,awakened,ctf7p1x,2,t5_2ubdb

Do you truly believe that it is worthless or do you think there is some kind of emulation false modesty there?No false modesty... Im not even sure how that plays in here. This is sharing an observation in this process. If you have a different perspective then please share it thats why I brought it up.As we often say language is unclear and we all have our own definitions of things. Ill try and describe what Im saying differently and see if it makes more sense. It might not. Who knows.I think that what you said here is actually a key pointgt Once you define a point of reference there is certainly better or worse...So what seems to happen is that what we might say is ego or egoing is a solidified point of reference. In other words other perspectives have been shut out due to belief structures which say that this point of reference is more correct. Values then are in direct relationship to the self ego point of reference. The more frozen that an ego point of reference is then the more frozen a value is and vice versa. That apparent solidity gives them apparent separation.Reference points in themselves are not bad. We adopt them for everyday life. There are certain ones we settle in no matter what. The difference I think is that an ego point of reference and its related values are points of reference that we are settling into unconsciously by relying on belief systems that we may not have seen clearly. Other values are ones that we consciously agree to and remain more maleable and open. Its hard to explain how Im seeing it and its probably not that blackandwhite and Im sure you could argue that there are some learned beliefs that will never get examined which will be acted upon in rare situations. Again if this remains unsatisfying I would like to understand your perspective if you would share it.,awakened,ctrorpv,2,t5_2ubdb

5663400,0,t3_3shhsd,So glad this post came up on rawakened where us egomaniacs can really ramble on gt Because what really matters is are you coming from a loving place and coming from your heart. Not how intellectually awakened you areI certainly agree that where youre coming fromyour underlying motivationis more important than where youre going or whether you ever get there. That is fundamental. So long as you secretly long for personal success fame money prestige and so on your outer actions will fall flat and fail to stir your soul. Youll wonder why after all the millions all the promotions all the stuff you still feel miserable.Thing is for many of us this place in your heart isnt easily found. What is needed is the reprogramming of ones basic patterns of thought. What is required is a nonetoogentle inquiry into ones own personality. Marcus Aurelius wrote that humans are made for one another and I agree but  and so long as we remain deluded we cannot accept or experience this fact directly.  So then for many individuals the awakening of the heart must be precipitated by an intellectual revolution. And I believe this intellectual revolution must by necessity reveal the nature of reality and self. The intellectual revolution paves the way for the awakening of the heart or at least it did for me. I know that the inverse is also possiblethe heart first and mind secondand Ill explain why I think this is an impractical course to pursue for Westerners in a second. In my experience nature of self is the basis for philanthropy philos love of anthroposmankindhumanity because it tells us that you are me I am you they are us and were all one. And this is also true biologically speaking and psychologically speaking so that even science can precipitate the intellectual revolution and help us see that our differences are cosmetic that at our core were all the same.Its not enough to understand it. We must experience it firsthand. Once we do acts of violence or abuse toward others become masochistic. Why would I want to hurt you? Youre no different from me. In fact you are me deep down. Once we strip away the masks we find the same actor playing many different parts. We can definitely awaken the heart first but this path is difficult for Westerners. It requires a connection with the unconsciousinstinctive mind and weve mostly lost that here. Too much emphasis on reasoning not enough on feeling. We dont trust the gut. We dont listen to the intuitive mind. We dont know how to experience life as it is without the bullshit filter of This and That in the way. IF we did we might awaken the heart first. We might have a genuine satori and experience the nature of reality directly.In any case I believe the two awakenings go hand in hand and eventually lead to each other. One can hardly awaken the heart without eventually forming beliefs that very closely represent the nature of reality and self. One eventually finds that the connection goes further through the tree of life and down to the roots down further to the stars and planets and all the way to the Big Bang itself. You and I and everything was there when it all started and well all be there when it ends and starts again. And even though it look like were apart now its just a trick of the senses.

5712196,0,t1_cx3fr0w,gtstate of fulltime awarenessAwareness is not a state. States like blissuniversal oneness are of course temporary such is the nature of experiences. Awareness can best be thought of as the background of experiences. Its the space in and from which all experiences arise and subside. When one is awakened its not a matter of achieving something special it can better be thought of realizing whats already presently happening. By looking to the experiences that arise in awareness you remain focused on the clouds the appearances rather than turning around and seeing that youre the sun the light that shines on all appearances. When you know yourself as the sun the clouds dont make a difference no matter how violent the storm. My unsolicited advice is to stop looking for states of blissoneness and trying to find deeper levels of awareness higher states of consciousness thats all distractions from truth. My advice is to look at what is presently happening. See how you are not your thoughts feelings and sensations but whats aware of them. As long as you continue to identify with the experiences you continue to feed and reinforce the ego that pursues pleasure and shuns pain. ,awakened,cx55jql,1,t5_2ubdb

5762696,0,t3_3tzyo5,Ive felt exactly what youre saying. It all makes sense to you there is complete understanding but still somethings missing. The theory side is acquired but you feel like theres now a practical side that needs to happen and youre more than willing to get started on that but... how the hell do you do that? The answer is super simple nothing needs to happen. Nothing is going to change.What you feel right now as you feel it IS IT. Thats it. That is what unity or God feels like. The I that you think is your ego is not the ego. The I that you feel in you is God. If you want to know what being God feels like just ask yourself what does it feel like to be me right now?. Thats exactly what it feels like. The I that youre so convinced is the wrong I the I that needs to become some other better I is actually already the correct I. No need to change anything about it.ampnbspgtOn one layer this I is the ego the body the mind that which navigates through the world. Its the only me that I have memory of being. Experientially the egome is the only me I Know at the point of this writing at any rate. And yet I Understand that there is more to this idea of me.No there isnt more to this idea of me. There is only less to it. That I is what you are looking for. This I that you think is the ego the body the mind etc... is the I everyone is talking about except you are falsely associating it with the ego the body or the mind. Instead of saying I am the ego the body the mind cut that sentence short at I am period. That is instant truth right there. You have the I but you just link it to things that arent true. Dont link it to anything and youre done.ampnbspSo its not the feelings that have to change its simply your belief that anything has to change that you must let go of. Thats all.Like when someone is looking for their glasses while theyre wearing them. They think theyll stop looking when they find the missing glasses but theyll never find them because theyve never lost them. So they keep looking and looking with increasing frustration until someone tells them Hey youre wearing them! Youve been wearing them all along!. Was the frustration and unhappiness caused by the missing glasses? No they werent missing in the first place. The frustration was caused by the false belief that theyre missing which wasnt the case.Youre waiting for fireworks not realizing that this is what the fireworks look like. Youre waiting for something to change not realizing that nothing has to change. Its the nonstop nonacceptance of this that causes unhappiness. Realize that what youre looking for isnt something that you dont have or something that you can acquire. What you are right now as you are is it. So all you need to do is stop looking for it hoping for it wanting it imagining that one day youll get it and it will make you happy.So how do you stop looking for something that youve never lost? You have to realize that you have it. Keep your attention on this I that you are so convinced is the wrong I. Feel what it feels like to be you. Do this all day every day. It will become easier as time goes by and youll gradually realize that this is what youve been looking for.

5991294,0,t3_3xh6zf,the image of yourself which you created thanks to upbringing culture is an image composed of reoccuring generic themes.  This image indeed can be seen to some extent as a reincarnation  but I always call it the Frankensteins monster reincarnation. You are composed of bits and pieces of descriptions that have been used over centuries to describe various people.     If you then remain in the naive and common belief that the image of yourself your culture gives you is actually  you in other words you fully identify with your social mask  then you can claim partially you are a remanifestation of some previous people.    But as all good Hegelians know  the image of yourself is not you.  In order to discover your true identity you need to construct it from completely private selfinvented images experiences narratives which you lived through not which someone applied to you.   It is a difficult and dangerous task for a man to radically claim herhis identity in modern highly categorised society. Because the claim is always  Im a separate unique never before existing and never again occuring category of huam  an entire category.  This claim is a threat to every categorisation system and therefore is widely and violently forbidden with the possibility of death in more brutal societies and usually alienation in more civilised.  To claim to be a reincarnation or to at least feel it is precisely an emotional reaction to this violent ban. You are so afraid to be yourself you begin to feel the general false rule of everyone being image of someone else to be true.  Its something like a cultural equivalent of stockholm syndrome.

Then as your mindfulness develops you are able to start breaking it down in to two rise and fall then three rise sustain fall then more and more parts until you finally see actually perceive as opposed to analytical understanding that every sensation that arises immediately passes away.Sensations get less and less solid. To get a sense of what it does to your perception Visual snow is a common result of practice. Not everyone has the same visual perceptual changes but that is my experience. I actually suspect a lot of people do experience that but I have not talked to many people about it.Now just apply that same idea to the rest of the senses to get an idea of what perception turns into. All the senses start to feel pixilated. If you touch your arm it no longer feel like a solid pressure but innumerable points arsing and passing away much like sand.Then instead of perceiving the arising and passes away of every sensation awareness moves forward to where you are only perceiving the passing away of everything insight stage knowledge of dissolution. It is as if things are arising and passing away so quickly that you can not even see the arising anymore.This causes the knowledge of fear to arise. This is the stage where people can freak out. It is because they start to see that everything they ever thought of as their self is not solid but really just a constantly arising and passing away conglomeration of sensations. My experience of the knowledge of fearfulness was that every change in sense perception was frightening. Like someone sneaking up behind me and yelling boo!. For example if I meditate in front of my computer and my screen saver comes on that is scary. Or if my dog comes into my room and shakes his collar the sound of his tags jingling is scary. Etc . . . . This would probably be considered the result of the insight stage knowledge of fearfulness being well developed. It initially is like the previous paragraph.If they can keep pushing and make it through the fearfulness they end up at equanimity and from there they have the best chance of experiencing maggaphala enlightenment.

6026429,0,t3_3y0q2s,I felt like this for  years after getting kicked out of a Zen place where I was livingstudying. I had learned all about what was illusory and nothing about what wasnt. It was the bleakest time of my life. Worse than post detox early recovery. When moving from a materialistic world view to a spiritual one a lot of us seem to have to pass through a period of nihilism. I think this is natural but painful. the thing to do is to pass through it as quickly as possible and to keep going. There has been a ton of suffering involved in my journey. Sometime I despair that pain seems to be the only way I can learn. But at least I learn and I always end up looking back at the dark times and saying they were worth it for what they taught me. Its tough but dont turn against yourself. You need to be your strongest support now more than ever. Be good to yourself.,awakened,cy9l3zn,6,t5_2ubdb
6044098,0,t1_cybty0f,Thanks for the response!I certainly dont feel stuck. Sometimes a certain sense of hitting a bump in the road or a kind of grating feeling appears when some conditioning arises or if some kind of experience reveals something that is being held onto. But when that does happen its like an awareness of it almost automatically happens sees whats happening sees why and the apparent issue simply disappears. Sometimes it may last a couple of days to figure out sometimes its instantaneous. Either way its all just allowed to happen whatever way it needs to.gtWhat do you mean by I? Do you mean theres no sense of the old separate egoidentity that you used to call I? Or that there is no sense of self whatsoever? From that perspective what is the sense I am  which Maharaj mentions a lot  for you?Hmmmm. It feels like when I say I in the truest sense Im referring to blanket consciousness. The Iless awareness. I know Im not an entity what I am is that which sees any idea of an I haha if that makes sense. It feels strange to try and put into words language never hits the mark. Every sentence I use to try and describe feels wrong in a sense. Like it all misses the mark its all a lie in a way. Theres also a seeing that the illusory idea of an entity is still I in a sense which is why I guess I have no problem with the mind based idea of I and whatever issues it apparently runs into. Its all imaginary dreamed. Its seen that even this apparent deepening and such is all part of the play so I in a deeper sense isnt really concerned with how its playing out. If anything its enjoyed! But it wouldnt feel right to say i am enjoying it more akin to I AM the enjoyment? I see that which is aware of enjoyment I am the source of enjoyment I am the enjoyment I am the idea that is enjoyed. This is where trying to describe I can get a little blurry I guess. I dont really know what to say what to describe? ,awakened,cybw0lw,3,t5_2ubdb

6768120,0,t1_d0j3nmz,Ah you are so painfully normal  All I mean is its painfully clear that you implicitly believe your thoughts. Adding to the pain is the fact that you have conflated correctness with truth. Nobody here is arguing that physics story about the world isnt the most technically correct story humans have ever developed. The problem is when you falsely believe that by taking a story to its logical extreme you can somehow change its essential nature. Thats just not true. And that false belief bleeds through all of your posts. That false belief is why the selfmaintaining automatic reaction pattern that is your personality so often manifests as an iconoclast. Its pure ego and dont mistake me saying that for thinking that any of the evidence you are providing is false. Its pure ego because it stems from a messiah complex the idea that you have to save everyone from false belief  but you have never checked your own false belief that spurs your automatic behavior onwards.gtIm aware that physics is not the same thing as the universe it describes.You say this but really youre not aware of that in any meaningful way. I know this by the fact that your eyes glaze over whenever someone brings this up. It has no impact on you because you have never realized it. It has never penetrated to your own belief center. Your ego identity as an iconoclast depends on you not realizing this at your deepest level. And so it exists only as a vague intellectual formulation. Simply you lack realization and pretty much everyone can tell it but you.Another way it is obvious you lack realization is your handling of Descartes cogito. To anyone who has experienced realization beyond thought the cogito is immediately sniffed out as foolishness. I think therefore I am? Lol. You are therefore You are. Thinking has nothing to do with it. Correct me if Im wrong but it seems pretty clear that you think lol that thinking is humanitys natural state. You think that thinking is just what we do. You think that there is no other choice but to think. And thats just a belief. How do I disprove your belief? I cant. It might help you going forward since you cant escape your own thoughts just yet and indeed probably are going to glaze over when you read this as anyone thoroughly invested in thinking would do to view enlightenment in a new way. Enlightenment is a hypothesis. It is a hypothesis of subjective consciousness. Because it is subjective and deals with your actual experience of life  it deals with the viewer not the view so to speak  no one can prove or disprove this hypothesis for you. You prove it yourself or you dont. You overcome thought or you dont. You transcend limitations and conceptualization or you dont. And like any good hypothesis you dont go into it expecting anything. Enlightenment is pure science pure scientific method. The only thing that scares people away is that it is a solitary endeavor and to unravel thought requires us to battle a thousand legions of selfcreated demons. Hence it is rare. But I would encourage you to actually test the hypothesis yourself rather than from the outside without having taken a single step inward presume to know what the outcome is. That is the opposite of the scientific method.gtAs Daniel Dennett puts it Its very hard to change peoples mind about something like consciousnesses... The reason for that is that everybodys an expert on consciousnesses... each of us seems to think I am an expert on consciousnesses. Simply by being conscious I know all about this. And so you tell your theory and they say No no thats not the way consciousnesses is youve got it all wrong and they say this with an amazing confidence. The point is that life  yes even your life  is experientially defined by an infinite number of factors which cannot be studied from the outside. Personal development is not a geometric proof that can be solved from the outside once and for all. You solve it for yourself subjectively or you regress and avoid all mention of the subjective world. Awareness cannot be quantified. You grow it yourself or have your eyes glaze over in confusion when your peers talk about expanding their consciousness because you cant even relate to something that cant be quantified or studied something as hippy dippy as subjective consciousness. The individual has to solve the problems and grow in awareness for themselves or they live as a brute. Youve never developed beyond the stage of mere physicality so you think that life is just to die and so we might as well be gluttons since all life is for is fulfilling our own private lusts eating as many burgers as we can and making up for any insecurities by drawing strict lines between our preferred ingroup hard scientists and the outgroup everybody else. Youre the equivalent of a human nematode. And I mean this in all due respect to your altar of science worship. Science is really good at building stuff and it is the best at verifying in new form what already is selfevident exists aka evolution existed before evolution. And thats basically its entire range of movement. Science is not meant to solve subjective issues it has something else to do. That thing you have no idea about  consciousness your self your life your subjective awareness?  yeah that that is something that is beyond the nematode stage. Its not that you cant evolve past being a nematode and never do science again. Its not that investigating subjective consciousness means you have to believe in crystals instead of the LHC. Far from it once you evolve you never believe anything. You certainly never think that science is something its not. Your problem is youve never actually considered what science is. As Ive said before you lack the philosophical mind to really consider what science is and why that matters and why simply saying something out loud isnt the same thing as realizing it at your deepest level of being. Science is just analytically cutting the world up into artificially separate piecessystems and those separate pieces dont actually exist outside the mind and that the analytical mind isnt actually meant to solve anything other problems than building stuff. There are a thousand ways that anyone could interject into your posts and say citation needed for a core developmental milestone that you claim to have but all of us can clearly see you lack but all you can do is look back at them with your eyes glazed over because you literally cant see outside the little secure bubble that your mind has tethered itself to like a baby who is too afraid to stop sucking on the teat to see that its a grown man capable of extraordinary feats of perception not an infant who needs permission first before believing in the infinite complexity and unity of life. You ARE the Queen of England. But there IS no Queen of England. You ARE the universe experiencing itself you are without bound or limitation. And yet there IS no universe. Is it beginning to make sense? I love you and want you to wake up to what you really are no more belief that all you are is this selfmaintaining automatic reaction pattern you call a personality. Whenever youre ready to give up your beliefs of course  no rush.gtYou Veragood seem to be doing the same thing here insisting that anyone with a different explanation of consciousness than your personal experience of it just needs to meditate more.Im just pointing at the enlightenment hypothesis and encouraging you to find out for yourself. I only do this to people who cling so hard to certain beliefs that it leaves an obvious trail in all of their posts. I want to save you from belief isnt this noble? Is this not what you are doing? Is the medicine you yourself dole out too bitter now that you must have a small taste of it? Ah life is ironic.gtgtI wonder is there any materialistic explanation of consciousness that that would satisfy you?Ah. I love you so much. We are the same. The only difference is that you are still spellbound by explanations. You want the model more than you want the real thing.gtIm aware that physics is not the same thing as the universe it describes. What of it?What of it? Well lets just say that Im at a point where I want the real thing more than I want the model. And to find the real thing you have to take the road less travelled the road where no peerreviewed journal can help you the journey within. You do it for yourself or your eyes glaze over at the mere mention of consciousness. The choice is yours kemosabe. Choose wisely.,awakened,d0jg36y,4,t5_2ubdb

7156786,0,t1_d1rke7f,OK Ill give it another try.I understand oneness but I hold different beliefs about it.  In my own experience Ive noticed that although there is Mind big M Oneness thee is also mind small m  duality.  Most people think that duality is swallowed up by oneness but I dont think that  I think we exist and we dont exist at the same spacetime.  In other words its a paradox  the key concept of my understanding of reality.Paradox is what makes oneness not oneness.  Its not like oneness went away but like the Zen people say its the myriad everything.  It seems very difficult for most people to understand this idea of paradox but it seems to be the actuality of our Universe.  Our body and mind live in a solid world yet as we now from science its not solid at all.  When we look around we can easily mistake oneness as just emptiness but its both...There is nothing wrong with oneness but there is a lot wrong with the myriad everything separateness for lack of a better word.  And  of humanity is in separateness.  Its not fair just because you are awakened to turn your back on  of people suffering in ignorance.  It might not be real to you but its very very real to the rest of humanity.  And in the long scheme of things a million years from now it wont matter if the Earth becomes a desert and all life is gone but there is something karmically wrong with letting it happen without lifting a finger to fix it.As for good and bad as it relates to suffering its simply how we view pain and suffering that causes us to suffer.

I was young at the time and knew people would shrug it off.  I went to the doctors and he helped me understand that I had to learn to cross my defense barriers.  Each level deeper has a new gate.  Focusing on the gate triggers our mind and emotions to do anything to pull us out. I learned to release and focus correctly to understand. It sound like a lawnmower at first. Accompanied by extreme fear. Then I would start hearing voices from my waking life  trying to wake me up.  After pulling myself out again  I would find no one around me. This scared me at first but I learned that our programming as human beings during this time  didnt want it happening.  It would split the wrong individuals reality in ways it cant comprehend.  If you are going through this  its because you can.  Let me know if you ever need to talk.  While each of our experiences are our own I am more than welcome to share mine.

In this particular event there is a heightened sense of drama or theatricality due to the audience present and so the egobased roles and dynamics implicated in the context of the event are more likely to emerge. That does not preclude the potential for real learning and healing I just find its important to recognize whats what. gtIn my experience the laughter was anything but embarrassment.Embarrassment may not have been the right word. Im very familiar with the kind of laughter you describe. It is like you said linked to a kind of spontaneous knowing or recognition. While the laughter may be spontaneous Ive noticed that it can also be connected to something like This is so obvious! How could I have missed this? All that seeking and for what?.

Im sure that people here who work on say climate change and global warming or on the future of the Internet encounter people who have very strong opinions about whats going to happen next. But they probably dont think of these opinions as expertise. Theyre just strongly held opinions. But with regard to consciousness people seem to think each of us seems to think I am an expert.

Not so much for the money which would have been okay enough but more for the regimen and pattern a small and ultimately meaningless comfort but a comfort no less that having a schedule would have provided.,awakened,d7ej8n9,7,t5_2ubdb

Dechohernce in macroscopic collections of particles is always a question of how quickly not yes or no. If quantum coherence in photosynthesis is real and thats a big if see the five papers casting doubt on it cited in the relevant Wikipedia entry were still talking about scales the size of individual proteins and timescales of only  femtoseconds. The cell walls of a single neuron are made of millions of protein molecules and the communication time between two neurons is on the order of milliseconds there are a trillion femtoseconds in one millisecond.Again as with your earlier use of Bells theorem you are merely pointing at some quantum phenomena and then saying So you can see how this might allow for psi phenomena at least in principle. Im not going to bridge that gap for you because I honestly dont see how. You still have to explain how a brain might be influencing things beyond its skull. Where are the forces on telekinetically manipulated objects coming from? How are telepathic brains passing information These are not trivial questions and quantum nonlocality doesnt really seem to provide any answers. The burden of proof is on you to come up with a plausible mechanism of action. Waving your hands at examples quantum nonlocality and saying SEE! isnt going to cut it. You have to explain how QM might allow for psi phenomena. gtIn this conversation thread you have planted your flag in a purely deterministic universe.I actually have no idea if the universe is deterministic or not It depends on which interpretation of quantum mechanics turns out to be correct. Some are deterministic others are not. In the many worlds interpretation for which there are some compelling reason to suspect it is correct the multiverse is determnistic but which branch we find ourselves in is stochastic random with some probability distribution.gtBut I wonder if you see that a deterministic universe such as you profess faith in requires a Prime Mover?Hahahahha.gtStop and think about it.

Not because the arguments are especially persuasive but because the ultimate answer to We need to understand why the universe existscontinues to existexhibits regularitiescame to be is essentially No we dont. That is unlikely to be considered a worthwhile comeback to anyone who was persuaded by the need for a metaexplanatory understanding in the first place.gtgtGranted it is always nice to be able to provide reasons why something is the case. Most scientists however suspect that the search for ultimate explanations eventually terminates in some final theory of the world along with the phrase and thats just how it is. It is certainly conceivable that the ultimate explanation is to be found in God but a compelling argument to that effect would consist of a demonstration that God provides a better explanation for whatever reason than a purely materialist picture not an a priori insistence that a purely materialist picture is unsatisfying.gtgtWhy are some people so convinced of the need for a metaexplanatory account while others are perfectly happy without one? I would suggest that the impetus to provide such an account comes from our experiences within the world while the suspicion that there is no need comes from treating the entire universe as something unique something for which a different set of standards is appropriate.Sean Carroll Does the Universe Need God?gt gtdont think different levels of emergence really exist outside of the mind.

They arent just saying youre not there shut up theyre saying youre not there YET well done keep going.But if you really do have an understanding on a mental level it means you have made a connection. Deep within yourself on your emotionalfeeling level which you may not have access to you have touched oneness. Of course we may argue this is true for everyone but I mean more than that sense. Thoughts come from emotions thought is a product of feeling a derivative way of expressing. So in order to understand this you actually MUST feel it.

I am trying to speak coherently within a multiplicity about a function. As I see it there is a meaningful divide between mind and will. They are one in the sense that all is one but in constructing a metaphysics of that oneness it may serve to speak of them separately.I was saying that the higher aspect was not the mind. What is wrong with that? Isnt Godel saying there must be something higher than mind? Or is he saying that we actually cannot fully understand mind since we cannot get beyond it?In my conception mind is not synonymous with the ground of being. Mind is the aggregate of mental phenomena. I am not sure there is an emergent quality that we can call mind it is merely the contents of consciousness that we identify in the mental realm referred to as a perceived unit. Obviously physical objects are the contents of consciousness but in speaking normally we dont consider those as part of mind. Some traditions of course do and there is some merit for thatat some level of perception all becomes mind but we may still talk about the awarenessisness behind the divine mindor at least some would say so others might call that the ground of being.In this conception then there is the mind which is all the attitudes perceptions intentions desires etc. And then there are actions. We observe a relationship between these and often think of it as causal and we call that cause the will.

I think this is what Jesus pointed in Why do you look at the speck of sawdust in your brothers eye and pay no attention to the plank in your own eye?  Psychology is full of examples of planks in our eyes most significantly in means of defence mechanisms that protect the ego from experiencing harm such as projection and denials. These are unconscious illusions that stop us from perceiving the world as it is as there is a me distorting the view.I find that its rather sad thing that people see having ego as a sign of confidence and power. Ego is just compensation for the damaged sense of selfesteem. There is no need to feel better than others when you are already equal or better yet dont see oneself as seperate entity from the rest of us.

10472680,0,t3_5pzv4c,Psychedelic drugs have a way of transforming the individual into a more awake state but the problem is that their effect can only last for several hours. After the trip you still have to integrate the experience into your reality. At best this sets the individual on a sincere path to awakening at worst it will reinforce their ego with new ideas about reality that make no sense without deeper psychedelic trips. Someone like your friend seems to be more awake but their insight depends on the use of LSD and their ability to share wisdom is limited to those who have had similar psychedelic experiences. So it just becomes a different ego and I think that is what put you off. In a way your friend became a different person.However you dont need to be sad about the LSD you didnt have. It is possible to awaken without the use of psychedelics and your awakening will be much more stable as you are able to integrate it while sober.There is a common saying about psychedelics that once you get the message you should hang up the phone. You already had a powerful experience once and once more so there is enough to reflect upon. A meditation practice can help you to do this in a controlled way. Do you have one?

10929171,0,t3_5w3hei,The Truth is the unborn and the undying yet you somehow think you can give it to people via text? Youre right to an extent in saying the age of information is the age of lies yet youre promulgating socalled information without due considerations of subjectivity while refusing to entertain the possibility youre spinning off into a world of delusion. In other words you could be just spouting nonsense which honestly it seems like you are. If youd like Id be happy to take a look at some of your ideas in details and discuss them in depth so we can bring them to life andor put them to rest Ive been in your shoes before and trust me when I say that the vast majority of what youre thinking will not stand up to inspection simply because you have nothing to check your own thinking. In other words you are opening your mouth whilst closing your mind.Listen to me fully and honestly when I say to you that the recent mania youve been feeling is NOT at all progress if such a concept is useful in this domain. Its clear that youve had a traumatic experience likely from a psychedelic trip that has jarred you from the walking sleep youve likely surmised your life to be but in the void of a coherent thought structure youve replaced it with something potentially far more dangerous  a belief system in which you are free to spin off in your own delusion with absolute confidence that you are objectively right. One in which youve replaced convention and normality with delusions of grandeur and mass affectation.Please let me use your own words against you in the hopes that you will honestly listengt People validating their bullshit way of lives refusing to grow or change.You.gt Their attempt to be God to make order in this disorder is WRONG. We live NOW.You.Let me bring you an inkling of conventional reality  how many people in the world are locked up in mental institutions or wander the streets believing they are Jesus? How many people in the world believe they have the ultimate solution to all of humanities problems even though they are just practicing shallow thinking and suffering from the DunningKruger effect? Ill bet its more than one. Do you think they are all on the same level as you? If not what makes you so special such that it even precludes the possibility that youre spinning into your own delusions?Please take a step back take a few deep breaths and engage with someone in an intellectually and spiritually open manner. It doesnt have to be me but I promise if you stick around this subreddit and continue to engage in good faith that youll see things as they are ... maybe. As it is now several of us are very concerned about your mental health which seems to me apparent from the way you speak short jilted sentences with an incoherent message despite claims of the contrary along with several different usernamescharacterspersonas youre playing with.In the event Im way off base and this is only an issue of communication let me give you some tips because it seems like that is an area in which you are sorely lacking ask questions about other perspectives and see for yourself if they really are wrong instead of telling us the way it is your way and telling us the rest of us are wrong without appeal. These kinds of discussions will not only bring you new perspectives but it will help clarify your own. Flesh out some of your ideas in depth and try to have a discussion about it instead of making shallow claims  unsubstantiated by nothing but Gods word your word. Invite others to help you build your ideas up and see where the weak points are. Consider all points of views and invite others to do the same rather than disparaging the unassuming passerby. What youre currently doing is equivalent to one of those religious types trying to hand out poorly writtendesigned pamphlets on the street while yelling out doomsday prophecies and messages of the resurrection. Seriously for someone as smart as you claim to be youre awfully stupid in communicating your message. Unless it isnt actually about the message and instead about the one delivering it in which case your actions are completely congruent. Food for thought man. I hope my words have at least given you pause for selfreflection because if not youre doing something wrong.This is a plea. Please please drop all of these stories for a quick second and engage with someone on a personal level I double majored in Biochemistry and Applied Psychology have a masters in Applied Economics and Finance and currently working as a quantitative analyst at a small hedgefund.

At one point we used to segregate people based on their race. We had Whites only carriages schools beaches etc. We still have plenty of discrimination but its so much better  hell the US even had a African American president!  years ago women were not even allowed to vote. Weve come such a long way in just  years with regards to gender equality. Science has found cures for a lot of diseases that used to kill thousands. And scientists are constantly finding new cures for diseases. In tribal times it was common for entire tribes to be wiped out by other human tribes. Violence and war were commonplace even in the recent past. The truth is that we are living in what is probably the most peaceful era in history and despite what the media tells us I believe we are moving towards peace. Weve always had war and disaster we just didnt have a news article telling us hundreds die in a bombing attack in Baghdad. We didnt have instant access to media that often sensationalizes these attacks either. We have philanthropists like Bill Gates and Warren Buffett who have donated a large part of their wealth to worthy causes. You dont hear of monkeys donating all their bananas to another monkey group so that they wont suffer or for the good of monkeykind  or maybe they do and I just havent read about it haha.

Best to assume the crazy and work from there PgtAgain Im not quite seeing the relevance. Youre egofree your ego has been blown up l so what exactly are you stuck in?Your ego blown to shreds is level  awakened. Just initialized fresh batch for Hogwartz.They are stuck in the reality their ego dug them into. Their ego lied to and the environment that comes with it. They wake up and see all too clear the lies and the signs smacking them in the face to change things become more and more clear and pronounced. Under PressureThere is still much growth once you awake with egodeath.. getting stuck is no good!gtAh I see. Youre talking about the fear of instability but faith in your path will yield all the abundance you need. If so I suggest you examine your sense of stability relative to your sense of faith else it could lead to all kinds of confusion. Wouldnt worry too much though abundance is relative so forgetting is a good thing.Yes... and yes... and yes. Stability... yes people need to examine that very carefully and what the world has given them if they should be grateful whatever path they might have . Like I say ignorance is bliss some people are blessed to stabilitynot too much faith normal life... and some people are blessed to have a voice in all manner of ways! It is nice to discover that the game does have some balance after all...gtHes trying to tell you to keep your views to yourself and allow his growth to happen as it happens. See how that works?Yes... he wants to keep his ego his safe loop and understanding of things. Good for him greedy but he gets what he gets...the point is to ensure no one is kept down or stopped from their will if it is goodI always tend towards the path of growth and understanding... just ensuring that growthunderstanding can exist without having to worry about some old guy making things difficult for people gtThere I think that is the point I am trying to make. If definitions of good are conditional on awakenonawake i.e. subjective Well egodeath can be done scientifically... thanks Albert Hoffman! It is not subjective... I think we can really pinpoint people who have experienced egodeath type things PTSD situations usually provoke it as well meditation as well.. fasting does it... things like that.gtand growth is good that means growth is also subjective.Growth is good... and it is only subjective in that as we grow it must grow as well. There is an objective quality to it GOODBAD I think. The internet is a good example there... so many unforeseen ways or growth! Subjective how we grow... but obvious goodbad quality. Hate is bad. Anger is bad. Evil is bad. Patience is strength. Mindfulness is strength. gtIts always an interesting exercise to take the opposite of something and entertain it so what is bad and why?I think this guy breaks it down really well!
