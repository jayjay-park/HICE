7107461,0,t3_4csb9x,Hi Funny! As we said wifi is not supported apart from our wifi guide which dmokun has now mentioned here again. But let me give you one tip anyway if even the wifi guide doesnt work for you and you absolutely cant use a cable connection as you said just get a Wifi dongle with the RT chipset     That one will work without even following the wifi guide. Itll just work perfectly out of the box. I know because Im using an adapter with that chipset myself  I bet there are others that work without issues and without manual steps but its been difficult to squeeze information out of people who have working wifi on our builds regarding what adapters theyre using.,ChromiumRPI,d1m08cw,1,t5_3b6pe
