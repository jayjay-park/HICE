Imo realistic is not what you are going for because a horse could gallop alot further than what you can do in vanilla. Some type of system where she would need to rest alot longer and also foodwater is a must is more of the type I would like. So for example you can ride between villages fasten Roach at the water buckets or whatever and do your business while she rest. ,witcher3mods,cu4rmqt,2,t5_389p6

Do not put any mods in.  Try to load the game and if that works load up the save and let the game recreate the config files. ,witcher3mods,d7cqafg,2,t5_389p6
