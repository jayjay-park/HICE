I had stumbled upon it on random and for some reason my mind connected it with the matrix movies so I hit subscribe without reading any of the articles. I just thought to myself I would look at it later and read some stuff and enjoy it because who doesnt like the Matrix? Right? gtgtCue this week my boyfriend on my Alien Blue app. He is just clicking through random things and gets this horrified look on his face. He puts the phone down and says the dreaded words We need to talk. I confused sit down and ask him what the issue is. He started talking about he doesnt support the red pill movement or whatever it is and if I did then this was going to be a serious roadblock in our relationship. I couldnt for the life of me figure why he didnt like the matrix... gtgtgtAll The confusion is now figured out but damn was that a moment of idiocy on my part. I didnt even know that that type of movement existed I guess I need to be more careful with that subscribe button next time. gtgtEdit Here is a link to an article that explains a bit about the red pill.gtgtgt,longtail,ch172pp,1,t5_2y2kz

I packed my things and left that day without giving one fuck or having a conversation about it. After the divorce he was miserable and I felt free. I didnt take alimony or the house because I wanted nothing from him no kids never wanted them. Shortly after I started dating the love of my life a few weeks ago we became engaged. Evidently my ex saw this on my facebook and had the nerve to call me crying asking how I could betray him like this. I didnt even laugh I just hung up and blocked his number. Two days later I find out he committed suicide... I loved him once and I wish his life hadnt ended this way but in a way I dont care. Im happy and in love with a man who is loyal. ,longtail,ch1z19j,1,t5_2y2kz

1520916,0,t3_2bn222,gtThrowaway because I would prefer people didnt know what Im capable of!gtgtI commute to work every weekday. The train journey itself takes about  minutes and my overall commute is a little over an hour.gtgtThe train gets quite busy and Ive become rather adept at getting a seat normally in a corner where I can sit back out of everyones way and mind my own business.gtgtSo today like most I get myself a nice window seat on a row of three connected seats with another row of three seats facing us. I get squashed in by  big young important looking businessmen types my guess was bankers.gtgtA few stops in a little old lady with a walking aid gets on and we all wait for one of these gents to get up and offer one of the easier to access seats that they are sat in... gtgtNope. They all look away pretending they cant see this sweet old lady and avoiding eye contact with everyone who is now glaring at them.gtgtI end up getting up forcing my way out of the corner and making everyone slide down one so this lady can have a seat. gtgtSorted. gtgtOf course now theres nowhere to sit but its okay because Im a young healthy lady who is perfectly able to stand for  minutes.gtgtI do notice however that there is a lovely perching spot which just happens to be on the side of the seat of one of these very important men. I leaned against the edge of his chair for the remainder of the journey ensuring my bottom got all up in this gentlemans business adding a little shuffle every minute or so just to remind him Im right there.gtgtThen just as the train is nearing the station and Im about to head to the doors... I drop the foulest most noxious but barely audible fart about  inches from this guys face. He would have had to stand up and pass right through it.gtgtI did chuckle.,longtail,cj6x9yq,1,t5_2y2kz

1738650,0,t3_2ed66d,gt gtgtAbout five months ago my gf started taking craft classes at night. She would never bring anything home and I was honestly a little suspicious of what she was doing. I finally had enough of the worry and snooped her social media and phone. What I saw made me think she was cheating. There was a lot of chat between her and some other girl about he has no idea and Im so nervous Ill get caught and thanks for letting us do it at your place I was angry and fired up. By the time our anniversary was planned out and it was coming up I had made up my mind to leave her before she could hurt me. I steeled myself against her and began getting cold and emotionless with her. Im not proud of it. I was a jerk.gtgtI wanted to at least see out the anniversary because she was so excited about it. I think she thought this was the year Id propose or something. Which with that in my mind it made me even angrier. I packed a suitcase to keep in my car so that after the night together I could leave in the morning and she wouldnt be able to convince me otherwise. I was getting angry during the dinner thinking how could she cheat on me with that woman and then turn around and act nice to me?gtgtWe went to a fancy restaurant shed gotten all dolled up. She looked good and it pissed me off. I came dressed to rip out her heart. Make her last memories of me the best shed ever have. And we got to dessert and she with this big smile took a present from under the table and handed it to me. I hesitantly opened it.gtgtShe knit me a fucking sweater. She showed me pictures of her and the girls at their little knitting club at the girls house. Her picking out the yarn. She looked so fucking happy to be doing it. gtgtMy heart sank to my knees. I didnt know what to say or do. The classes were real. The messages all made sense with this new lens. The sweater is beautiful. I almost cried right there I didnt know what to say or do. I hadnt gotten her anything. Id planned on just leaving. gtgtI dont know what to do now. Do I just forget how angry I was and try to move past it? Do I tell her what I was thinking? Do I never speak of it? I cant believe this happened. I feel like such an asshole and idiot. gt   gttldr I jumped to conclusions over FB messages and my girlfriend was not cheating on me but secretly knitting me a beautiful sweater. ,longtail,cjybk61,1,t5_2y2kz

I actually went to a restaurant CALLED Umami and the waitress described it as being a combination of all other flavor profiles in other words saltysweetbittersour at the same time. This is equally ridiculous. Thats like saying Purple is a primary color because its made up of other colors.gtgt Why isnt there a word for the combination of sweet and sour like SWOURT?

2224227,0,t3_2km0a6,gtHey guys gtgtId like to share with you the transformation I have gone within the past five years.    gtgtHere is the transformation     gtgt  gtgtBackground  gt  gtgtI started college after the summer of  and became intrigued by fitness. During this time my main focus was geared towards running. For nearly two years I ran  miles and did core almost every day. I would rarely touch a weight. After the summer of  I got interested in weightlifting after talking to some friends at the gym. From there I started going in every other day or so and lifted without any real knowledge of what I was doing. I would go bench press here...curl there...curl some more. I was still pretty weak and oblivious to what I should have been doing. It was a good start though! I did this until sometime during the winter of  and at the start of the new year  I joined a Crossfit gym. At first I loved it. I got stronger I was in great shape and met some incredible people through it. The more I worked out there the more I realized it wasnt for me. Basically I wasnt seeing the results I truly wanted which was to get bigger and leaner. After the Spring of  I joined a local Y with my younger brother who was already on a great lifting split and had tons of experience. Hes really one of the reasons I started lifting in the first place. To start the Summer of  we decided to give Jim Stoppanis Shortcut to Shred a try. This is when I first really started seeing results. After the first couple of weeks of the workout we cut out the cardio acceleration and just lifted to weights. Note  Its very important to add that around this time is when I really started cleaning up my diet which I believe was a HUGE factor in the results that were showing. Once we finished Shortcut to Shred we created our own workout which was based on that same exact split. I worked out on the split until the Spring of  and have been doing what Im doing now since then. Below Ill give an explanation of the split I run today.    gt    gtWorkoutSplit    gtgtMy split goes as such    gtgtDay  ChestTri    gtDay  BackBi    gtDay  Shoulders    gtDay  Legs    gtDay  ChestTri     gtDay  BackBi    gtDay  Legs    gtgtgtHeres a layout of what the days generally look like Each day I start with a power movement. For example Chest  Barbell Bench Shoulders  OHP etc. I will perform those movements for  sets with low rep ranges Note format for exercises will be SETSxREPS    gtgtChestTriceps    gtgt Barbell Bench  x    of max.    gt Incline Barbell  x gt Decline Barbell  x     gt Cable Flys  x   sets from top  from bottom  from middle    gt Close Grip Bench  x      gt Dips weighted   x     gt Tricep Pushdown  x     gt Cable Kickbacks  x     gtgtThings to consider The presses can be switched out with dumbbell which I will every other week or so. The second chesttricep day of the week starts with the same power movement for high sets and low reps at a  of my max but I will implement more reps in the workout. For example I wont do dips weighted and will do bodyweight until failure. I will also swap up cable flys with dumbbell flys. I will also swap out various tricep exercises with the ones I listed. For example Skull crushers for pushdowns dumbbell kickbacks etc.     gtgtBackBiceps    gtgt Barbell Rows  x    of max.    gt Lat Pulldown  x gt Seated Row  x     gt Pullups  x failure    gt Straight arm pulldowns  x  gt Barbell Curls  x      gt Preacher Curls   x     gt Reverse Curls  x     gt Hammer Curls  x     gtgtThings to consider A lot of the same things with chesttriceps applies here Second day of the week is focused on higher rep ranges and starts with the same power movement. As we all know there are tons of bicep and back exercises to exchange here. You can swap out whatever as long as the rep ranges are the same.    gtgtShoulders    gtgt OHP  x    of max.    gt BentOver Reverse cable flys  x gt Front raises w barbell  x     gt Hammer Strength machine seated press  x   gt Dumbbell Later Raises  x      gt Single Arm Reverse Cable Flys  x     gt  gtgtThings to consider The change in the power movement here is just showing what changes Ill make to the movements week in and week out. Sometimes at the end of the workout Ill add in a few more rear delt exercises like reverse dumbbell flys.    gtgtLegs    gtgt Squats  x    of max.    gt Leg Press  x gt Hack Squat  x    gt Goblet Squats  x  gt Leg Extensions  x      gt Leg Curls  x    gt Standing Calf Raises slow controlled reps  x  gt  gtgtThings to consider This is what one of my current leg days look like. Typically I would implement deadlifts but Im dealing with a gluteal strain that is holding me back from doing so at the moment. Again many of these exercises are interchangeable with others that work just as well.    gtgtgtCoreCardio    gtgtIll be honest I dont do a whole hell of a lot of cardio. If I do its typically to warm up and if thats the case Ill run a mile and walk for about  minutes.    gtgtI get asked what I do for core more than anything else and I hope I dont disappoint people with what Im going to say since my core routine isnt intense at all. I try to work my core every other day. I never have a set workout for it I just go in and do various exercises. Most of these include Touchdowns weighted situps on decline bench leg raises hanging leg raises standard crunches planks etc. Remember If you want abs diet well.    gtgtOne Rep Maxgt    gt Bench  x     gt Squat  x     gt Deadlift calculated  x     gt OHP  x     gtgtFinal things to add I know that its a pretty high volume and I know that some people will advise against the volume of it. This is what works for me. Ive never had any trouble with this sort of volume and I believe that I benefit from it more than anything else. Also Ive been dealing with a gluteal strain injury for the past several months so sometime I will cut my leg days short if it is bothering me.    gtgtDiet    gtOverall my diet is very clean and rarely do I eat any junk food. I only allow myself to drink alcohol one night a week and its always just vodka with water and lime juice. I do not count my macros and just estimate everything that Im taking in. Heres a sample of what my day looks like    gtgtBreakfast    gt    gt . cup of oats mixed with milk and one scoop of whey protein.    gt Bowl of strawberries and blueberries.    gtgtLunch    gt    gtHonestly I almost eat chipotle every day for lunch. But when I dont I usually just cook the same thing myself.gt    gt Chicken    gt Rice    gt Beans    gt Hot Sauce    gtgtPostWorkout    gt    gt Protein shake with  scoops of whey and g of creatine.    gt Banana    gt gtDinner    gt   gt Dinner is typically the same as lunch but I usually just up the portions and interchange foods. So Ill add something like Salmon broccoli and a salad.    gtgtSnacks    gtgt Yogurt cottage cheese protein bars protein shake string cheese and fruit.    gtgtSupplements    gtgtPreWorkout    gtgt Creatine   gt Beta Alanine    gt Taurine    gt Caffeine    gt Citruilline   gt Mixed with Crystal Light Lemonade    gtgtPostWorkoutgt    gt Whey Protein    gt Creatine    gtgtFuture Goalsgt    gtWithin the next three years I really want to be around  pounds with a similar BF. Along with that just like anyone else I want to get stronger as Im going along. Thats why Im trying to implement power into my routine since Ive never really been too keen on doing so. I might start competing after I graduate from college at the end of this year.    gtgtThank you guys for taking your time to read through this. I will be here to answer any questions that you might have for me. If you want to continue to follow my progress you can check out my Instagram gt   gtgtgtgtgtgtgt    ,longtail,clmjwth,1,t5_2y2kz

It was just two of my older brothers their wives my sister her husband my mom dad and me and my wife. My oldest brother brings up the topic of the painting in the attic. It was a painting of a naked lady. The face wasnt done but the body was complete. gtgtMy next oldest brother says Hey that was MINE. I loved that painting then he gets quiet. So naturally im now curious. Why Charlie? Why do you like it so much? I pester him for most of the meal just to be a dick. He finally blurts out FINE FUCK. I JERKED OFF TO IT ALL THROUGH MY TEENAGE YEARS. HAPPY NOW? My mom turns bright red and blurts out Oh Charlie your father paid a guy when we were in Germany to paint this of me. While shes crying he looked like someone shot him and everyone else at the table was mortified. It was the last Thanksgiving anyone in my family would attend together. gtgttldr my brother use to jerk off to a painting of my mother not knowing it was her. gtgt,longtail,cmucqbg,1,t5_2y2kz

3139995,0,t3_2w4cri,gtAlright this happened a few months ago but I have recently gotten hooked on this sub and thought I might as well post it.gtSo my friend Daves parents were heading out of town so my friends and I were pressuring him to host a party while they were gone. Finally after convincing him we would do all the clean up afterwards and ensure there would be a solid turn out We werent the coolest of  year olds he agreed to have it. The party was a complete success  there was women everyone got shittered nothing broke and it was overall a great time. The party ends at around am and my friends Tom Glen and I are cleaning up as promised. Flash forward an hour and Tom heads out to the  convenience store because his drunken self is starving. Glen is wondering around looking for Dave and I am completely drunk and begin to pass out somewhere on the kitchen floor. I hear Glen banging on a door and trying to openbreak it down. I head upstairs and Glen believes Dave is passed out in the bathroom. The fuck up? Us unlocking the door. The first thing that hits us is the smell. I have never smelt anything that bad in my entire life I begin to gag on the spot and feel the alcohol in my stomach churn. In the bathroom passed out is the biggest fucking black naked guy I have ever seen along with shit everywhere. I mean everywhere in the sink the tub the floor the wall toilet set. Everywhere mixed with vomit and spilled alcohol. The smell and scene are too much and Glen and I book it downstairs. We start freaking out who the fuck is this guy? You clean up that shit! What is Dave gonna do? Wait where is Dave? And then we hear it. Footsteps walking around upstairs I guess our yelling woke him up. Glen crawls to the top of the stairs trying to stay hidden and sees him walking into a bedroom. Daves bedroom. We quickly follow. The guy grabs the white covers on the bed which reveals Dave passed out underneath like a proper drunk. We turn on the lights and see the man is also covered in shit and begins to lie down on the bed and cuddle with Dave. Just as he gets settled he bolts upright Glen says You alright bro? he replies Gonna yak. I grab a garbage bin from the room and shove it infront of him. He grabs it throws it at me and vomits all over Daves bed and wall. At this point Dave wakes up with a Who the fuck..? Glen and I grab him and run out of the room. The bathroom door has been left open and the smell is emanating throughout the house I cant hold it down anymore and can feel the alcohol coming up and I can see and smell shit and vomit from everywhere. I run outside feeling like I am going to throw up and see Tom on the front porch sitting down eating a burrito. He takes the first bite and brown beefbeans squeezes out all over his face. I fall on the floor vomit all over the porch. Everyones drunk and tired at this point and nobody wants to clean the bathroom or go in the bedroom so despite Daves protest we call it a night. When we wake the man doesnt remember anything and we explain to him what happened hes actually a really nice guy and cleans up everything and buys Dave a new mattress because of the shit stains on it.gtI still regret opening that bathroom door and hope the stench doesnt remain on me forever.gtgtTLDR. My friend had a party and some random naked guy shit himself all over the bathroom and my friends bed. ,longtail,congh08,2,t5_2y2kz

4045645,0,t3_36vmtd,gtShe forgot I was working an unusual shift I care for our son during the day while shes at work and work night shifts myself that let me out almost an hour early. So I arrive home at am and she didnt hear me come in partly because the doors to our and our sons room were closed to the just barely open level I associate with our adult time whilst he our son sleeps and twas a stormy night in a very literal way also. So she wasnt aware of my presence until I walked through the door.gtgtTo see her in her bedtime attire panties of no high modesty and the kind of muscle shirt that would take half a roll of tape to assure modesty. nothing else nor blankets atop with some bearded face on a skype feed. She looked stunned muttered something along the lines of gotta go and closed the chat window.gtgtI definitely gave her a suspicious look but otherwise proceeded to unload my pockets and change out of my work clothes as usual while she quickly opened some inprogress sitcom on the computer with one hand but otherwise stayed stock still. gtgtShe asked very confrontationally What?. gtgtI ask Who were you chatting with? gtgtJust a driver from workgtgtShe stayed stock still through the end of that video and straight through the next. A solid half hour of motionlessness visibly trying not to twitch or fidget shes a nail biter whos been quite proud of how long shes let them get lately and near the end of the second episode she attempts to relax but its a still tense uncomfortable stance just now slouched. she holds that pose for two or so minutes before rolling over and going immediately to sleep. gtgtI leave the bedroom to the living room as its not usual for me to go to bed immediately upon arriving home from work and my worry trumps my trusting nature slips enough to open skype. Contact added that day mins of chat over three consecutive connections. gtgtThat was saturday night. Please do some judging now. I had to and am writing this for feedback not catharsis.gtgtSunday she lets me sleep unusually late and when I wake up and the little guy goes down for a nap I ask her point blank what the hell was that last night?gtgtWhat?

Anything? Maybe something to put me at ease?gtgtyou wont believe me anyway what do you want me to do?gtgtNot much else progressed from there until the next day she just proceeded to end the convo as qucikly as possible before laying back with the laptop on her knees such that her face was hidden from mine by its screen and made a feast of her nails. Such is not her usual tvwatching posture. There is plenty of prequel and as I write this I am still shaking from the sequel. Will update when able if this produces anything constructive or otherwise useful someone please convince me theres an innocent enough explanation for thisgt gtEdit Thank you about what I was figuring. even my best friend couldnt think of a bright side thing to say. So Ill skip quick to part two. That was saturday night. Weve been fighting since Ive mostly kept my calm stayed on point with stating how I feel without name calling or accusations when prompted but mostly trying and succeeding to bite my tounge while she badgers me that she doesnt like being ignored and tries to make the whole thing about how I am making HER feel. I have said my piece in calm restrained detail several times. gtgtLast night thursday was my first closing shift since the incident. As is her practice she insisted on texting to ask if I was closing for sure the two duty bartenders decide between them who stays and goes but Id already told her I had agreed in advance to stay this night. She also sent a follow up text at am approx. the time Id last spooked her asking if I was on my way home to which I replied I was still doing my cashout.gtgtI come home an hour later she is pretending to sleep. the youtube video playing on the laptop was started about the time my key hit the door. thats also the time skype says the second of two consecutive  hour  min convos with JB ended. Shes naked under the quilt. She cant believe i could be such a fucking asshole as to mistrust her and no matter how mad I might be about something she didnt do I dont get to talk to her like that ALL directed swears and insults have been her to me or her to herself and I AM THE ASSHOLE WHO WONT TALK. I dont know what to do. My main worry is our son I dont even know for sure if hes biologically mine anymore but he IS my son and I need to do whats best for him... I just dont know what that isgtgttldr SO caught skyping with friend in dead of night and immodest dress acteding extremely guilty. pls tell me Im going nuts,longtail,crhfmpv,1,t5_2y2kz

5587011,0,t3_3rnlvr,gtLike many before me I had though I was safe from the weapon parts drought. Siting at  when TTK Was released I never had an issue until recently.  What Ive found is that the cost of infusion is absurd. First off it actually costs  weapon parts to infuse because you lose the weapon parts you would have received from dismantling said infusion.gtgtThis makes zero sense. gtgtInfusion should not require any weapon parts at all it should simply be using the weapon parts we would have received when dismantling said gear. I mean logically if were trying to upgrade a gun using a better gun why the hell would we use random weapon parts from other shitty weapons?gtgtPlus having a  weapons part cost across the board for all infusion is just ridiculous. For those of us striving for max light level we may only be able to infuse our gear up a few light levels at a time. Or with any purchasable gear starting at  that requires at least one or two infusions to get it up to my current level. So basically the higher my light level becomes the more draining infusion becomes. So we are actually using more and more weapon parts as we level up instead of a consistent amount. I honestly think eliminating the infusion requirement or at least reducing it would help alleviate the tension concerning the weapon parts economy. Having to use  parts to upgrade perks seems fairly reasonable even with the current nerf but infusion  parts every time is just madness.gtgtEDIT Of course my first front page post is hosting a whine and cheese party. So I do want to clarify Im not trying to pile on or incite an uproar. I applaud those who remain positive in these trying times and I do believe Bungie is aware and hopefully working towards a solution. Also thanks for all the great feedback it seems most people are having infusion issues as well. I would like to point out that Court of Oryx does seem like the best way to farm weapon parts for those with dwindling amounts in their reserves. I will try to get some more data on that and update for those who would be interested.gtgtgtEDIT My main concern is losing players due to grinding frustration. As someone who has played since the beta I can say it does get better.  I encourage everyone to hold strong and be patient. Bungie does so much for the community and they do listen. Even though at times it may not seem to be true. ,longtail,cwpmcyn,1,t5_2y2kz

5750662,0,t3_3twx44,gtFirst off let me start by saying part of me understands what my Dad was trying to do and then parts of me dont at all.gtgtWhen I was younger my half brothers from my Dads first marriage would come stay with us every other weekend. In my eyes for the most part I had a fantastic childhood. My family was very happy and loving. We always had a home and clothes and food. The exception to this were these weekends. When I was  or  my half brother Tommy started to molest me. Every Monday after the weekends with my mom dad and sister I would feel this sense of dread because I knew what was coming that Friday. The first time it happened was when my parents left for the store and he stayed and baby sat me. As time went on he got braver. He would tell me to sit in his lap while he played PlayStation and when my parents were talking or not looking he would push the vibrating controller on my privates. When I was  he started raping me every time they left me alone with him. I didnt tell my parents because he told me that if I told the secret I would be in big trouble and I wouldnt be allowed to live with my family anymore. Every time I was called to the principals or counselors at school I thought they were going to tell me that they found out the secret and that I couldnt live with my family anymore. This continued for about a year until my older half brother stopped coming over at all which made my dad decide they should just come for holidays. gtgtIt wasnt till high school that I told someone. Tommy had gone to prison for robbery charges and I had felt safe for a while. I started dating this guy and it was my first real relationship. After a year or so I told him. Fast forward to me being  Tommy gets out of prison. In my parents eyes he still wasnt a bad kid he just had learning problems and didnt know what he was doing. I had messaged my ex we were still good friends that he was out and that I was scared because I was pretty sure my parents would let him start coming over again. I woke up to my mom with my phone outside sitting in our gazebo. She asked me point blank if Tommy had ever touched me. I cried and told her what had happened. She apparently had been checking my Facebook and text messages yeah my mom is a snooper and saw what I had sent to my ex. Apparently one of her old friends that we had stopped seeing had accused Tommy of touching her  year old son inappropriately. My mom called my dad they divorced when I was in high school and told him despite me begging her not to.gtgtA year later I was living with my dad. He takes me out to eat and then starts driving somewhere I didnt recognize. I asked where we were going and he told me someone had called him and said that Tommy was homeless and had been sleeping at a park for a few months and that he was going to come stay with us. I really didnt know what to say. He then became all bubbly and smiley and told me it would be fun and it was the right thing to do. He said he would be a bad father if he let one of his kids sleep on a park bench. He said Tommy could sleep on the couch in the living room right between my dads room and minegtgtI spent that year hopping from one friends house to the next and locking my door when I was home. Eventually I moved out and so did Tommy gtgtI feel like I need to say something to my dad. We havent mentioned it or brought it up but its been this big barrier between us. I think he is pretending none of it ever happened to me so that he can justify his actions. I dont even know where to start. I feel incredibly betrayed but I also feel like maybe I was being selfish. I guess I just needed someone to talk to or tell and thought maybe you ladies would have some input or support for me. gtgtgtEdit  the amount of people PMing me and saying that I deserved to be raped is astounding. Here are some of the encouraging things said that I havent blocked yetgtgtuurbanvandweller sent me a lovely one calling me an attention whore and saying I must have liked the abuse since I didnt report it.

On the side of working on feature films and TV shows I also direct my own projects.gtgtThe basis of our job as a greensman is building sets that involve landscaping plant work anything involving greens. Up here in BC we are known for being a unique breed as they say we want  ft cedar trees we drive into the mountains and collect them on our pickup trucks. Weve got a lot of great resources to collect from up here compared to LA where everything comes from a nursery.gtgtGreens are considered a bit of a rougher side of the film industry here in Vancouver. We work usually on our own sent off to find materials source things etc. Most greensman do not have professional film experience before greens or went looking for the job they are usually landscapers and arborists looking for better higher paying work. A select few of us have that artistic vision required or skills to handle a greens crew most are goons with spoons happy for a good paying job or someone who has managed to run a chainsaw for years without chopping a limb off.gtgtIn terms of variety of work on Godzilla we muscled the chunks of ashpalt into our pickup trucks to the crash sites then had to walk them into the location. Warcraft I helped build the giant canopy of trees you will see in Elwin Forest along with dressing the set and moving plants around as per what was needed for Duncan Jones on the day super cool day nicest director ever BTW. On the Revenant we were resetting the smashed ferns and ground inbetween long extended takes.gtgtSo our job is kind of all over the place but its usually dirty and mostly outdoors.

7086827,0,t3_4cn2by,gtObligatory this happened  years ago... I wanted to do something special for our first anniversary but wasnt sure what to do. So I paid attention to my wife in the months leading up to the special day and lucked out noticing that she really liked a certain dress when we walked through a store at the mall. It was pricey and at the time she said she didnt want it for that reason we didnt have much money back then but I went back later and purchased it without her knowledge. But I still needed something to take her to for our night out. It couldnt take too long though because we had a  month old baby that we had never been away from and couldnt leave for too long. I finally hit on the clich dinner making reservations at a nice ethnic Sicilian restaurant for early evening on the specified day. I then prearranged with couple A our apartment neighbors and good friends to watch our baby daughter that nigh for a couple hours and swore them to secrecy.gtgtMy excitement at surprising my wife was the only thing that kept me from spilling the beans although I was hard pressed keeping everything under wraps. Well the day finally came and I didnt say anything as I went off to work although I thought it kind of strange that she didnt say anything either. When I returned home after work I could contain myself no longer and grabbed the wrapped dress from its hiding place and presented it to her. She was certainly surprised and asked Whats this for? and I replied Happy anniversary! The look on her face said everything shed completely forgotten.gtgtI told her to change into the dress because I was taking her to a special dinner. This is where things began to go south. She saidWe cant go Ive already committed to babysit our neighbor friends couple B baby for the evening. Really? Really? I then noticed yes indeed there were TWO kids in the play pen instead of the usual one. gtgtHere is where my FU occurred. I was concerned with our short time window because Id prearranged a set time for couple A to watch our daughter and Id been told that the restaurant Id made reservations at was busy and thought if we were late the whole thing might be off. So even though I was a bit perturbed that shed agreed to babysit on our wedding anniversary I didnt make a big deal about it but went into problem solving mode. Id already worked things out with couple A so maybe one more kid wouldnt be a big deal? I called and they said no problem we have your back. Problem solved right?gtgtWell not so much. My wife protested that we couldnt just pass couple Bs baby off but didnt really give me any reasons why not. In my defense at this point we were good friends with both couples and I assumed they were as good friends with each other as they were with us. Actually no I was soon to find out that theyd never even met. We dropped the kids off and were heading out when we ran into couple B coming back Id asked my wife when they were coming back but she didnt know. They got a bit panicky and wanted to know where their baby was and then came unglued when I told them she was with couple A. Who? It then turned out that they had never let their baby out of their sight and had only done so now for the first time at the insistence of my wife who promised to take care of her as if she was her own. She had felt so embarrassed about screwing up my anniversary plans that she hadnt bothered to tell me that.gtgtWe did make our reservation but the evening was pretty much ruined by the whole situation. Couple B pretty much avoided us for a long time after that and when we finally reconnected it was never the same. But theres always a silver lining. The happy ending was that couple A and couple B ended up becoming even better friends with each other than they ever were with us and my wife and I got divorced  years later! So alls well that ends well.gtgtTLDR My wife doesnt remember our anniversary I give away our neighbors kid and the dinner wasnt really that good anyway. Slow simmering divorce ensues.,longtail,d1jnqq3,1,t5_2y2kz

I get that youre hyped and you think chroma  will make your ruby or sapphire dream more achievable but the sad truth of the matter is it does nothing to actually change that market. gtgtLook at it this way there are over  cases out right now for  cents that give case openers the same opportunity to get a chroma knife as the new case which is ..gtgtNow everyone loves to say supply and demand in here as if theyve ever done real market trading outside of their steam windows before you say it yes I have and still do real world stock trading.

However the supply remains exactly the same. gtgtBUT JON CHROMA  CASES MEANS MORE CHROMA CASES WHICH MEANS MORE SUPPLY OF CHROMA KNIVES! You sir are wrong. It doesnt increase the chance of getting a chroma knife or it being opened more frequently. Supply of chroma cases has never been an issue. If anything theres too many cases that supply chroma knives. The only difference we have here is theres now a rd and atm very expensive option for you to get your chroma knife from. It does not effect supply of chroma knives and it sure as hell doesnt effect the price of current chroma knives. gtgtChroma WEAPONS from  and  will probably go down because the new weapon finishes in  are going to be more desirable as they are new. That is where DEMAND comes in and will effect the price of chroma  and  weapon skins. Since the same knife comes from all  cases it does NOT effect supply and does NOT effect demand. gtgtedit  appreciate the downvotes it will directly affect my life. you know what the down votes wont affect? chroma knife prices.  gtedit  there were  casescollections before chroma came out. the price of fades and slaughters and crim webs were unaffected. do you really think a rd case for chroma will affect prices? you need a new case that has new weapon finishes then youll see price drops. i honestly cant believe how ignorant some of you are.,longtail,d2kzrr3,1,t5_2y2kz

One way to easily get a good supply of exotic shards is to buy the Year  version of any Machine gun or Rocket Launcher for this example I use the Year  Thunderlord from the exotic weapons blueprint kiosk and equip it. Then make sure to equip your class item cloak mark or bond that has the Increase the upgrade rate of Machine Guns or Rocket Launcher if using a Rocket Launcher for this. Then use just  motes of light to completely upgrade your Thunderlord you dont have to activate the nodes on the Thunderlord and then dismantle it. In return you will get  exotic shards usually  motes of light back  weapon parts and some glimmer. All it costs is  exotic shard and  glimmer. So you are essentially trading  exotic shard for . Something great to do if you are maxed out on your glimmer.gtgtgtTLDR Purchase Y Thunderlord equip it. Equip upgrade machine rate class item. Use  motes of light. Dismantle Thunderlord.

8675615,0,t3_4ysew7,gtHopefully this kind of post is allowed here. Ive been working at this store for almost  years and when I started I met Dinnese and her partner Ron. They are locals and shopped daily at the store. gtgtA few months after I started working and chatting more with Dinnese whenever she stopped by I learned that shes been battling cancer for a couple years. She was undergoing chemo therapy and had her good days and bad days however she always will try her best to give me her wonderful smile and at least a nod if she was too exhausted to even speak. She was in her late s and has been together with Ron for almost  years. gtgtA few weeks ago she learned that the cancer is back and its worse. Two three days go by and I havent seen her and I was starting to get a bit anxious. I knew something was wrong because no matter how bad she felt she would stop by at least once a day to buy a drink a snack or some groceries. The next day Ron comes in and he doesnt look very well. I asked him if everythings ok and he said that that Dinnese had a heart attack last night and he rushed her to the hospital. Shes staying for a couple days. gtgtFast forward a day and she comes in I tell her I heard what happened and asked her hows shes feeling. She said she was always questioning God about why he wont just let her go shes suffered enough and shes really tired but when she had the heart attack and woke up in the hospital to see Ron on his knees crying she figured it out. God wanted her to stay for this man because hed be absolutely devastated without her. I held the tears as much as I could during that conversation but as soon as she left I asked my boss to use the bathroom and went and balled my eyes out. gtgtYesterday I started my shift and about an hour into it Ron walks in with a friend of Dinnese. Ive never in the past four years saw him with a friend of hers without her being there as well and at that moment I felt my heart squeezing so hard I could barely breathe. He walks up to the register and I saw it in his eyes. I asked him if everythings ok and he said Dinnese had another heart attack in her sleep last night and they couldnt revive her. I wanted to break down but I didnt. Dinneses friend teared up and so did Ron. I didnt know what to say all I said was Im so sorry for your loss Ron. She was a wonderful person and she loved you so much she was tired and now shes in peace in a better place. gtgtAll I hear now is her voice singing.

He was commander of NATO ground forces in the Central Europe region meaning he was several levels down from the Supreme Allied Commander Europe who is always a US general.

10124529,0,t3_5kx5j9,gtA little backstory firstgtIm in the army and Im stationed in the south. Cryptic right? Operational Security OPSEC and all that for my own safety. Now how did I get stuck working a shift thats pmam? Simple I dont like going to the field and any time away from my unit is a vacation so I volunteered. In all actuality the job is cake. All we do is check to make sure that people that can come in can come in and those that cant cant. By we I mean me and a Law Enforcement OfficerLEO. We sit in a guard shack for twelve hours and try not to fall asleep. Pretty simple job. For some reason one saying from our training has always stuck out to me Nothing good happens after midnight. gtgtSome of the examples of this drunks homeless guys trying to get on and steal shit and that date the barracks soldiers try to pick up on Tinder. You know the kinds that look like a trolls ugly cousin. I can deal with this shit all night long no problem. What they fail to tell you in training is that weird shit happens after midnight too. gtgtOne of my first nights working the gate was with and older LEO that had been in for almost ten years and was getting ready to get out of the army. So of course I was the one doing all the work since I was a new guy. It was in the young hours of the morning when a car starts coming our way. I put on my cap and step out of the booth as the car starts rolling up. The headlights are bright as hell so I cant see inside the vehicle until it comes to a stop next to me. Confusingly the goddamn car was empty not a single person inside. At first I thought it was a prank the LEO was having his buddies pull on me to break me in. I turn to look into the guard shack and see the LEO ashen white mouth agape staring dumbly at the vehicle. This raises some red flags in my book. I turn back around to the empty idling car and watch as it slowly pulls off in a cloud of exhaust. I turn back around to the LEO and ask him if we should radio it up. He slowly shakes his head and looks me dead in the eye with a super serious look on his face and tells me to never tell anyone about the car. The LEO ended up getting an early discharge for mental health issues. gtI asked another LEO on a different shift of mine if he had ever seen anything like the empty driving car. He gets very serious and shakes his head slightly. We sit in silence for awhile before he quietly tells me that they come through on occasion. He explains his theory that they are the cars belonging to fallen service members who were never returned home and that their cars after years of neglect will pick up the detached soul and transport the soul back to work. gtgtAnother time about four months into it the clock had just rolled past midnight on a very foggy night and I saw a vehicles headlights cut through the dense fog coming at us. I stand up and step out of our guard shack as the headlights grow closer. As the vehicle approaches I notice that the headlights are very big eyed and are attached to a car straight out of the s. Its very odd to see such a well restored car like this around this post. When the car pulled up it looked like it had just driven right off the showroom floor of a Ford dealership. The people inside were the same way. The service member inside was dressed in an old officers dress uniform from WWII with a female beside him to match. The man and I exchanged looks that were of confusion. He looked like he didnt know what to make of my digital camo and I didnt know what to make of his uniform. He passed me his ID card and I took it without thinking. My LEO called from inside the shack to let them through and to salute them and to not ask questions. I returned the ID and saluted him. Confused he took back his ID returned my salute and drove off into the fog. Stunned and full of questions I returned to the guard shack. My LEO explained to me that on a foggy night after celebrating a bit too hard a young lieutenant and his wife got lost trying to return to their house. The LEO said he didnt know if the lieutenant was simply swallowed by the fog and he still trying to find his way home or if he actually died that night but he still shows up on occasion on foggy nights. gtgtThats all I have for tonight. Ill post some more weird stuff that Ive seen tomorrow night since I just got off and need some sleep. ,longtail,dbr8doe,1,t5_2y2kz

11219520,0,t3_6061rg,gtBeing a single yearold father of a yearold is quite the challenge but my son Jared has made it far too easy for me. He was the poster child of a good child. He never got into trouble excelled at every subject in school and had a passion for the classical guitar. Of course just like any other kid he would do something wrong but he was always honest with me. He would tell me what he did and he would always seem legitimately sorry for his actions. gtgtThat is why I was browsing through craigslist looking for an Xbox One. I knew he wanted one but it was far too expensive for me to buy. I could barely keep up with the bills but I checked for a decent deal every night before I went to bed.gtgtFour days ago I came across a new ad placed for an Xbox One with  games for just . When I clicked on the ad I saw that an enraged mother was selling her sons game system because he failed in all of his classes. After checking the time and seeing that it was  pm I called the number that was on the bottom of the post. gtgt minutes later we agreed to meet at my house at  am the next day to make the transaction. Before she hung up the phone she said I just want you to know something. My son. He is a smart kid. He is a really good boy but ever since he got that stupid system he started getting obsessed over a game. I dont really know which one but just monitor your son. I hung up the phone with an uneasy feeling but I knew that my son was different. He deserved it.  gtgtWhen my son came home from school he screamed out in joy when he saw me hooking up his new Xbox up to the tv. He ran up and gave me a hug and sat right next to me while I connected the HDMI cable to the system. I handed the controller to Jared and he started looking through the games. Once he picked out some sort of car racing game I got up and started getting dinner ready. By the time I put together the last chicken taco I turned around to call out to Jared to come in but I saw he was already sitting at his chair. The whole entire meal Jared thanked me for getting him the Xbox and about how his first couple races went. When we finished dinner he got up and walked into his room. gtgtAfter I cleared out the dishes and washed them I walked upstairs to my room and when I passed by his room I checked in his room and saw that he was closing up his school notebook and picking up his guitar. I had to get up early for a meeting the next morning so I fell asleep as soon as I walked into the room to the sound of my son strumming out Fur Elise. gtgtThe next couple of days went by smoothly. My son would come home play on the Xbox for about  to  hours eat dinner with me and then do his homework and practice his guitar before going to bed. gtgtTwo days ago everything changed. My son looked through his games but after a couple of seconds he started going through the menu on the Xbox. I told myself to make sure I had some new games before next week. gtgtI made chicken soup that night but when I was done making it my son was not sitting in front of the dinner table like he always was. After I called out to him  times without a response I walked out of the kitchen and into the living room. gtgtHe was completely fixated on a game I havent seen him play before. gtgtIt was just a yellow ball on the far right corner of the screen. There were smaller gray balls flying towards the yellow ball that I guess you tried to avoid. I tapped on Jareds shoulder but he ignored me and kept playing the game. gtgtHe never did this before so I just took his dinner out to the living room and placed it next to him. I told him to eat it whenever he felt like it. gtgtI never really worried about him. He always did the right thing. The next day was Saturday too so I decided to let him play the game for as long as he wanted. After I finished my dinner I gave Jared a kiss on the forehead and walked to my room. I was used to falling asleep to the sound of his music but the fast paced rhythmic tapping on his controller slowly guided me to sleep. gtgtI woke up at  am yesterday morning. The first thing I noticed was that I could still hear the sound of tapping. The second thing I noticed was that the tapping was completely in rhythm. Not a single tap was out of the beat that filled the otherwise silent house. I got out of bed and walked downstairs.gtgtJared was still sitting in front of the tv. I tapped on him several times but he did not take his eyes off of the screen. I looked him in the eyes to get his attention but the glazed look in his eyes made me start to panic. His eyes were a solid green. It wasnt the lighting or anything on the screen. His eyes were solid green. Without any hesitation I grabbed the controller out of his hands and started to drag him to his room. He screamed and tried to get out of my grip but I didnt loosen my grip until he was in his room. gtgtThrough his tears and his screaming he crawled to his bed and fell asleep. gtgtCurious I went downstairs and picked up the controller. It was on the start menu so I just clicked on the option that said Start New Game. gtgtI played it one time.gtgtJust once but it is taking all of my willpower to not play it again. I know its not good. Its called Desires Unknown. If you happen to come across the game please do not play it. gtgtIt has taken up almost all of my thoughts. gtgtWhat does the game do?gtgtWhen you start the game you are the dot on the far right side. Not just a pixelated version of you. No. A real life version of you. gtgtThe gray dots that fly towards you?gtgtEverything that you ever wanted.gtgtThe first couple of dots were my favorite foods. Lasagna steak roast beef and spaghetti but as the dots progressed it soon became my son graduating from an Ivy League college my wife surviving past the first  hours of Jareds birth and the promotion that would allow me to spend more time with Jared without having to worry about finances. It took me everything to avoid all of the temptations but Im afraid to play again.gtgtIm afraid to figure out what happens if you fall for any of the temptations gt,longtail,df3pvpt,1,t5_2y2kz

11505076,0,t3_6486cu,gtTo preface this isnt about me but about a coworker. We work overnights together and are paid by the hour. She just discovered that her management has been putting lunches into her reported time as its required by law to take a thirty minute if a shift is over six hours. gtgtThats cool except they dont tack on thirty minutes at the end of the shift to compensate. This is leading to   to  hours of overtime each week being lost. This has been going on since November and likely even earlier. Is there a court case for this or should it be settled with backpay for lost hours?gtgtThanks.gtgtP.s. we live in New York.gtgtEdit I didnt mention that we usually dont get to punch out until about half an hour after our shift ends due to late coworkers and after shift paperwork. Thats where the overtime comes in when we dont get breaks. Normally we dont mind but then we discovered the lunches.gtgtAlso just to make it clearer we work in two separate departments on the same shift. My timesheets are fine. This is about hers.gtgtEdit  Thanks for all the help so far. She went to see the book keeper after her shift today so Ill keep you updated on the situation.
