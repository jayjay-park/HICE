Copy and paste the game or easier cut and paste.. I believe you can upgrade the RAM but that wouldnt make much of a difference because it only increases the capability of the laptop to run more applications together but you would be good to go if you just play the games with some minor applications open like browser media players and such.Honestly I dont recommend the laptop if you wanna play some high end games. Theres also this website that tells you whether you can run the game or not. From my experiences if you only pass the minimum requirements you can only run the game at  FPS if shit gets crazy and  FPS when theres literally nothing to do as I mentioned in answer .

2700307,0,t3_2qyhgb,I would really need more info on what type of game you want. Do you want good old games   ? Do you want new games that can run on old hardware? How about emus? Eh I shall just list a few of them from each.First up old but good.Age of Wonders is a turnbased fantasy strategy classic. I am not really a fan of this type of game but I do love this series. So much that I own  physical copies on steam and on GOG. If you like it their are  other AOW games that can run on older hardware and a new one that needs a pretty new computer to play.Independence War   Edge of Chaos is a d space pirate game. It is a linear game in that it has a story that you need to complete to move on a bit. However you can always kill time as a general pirate in the areas you have opened up already think of it like space GTA. Plus there is a great mod called Torn Space that makes it an open game. Same engine no story just drops you in the universe with a ship and sends you off to play. Trade pirate do whatever you want.Planescape Torment is an awesome squad based RPG. It is a huge game a deep story and multiply endings. There really is no game quite like it though they are making a spiritual successor called Torment Tides of Numenera The engine that it is based on also has a opensource remake called GemRB allowing it to natively run under Linux Mac and even Android. Even if you have windows I would rec using GemRB as it works better with newer OSs and bigger screens.Morrowind as has been mentioned is a great game. I am not going to talk much about it just want to mention that it also has an opensource engine by the name of OpenMW allowing it to work on Linux and Mac too. It is still beta but pretty playable. I actually had better framerate with it over the normal one as I had to run the normal one in Windows and the Open one on Linux. Since Linux uses less CPUram that was given to the game.Next we got New but lowend.Minecraft you know it I know it we all know it. So I will just talk about some mods. First up is OptiFine With it you can get quite a few more FPSs on low end devices. With a few settings changes I went from fps to around fps. Next up is Pixelmon Full D well blocky D Pokemon. I havent played a Pokemon game since the GBA but this is very cool. SPAZ aka Space Pirates and Zombies is a d pirate game. Fight zombies fight the government harvest res upgrade your ship save the universe. A very big game granted a lot of which is same old same old it is still quite fun. Always is fun take a fleet of ships to blow up some zombies.Dont Starve A game with a simple premise. Dont starve. Simple? Not quite. You are dropped in the map with nothing and have to find a safe place before night least the monsters get up. Craft food weapons magic lots of stuff. Be careful least the wolves hunt you down. Or the spiders. Or with the dlc Giants. Can you do it? Can you survive?World of Goo is a great little puzzle game. I am not often a fan of puzzle games but I still find it good. Use goo balls to get to the end simple but can get very hard.  Last we have EMUsSo for these well I shall just name some systems that older computer can play and a good game or two for each. No links because duh but still.So about the easiest system to emu at least with games a lot of people want to play is NES. I dont know your OS so I can suggest emus so on to games. For NES you have Super Mario Brothers  The Legend of Zelda MegaMan games and Metroid. Lots of great game series were started here so always fun to go back and play.SNES is also pretty easy to emu for even low end systems. This has lots of great hidden gems like E.V.O. The Search for Eden Harleys Humongous Adventure and The Simpsons  Barts Nightmare as well as tons of well known ones like The Legends of Zelda Mario MegaMan Donkey Kong ect.N should play on your system as well. This again has lots of great series as well as games like Conkers Battle Tanks Goldeneye and Super Smash Bros.GBCA also have a lot of great games. You must know of the Pokemon games there is also some MegaMan games Mario games Donkey Kong and lots more big games. There is also some lesser known ones. I personally LOVE Zoids Legacy. Then there is Golden Sun games Dungeon Dice Monsters Summon Knight and Great Greed.GenesisCDX has some good games. I havent played much as I was in more of a Nintendo house growing up. I do know that Sonic is pretty good as is Road Rage Jurassic Park games Castlevania and Lunar  The Silver Star.Game Gear will run too but this I really dont know any games with this.You can likely get PSX to run as I ran it on a Win PC. This has games like Digimon World Vigilante   Silent Hill Jade Cocoon and tons more. It is really a great system for RPGs.Their are tons of other emus that will run too. Any none d system should play fine.This took me over an hour to compile plus another hour wasted when I accidentally navigated away. So I hope you enjoy it .,lowendgaming,cnb0jar,6,t5_2u51f

7800111,0,t3_4m5s0k,That integrated GPU might not be properly capable of running Skyrim very well but you can probably scrape out more FPS by lowering the resolution assuming youre not already at the lowest setting available. Hard to tell from your post since Im not sure if the x is referring to the max resolution of your monitor or the resolution youre using ingame or both for that matter.You can also try running either the standalone HiAlgoBoost or the specific HiAlgoBoost for Skyrim mod What this programmod does is dynamically lower the resolution while the game is running while leaving the HUD intact. This has the effect of improving FPS while youre e.g. turning your character around or in combat or something at the expense of lower visual quality but since the scene is moving the visual quality drop is not terribly noticeable. Not sure if your iGPU is supported though but its worth a shot. I recommend trying the standalone version in the first link since I think its more uptodate plus it works with some other DirectXbased games.Anyway good luck.,lowendgaming,d3sskmi,5,t5_2u51f

If you have those drivers cant remember the name and the most recent example All the normal low end gaming tricks can be used as well as downloading MSI Afterburner and increasing your clocks in small increments Mhz while in ratio of course until you get stability issues. My Quadro FX M can usually clock Mhz to the core and Mhz to the memory. The shader core automatically scales with the core clock or should. If youre Display is saying Intel HD  you might want to see if you are setting games to play with the actual Nvidia GPU instead of the integrated graphics as well.

10267945,0,t3_5n12ay,It will use the full TDP of W.  Thats one site with their specialized usagesetup.  If you look at every other site that does actual power consumption analysis of the cards for gaming the max power draw tends to be W under full load stress testing Toms Hardware TechPowerUp  Heres the thing the ti was marketed as a low power consuming GPU so if it actually consumed even less power than the reference W TDP Nvidia and all the card manufacturers would have taken full advantage of that as a marketing tool.If the PSU calculators are saying W max load with the ti installed you should be alright.  Ive done similar calculations for others in the past and had results in the s so W doesnt sound to far out there.,lowendgaming,dc7xeqt,3,t5_2u51f

Have a quick Google on possible OC of the iGPU and the RAM too I had that exact chip a few months back. If you go to ramd every time an APU laptop comes out with channel RAM the collective groan is pretty audible. See Digital Foundry coverage on fast vs slow DDRAs a critique of your component choice you could get a Pentium G and a used graphics card instead. ,lowendgaming,dd574h8,1,t5_2u51f

10937436,0,t3_5w7c7d,PCSX depends on the game. I only really tried RPG games Okami SMT  Nocturne Devil Summoner amp Persona amp Digital Devil Saga amp .hackInfection .hackG.U. vol. Kingdom Hearts Final Mix Kingdom Hearts  Final Mix and they all worked very well with average  speed and just a couple issues some stuff only works on Software rendering which slows down a lot some examples are Okamis scroll cutscenes at the end of chapters and illusory walls in Nocturne and Digital Devil Saga . Devil Summoner amp did slow down when walking on crowded streets though. I tried a couple other games Gran Turismo  Guitar Hero  Ratchet amp Clank but those either were way too slow or didnt work at all GT would only work on software renderer though this was back in v.. dont know how it goes nowadays. Youll often need to run it at native resolution though.PPSSPP should work without a hitch. I played around  games and only had any slowdown at all during one specific boss fight of Kingdom Hearts Birth By Sleep on Terras path.As for Dolphin I ran Ikaruga Skies of Arcadia and Tales of Symphonia with no issues but didnt really get much far on any of those so cant say for sure.Specs iM GB RAM Intel HD.,lowendgaming,de84bsz,4,t5_2u51f
11006807,0,t1_deekc60,I bought mine in late  so I suppose the market was different then from when the FX  was originally released. And its clocked at . GHz. I actually almost commented on overclocking in my original comment but decided against it. The thing is I could spend  on a decent cooler and overclock it but I feel like that would be wasted money when I would just rather save up for a new i or a Ryzen chip. The games that Ive been having trouble with are Rise of the Tomb Raider Deus Ex Mankind Divided The Witcher  amp  These games are by far the worst offenders. The Witcher  actually does a much better job holding  fps Crysis  Battlefield  and Batman Arkham City. Thats not to say that all of these games are struggling the entire time but its frequent enough that it really annoys me. Also I should probably note that my flair is outdated and Ive since upgraded to a GTX  GB. When I made that upgrade thats when I really started to see some major bottlenecking on the CPU side.,lowendgaming,defl9yn,1,t5_2u51f

11242751,0,t3_60bu3o,Come on dude. Dont even pull that bullshit on me. Thats the lamest excuse possible. I replied to you solely based on your comment about the music being the reason you didnt open the video. Dont try to martyr yourself by crying But my real reason was mobile you inconsiderate jerk! because thats really not even relevant to why I said anything to you. Theres no need to defend yourself here just dont whine about the music in someones video not meeting your standards when its not even actually present in the video and you misunderstood a different users comment. Also every subreddit is different and different types of videos get lists in the comments depending completely on who sees it. There is no hard and fast rule and thats something that rarely if ever happens in a small sub like this. Reddit mainstay or not. Try not to hurt yourself when you lift your oversized head up. Next time dont complain about something nonexistent and inconsequential and you wont have someone comment and hurt your feelings. ,lowendgaming,df6cl0s,0,t5_2u51f
