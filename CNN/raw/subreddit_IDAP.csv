Its prismacolor markers first.. i just lay down a base color with the markers and it looks shitty and really choppy then I use the same color prismacolor pencil and go right over it which smooths the surface out and blends each other color nicely.

1797612,0,t3_2f32he,I like the edit you made to the face as the original shading makes her face look a little harsh.  I agree with ufkwillrice said. You have the pencil down and should start adding in color.  Koras left arm is slightly too high up which makes it look a little unnatural. More practice with anatomy should help.  Koras wristbands ? hair and some of her clothing are so dark that they are approaching a black shade. If you darkened in those areas in your drawing it would complement the darker eyes you drew and make all of the details pop out. This is a really good drawing. Keep at it!,IDAP,ck5qka8,2,t5_2rbki

4651643,0,t3_3en5vq,One thing that beginner artist do is that they are way to hard and definite with their lines. The more you draw the looser and freer your lines become and the more accurate they become. I would say that you should focus more on the rough sketch and less on the finished lines. Start with the circles that block in the different areas like a circle for her arm head body and so forth. Then once you are happy with the proportions and posture pick and choose your lines that you use. You will be using different weight lines for different parts of the figure. The hair for example is all the same thickness of lines but when you look at pictures of hair youll see that the upper part is much lighter and thus should be depicted with very feathery lines while the lower part of the hair will have much thicker lines or even large areas of solids. Usually the bottom of objects will get much thicker lines than tops. You can ever experiment with putting heavy shading on the bottom of objects and no lines on the top. Its called art because there are no fast rules for anything but there is a ton of fun options to play with. Just stay loose and have fun. And draw a ton. Youll be able to see your progress if you do. ,IDAP,ctgwfsf,2,t5_2rbki

Maybe let them feel other emotions? Youve got the basis for an interesting unique style and youre drawing yourself into a feedback loop.

10115980,0,t1_dbq3o9f,There are some pretty good tutorials out there on it. Ill see if I can lay it down simply.This was done in photoshop CC. Start by lowering the flow and opacity of your brush. I like near or under  for flow around    for opacity. Play with it and you can find what you like. Paint one color then pick another color and paint next to it. The area between the colors should be a blend of both of them. Pick that color and use it to blend between the two. Now youll have  main colors with some blending between them. I dont know if Im making sense lol. Let me see if I can find a video... Here you go. This explains it way better than I can! ,IDAP,dbq4c3e,2,t5_2rbki
