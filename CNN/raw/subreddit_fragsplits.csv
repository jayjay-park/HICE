This batch was considered to be the fruity more pineapple batch from some people online. Many had said that was the closest batch there was to the famous z batch. However I really didnt think it smelled too much different from a  oz bottle I own.

9972586,0,t3_5i7pnj,Its a toss up between Ambra Aurea Profumum Roma and Ascot Moon Xerjoff. First off I get poor longevity on most perfumes. I think the longest Ive worn was Tabac Blond wish it was a less powdery. Ascot Moon has a long spicy musk glow but for some reason I dont get the green horse club vibe. Ambra Aurea is incense amber scent that lasted for a week on a shirt of mine and on myself I could still smell in the next morning. ,fragsplits,db7ge30,2,t5_2zkcn
