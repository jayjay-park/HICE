5479127,0,t3_3pz05l,Awesome youre at exactly the same stage as me.I started reading Valiant because I saw a copy of Imperium and wanted to start from the beginning. I was mostly looking forward to Harbinger and a little hesitant about XO Manowar after hearing it was somewhat like a Conan the Barbarian in modern times making me think it was just a big strong guy who hits people with big weapons.Fortunately its far surpassed my expectations. I both like this character and am excited to read more.Whats surprised my somewhat so far is the fast pace things move along. I dont feel like Im missing anything at all and theres a setup and payoff within a few pages at times. That may be a factor of establishing a character and world as quickly as possible and things slowing down later but Im enjoying the writing for now so well see how things go.,valiant,cwc0cu8,2,t5_2u4gf

6029973,0,t3_3y13qh,If you want it all start at the beginning every Valiant tittle is not only worth reading but like marvel and dc share a universe thats very diverse. The reading order is pretty spot onNow there are later jumping on points so you dont have to play catch up and that why that guy suggested the valiant. But if you want to be really invested in these characters start from the beginningPersonal favorites bloodshot xo manowar SHADOWMAN though others dont like him as much and of course Divinity ,valiant,cya1qtt,5,t5_2u4gf

6823564,0,t3_48u03c,A House style is much more noticeable on the original Valiant titles where Barry Smith seems to act as a sort of Art Director. He drew Solar AlphaOmega the endcap books of Unity the first dozen or so issues of Archer and Armstrong most of which he wrote the first ish of X a few Eternal Warriors and a deathmate prologue...You look at David Laphams early work on Shadowman and Harbinger and its not hard to see where hes drawing his cues fromespecially when you see how he draws Stray Bullets after parting ways with Shooter. At this point Valiant has so many different kinds of artists that I dont think you can say they have a house style. Sure at their Launch they had some very servicable but bland commerciallooking books along with some straight up bad looking books. If they have a house style I think its rooted in the similarities between Clayton Henry and Francis Portellas styles. Clean precise open realistic but open to exxageration.The upcoming Bloodshot Annual looks like a pretty good indicator of where their visual range is heading as opposed to a house style This books got Kano doing a Paolo Rivera thing along with Michel Fiffe and Benjamin Marra.The Arival of Fiffe and Marra along with Rafer Roberts is a pretty strong indicator that even though Valiant uses marvel and dc workhorses like Nord one of their best Hairsine barf Crain THE best theyve also got their eye towards alternative comics even Katy Skelly got a variant cover on Dr. Mirage!It think that with the arrival of David Lafuentes postCapcomJoe MAD! style kind of shows that that there really is no more house style at Valiantgood comics with unique looks is the name of the game from where Im sitting.,valiant,d0pr00f,2,t5_2u4gf

8144358,0,t1_d4ve8bt,Ill check out the AampA You know this is the problem I have.......I want people to like comicbooks I really do but it can very intimidating to recommend a book to someone new to comics they are TONS of them as soon as you recommend something to them it gets cancelled. Most people see a TV series or a movie and want to feel the magic that winded off scream with them. Marvel has been doing miracles in the movie department for a while and DC will eventually find their balance but I really see Valiant and Image really being the big . If they can get material on Screen and spread to a wider audience that would be great also yes Shadowman started off kinda dull they should of left Milligan on it from start to finish ,valiant,d4vl9va,2,t5_2u4gf

10808035,0,t3_5uizg1,What type of reads do you like? Heavy dark? Light funny? Scifi? Solo? Team? I read a lot of Image as well as well as other independents Valiant though is a little different. Its the only other comic book universe out there where multiple titles and character interact. Its the only company that is comparable to the big two and in my opinion as far as story telling and art and continuity is concerned it blows Marvel and DC out of the water. So think of Valiant in this light. You are about to enter a universe and you will be very happy to do so. Welcome you are in for a treat. ,valiant,ddurtvx,4,t5_2u4gf
11549154,0,t1_dg531g8,Palmer finally having enough would be fitting but also dont see how it sets Harbinger Wars . I figure its basically either Faith Peter or Kris  with Peter being the only good option. Faith is to over so killing her wouldnt be good. Kris would be yet another bury your Lesbians and thats already after they killed off Charlene. Peter being Stier makes having him off the board interesting. Torque like thatd kind of suck since I kinda like the big lug but also dont see him as super important. ,valiant,dg53laq,3,t5_2u4gf
