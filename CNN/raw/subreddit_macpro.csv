Theres really no advantage to direct connecting to the router if the switch also connects to it wont double your upstream router is the bottleneck no matter how you connect to it. If you only use the nas for the pro the. You could direct connect so youre not saturating your switch while transferring stuff but I assume it needs to be on the switch otherwise your probably just have direct connected storage.So you wont break anything but you wont get any benefits either unfortunately,macpro,cxusnur,2,t5_2uq28

7253201,0,t1_d21egcy,Worked with an Apple genius last night Apparently they were totally unaware that Mac Pro aluminum towers were affected by this in the help desk support.There is no direct solution However I managed to create a new boot image for Maverics and install it on a separate drive in my MacPro. Once done I was able to start up Bootcamp and create the Driver USB image Maverics is Bootcamp .. the last to support the aluminum tower MacPro. Once complete and for safety sake I shut down rather than have Bootcamp create the partition and install windows.Once shut down I removed all drivers but the one that would become the new Windows bootcamp drive. Inserted the windows install disk into the dvd tray and booted with the option key. Did a full install of Windoze started updates and installed the bootcamp utilities via the USB key. After windows was updates and protected with AV and Malware protections. I shutdown again re installed the other drives and booted using the option key. Once up I selected the ElCap partition and booted to it. Once in I wend to the control panel for startup disk selected the now visible Bootcamp Drive and rebooted. Windows comes up I then went to bootcamp control panel and selected boot to OS X and it rebooted back to OS X..Problem solved in a roundabout way but solved...,macpro,d22my3a,1,t5_2uq28

They are being dropped for support with macOS Sierra later this fall  The   model is still supported and a  model can have the firmware flashed to become a  but you will need to upgrade the CPU to support Sierra.  There are other upgrades you should factor in to a  model namely replacing the AirPort card with something that supports Continuity  I personally have a  flashed to  with a core Westmere CPU Xeon W and am pretty happy with it.,macpro,d4jc0aw,2,t5_2uq28

9127275,0,t3_55absd,gt Does it make more sense to rather just go with a USB  based SD card reader than an internal one?Yes.gt Does it really make such a huge difference to boot from an SSD vs. the HDD?Oh my yes!gt Will  GB of RAM be sufficient or should I look to upgrade it to  GB?Really depends on your workloads.  If youve got really complicated projects then rendering and exporting may be improved with more RAM.,macpro,d88y7bh,3,t5_2uq28

11680994,0,t3_66mms5,If you want PCIE SSD speed the two options are an external TB PCIE expansion device with a PCIE SSD in it or a TB RAID enclosure with many SATA SSDs in RAID .Both solutions are as expensive or more expensive than a new internal Apple SSD.Any fast storage solution for the Trashcan Mac Pro will be ridiculously overpriced. Thats a key feature of these machines. That was no secret from day one. The only affordable solution will be a USB enclosure which is in the range of SATA SSD speeds  MBs.,macpro,dgk22pl,2,t5_2uq28
