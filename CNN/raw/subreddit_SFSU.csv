794737,0,t3_238oat,Its a trade off dorms at state are a little on the higher side for shared rooms but you meet a ton of people that will really make your college life and experience a whole lot better. Being in the dorms you have limitless social contact which is great but it can really be a dread if youre trying to study. I really suggest the dorm life at least for the first year so you can get the ball rolling. ,SFSU,cgum5fd,5,t5_2roxy
835064,0,t1_cgz5n9u,North of Golden Gate Bridge is going to be Sausalito. I rented in Sausalito and while my place was somewhat expensive  it was still significantly cheaper than San Francisco. It also included a view of the bay. It can also be a lot cheaper if you look. I have a friend who is paying  a month smaller place but right off Bridgeway main strip of Sausalito. North of Sausalito is going to be Mill Valley Larkspur and then San Rafael San Rafael will probably be the cheapest other than Novato. Im not including Belvedere Strawberry or Tiburon as I assume theyre going to be more expensive. I personally dont recommend Novato as its going to be too far north and I personally dont like Novato as much as the other cities. I just realized I also forgot Marin City which I dont know a lot about other than its bad reputation.,SFSU,cgz76ik,1,t5_2roxy

2206721,0,t1_cljvr29,If you are thoroughly engaged in what you study fascinated by it you will have no trouble finding success academically. HS is generalized education it is boring. College provides thousands of topics and an opportunity to select courses that interest you. It is easier than HS to want good grades because you give a fuck about what youre learning.I aced all the classes I actually liked at UCLA and Cd the boring ones. The ones I loved and got As in were considerably harder too paleopathology,SFSU,clkbtjs,0,t5_2roxy

5829619,0,t3_3uyt4f,Online classes generally have office hours or scheduled appointments via email or you can just email the professor back and forth.  Advantages Goes with your schedule classes tend to be a little easier in my opinion  Disadvantages Since youre not in person some questions will be hard to articulate over email. Since youre not on campus for class the likelyhood of going to office hours drops immensely. More likely to procrastinate on homework and online lectures.Anyways heres my  cents on when you should take online classes  Any class you can learn from the book yourself take online management history english etc.  Any class that is more conceptual and while you can learn from the book will be harder to do so. Take these classes in person Math Physics Major classes etc.  ,SFSU,cxjseqs,1,t5_2roxy
