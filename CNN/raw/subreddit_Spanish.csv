156659,0,t1_cew0eq6,. oops didnt mean to take out the una there!. no its not a grammatical error it just sounded very repetitive. In English you could just as easily say A good person is one who... instead of saying a good person is a person who... It sounds more natural. And no definitely not. Article rules for Spanish and English are different remember. You only say person es ARTICLE job if the job is modified by an adjective. example Juan es un maestro inteligente. But if all you want to say is Juan is a teacher you say Juan es maestro.. with ayudar I think you mean which tense is it being conjugated in. Its part of speech is verb but its in subjunctive. . I would just make it one sentence. Even in English that is a little awkward. I would say He thinks that all people should know their own personal flaws as well as their strengths. or something to that effect.. last sentenceconocer has to become reflexive because the agent of the action is also the recepient of the action he is KNOWING himself. and the a si mismo note that si should NOT have an accent s means yesanother stupid mistake I made. wow it was early in the morning hahaha just means himself. Its just a phrase used to make sure that the reader knows when you say conocerse you mean that he is getting to KNOW HIMSELF.

182607,0,t3_1w6w79,This excerpt from the wikipedia page  sums up my previous experience withunderstanding of the word In modern usage in the United States the term cholo usually indicates a person of Mexican or MexicanAmerican descent who is associated with a particular Southwestern style of dress. The term is used in Cal slang but it in turn has infiltrated into mainstream American English use specifically in association with American cultural subgroups such as the lowrider car culture or the hip hop scene in general.However Im from the northeastern U.S. and had never heard that term until I lived in Mexico for a couple years so while wikipedia says thats a U.S. usage Id extend that to U.S. and Mexico at least.

Affective filter hypothesis of article  Input hypothesis sfw gtgtThe affective filter is an impediment to learning or acquisition caused by negative emotional affective responses to ones environment. It is a hypothesis of secondlanguage acquisition theory and a field of interest in educational psychologygtAccording to the affective filter hypothesis certain emotions such as anxiety selfdoubt and mere boredom interfere with the process of acquiring a second language. They function as a filter between the speaker and the listener that reduces the amount of language input the listener is able to understand. These negative emotions prevent efficient processing of the language input.  The hypothesis further states that the blockage can be reduced by sparking interest providing lowanxiety environments and bolstering the learners selfesteem.gtAccording to Krashen   there are two prime issues that prevent the lowering of the affective filter. The first is not allowing for a silent period expecting the student to speak before they have received an adequate amount of comprehensible input according to their individual needs. The second is correcting their errors too earlyon in the process.gtInteresting Stephen Krashen | Secondlanguage acquisition | Natural approach | Theories of secondlanguage acquisition Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcgmgf oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecgmgf.

1803105,0,t3_2f6n79,Direct objects are nouns that answer what? Or whom? about a verb. For example I told the story. What did I tell? The story. I knew him. Whom did I know? Him. Most direct objects in English come right after the verb and are not in every sentence verbs that use a to be verb do not have objects and phrasal verbs  verbs that have a verb and a pronoun as part of the phrase  do not have a direct object. Now look at these in Spanish I told him the story  Cont el cuento. The pronoun would be Lo because el cuento is masculine amp singular so you could rewrite this as Lo cont. I knew her  Conoca a ella. The pronoun would be La because ella is feminine amp singular so you could rewrite this as La conoca. Note the usage of the personal a.Spanish has the following direct object pronouns|        |Singular| Plural | Example w English Translation|||||||st person|me | nos | Me conociste en la fiesta. You met me at the party. Whom did you meet? Me   Ella nos llam ayer. She called us yesterday. Whom did she call? Us.|nd person| te | os| No creo que te conozcan los chicos. I dont think the guys know you. Whom dont the guys know? You.   Ellas quieren invitaros a la fiesta. They want to invite you guys to the party. Whom do they want to invite? You guys.|rd person|lola|loslas| Pas toda la noche escribiendo la carta gt pas toda la noche escribindola. I spent the whole night writing the whole letter it. What did you spend all night writing? The letter. Es necesario que tomes refrescos gt Es necesario que los tomes. Its necessary that you drink some refreshments them. What do you need to drink? RefreshmentsIndirect object pronouns primarily refer to people and answer the question to whom? or for whom?  a quin? or para quin?. They usually only appear in sentences that also have a direct object as well. For example I wrote the letter to her which is the same as I wrote her the letter in which her is the indirect object because to whom did I write the letter? Her. Or in Spanish Le escrib la carta a ella or simply Le escrib la carta.|        |Singular| Plural | Example w English Translation|||||||st person|me | nos | El camarero me trajo el agua. The waiter brought me the water. To whom did the waiter bring the water? Me.  Mi mam nos dio dinero para hacer la compra. My mom gave us money to run errands. To whom did my mom give money? Us|nd person| te | os| Yo siempre te digo la verdad. I always tell you the truth. To whom do I always tell teh truth? You.   Os pudiera hacer una pregunta? Could I ask you guys a question? To whom do I want to ask a question? You guys.|rd person|le|les| l ya le cont lo ocurrido a ella. He already told her what happened. To whom did he already tell what happened? Her.   Yo les traigo las bebidas a Uds. inmediatamente. Ill bring you your drinks right away. To whom am I bringing the drinks? You plural.Placement is slightly different  object pronouns go before the conjugated verb in Spanish. However they can be attached to an infinitive or gerund ndo form of a verb. If there is a direct amp indirect object pronoun in the same sentence they must be right next to each other and the indirect pronoun goes first. If two pronouns are attached to an infinitive or gerund a written accent must go over the aer of the infinitive Decrmelo or the ea of the gerund Dicindomelo. However if an object pronoun is attached to the gerund an accent is required even for one  dicindome for example. But decirme does NOT need an accent over the i as it is only one pronoun. If both pronouns begin with l the first is changed to se  Le lo Se lo digo.Hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions. ,Spanish,ck6fj6w,13,t5_2qtt1
1814338,0,t1_ck7rl6r,When I was in the th grade I taught ESL students. In my neighborhood all of the ESL students were Spanishspeaking from Mexico. It was one of the hardest tutoring jobs Ive ever had but most rewarding. I read a book with the specific kid that I tutored. I read aloud to him and I made him read to me too. Him knowing that I was there to help him if I got stuck on words was a big part in actually making him be more willing to learn! Vocabulary is a big part of it. The class was provided translations for words they might have felt the need to say in English. And honestly there was always a kid who knew more Spanish than another so the kids who knew more English were a great help. They could translate to the other kids in a way that would make them understand better. We also had way dictionaries. Patience is hard especially when my person refused to abide the no Spanish if youre not asking for help rule  but it is so rewarding. I also got the challenge to somewhat tutor a guy who spoke a language that I cant even remember the name of. He was Muslim  all I remember. It was a lot harder to help him because there were a lot of moments where translation wasnt possible but no one nearby could help. I was surprised that the foreign exchange student program that he was in even let him come to America. There were so many times he could not understand his assignments. But even more than that the Japanese students. ,Spanish,ck7t4pl,2,t5_2qtt1

And Im sure if you look back at the beginning of the six months youll see youve learned a lot.  But six months isnt a huge amount of time to learn a language.  There a lot to control.  There will be points of success where things come together and then more struggle.   Thats normal.  Things are clickingor have clickedseveral times. Im sure.  But if youre waiting for a big moment when everything makes sense well that will take more time. It took years to master your own native language.

2788083,0,t1_cnkw9s7,Yes I know. In many cases the distinction is merely political but in some others it is much clearer. Catalan and Valencian are a good example. They are considered by linguistics to be two varieties or dialects of the same language which normally goes simply by the name of Catalan language. Technically there are several Catalan dialects the Central and Northwestern spoken in Catalonia the Valencian in Valencia and the Balearic Balearic Islands. However many people against Catalan nationalism use the idea that Valencian is actually a different language within the GalloRomance family but not Catalan while the Catalan nationalists say they both are dialects of the same language. People in the Balearic Islands do not have this problem however and openly admit that Balearic is just a dialect of the Catalan language while this is very controversial in Valencia. Its just a local example of how the language vs. dialect problem can be political just like you said.However the rest of the languages spoken in Spain are languages in their own right.,Spanish,cnkzuck,1,t5_2qtt1

3149205,0,t1_conizh3,Los diptongos tienen que ver con una alteracin fonolgica que sucedi cuando el castellano se desenvolva del latn. En castellano las vocales medias breves del latn en slabas tnicas se convirtieron en diptongos. Las otras vocales bajas y altas se mantuvieron sencillas. La primera vocal de la palabra VENTVS  o un fonema parecido como es difcil de saber al cierto cmo el latn se pronunciaba en latn se convirti en un diptongo je en viento en castellano. Sin embargo en slabas tonas las vocales breves no se convirtieron en diptongos por ejemplo cuando se aade un sufijo como oso que a su vez viene del sufijo latn OSVS en el que la O tnica es larga. Por eso la E de VENTOSVS se conserva en el espaol ventoso como queda en slaba tona. La otra vocal breve tnica del latn la o se convierte en el diptongo  we en el espaol. Por eso nos podemos dar cuenta de que la palabra cuervo viene de CORVVS. Esta o es la otra vocal media breve que existe en latn. El nico sufijo que permite mantener estos diptongos en una slaba tona es el simo como otros ya notaron. Las otras vocales breves es decir altas y bajas no se convirtieron en diptongos. Por eso la V de MVLTVS se pronuncia igual que la u en mucho la I de FILVM se pronuncia igual que la i en hilo y la A de CATTVS se pronuncia igual que la a en gato. Las otras alteraciones que vemos se tratan de otra cosa intento enfocar slo en esta diptonguizacin sin entrar en detalles sobre alteraciones consonnticas ni ms voclicas.  Es interesante notar que en otros idiomas como el portugus y el cataln estas no se convirtieron en diptongos. Por eso CORVVS en portugus corvo y en cataln corb y VENTVS se dice vento en portugus y vent en cataln. Esta es una explicacin brevsima de tan slo un cambio fonolgico de muchos pero es un tema interesante y lo hall relevante a esta discusin. ,Spanish,cooeu70,3,t5_2qtt1

This occurs in your example se encuentran and also commonly in se vende se alquila and all over the place.Spanish isnt very comfortable with the use of the passive voice in the present tense and so the avoidance of the passive is extremely common.

3629572,0,t3_31xu7x,The number one thing people dont talk about when it comes to learning Spanish  in my opinion is the fact that you will very rarely hear each individual word clearly.  of the time you will hear words blending together. You just have to get used to it. There is a trick to it though. If its the same letter sound at the end of one word and at the beginning of the next word they blend. Ex De ellos will sound like Dellos. La abuela will sound like Labuela. As far as I know there is no limit to this rule so you could have an entire sentence said as if it was a single word. So you may see something like La abuela hace ejercicios but hear Labuelacejercicios. It may help if you stop trying to hear each word. Just listen and try to get the gist of the conversation. Eventually youll get to the point where you can accurately predict what was said. You also need to give it time.

5160034,0,t3_3lnvqa,Hey I started out in a similar situation. I came here one year ago after one spanish class at uni. Im currently living in Sevilla Spain and I think im at a B level now. The biggest problem for me in the beginning was that I was so shy and I would get easily flustered. To get over it I just reminded myself how i feel when a non native english speaker talks to me. I dont think theyre stupid I wouldt laugh....Its the same concept. No one will laugh at you or ignore you or think youre stupid. And you have to try no matter what every time youre in a spanish speaking situation try. If you cant keep up with the conversation then listen and try to pick up words and context. Its so easy as native speakers to just speak in english all day I work in english my friends and english and i speak with my spanish boyfriend in English. You can honestly live here and never learn Spanish its easy I have friends doing it. This is why you need to talk in Spanish at least once a day with whomever you can. Too many people think they can just show up in a country and somehow theyll learn it. You wont unless you put some effort in.As for understanding dont feel discouraged. When you dont understand just agree or ask for clarification. Another thing to keep in mind is who youre talking with. Younger people are easier to understand especially those from mediumlarge cities. Older people or those from small pueblos...much harder... As an example Im at a point where I can understand the majority of everyday interactions. My boyfriends university friends? Yes. A movie in Spanish? Yes. But I talk with my boyfriends family nearly every day AND I CANNOT UNDERSTAND THEM... seriously. I understand the words but i dont get the meaning... Usually I just smile and say yes or maybe or I dont know... It has been like this for a year and I live with them at the moment so i have to speak with them nearly every day. Its the same with my boyfriends friends who are from a small pueblo in extremedura...it might as well be another language. I also have the added difficulty that andalucian spanish skips a ton of letters.... generally they drop the s and sometimes the d. For example pescado becomes pecao.... The upside is that learning a difficult accent first will help me understand a wider range of people. The downside is that I now talk with an andalucian accent and sound ridiculous...My point is is that it will get easier and it might take a while but youre progress is directly related to the amount of spanish you expose yourself to.

I feel that despite all the PC todays society is way more sexist.I think most of the problem is that native speakers feel that its a proposal made by outsiders though therere some advocates in Spain and also because it looks like it comes from people who dont understand how the language gender works Someone in this thread said change feminine with type A and masculine with Type B and neutral just happens to match Type B and you have no grounds to talk about sexism.Of course there are some sexist commenters too this is Reddit after all.The only real problem is for people who dont identify with either gender I know they exist in the US never encountered in Spain because I have no idea how they refer to themselves.,Spanish,czktnfp,1,t5_2qtt1

As the word suggests a desubicado is somebody who is out his social place. It sounds to me like a grosero but worse generally because the offended party is of higher status. A student insulting a teacher in an argument would be a perfect example of a particularly bad desubicado. I think Ive heard highschool teachers use the word when scolding somebody.

9342753,0,t1_d908xgo,I changed my word order to SVO when I was talking with Spanish speakersso they could better understand me but the standard in Chavacano is VSO. The sample above is Chavacano de Cavite and the poem has Tagalog loanwords and follows a VSO word order. I speak Chavacano de Zamboanga and we have two ways of speaking the formal and informal. I had to speak in formal when I was speaking with Spanish speakers as that way of speaking contains more Spanish words.I know which words come from which most of the time so I just Hispanicized Frenchsounding English words when I knew the Chavacano word was of native origin and I was correct most of the time.If you want to better understand Chavacano just remember that the subject comes after the verb and that all our verbs are in the infinitivo. We add a ta to make it futuro a ya for the presento and an ay for the preterito.,Spanish,d909ela,2,t5_2qtt1

9439222,0,t1_d9caymu,gtNow to try to translate into the English it fails to capture that sense of a complete and total giving over to the butchery. Of course its possible to do so but then I think you need to use indirect and relative concepts to capture the same sense no longer being a direct translation of the word.Youd be astounded by what a gifted translator can do. Again this notion of direct translation seems impractical to me. Look at any professional translation and youll see the translator frequently avoids the most literal or obvious translations while still preserving the tone and meaning of the original text with great fidelity. Whether they achieve this with fewer or more words than the author is irrelevant. Perhaps the translation will not be by your definition direct but there is nothing to be lost or gained from that. Now when it comes to texts rich with puns alliteration onomatopoeia and the like some wordplay and shades of meaning may not survive fully intact but generally speaking translators are very good at what they do.gtWell actually to breakfast is a verb so there is a direct equivalent.If you or anyone you know has ever used breakfast as a verb or ever heard it used that way I will eat my shoe for breakfast ,Spanish,d9chkti,2,t5_2qtt1

9774227,0,t3_5d0vj6,Ive done some research into stress patterns in Italian and French and from Latin it is clear that Italian and Spanish went one direction to become very stressheavy and stressimportant languages.On the other hand French went the other direction in its development. It has almost no discernible stress mostly lengthening and no obvious pattern or correct way to say polysyllabic words. Shifts in the lengthened syllable can change for the same word depending on the context.When I listen carefully to French I do perceive a stressed syllable and the same word can be pronounced with the stress or lengthened syllable moving. In Spanish you can only say eleFANte never Elefante. It appears that nativespeakers of Spanish hear it too. Google translate elefante to French and listen to pronunciation lphant gt  Elephant Then Google translate cuatro elefantes van a la escuela to French and listen quatre lphants vont  lcole gt  elephants Apparently in French at the sentence level the last syllable of a phrase is stressed in this case the noun phrase is quatre lphants.Of course in English and Spanish whether we say the word alone or say it in a phrase the correct stressed syllable is  obvious and  does not change elephant gt  Elephant  four elephants gt  four Elephants  elefante gt  eleFANte  four elephants gt  CUAtro eleFANtes This is a very interesting thread on wordreferenceApparently Frenchspeakers learning Spanish are confounded by the importance of stress in Spanish not only for proper pronunciation and cadence but also for meaning in cases such as termino vs. termin vs. trmino.Italian developed like Spanish and in fact has much simpler stress norms that mirror Spanish norms that are much easier to articulate as general rulesofthumb for pronunciationThese general patterns in Italian in fact support my simple articulation of the stress pattern in Spanish before the last consonant a vowel after the last consonant does not count. Im not sure if Italian orthography addresses the problem of common inflectional suffixes that are consonants which Spanish handily addressed simply by saying no cuentan.,Spanish,dahw1jz,1,t5_2qtt1

11265087,0,t1_df76k3w,I wholeheartedly agree that people shouldnt be looking to acquire a second language exclusively through television or film but its just as spurious to suggest that conversation is the one way to acquire a second languageespecially early on. Youre stating a hypothesis as though it were fact. Oral conversation isnt necessary at all for learning to read and write a second language though I imagine this is neither here nor there given that most people do want to learn how to communicate orally. I suspect based on Comprehensible Input theory that the main issue with watching television is that vocabulary is not sheltered and therefore too much of the input is not comprehensible enough to be efficiently acquired. Though adherents to Communicative Teaching theory might disagree appropriate audiovisual input probably would be a shortcut in the sense that it may better prepare novices for the level in which conversation becomes effective and efficient.I took you up on your challenge to look up evidence and the first few Google Scholar results actually do provide evidence that at least mitigates your claims. Watching television with audio and subtitles in the second language does produce incidental acquisition . Television is effective if the input is comprehensible and if L and L are similar enough one can possibly acquire L through television Krashen suggests here that as a result television may only be effective at the intermediate level but he doesnt appear to be taking into account the possibility of programs created using sheltered vocabulary for language learners There are anecdotal cases of people who have picked up second languages via television LarsenFreeman  for example cited a case of a German speaker who acquired Dutch via TV ... I am not claiming that it is impossible to acquire language from TV. I am only saying that comprehensible input is necessary for acquisition and that television provides little comprehensible input for a beginner. Intermediate level students may profit quite a bit from television and even radio. Krashen Stephen. Principles in Foreign Language Acquisition. p. .

11394067,0,t1_dfngt7x,Es ms o menos lo mismo que t. Algunos pases se usa en vez de t y en otros vienen juntos. Tpicamente el vos es ms informal que t.Tiene races con vosotros. vos  otros es el origen de la segunda persona plural. A veces se conjuga vos como vosotros tambin por ejemplo en el oeste de venezuela pero esa forma es anticuada. Pero si mirs Shreck vas a escuchar a Fiona decir que tipo de caballero sois vos? que en ingls significa what type of knight art thou?.Tambin usted tiene una etimologa muy interesante porque viene de vuestra merced o your grace en ingls. Por eso lo abreviamos como Vd. a veces.,Spanish,dfni2dy,1,t5_2qtt1

11623495,0,t1_dgdio1h,It would help but thats the sort of position that you generally dont need additional qualificationsskills to do like retail work so youd generally be at a disadvantage against native speakers of Spanish.  Especially true as this is normally the sort of job where youll hear a lot of colloquial speech which can be the big stumbling block for those speaking it as a second language.  This is all purely in terms of being hired.  Oce you have the job knowing Spanish would generally be helpful in many positions.,Spanish,dgdj954,4,t5_2qtt1

11730755,0,t1_dgpof54,So when the subject pronouns are used there is often a verb or an entire predicate that is omitted. Note To be clear when subject pronouns follow a preposition they are not actually prepositions in this case they are conjunctions.Let me give you some examples. l corre mas rpido que t corres Ella habla en una manera muy delicada como yo hablo Est pelcula es muy mala segn lo que dices t. In English this obviously works differently.  He eats like her  He eats like she eats. I arrived before him  I arrived before he arrived. She speaks in a very delicate manner like me  She speaks in a very delicate manner like how I speakI think this can be made the clearest using antes que vs. antes de. Antes de is a preposition that refers to the position of the subject in physical space relative to the prepositional object. Antes que is a conjunction that express that the first subject performs the predicate verb  action before the second subject. El nio est antes de m en la cola  the boy is ahead of me in the lineup. Yo termin todas las tares antes que t terminaste todas las tareas  I finished all the tasks before you did.,Spanish,dgppmjx,2,t5_2qtt1
