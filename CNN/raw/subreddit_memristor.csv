3863953,0,t1_cqwpjox,Essentially I want to be able to connect point A to point B. I want to use the memristor as a switch for a switchable communication channel for pulsed signals.I just have an idea for a full solution to the Von Neumann bottleneck and the only way I can do it is with a huge number of programmable switches. Of course it will also require a new kind of software model.,memristor,cqwq4ct,1,t5_2ssg5
3875625,0,t1_cqxbgtd,gtthe resistive range of memistors seems to be quite lowActually im working with a device fabricator that can tailor memristors to pretty much whatever you want. Onstate from Ohm to kOhm offstate to MOhms.gtI like the crossbar capability of memristors Dont forget about sneekpath issues with crossbars. Some memristors can be intrinsic diodes so that helps.Good luck!,memristor,cqy1z62,1,t5_2ssg5
