233626,0,t1_cf4y8yh,Hey thanks. Im actually doing fine now. I lost a bunch of hair and then... it just kind of stopped.Obviously Im not a doctor so I dont really know... but I wonder if gaining weight could cause hair loss as well? Maybe rapid weight GAIN could also do it? I dunno. I hope you figure it out and get on the track to stopping it. I know that when I was pulling out basically clumps of hair I felt sick. Its a very scary thing. Especially when it starts to feel like there is no end in sight and youll eventually have nothing left to lose. My hair is definitely a LOT thinner now. But it did stop. So I really hope its something simple that may even correct itself. Otherwise... go see another doctor! Get a second opinion. ,beauty,cf4yqpd,2,t5_2qlac

Pop an advil go to town suck for like  minutes max and a little sore the next day but bliss for a few weeks.  Try to do it every other week to stay on top of the little sprouts and you should be fine.  I let mine get a little wild and have to do the whole arm pit every time.

1267354,0,t3_28kvt9,Aveenos line is pretty good I dont think you need to see a doctor to use it safely. But a dermatologist can give you a prescription lotion to apply to specific patches and confirm that its eczema and not something else. I use the CeraVe line because its affordable gentle and moisturizing. Hydrating Cleanser and regular lotion interspersed with Simple brand face wipes during the day if my face feels dirty. Make sure anything you use is fragrance free. Ive had eczema since I was born and its been a constant battle. Also consider switching to fragrance free laundry products. Look for skin products with oatmeal and ceramides those tend to help the most. ,beauty,cic6z6k,1,t5_2qlac

I know the first month was a transition period but after a month I couldnt take it anymore my hair was a disaster. I have very thin flat hair and the nopoo process was my nightmare. It made my hair even more flat and obviously incredibly greasy. Shampoo works for me because it actually gives my hair the desperately needed volume. I also dont have time or the commitment for a complicated routine hence why shampoo is easy and works for my lifestyle.

Your eyebrows are perfectly fine sweetie. Have you tried penciling in some shape into them? For your left brow I would pluck a little bit off the top where it starts to rise to give it a straight shape similar to your right brow. Amazing things can be done with an artist and her eyebrow pencil! Try drawing in your brows give them the same shape despite them not actually growing in the same and no one will notice how your brows are different!

4672868,0,t3_3e09xb,Late thread but Im jumping in anyway If the cheaper version of the products works just as well I buy that. My mascara for example. Lipstick some eyeliner a few other things. Often though they dont. Drugstore foundation gives me a rash and the blush makes me look like Ronald McDonald.  Makeup is SO. FUN. The colors the packaging the different looks I can pick up by comparing with friends. Its awesome. I just bought a new palette for work and it makes me smile every time I look at it. It has this cute little tin that snaps shut and the colors are all pretty and I love it. I need it for my job. Low quality makeup would show in my workplace and I would lose work because of it. So I cough up the cash for the  foundation that looks ok in HD.  You mentioned brushes. Brushes are the  thing I would spend extra money on. With good brushes I can make shitty makeup work. I could probably pull off that  foundation with a good brush. When Im trying to create a particular look having the right brush will make the biggest difference in whether or not I can do it. Honestly it all comes down to the fact that I buy makeup in order to achieve a goal. That goal is usually either personal enjoyment or looking a particular way for work. In both cases more expensive makeup tends to further the goal. So thats what I usually buy.,beauty,ctjke2j,2,t5_2qlac

Cheaper irons and some more expensive irons will work great for a year or so but the wear and tear causes little nicks in the plates which causes hairs to start getting more damaged when they pass through them That GHD should be good for  years if used and maintained properly.

I try to keep it minimal  especially when its hot and humid since my vacations are usually to Disney World where no matter how well I think I set my face my makeup melts off. My personal concerns are my under eye circles and my lashes so I always bring an under eye concealer Maybellines Instant Age Rewind Eraser is my HG that can double as an eyeshadow primer and some kind of setting powder I hopped on the RCMA bandwagon but transferred some of it to a smaller sifter container since the original packaging sucks or else everything creases like a MF. Since I do like eyeshadow on vacation I try to narrow it down to one palette. Ive been brining my Too Faced Neutral Eyes palette because its small and has everything I need for my eyes. I also always bring a brown liner for my top lash line and a nude eyeliner for my bottom water line. Im a bit of a mascara junkie since my lashes are so wimpy so this is where I guess Im a bit excessive! I usually bring  mascaras and an eyelash curler but those dont really take up any room so I try to justify myself. For brushes I always have a blender brush and a regular eyeshadow brush as well as my Real Techniques sponge which I use for both my concealer and setting it with powder. My moisturizers have sun screen in them but I always reapply with normal face sunscreen i.e. the Neutrogena face sunscreen which is much easier to do when Im not wearing foundation! I also always have a lip balm with SPF in it that I reapply since its easy to forget about the lips!,beauty,d0tkwjy,1,t5_2qlac

Many chems are too harsh and need carrier oilsmediums. I was so pleased having never used the wet wound healing method before.After the irritation subsided I continued with gentle cleansing and care. And slowly weaned off the coconut oil transitioning back into normal products. Coconut oil does clog pores in the long run. I did forgo cosmetics during this time and if had to run out applied SPF.

8299216,0,t3_4t5mo8,Personally the one time I used an epilator i  got really really really bad ingrown hairs and for me it was so painful. I dont know how I did it so terribly wrong but my legs broke out in really bad spots that literally reduced me to tears I was probably overreacting but I was so scared they wouldnt go  but they did about two weeks later. I found leg waxing combats the issue of strawberry legs. But with shaving how regularly are you exfoliating and which products are you using? I really like using a natural scrub but I also love the soap and glory crush body scrub  and I usually exfoliate a day before shaving which seems to help. Have you tried changing the type of razor I found using one with a higher number of blades to be more effective amp shaving cream you use? Also ensure your razor isnt dull if you have to go over an area of skin multiple times to remove the hair the razor is probably dull as this can cause strawberry legs as the hair follicle isnt properly removed. Oh also shaving towards the end of a warm shower helps massively as the heat helps soften the hair and opens the pores making shaving easier and I wouldnt be a beauty fanatic if I didnt mention coconut oil which is also a great preshaving and post shaving lotion! ,beauty,d5eykji,2,t5_2qlac

8835760,0,t3_50rn3a,I suggest to go see a doc regarding the underlying hair loss problem. Iron deficiency is quite common and relatively easy to treat.  I would personally wait until you dont experience as much hair loss since theres always a chance of damaging your hair. If youre wanting to bleach the entire head up to the roots contact between the bleach may irritate your scalp which is not optimal for your situation. Another factor is the level of developer you use peroxide which determines how much your hair lifts. Youd have to use a higher level of developer if you want to lighten more meaning theres a larger chance of damaging your hair. ,beauty,d79xmsv,1,t5_2qlac

I feel like stuff can go wrong there burns open wounds from pimples skin ripping over drying which leads to producing more oil and then more pimples etc. Maybe try using a trimmer like the kind ppl use for trimming their pubes but use the facial or eyebrow attachment to get most of the peach fuzz length off. It may feel a little stubbly but how often are people caressing your face? Plus with regular razor shaving youre still gonna get stubble anyway so it wouldnt be that different right? Though if your facial hair is dark and more visible this may not help much.
