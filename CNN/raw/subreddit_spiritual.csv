3922572,0,t3_35crby,All of the spirit science videos are based on the work of Drunvalo Melchizedek and his books on the Ancient Secret of the Flower of Life. I would highly recommend the books. The person who makes the spirit sci videos even quotes them word for word sometimes.  A lot of the ideas are oversimplified I think but its definitely a great series for sharing knowledge about sacred geometry  definitely give the books a read! And if you watch the videos start at number one! It will make so much more sense that way. ,spiritual,cr3eqtx,5,t5_2qi6t

NDEs are often quite transformative and I know there is a lot of similarity in the actual experience e.g. tunneling but what happens after I havent seen much about.,spiritual,ctwlguu,1,t5_2qi6t

7274916,0,t3_4e5tuk,So I had the time to watch this video completely today. And Im sorry to say this but your understanding or lack of understanding of depression saddens me. You should know that psychologists have a high rate of depression and suicide. They spend their lives helping others they know they have purpose and they know that positive thoughts are the ways to be happy. If it was that simple they could fix themselves. ,spiritual,d253xx4,1,t5_2qi6t

11099106,0,t3_5yhat8,Love is the natural state of every being in the universe. Everything is love. If you meant romantic relationships then I would say theres a lot of brainwashing there. But still its possible to have relationships that are nurturing to the both people when there is a good enough level of conscious is achieved by the both of them.,spiritual,deq2ody,5,t5_2qi6t
11605427,0,t1_dgaugl3,Hmm.... IDK either... But your comments are giving me a lot to think about. Living the socalled intuitive life can be really scary  especially since I believe a vast majority of people dont live their lives like that. Whilst some people are more in tuned with their intuition its also something thats hard for a lot of people to trust because of the lack of evidence... And by the time the evidence does come around its too late to do anything. I dont believe in defects  I think we all have different tools which we use to understand the world and not everyone has the same tools. Do you consider yourself psychic? ,spiritual,dgbhgq1,2,t5_2qi6t
