The short supply of souls makes it hard to fuse gold cards right now. what i personally did was every time I got k gold Id spend it on a silver card pack. Did that enough times that my kenshi was fused  times. Also made sure my team was in the high s. After that everyone after Boss Reptile was a breeze.

4208807,0,t1_crz1h3z,I disagree unlike Injustice this game is centered around silvers.  I dont pay play about  opponent FW towers a day and maybe a pve tower once every few days.  The only time where I play  times a day and farm hard is on thursdays.  I kill FW with all silver Kenshi Scorpion Jax and used to with F Jacqui F Trooper amp Seargent but Jaqui went to F last thursday and broke the matchmaking for that team and now I replaced that with the family trio. I find that I get high enough on the latter to make it worth my time and now the only silver I miss is Kotal Kahn and the only bronze I miss is Monk.  At first I hated the Skull gate but unlike Injustice I feel like I can keep up with paytoplay gold teams with my fused silver teams.    edit  I also find block breaking equipment so crucial on the gold team that I do use ninj. Scorp inf. Scorp Kung Jin I give ninj. scorp block breaking so he can get to special  effectively and get to special  again in time to combo with infernos special .  Block breaking is so good right now.,mkxmobile,crzzpuk,0,t5_37lxm

4320516,0,t3_3ah7fo,I would always go for packs. Youll bore to death if you have only one decent team and have to wait for its energy. Also there a good Silver teams cage family and Kenshi amp friends that might be better than lots of gold with low fusion level.Secondly I wouldnt go for  battles towers for two reasons youll need souls to refill your Teams energy after battle  and youre very likely to get a really unfair opponent. I would sticky with  or  battles towers or just do the quicio tower if youre team is not good enough.,mkxmobile,cscnggp,2,t5_37lxm

If there is a good samaritan out there who can help me in iOS i swear you are a heavens gift. I dont play faction wars very much to rob anybody of rewards. I played like  times this year. I just want to have souls saved just in case a new character pops or a character can be bought by random inside packages  so i have enough souls to grind and get himher. Im not even hellbent on leveling my characters to level . I just love new characters and combine characters and see them play. Thats about it. I hope i hear from anybody. Im not greedy. The last time i was given a lot of souls was last year around july. I havent asked anybody since then. Anyway it was worth the try. I just love mortal kombat. Ever since elementary. And i am now .

9684769,0,t3_5drkuj,If you have some blood rubies to spare try getting that new weapon the ban of something or the other. It deals extra damage on resurrected enemies. I have it maxed out on my UHJC and I can deal over K damge using his Xray on any resurrected enemy,mkxmobile,da6upn9,2,t5_37lxm

9816701,0,t3_5fu2st,I think with high enough endurance the effects sometimes can fail to be applied. I have this sometimes happening to my characters with endurance bonuses. And this certainly occasionally happens when I attack others in FW.,mkxmobile,dan4ugx,1,t5_37lxm
9816853,0,t3_5fo6cz,Honestly all of them seem mostly useless to me without their max fusions. I think the only one you cant get more or less the same effect from a different card is the  damage against resurrected enemies card and even that one Im not all that excited to get. What Ill probably do is max out DELK and then collect enough rubies to max out one of them. Right now Im leaning towards the one that gives you a bar of power to basically have two Warhammers. ,mkxmobile,dan5k7y,1,t5_37lxm

10066246,0,t3_5junly,This and the longer Faction Wars are more like punishments than gifts. You get XP that youd get anyways and less souls and rubies for the extra FW time period. Double souls or rubies or even coins would have been more useful. ,mkxmobile,dbjnla5,1,t5_37lxm
