520990,0,t1_cfzhbf6,gt  Those are the hallmarks of those bands and the gothenburg soundYoure quite wrong here.Keys and synths are not hallmarks of the genre at all. Yes modern day melodeath bands will use them Scar Symmetry etc... but At The Gates never had a keyboardist and Dark Tranquility didnt really start using them until Projector  years in to their career. The Gothenburg sound was always more of a scream than a death growl. Again compare the vocals of In FlamesDTATG to comparative DM bands of the same time frame  ... Monstrosity CC Suffocation etc. If you seriosuly think this sounds more like Ozzy and BLS than Trivium or AX you really need your hearing checked. And yes many metal bands have used triplets just that triplet palm muring chugging riff is a signature of the MC style. ,songwriterscircle,cfzhowd,1,t5_30n3g
525842,0,t3_2057xy,my thought is  its a little hard to figure out the beat at first.  but once i get how it goes its a fun rhythm.  id say the same thing about the chord change when it switches from harmonica to guitar.  i mean the thing is once i hear it a few times i dont mind it at all and i think its kinda coolinteresting.  i do get the bob dylan feel though so i think that worked well  it came out definitely.  im actually wondering if  because of the construction maybe you dont even need as many of the lines halves to rhyme?  you do a lot of half rhymes anyway maybe it would be okay to switch some out for a nonrhyme if you think theres another good word to put in?  thats my thoughts.  do you have nonphone recording equipment btw?,songwriterscircle,cg01loa,2,t5_30n3g
576278,0,t1_cg5mgs5,Wow thank you so much for this fantastic feedback!gtcrest feels like a forced rhyme....it was. Heh. gtIm troubled by the logic of the last partI suppose what I meant to say was that I am naturally softer than down but am currently boarded up and encased in stone. Perhaps there is a better way to say this but that is for sure the message I was trying to deliver  I will think about it!With the dead bed section  This was the hardest part of the song for me lyrically never really tried anything like it before. Funny you should say that the slake ache line was your least favorite since thats kind of the only one that I ended up satisfied with. I really like the idea of that rhyming scheme but need to play around with the words a lot more. And maybe use words from this century. This sub is absolutely fantastic by the way  keep up the good work!,songwriterscircle,cg5rzq8,1,t5_30n3g
877141,0,t3_22a1kw,Man this track is sweet.  I like the grungy tones you went for as well as the upbeat rock sound.  Like Nerfherder or Spacehog.  The drums could use a boost and the bass and guitar are pretty on but could use some volume adjustments in the mix.   I love collaborating let me know what ideas you have in mind and maybe we could crank something out.Nice work,songwriterscircle,ch3zgin,2,t5_30n3g
1010697,0,t1_chh492t,Thanks! The noise is an artifact of sloppy recording Im afraid though I may be able to lessen it with reducing reverb.Ambiguous lyrics are somewhat of a specialty of mine if Im writing anything other than kids songs Im out of my element. I do like the idea of self reflection through the bird! Thats an awesome idea. ,songwriterscircle,chj69nt,1,t5_30n3g

1273764,0,t3_28kg3f,I think it would be helpful to get kind of an idea of what you think the song is for or what kind of general area youre aiming at with the song.  I think for somewhat more electronicastyle pieces like this you might want to experiment with putting more heavyhanded filters on some of the instruments  i think a lot of hit still has a very present original midisynth sound to it.  alternatively  you could try some sampling.  but this is all kind of more modern expectations of what to get out of electronicalike pieces.  if youre not aiming for that then thats okay too.  ,songwriterscircle,cicwz2s,1,t5_30n3g

1791012,0,t3_2bk7yj,First off you give off a very grungypunkish vibe which is a very good thing. I could see this stuff with a full band. For the first  seconds about I find trouble when trying to find a tempo to it. It can be important for listeners so they can have to something to tap there foot to or cap there hands too so it could get stuck in there head. I got your metaphors and meaning during the verse but I couldnt particularly fugure out the meaning when listening to the chorus.,songwriterscircle,ck4wp78,1,t5_30n3g
2181250,0,t3_2iytvb,Great as always. One criticism I have is that your songs are mixed reeeaaaally loud. You can tell just by looking at the waveform. Everything is brickwalled it feels like and it doesnt allow the song to breathe dynamically. Ive said before that it is sometimes hard for me to distinguish your verses from your choruses and I wonder now if it is partly a question of dynamics.  Lyrics are great as always. Never stop being ambitious.  I like that you are going to try to commit to a new song every couple weeks. Itd be nice if you took it as an opportunity to go way outside of your comfort level and see where that takes you. All the songs Ive heard from you have been firmly planted within the same style. Not that theres anything wrong with that but I think you would benefit from dragging in some new influences. ,songwriterscircle,clh38q5,1,t5_30n3g
3384857,0,t3_2yprdh,Awesome sound dude! Really good vibes off this track. Great vocal control overall. I love the fuck you honestly Im gonna do me feel to the whole thing. It really sounds stellar.Only critique I have is a tiny technical point. The crashing cymbal that comes in the chorus seems distracting to me first time at . It almost overpowers your vocals and rest of the track.Fucking love the guitar solo at  and the vocal flare into the outro. Good stuff dude.,songwriterscircle,cpe3m2a,1,t5_30n3g
5506873,0,t3_3q0vb1,Hey all I am acoustic guitarist from Maryland. I am an accountant but I like to mess around with song writing because it truly expresses what words cant. I am by no means a proffessional at this but I can at least give the perspective from an average person. Looking forward to being part of this sub I just discovered. ,songwriterscircle,cwfjy2y,1,t5_30n3g
5589320,0,t1_cwpwcni,Really glad you liked it! Damien rice is really cool haha so Ill take it. No reason for the tag I was just too lazy to type something out since its a demo. Itd be awesome for you guys to share it though just be sure to use the link i put here since the song is set to private ,songwriterscircle,cwpwodp,1,t5_30n3g
6009017,0,t3_3x9ho4,Not my style but i will say that i would get rid of some of the reverb on the vocals on the final cut. ,songwriterscircle,cy7baf0,2,t5_30n3g
6812817,0,t3_48w5gf,Awesome.  I love that word jammed verse.      You can really get some mileage out of those MXLs sometimes.  The mix sounds great only comment I have is that you dont need the doubling effect on your lead vocal near the end in my opinion.  ,songwriterscircle,d0oj37p,1,t5_30n3g
7270355,0,t3_4edqmr,I love your stuff man ive said so before. This is no exception. The arrangement is strange in a smiley smile meets early of montreal sort of way but I really like that.
