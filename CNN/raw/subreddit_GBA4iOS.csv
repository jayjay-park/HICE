6036277,0,t3_3y5z3u,No one knows. Apple revoked the certificate a couple of times already. Sometimes it can be revoked after a few week sometimes a few days depending on Apple. The emulator website can try as many times to put a certificate on it but well sooner or later Apple will revoke it. Dont bother paying BuildStore they are scum. Just side load it if you have a Mac. And if you bother to read thread below you would have your answer instead if starting a new post. So well just wait patiently.,GBA4iOS,cyavbix,6,t5_302pi

8270171,0,t1_d5bauxq,the gba emulator?I got it off of I used the download for gbaios . . and lower and even though it says that it still works fine.You do this from your phones browser. Once you see the app starting to download you go into settings gt general gt date amp time gt change it to anytime during  or earlier i think it only works for the first few years prior to that.Once you get it to download change the time back to auto and go into generalgt profiles amp device management and click allow for the app.At first this was all I had to do to play obviously after installing any roms you want to use. But now I have been needing to change the time back each time I want to play. Sometimes now the app wont even open and the enterprise app that you clicked allow for wont be there in settings. This makes me have to go back onto the gbaiosapp site and reinstall everything again. If you do it without deleting the app from your homepage your game progress isnt deleted though.edit I dont think this is the exact one I watched but it might have been. Also seems to be the same setup as how I did it and described ,GBA4iOS,d5bbvxk,3,t5_302pi
