2568454,0,t1_cmttfdq,The Commander of the Watch will station more goldcloaks around the Sept of Baelor and I will make it clear to him that some of his men will need to protect the Most Devout and His High Holiness in their travels about the city. I will contact the lords who host the other great sites across Westeros and I will make it clear to them that they must increase their efforts to protect men of faith.Lionel peered more closely at the High Septon.I do not see one attack no matter how much of a tragedy implying that septons are in constant danger. The city was returning from the rule of a traitor and such godless folk were sure to remain within our walls for a time until Daemon could root them out. You have the aid you need without any need for us to reinstate the military orders of the Faith. You should be happy for that High Holiness.,GoTPowers,cmtu2lf,2,t5_33kuw
2588205,0,t1_cmwehng,Ok so this isnt actually a joke but uMrCervixPounder was originally created as an alt account because the user felt the need to browse porn under a more suitable name. Eventually this alt caught on and became his main account. We need to stop this sexcrazed delinquent before it is too late. He will ruin our lives just as he has ruined the dignity and sense of self worth of thousands of japanese cartoons. Start the hashtag.

A show was all it was a chance to prove how diplomatic the Prince was Lord Uller hadnt been afforded such a luxury. Perros had considered a trial by combat it wasnt the Dornish way but the other Lords would make sure the Prince honoured the wish. But who would fight for him? Both he and his brother were  and he had no other family. Hed indulge the Prince though.I did not order the death or wish for the death of Yohn Nymeros Martell born Sand. Of that I am not guilty. But I am guilty of the rest Lewyn so so guilty. Have I taken some of the excitement out of the trial? Sorry to disappoint,GoTPowers,cny5pvo,3,t5_33kuw
