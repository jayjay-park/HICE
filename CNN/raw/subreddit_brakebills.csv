I dont know I HATED Penny.Q is full of shit but thats part of it. Most kids who know they are smart get so far up their own ass at a point that its hard for most people to deal with. I saw the friendship in the book as something you can project your on experiences from the past on to and maybe Grossman was one of the kids Im talking about but I honestly dont think it needed scenes to explain why they are friends.

6652773,0,t3_45j15p,Hi. I never read the books and just started seeing the show now. Sadly I also just stopped seeing the show now because the cast is sufferable and all the potential of the story is simply thrown out of the window.  Like you I deeply miss worldbuilding in here. They explain nothing. Literally nothing. And the world seemed to be so cool the disciplines and stuff it seemed huge but they just put it there and makes everything feel so much less.  That scene on ep  or  I think where they are trying to get the book back... Its really stupid. They just want to get in and they do meeting all of the hedgewitches. The charlie episode was one of the most recent stupid things Ive watched by far too.  The first episode had some hints of stuff I would really enjoy without anyone telling me I already felt a Harry Potter for adults vibe but it wasnt as well presented sadly. The Fellory books were a big drawn to me that girl visiting him and shit that was cool and brought thoughts of a story inside a story that I like but eh.  Anyway sorry to vent a bit I watched the first episode and thought that was ok and had lots of potential but so far I just feel like I wasted time.  The books are probably good though if they expand and actually explain things.,brakebills,d07gd57,1,t5_2sqfc

Do intend to write the Filllory books someday or expand on the world of Fillory in another way or is there something else entirely in the works.. And finally what was your favorite chapterpart of The Magicicans. I loved all three books from beginning to end but if I had to single out one scene. I would have to choose either the fight with Martin near the end of book one Julia and Quentins trying to return to Fillory in book two or finally chasing the robed figures after the heist in book three.

11001804,0,t3_5wzvxg,I think one idea behind the books and show thematically is to be a bit more realistic about what it would be like to have magical ability IRL.  So in accordance with that there isnt a magical shadow government that somehow remains a secret.  Thats not very realistic if you think about it.... There is some sort of law because the books and show say battle magic isnt allowed but the kids practice it and no one comes after them.  Lax enforcement.,brakebills,def0t88,1,t5_2sqfc
11060334,0,t1_dee7pb9,Yes. Mayakovsky is the one case I remember from the book. I reckon the law got involved since he was sexually preying on minors who could not be expected to defend themselves. Also the court probably have family in Brakebills so its something they would probably be interested in.About Q and the gangs stuff they mostly did all of it in another world Fillory and maybe the court doesnt extend to other worlds.

He lost the girl he loved and was nearly killed all in such a short time... and with all of the magic at his disposal he could fix none of it. Its natural to want to disassociate at that point. He wanted something familiar. Something that didnt remind him of everything he lost... something that was there before all that madness. To me it made perfect sense. ,brakebills,deylz8x,15,t5_2sqfc

I wish they combine crappier shows budget and make one good show.Also I thought the musical should been with beast fight. He sounds like he would have enjoyed it more.I reworked a better episode to fit the tone of the show with all major plot points of episode still in place and without the boring sword fight. This how it it should have been. So well spring brown out disrupts the penis kingdom illusion spell instead of army of . Theres just .  This forces the king challenges Eliot to duel for throne.

11591849,0,t3_652d11,I think this show really demonstrates how the multiwriter format becomes precarious in proportion to the specificity of your message. There are many subtle but central lines that are important to walk because they took so much time to establish them a central character who is within and withouthero and no one e.g. harry potter or nick carraway an evened ambiguity between the cast such that they never feel boxedmonoissued significant but not in focus julias process for relearning to function without her shade Ill come back to this and now alice who has merged two split selves after an orphic rescue descent into the underworld to guide the dead back.These are tangible aspects of the narrative substrate that you dont fuck with without intention once theyve set roots. A common problem in western television is a reliance on creating and solving problems structurally but never mythically. Structural resolution in stories is clean just like in music but feels shallow especially when overused. Structural resolution often takes the form that makes sense but its not satisfying. Ironically many wellknown myths esp. greek are actually resolved structurally  a god simply intervenes at some point and makes order where there was none.Myths of that style were written primarily by aristocracy  the only people with representative power  as retconsfanfics of existing stories where they could describe the means by which Powerful Men put shit into place. And every pantheon is made by different proportions of the following an aristocracy with a heavy writing tradition an invading force norse aesirvanir war or unification of many distinct local beliefs easiest to see when there are a lot of gods but one is the best and theres almost always a Leonardo vs. Raphael dynamic in greek mythology thats zeus and poseidon.Mythical resolution is actually the miscellaneous category just like Cthonic. Thats what makes it so hard theres no easy way to know how we should resolve any of the tensions of the show by direct reasoning. Mythic resolution necessarily emulates the strange wondrous and arcane forces of our apparent world. That uncertainty of the issue also makes it enticing and enables all of us to share our theories that come natural to us without sounding farfetched. theres a relationship to sportstalk here that you might want to consider if you like puzzling the abstract esports tooIve said before that I love the OLUPersephone bit but I felt like this scene lacked any specialness. There wasnt any mythical substrate. Dont shoot youll be a shittier person for it is another one of those okay yeah that makes sense but its not satisfying. Kady couldve said that. Im not surprised people wanted Julia to turn the gun on OLU  that would not be satisfying for me but like lightning there would at least be a conduit for the immense tension and resolution were looking for after all this shit. Instead there was separation a holding pattern and Julia got her shade back  another structural resolution.I myself was rooting for her to learn a means to reason emotions. It would seem fake acting good without knowing good but on the upside she would lack the emotion to see herself as righteous. That would tie back into the Julia I always liked the one who would always break through whatever membrane was holding her back  which Fogg alluded to. It would also parallel the way that brains adapt and restructure over time when theyre damagedsplit. But mostly it would bring her closer to Goddess symbology  allmother goddesses were often depicted as a sacred trees because they had roots in the underworld leaves in the sky and a trunk in our realm. Snakes were their primary companion frequently representing the goddesses youngest son who unsurprisingly is the usual origin for tricksters. Genesis is a hit piece on snakes and trees I tell ya.Theres still potential for this all to develop further and Im not bemoaning anything other than the shaky conveyance of the subtlety the show has such a large appetite for. Its only done and settled if the writers treat it like free passage to just complicate other areas and never touch them again. A big part of what I didnt like about S was the ending which disappointed me in the exact way Ive described above. But this season took those lines and kept running with them so I havent given up hope. And really if you look at it structurally the shows rhythm on an episodic basis is to introduce some unexpected inciting complication that also feels flat cut to the title sequence then escalate into crescendo that makes me upset that I have to wait a week for more. The endings are never satisfying but tbh this is my favorite thing running on western tv right now and its a billion times better than the more common shitty until the last episode format.ampnbspP.S. a lot of this applies to Steven Universe too.,brakebills,dg9y092,2,t5_2sqfc
