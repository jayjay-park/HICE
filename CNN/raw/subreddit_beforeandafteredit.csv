148709,0,t1_cevda4n,ampampampHeres a bit from linked Wikipedia article about Rule of thirds  gtThe rule of thirds is a rule of thumb or guideline which applies to the process of composing visual images such as designs films paintings and photographs. The guideline proposes that an image should be imagined as divided into nine equal parts by two equallyspaced horizontal lines and two equallyspaced vertical lines and that important compositional elements should be placed along these lines or their intersections. Proponents of the technique claim that aligning a subject with these points creates more tension energy and interest in the composition than simply centering the subject would.citation neededRelated Pictureimage source | about | uschleiftier can reply with delete.

199744,0,t3_1w5rgw,I think this might look better if you could get more of the long shadows in the frame I think that would be a better subject point then the blocked buildings. Maybe go where there are more dramatic shadows and add contrast to make it more like a silhouette ,beforeandafteredit,cf16yij,0,t5_2wuh9

551932,0,t1_cg2zrxf,I really dig the portrait style.  The main subject cliffs leads the eye vertically by virtue of its texture.  Its got a nice separation into thirds and the framing thirds those on the top and bottom  term I just made up juxtapose nicely chaotic dark green and silky smooth bright or should be bright  blue.,beforeandafteredit,cg30ewm,3,t5_2wuh9
658632,0,t3_21ok8z,Id pull down the contrast on his eyes with a curve layer or something. Sticks out way too much. His eyes are beautiful but theres way too much going on.,beforeandafteredit,cgf4wmb,3,t5_2wuh9
686250,0,t1_cgi9qjj,Thats better! But now i noticed that that the white buildings are little to overexposed like the one under the church tower? you can hardly see the line between the building and the sky. ,beforeandafteredit,cgia0os,1,t5_2wuh9
792348,0,t1_cgtzt0f,Thanks for the comments and yeah I cant believe I missed the yellow in the bottles. Initially I was going to use a yellow background but I changed it near the end as I just wasnt feeling it. Shadows are definitely icky.I might have a bit more of a play on the weekend to fix it all up. ,beforeandafteredit,cgucdwc,1,t5_2wuh9

4437793,0,t3_3bsu8z,I wonder if it would have been better if it had been exposed a little longer in camera?  You were able to recover the detail anyway but you might have ended up with something a little more vibrant with a longer exposure.Good composition though!,beforeandafteredit,csq2hno,2,t5_2wuh9
4625208,0,t1_ctdk98g,Well as i said  it is my first edit ever never used photoshop until this picture it actually is very difficult to make a white and very bright picture more sunset looking. Looks like more and more people hate it so i might just remove it,beforeandafteredit,ctdkwut,1,t5_2wuh9

5632466,0,t1_cwusq6l,So with that said since I dont know what a RAW converter is and I assume I dont have one I will continue to shoot in JPEG. Thank you for the heads up though. Probably saved me from a lot of head scratches later in my editing if the RAW photos I shot didnt look right.,beforeandafteredit,cwv9e8p,1,t5_2wuh9
5788869,0,t3_3ufht7,I see your posts on here and other photography subs every now and then. I dont want to be rude or anything but you would really benefit from focusing more on your photography and less on the post processing. If the shot is bad when you take it it will still be bad after editing just with prettier colors.,beforeandafteredit,cxenwkk,2,t5_2wuh9
6043696,0,t3_3y9s3l,I actually prefer the original. The edit seems to have too much saturation and contrast. I dont like that theres so much blue in it and your cousins cheeks seem far too red. Im not a fan of the vignette you added either. It looks edited. It might be a personal preference but when I process my own photos I prefer the image to look clean rather than really looking like its been massively edited. The whole process has that same effect a scifi show will have when the characters travel to a different world where the light is different or whatever if you get me?For me id look at tweaking the lights and darks some play with an scurve and perhaps add clarity. Maybe look at increasing the saturation a little but not substantially.,beforeandafteredit,cybu4sl,23,t5_2wuh9

8959724,0,t1_d7ogfm4,I think you did a good job on the edit. Colours look nice and you made the people stand out well. My critique is on the composition of the image. I think it would work really well for a brochure or flyer where youd be adding text in the middle but as a stand alone image it doesnt have much impact.The subjects are at either side of the frame and the middle is blank water. Our eyes dont know where to look.Cover the girl on the left with your hand and imagine that is the entire photo. The girl on the right now draws your attention and the blank water in front of her shows her direction of travel and creates a visual story.Now try covering the girl on the right. It doesnt work as well because the girl on the left is facing away from the empty water. We dont know where shes going. Flip her around or add some water to the left of her and that problem is fixed. OR for fun leave her there and add a shark fin behind her bottom right and bam you got yourself a compelling visual story again. What Im describing in a far too complicated way is the rule of thirds. An easy way to make images go from Okay to Oh Yay.,beforeandafteredit,d7otoyi,2,t5_2wuh9
