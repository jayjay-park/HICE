8617207,0,t1_d6i4p6u,I shoot the Canon D usually with an  f. lens and mix flash and natural light depending on the scene. The D has pretty remarkable high ISO capabilities. One of these days Im going to experiment and find the real limits. An important thing to remember is that grain has a different appearance in print than on a screen. Even though this photo shows a fair amount of grain on the computer it still prints very smooth and clean. Its not razor sharp but that is a sacrifice of high ISO shooting. ,EpicWeddingPhotos,d6ir013,1,t5_3eapz
