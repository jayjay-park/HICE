117954,0,t1_cert2dm,I see what you mean. Its a magic car so it can do anything the author wants.  It just seems like more of an oversight than a feature to me because there is no reason for it.   Im sure Manx could drive a stick.,joehill,cerv2qk,3,t5_2wgmg
8081140,0,t1_d4oa7hk,Its kind of a mess.  And surprisingly poor writing for Hill. Overall decent story though.  And there are parts that are just brilliant.  There were times that I had to stop reading because I was so angry at certain characters. And that kind of emotion is hard to pull off.  ,joehill,d4oe8jf,0,t5_2wgmg
