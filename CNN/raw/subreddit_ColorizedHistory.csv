2113642,0,t3_2j5431,At first I found it a curious decision to give the picture a reddish glow as if it was close to sunset or sunrise. But then I noticed the long shadows! Nice touch I wouldnt have picked out that detail otherwise.My only suggestions for this one would be I noticed that you gave a reddish glow on the horizon but from the suns angle wouldnt the sky be darker to the left and get gradually redder to the right? I normally wouldnt call this out except that you seemed to have put a lot of thought into the ambient light and sky. One thing that I noticed was that the clothing colors seemed a tad oversaturated to my eye which I thought even before I thought about the ambient color. Interestingly I noticed this about the overall picture but if I look at a specific person it seems less noticeable. I think it might be because my brain noticed the lateearly day colors and in lower light colors tend to be more muted. So it may be that in isolation its fine but when Im perceiving the overall color scheme it makes the other colors jump out more because of my expectation. It would be interesting to see this picture with bright sunny ambient color but the same clothes and see if I noticed the same thing.Edit Forgot to say great picture!

LawrenceMore by me at my Facebook and FlickrBlackfoot Piegan Native Americans in Northern Montana ca. .From Ernest R. Lawrences book Alone with the Past The Life and Photographic Art of Roland W. ReedgtRoland Reeds decision came at the last possible moment. By the dawn of the twentieth century this countrys Native Americans were living on reservations their old ways of life unalterably changed. Royal W. Roland Reed Jr.  was one of a small number of professional photographers now known as Pictorialists who set out to document this vanishing race. Employing new artistic techniques and often posing their subjects the Pictorialists recreated the noble savage as they imagined them to have been in the past not as they presently found them. Reeds better known contemporary Edward Curtis enjoyed broad backing and financial support for his work. Reed did not his work was solitary selfdirected and selffunded. Critics agree that Reeds photographs are equal both technically and artistically to those of Curtis but his work has remained largely unknown and unpublished.gtReed lived with and photographed the Ojibwe in Minnesota the Blackfoot Piegan Flathead Cheyenne and Blood in northern Montana and southern Canada and the Navajo and Hopi in Arizona. He had begun work on the publication of his collection with the title Reeds Photographic Art Studies of the North American Indian at the time of his accidental death.

We have sat by while dictators rose and subjugated their people simply because there was nothing in it for us to topple them. We have turned away refugees from those dictators because of their race or religion on multiple occasions. We penned in our own citizens in prison camps simply for being born with a genetic heritage that led back to a nation we were at war with. We ignore our veterans with massive medical problems because its too expensive. The same goes for the mentally ill and the homeless of the nation.

He admired the camps for Boer prisoners in South Africa and for the Indians in the wild west and often praised to his inner circle the efficiency of Americas exterminationby starvation and uneven combatof the red savages who could not be tamed by captivity. He was very interested in the way the Indian population had rapidly declined due to epidemics and starvation when the United States government forced them to live on the reservations. He thought the American governments forced migrations of the Indians over great distances to barren reservation land was a deliberate policy of extermination. Just how much Hitler took from the American example of the destruction of the Indian nations is hard to say however frightening parallels can be drawn. For some time Hitler considered deporting the Jews to a large reservation in the Lubin area where their numbers would be reduced through starvation and disease.,ColorizedHistory,dgdb209,2,t5_2voya
