Waytools should be working harder to give me convincing updates to what plan gets them to a release date of this quarter.

10014514,0,t1_dbc2dfm,The several stories go far beyond simple frequency of posting.Glad youre enjoying the Sekret WT Slack chat... but of course its not exactly a substitute for actual communications with patrons who have not yet passed the AAPLcustomerandhavekissedsufficientasstoactuallyreceiveprototypeproduct test. A lovely tool it is for maintaining a safe space for Knighton and whatever minions may remain where he wont be triggered by microaggressions from the hoi polloi.

10649674,0,t3_5sell3,gtHi All  FYI weve been working through some of the bluetooth anomalies this weekend from changes on macOS  iOS. Well get that sorted first and then will post an update mid week.I have seen tons of reports of Apple users complaining about connection issues a fair few in relation to the BT earphones recently released. Here is an unfortunate vulnerability in BT as a third party connection. You are at the mercy of device manufacturers implementation of the standard and an issue they create becomes an issue that kills your device. I would not get into too much of a tis about this one as AAPL has motivation to attempt a fix for this fairly quickly. So midweek then guys is that the midweek after you have fixed the issue or midweek this week? Have you heard of a calendar? Its this class of tables the world uses to unambiguously refer to timing of an event past or future.  Try one out and see how that goes for you.R,textblade,ddefjxi,2,t5_3a2oz

Thank you for calling out when you see fringe amateurs spouting out on areas they have no expertise whatsoever in but you do and getting it spectacularly wrong.Making these corrections publically is what helps people to spot fake reality and not to simply believe the loudest knowitallbutreallydoesnt on any given forum  and all forums usually have at least one... ,textblade,de6r0zg,2,t5_3a2oz
11222894,0,t3_607dj0,I wonder sometimes if WT is even thinking of an exit strategy? They seem to be completely focused on the way they think things should be done I would not be surprised if they are completely in earnest with their marketing spiel. R,textblade,df43niw,3,t5_3a2oz

He isnt in this position because he is acting like a dick he is in this position because his staggering entitlement blinds him to his infractions.
