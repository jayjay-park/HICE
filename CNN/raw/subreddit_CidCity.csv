6825594,0,t1_d0pt91r,gt So what youre saying is once you see this dry diamond on some tabs it means the lsd didnt spread so you add another drop. What confuses me is wouldnt this make those tabs a higher dose?The dry diamond is supposed to be there. It will show up in an exact pattern. If you follow the tek it will be laid evenly and accurately. gt Wouldnt it just be easier to put the .ml in something and just lay the sheet on there and let it spread evenly?Not as easy to be accurate.gt when you say the slight overlay is that for the ug or the extra drop on the dry diamond spots.The ug. mg tabs  ugtab. Youre focusing too much on the dry spots. The tabs will be evenly laid if you follow the tek exactly. ,CidCity,d0pzayd,1,t5_3cnd3
