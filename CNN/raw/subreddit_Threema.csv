3856737,0,t1_cqvw9d3,gt...the probability that Threema has a backdoor is too small to be relevant for most of the users.If there is a backdoor it affects all users.gtFor people who need strong encryption the could still use TextSecure GPG or other secure proven open source software but unfortunately this software is way to complicated for the average user.In what way is Threema way less complicated for the average user than TextSecure?,Threema,cqvwjc4,1,t5_30if2
