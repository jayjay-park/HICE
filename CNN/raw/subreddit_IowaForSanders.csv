It looks like the case started in Polk County.Its interesting to me that county seemed to have gone Obama in the democratic primary of  given the Wikipedia chart. Are there any breakdowns of current candidate polling available by county?How influential do you think the Des Moines registers endorsement of Hillary will be? They seemed to pick Obama in  when the political narrative was Hillary. Are they a fair bellwether for the mood in Des Moines? ,IowaForSanders,czbrhbj,1,t5_380zo
6365104,0,t3_42qean,what do you think about this line Hillarys a good candidate but the republicans have hated her for decades worse than they hate Obama  I fear she simply wont be able to get anything done.  They take any chance they can to grind her to a halt and drag her through the mud benghazi emails.  They may dislike Bernie but they hate Hillary.  Even with the best intentions and plan in the world she just wont be able to get it done.,IowaForSanders,czd54j2,2,t5_380zo
