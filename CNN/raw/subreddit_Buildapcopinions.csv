6384884,0,t1_czf9x4t,Yes it plays the game fine on the minimum settings but Ive seen the game with medium settings and it looks amazing.  Ive tried all the different combinations of CPU AND GPU settings.  Nvidia doesnt automatically support Star Trek Online but you can set it up to select the GPU when it plays and in Nvidea GeForce Experience you can change many settings.  Ive searched online and fiddled with them but I still cant do better than minimum without serious stutter.,Buildapcopinions,czfe5yp,1,t5_38k1z
