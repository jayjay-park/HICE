318366,0,t3_1xo8cz,My knees have always been my Achilles heel so to speak. I had osgoodschlatters as a young teenager but that subsided in my late teens. I had an on and off relationship with running from about  with a few ups and downs in weight loss and weight gain over that time.I started crossfit in May  pretty overweight with an undiagnosed Lateral Meniscus tear in my right knee cause by having a discoid meniscus. Starting a serious training program prompted my to get my knee diagnosed and I ended up having the tear operated on in August.Needless to say I am very used to working out in and around knee pain. First and foremost I avoided the running and stuck to rowing and airdyne for the WODs. Squatting really helped alleviate knee pain and i think building stronger leg muscles also helped a great deal.  weeks after my operation I tentatively got back to the box and started carefully working out again. I did no jumping movements for a few months no running no skipping but I was still getting good workouts.My knee is now  healed and feels great. The best advice I can give is talk to your coaches and work it out with them. Let them know if a particular movement seems to be hurting you and they should be able to work out substitutions and scaling for you. Squats performed properly should really help with knee pain and building strength in the leg to help with overall knee health.,crossfit,cfdrndw,2,t5_2qqfd

Hang in there. If youre consistent and follow a good diet youll lose it.

It also gives you a head start for the transition as your wrist already is in receiving position if that makes any sense at all. Because of the reasons listed it is a very good way of introducing the movement to new athletes. For example I learned false grip MU first with reg grip a couple of months later.

675287,0,t1_cggmgc0,I understand where your coming from but look at it this way. For those looking for a box having so many choices near by forces gym owners to continuously expand their knowledge and provide better training or risk losing members. Personally if I was a gym owner I would constantly be learning and educating my clients to the best of my ability. Having a box every ten miles does not force the owner to do anything because if you dont like their training method you have to drive ten miles to the next one. Competition is good for all involved and provides a better product for the members. Also in your example McDonalds has designed it so that no matter where you go in the world a Big Mac tastes exactly the same. Training does not work that way. ,crossfit,cgh13qx,1,t5_2qqfd

Hed said something about how he does the left the same no matter what the weight.  It reminded me that I need to keep my form good when theres no weight too. So I worked a bunch on getting down ATG every time.  Ill warm up hanging from the bar in that position as a stretch my knees start out stiff. Then squat the bar then start stacking weight on.

If HQ had launched such an undertaken its failure could take down the entire business.The NPFL is not going to be offering certifications. They are not going to be affiliating gyms.

835002,0,t1_cgz6dha,Its not a stupid question at all! Low bar squatting what youre doing in the video positions the bar lower on the back think sitting on the shoulder blades or below bottom edge of the traps and pushes the chest and torso downward. In order to stand up out of the bottom position your hips will have to hinge rather severely think deadlifts which puts a lot of strain on your back. It does use more muscles this is an oversimplification so if youre training low bar then youll low bar successfully. High bar positions the bar on top of the traps which allows you to keep your chest and torso upright. Your quads and hamstrings dominate this movement allowing you to push the weight straight up again an oversimplification without hinging at the hips as much. Think front squatting when front squatting your torso stays upright so you dont dump the weight off of your delts. For cleans push presses jerks and overhead squats among other things would you want to bend over in the hole at the bottom of the squat or would you want to stay upright? When you see powerlifters squat they generally squat low bar since it allows them to squat more weight. When you see Olympic lifters squat they squat high bar.,crossfit,cgz6xdb,1,t5_2qqfd

Also its not a great practice to allow people to join classes if they require all your attention as this deprives other paying members of the same attention. They may not care but they should have the option for coaching focus if they need it as well. That being said my gym doesnt even have an on ramp yet.

Ask to speak with the manager and see how interested theres any equipment they need boxes always need equipment and tell them about your prices and the stuff youre selling. If they say they get their equipment from rogueeleinkowhatever show them how much money they can save by switching to your gear. If youre not a good seller hire someone who is.

1754820,0,t3_2eka5e,Adwords and Facebook ads are great but going the grassroots way would go a lot further in establishing your company as a trusted source for good equipment.  Contacting large and small blogs and asking them to review products or providing them with content to share with their members goes a long way in getting your name out there.  Bloggers are always looking for content.  And  if you can provide them with a blog post  with  or  links to your site not only gets your name out there but increases your visibility in search engines.  So next time someones is searching for a keyword like outfit a crossfit box Fringe Sports would be right on the front page.  Those in the market for equipment will have Fringe Sports in their mind because they seen it around the internet enough times.  Also look into starting an affiliate program where you kickback  to  of each sale to the referrer.

Trying to force yourself to get a pistol before you are ready will just put you into a poor movement pattern and you will learn how to do them incorrectly. Some people get quite good at this however you will never be as good at them as possible AND you will be putting an unnecessary stress on your body. More importantly pistol squats dont provide a training stimulus you cant get elsewhere and more effectively. Skater squats are a great alternative and work a biochemically sound movement. I also recommend lunge variations and single leg deadlifts for unilateral training. Save the pistols as a test or just skip them altogether.  ,crossfit,ck2uzy6,-1,t5_2qqfd

2178333,0,t1_clgovz9,I agree entirely except your first statement.  My examples were more of an as a minimum.  The point I was disputing is that No one needs to train that much.  At a bare minimum someone training for a marathon would be training  days a week totaling at least  miles.When I ran Cross Country high school so K I was probably running close to  miles some weeks with our shortest runs usually being about . miles except for the occasional speed day when we did repeats  but those typically added up to . miles.As to your first statement do you have any examples to support that elite runners will run marathons to train for marathons?  As far as I am aware the general consensus among experts is that there is no training value to actually running the full distance especially with the trade off that recovery time is ridiculous.  You can run a marathon and be out of commission for  days or run an equal distance over  days and have better training adaptation as a result.  The risk of injury increases as your volume in a particular session goes up so you also risk injury by training those long distances.  Obviously a seasoned marathoner will be able to know themselves and how they recover from running those distances but I would definitely say as a general rule most people do not run a marathon to train for a marathon. I would definitely like to see any examples you have to support your stance though.,crossfit,clgpwen,1,t5_2qqfd

Teams would do the same thing but the WODS would resemble those from the Team Series.  The top  from each region and top  teams would be invited to do the sectionals weekend.  The scores would be the created from their scores from each individual workout during the weekend plus two scores for their ranking in the Opensimilar to the Masters.  For teams this is it.

My point is more along the lines of if the games athletes are only worried about the  times a year when CrossFit tests regionals and the games that Im aware of then its not too difficult to plan cycles around it. Dope in the offseason when you know your not susceptible to HQ testing and then cycle off so they can pee clean from mid may through July. The only way to limit that is to extend the window they could be tested. If the top  open finishers in each region could be tested any time at random between the end of the open and the games then they would have to be able to pee clean from March through July. You dont actually have to test them all. Just a few of the  would be enough to discourage PED usage. ,crossfit,cm54mq4,1,t5_2qqfd

As the sport aspect of things matures its going to be more and more about people who train full time and treat it like their job.Its like the earlier days of MMA where it seemed like a local barfighter could make it based on natural talent but its not like that at all now you have to be dedicated to training multiple disciplines. Even if they didnt reduce the number of people qualifying for Regionals it would have become less likely each year that even a dedicated Crossfitter would make it due to and increasing number of people training basically full time. Ill participate in the Open workout but theres no way Im paying them for the privilege. ,crossfit,cmvv8sk,9,t5_2qqfd

They have really good coaches and good programming and they still have a lot of crossfitters. They all have open gym access also along with their membership. I talked to the owner when i first started and was saying how great it was and his response was basically whats the point of all this equipment and space if its only going to be used  hours a day. it caters to the regular gym rat as well as crossfitters who either just want to do their own thingfollow their own program or people who want access to crossfit equipment but dont have the schedule to get to the gym at a few exact times throughout the day.,crossfit,cmwq5id,2,t5_2qqfd

Ive been slowly feeling better by trying different thingsAlways pay attention to how you relax especially right after a workout. Sitting down and driving for long periods of time immediately after working out always makes it feel worse. Make sure you dont sit for too long and always stretch after working out. Butt stretch and chair stretch for your hips lying down back extension for your lumbar spine. ALWAYS maintain your lumbar lordosis and never slouch flex your lower back. Use lighter weights than usual and stop doing Olympic lifts if it gets worse. I have inflammation in my LS joint significant hip dysfunction and scoliosis probably from sitting on my wallet for years and sitting with terrible posture.

While Ive definitely increased my range of motion Im a far cry from being flexible. What I would suggest is that you not think of your flexibility exercises as a means to an end but rather just something you do to warm up and cool down. Stretching for its own sake.

The thing you have to remember is that most if not all movements within crossfit can be modified to meet any fitness level.  Not only can I not do pull ups but I cannot even do banded pull ups.  In order to do the pull up portions of the WOD I stand on a box and pull with my arms as much as I can using my legs to move me up the rest of the way.  Is this as good as a regular pull up?  No but it gets me started. One final point nobody cares if you are out of shape they are happy just to see you trying to get your shit together.

3179870,0,t3_2wjped,I would recommend CrossFit Aldgate   Its not in North London sadly but it is in the heart of the City with great transport links from Bank Liverpool Street Fenchurch Street London Bridge.You can go from High Barnet to Bank on the Northern Line about  minutes and then it is a  minute walk from there according to Google walk fast you can do it in . minutes.Outside office hours you need to enter from the back of the building as the front desk is not always manned.  Walk round the back.The majority owner and head coach Kamil is a former Slovakian National Wrestling Champion and has been a personal trainer in the UK for about  years.  He placed th in the CrossFit masters regionals in Manchester in Jan  despite having an injury.  He has crazy lifting numbers on squats front squats deadlift CampJ with excellent form and can row m in  or was it  so this is one gym where the CrossFit trainers are very very experienced and have done far far more than just the minimum week long course.You can pay per session or it is cheaper if you pay for a block of a few sessions.  Tell Kamil or Adam that Joe told you about it and that they will see me again soon once Ive had my stitches removed box jump FAIL.  Just to clarify I am not incentivised by the gym in any way although I do count Kamil as a personal friend.Also if you want any equipment check out  which is about a  minute walk from the gym you get  off as a CrossFit Aldgate customer and they specalise in CrossFit equipment and clothing and their prices are great.

3429856,0,t3_2zhlc3,Start by identifying specific areas of improvement match them with specific goals and lay out a specific strategy to achieve those goals.  You mentioned numbers and fitness overall but what does that look like for you?  Numbers fitness and movements might improve with weight loss extra lifting or spending more time on technique.  For me without specifics and a strategy by which I can measure success I end up feeling like its all pointless.  Spend some time thinking about what success will look like for you specifically for you.  Write it down along with a strategy and some goals.  Make your goals challenging but achievable  it definitely helps to set a big long term goal along with shorter term milestone goals.In another thread I wrote it out more thoroughly but the quick recap on my story is this... I started Crossfit about  months ago and found myself rapidly approaching the wall after a year.  There was progress but after  months I expected to see more in terms of weight loss cardio endurance and lifting strength.  My initial goal was to improve lifts.  I had a loose plan for how that would work but I never set an achievement goal.  So I did some stuff saw a little improvement then stagnated again.  The goal setting idea finally clicked and I came up with the  goals below.  I am female and a few years older than you so some of this is probably different than where you want to target but hopefully you see what Im getting at. Improvement  Chubby  Goal drop  lbs Ive since decided to focus more on body fat reduction but need to get my current BF measured before I can set a goal  Strategy calculate BMRTDEE and stay  lt TDEE daily track all food intake simplify diet to meet macro goals and eat in a way that fits my lifestyle add  min of cardio xweek be more active more frequently throughout the day. Improvement  Lift s  Goals Set PR targets based on  of body weight and sanity checked them against the PRs of some of the better female athletes at my gym.  Dedicate one day per week every week solely to lifting.  Drastically improve squat form.  Strategy Tear down squat and start from scratch identify lifts I want to work on box squats shoulder press power cleans pull ups bench press and dead lifts increase protein intake use Open Gym day at the box for lifting track weight progress buy lifting shoes. Improvement  Mobility tendonitis  Goals Reduce frequency and severity of tendonitis flare ups in forearms and biceps tendon  barefoot ATG without heels rising up or feet going into plie mode work out the ridiculous knots in traps and rhomboids  Strategy Stretchroll out every night lacrosse ball work xweek floss band xweek coachchiropractor assisted mobility weekly ice up as needed where prone to tendonitis flare ups.This has been pretty successful for me.  There are direct results like dropping  lbs getting my squat form down and seeing improvements in mobility.  There are overlapping successes losing weight has helped my pull up progressions working on mobility has helped my squat form and an extra day of working out lifting day has sped my fat loss.  And finally there are indirect results like rxing my first entire WOD increased cardiopower output during WODs and suddenly without focusing on this area at all being able to manage significantly heavier kettle bells.  The other major benefit for me is that goal setting keeps me in my own lane and focused internally on my capabilities rather than constantly comparing myself and my performance relative to how others perform.  Its your journey everyone has to start somewhere.  Dont get too high or low comparing yourself against someone with a different starting point on a different road than you.,crossfit,cpj89l8,2,t5_2qqfd

3522805,0,t1_cptn5uc,So when I started out with crossfit I came in at about .  I lost a lot of weight fairly quickly.  I was regular about am five times per week I never ate before.  Ive been pretty consistent about the protein shake right after the WOD.  I didnt always eat as much for breakfast as I do now  I made a conscious decision to shift some of my calories away from the afternoonevening on purpose because I felt like I was starving by the time I hit pm and was gorging myself when I got home from work.The most successful strategy Ive had for losing the weight is honestly doing the Whole and then sticking to the changes.  I cut all processed food I dont eat anything with any added sugar at all.  I havent touched a piece of bread not a bun or a pizza crust or anything in more than two years now.  It was a big shift at first but Ive gradually found myself in a much better space with my weight with my energy with my health in general.  Im in better shape now than Ive ever been in  stronger faster and leaner  and I think crossfit has been great for giving me a discipline to organize those changes in my eating around.  But the changes in what I eat and maybe not even so much how or when I eat necessarily have been the most important to my mind.Hope thats helpful.  Let me know if you need any encouragement in sticking with this.  I know it sounds corny but this stuff really totally changed my life and I believe it can help people.  Im happy to be supportive when and how I can.,crossfit,cpttpul,1,t5_2qqfd

3696302,0,t3_32kl4k,Ive had this discussion with many people and its a paradigm problem. Youre focused on weight as a number but not on body composition.Its very likely that youre beginning to put on a decent amount of muscle for the first time. If you gain muscle and lose fat at the same rate you will actually gain weight. Muscle is more dense than fat and therefore for the same volume muscle weighs more than fat. It doesnt mean that youre not losing fat. It means that youre gaining muscle.I took care when designing the most recent nutrition challenge for my gym because of this effect. People can change their body composition for the better and either stay the same weight or even put on weight. To truly know whats going on you need more metrics than just weight alone. ,crossfit,cqdlpyw,1,t5_2qqfd

4112176,0,t3_37qnn4,Hinging at the hips first helps load the posterior chain and reduces stress on the knees ankles and lower back. Id be interested to see how you used to squat and how you squat now. Edit as someone else said its an easier way to teach a newbie to engage more musculature if theyre not kinesthetically aware. However I never teach hips back to squat which seems to be the problem here its wrong. The cue is hips back and down where you hinge at the hip a split second before bending at the knee and squatting straight down. One of my strongest squatters initiates with his hips and can squat  high bar.Edit those coaches you went to must not have paid attention during their L. I just looked through CrossFits resources and even they all say hips back and down. That down part makes all the difference. But everyone is different when it comes to movements and you have to find what works for you. Another of my strongest squatters does not hinge at the hip first and he can do almost  as well. You found a way to squat better and thats all that matters. Keep trying to perfect your form and those numbers will keep climbing!

Ive noticed this last week that I am rarely feeling discomfort in my knees anymore though it still comes from time to time its much more infrequent.

5056916,0,t3_3k8aui,First and foremost spend the extra money on a good brand. The first pair I got were the TKs for half the price of other brands and they ripped within a few months. This isnt something exclusive to me as I have read multiple reviews with the stating the same issue. I ditched them for Rehbands and more than a year later they are going strong. Secondly they arent going to make you a better lifter nor are they going to prevent an injury related to poor form and technique. They do keep your knees warm and maybe offer some support but if you have knee pain you should probably get it checked out. You cant fix bad movement patterns with a bandaid. Thirdly is thirdly a word? Thirdly since they arent necessarily going to do everything you thought they would they still come in handy for other things. I like them for knee pads during lunges. Also as someone stated they can be put around your ankle as a rope guard. I put mine under a long sock on my right ankle when I do rope climbs and it allows me to descend much faster without the fear of rope burn.    ,crossfit,cuvjscm,2,t5_2qqfd

I fought for what I could but looking back I know my performance was vastly less than what I could put forward today.And thats the real point Im not competing with Rich Froning. Im not competing with the top level athletes at my box. Its unfair to even think in those terms. Im competing with where I was a week ago or a month ago. Im competing to beat my previous accomplishments and my expectations for myself.From what youre saying your coach has a terrible attitude. The raw numbers youre putting up are irrelevant if youre putting forth your best effort because if youre putting your best into it your best WILL improve over time. Id talk to the owner about your experiences with that coach and try to schedule your times there so youre with someone else. If the owner isnt responsive or if that was the owner Id find another box.Im a fat lazy out of shape man but every coach Ive worked with at my box has done everything they could to convince me that I dont have to be and you know what?

Youre not a small guy so  should not be that slow off the ground for you. As a novice weightlifter I would advise that you move away from this Vanquish Method and begin practicing a straighter setup.

5450187,0,t3_3pp459,My gym has open gym every day so I usually add in three lifting sessions per week.  One of the knocks on CF is that you dont get strong or big if thats what youre looking for.  While not entirely try theres a grain of truth to it.  For example we have a strength component probably  out  classes per week.  These range from squats deads push press oly lifts etc.  It can be a couple if not more weeks before we see a heavy deadlift session again.  You arent going to dramatically increase a lift doing it that infrequently.  Currently I do the hatch squat program and madcow for bench and deads.  Those lifts have increased and CF wods have gotten easier at a way faster rate than if I relied entirely on CF classes. ,crossfit,cw8bb1u,7,t5_2qqfd

5644811,0,t1_cwwdsqk,What do you mean by feeling your lower back? You were likely told not to lift with your back which is not the same as not using your back. The power of the lift is going to come from extension of the hip but the lower back is still supporting all of that weight. It is preventing your spine from arching over. You are going to feel it every time. That isnt a bad thing. What you dont want to do is round your lower back and use your spinal erectors to lift the weight. Using proper form is absolutely essential and erring on the side of caution is probably wise when it comes to weightlifting...but dont be a total pussy either.,crossfit,cwwskg8,1,t5_2qqfd

5697368,0,t3_3t5rut,Google shoulder impingement.When you lack good shoulder rom especially when the rotator cuff has been pulled forward and the shoulder sits anteriorly in the socket ie the front instead of the back of the socket the room above the joint decreaseses when the shoulder begins to move into flexion which would be overhead. This loss of room causes the infraspinatus tendon to get snagged in the little gap between the collar bone and scapula causing inflamation and pain when the shoulder is lifted overhead. Your shoulder injury was caused by lack of mobility and adequate room to perform overhead movements with your shoulders. Spend lots of time mobilizing the shoulder capsule. It is very likely your shoulders have sat forward for many years from sitting with poor posture. Its going to take a long time at least a couple months of mobility xday before you get really significant progress but if you commit you will be back in no time. Talk to your coach about finding ways to get through the workouts without going over head or putting the shoulder into lots of flexion. They should also be able to aid you in finding some practicioners that can help as well as some mobilizations.... if theyre solid and have a good background of mobility. ,crossfit,cx3bado,6,t5_2qqfd

6073478,0,t3_3yps7x,Heres the thing you need to know about Crossfit. Every single person has a different definition. The programming the scheduled workouts at wherever you go are going to be different from just about everyone elses. Yours may be very very strength heavy or it may mostly ignore barbells for bodyweight stuff or any other possible combination.If youre only doing their programming twice a week you will miss out on progress because it will be inconsistent. Youll miss a lot of skill work strength work conditioning that is all scheduled as part of a regular program.So your best option is to get with the coach after youve finished the introduction and tell them that youre only doing it twice a week. A smart move would be to look at the workouts your gym is doing and try to do them at home either identical or as similar as possible. Generally speaking a  on  off  on  off or a  on  off is the normal workout routine. So plan around that.And I want to stress over all...talk to your coach for any questions or issues first. Talk to your coach. Its what youre paying that ridiculous membership fee for. Stick with a single philosophy and training method and youll see results.,crossfit,cyfpxbu,2,t5_2qqfd

6292365,0,t1_cz4i7mv,gt If youre a normal person digestive wise and youre eating keto youre almost certainly killing your chances at making significant progress. Carbs are a big factor in muscle repair and growth.FYI I dont eat keto I eat a modified low carb diet but thats mostly because Im diabetic and it gives me the best chance of long term survival. Just to give you some background on where Im coming from. I dont advocate a keto diet usually I think it causes insulin resistance issues in a portion of the population long term but I absolutely will advocate LCHF.That being said I have to stick up for the highfat highprotein diet people here because those diets have been shown to be extremely healthy. For your brain for your cholesterol for your hormones your fat burning metabolism basically your entire body. No you do not need any carbs whatsoever even for athletic progress. If youre training to be a CF games athlete or olympian or whatever then yes you will probably do better on carbs but everyone tolerates them at different levels. Plus there are plenty of great examples of strength athletes and professional athletes on HFLC diets already Mark Bell LeBron James etc. and we already know the huge implications of ketogenic dieting on endurance training. Prescribing eat lots of carbs to everyone is downright dangerous for some people who have for example hidden insulin resistance issues. Also what youre describing about keto is actually a straw man argument  you are railing against the therapeutic ketogenic diet which was used to treat epileptic patients and has plenty of nutritional gaps. A well formulated ketogenic diet includes plenty of carbs from leafy green vegetables and high nutrient density foods and enough fiber to support gut microbiome and keep you regular. The research shows such a diet can sufficiently refuel your glycogen levels nearly to  between daily strength workouts between the small amount of carbs and gluconeogenesis. And you burn your fat stores more efficiently all day and specifically after highintensity workouts. You can absolutely eat a ketogenic or LCHF style and maintain all of those things it just takes a little bit of work. Demonizing LCHF diets is just plain shortsighted and they have HUGE benefits for a portion of the population.,crossfit,cz4vdh5,1,t5_2qqfd

6907790,0,t3_4ab5ck,I started CrossFit when I had just gotten below  lbs. Im  and female.  I have had no fitnessathletic background. The hardest thing is getting in the door the first time. Ive been at it for just over six months now. There were a lot of things that I could not do when I first started.  I could barely get an air squat to parallel.  I had no clue what a burpee was.  Running m felt impossible.  However with working at it my squat depth and overall range of motion has vastly improved.  Im not quick with them but I can do burpees now decently.  My endurance has gradually improved. Theres still a lot I cannot do yet.  I dont have a pull up in me yet. I did horribly in this last open workout. I didnt even have a jumping chesttobar pull up in me. I jumped at that bar for over  minutes trying to get it and I was pretty depressed that I couldnt even get one at the time.  I totally wanted to cry because I thought I would be able to do this and I failed horribly.  My box is doing a teamtype event for the Open within our own box and I felt horrible I didnt do better for my team. However no one made fun of me or made me feel bad for it not my team or the people from other teams. They were all quick to remind me how far Ive come in the past six months.  My fianc who came to watch our Open event this past Friday night and has been very hesitant to do some of our WODs even told me that Ive inspired him to do more of the WODs. He has apparently been afraid of the things hes not able to do and....apparently it took him seeing me fail horribly at something but not give up to cotton on to the fact that its okay for him to come in not being able to do something.Everything is scalable. No one is going to expect a person to come in doing handstand pushups on day .  Yes there will be some shirtless hardbodied dudes and cute lil CrossFit girlies in shortyshorts especially with Spring coming up.  And it will seem like everyone is just getting through this with ease.  Everyone is after their own results and have their own progression with learning movements and improving themselves.  Every last person that is in there started off with knowing nothing at some point.  My experience has been that the community even with other boxes Ive visiteddropped in at has been very accepting and nothing but encouraging.  The biggest assets one can bring is a positive attitude the willingness to learn the integrity to not cheat reps and the determination to not give up when things are challenging. ,crossfit,d0zbfua,7,t5_2qqfd

7300066,0,t1_d27y2d7,gtIf you feel that my corrections are wrong incomplete or badly prioritized please respond to OP.Im responding to your comment because it pertains to the comments you made not to OPs corrections needed.  I only brought that one portion up because in the clean you want the knees to track forward.  Your comment states the opposite so I didnt want OP to get the wrong idea of the positions of his knees.  The other comments made some good points and I didnt feel that there was much else to note to OP in a separate comment.It allows your body to remain in a more upright position at the bottom of the clean.  Try sitting in the bottom of a squat and pushing your knees behind your toes like you stated to do.  It forces your torso to lean forward to compensate for the position of your knees which is exactly the opposite of what you should be doing in a clean.  I have seen very few people if any that can really have their knees behingJust as a note while you want the weight to be across your foot and on your heels some all of your weight should not be on your heels in the bottom of a squat.  The general consensus is that the weight is concentrated under your midfoot near the front of your arch.  Having the weight entirely on your heels does not allow you to drive through the ground as well as otherwise. ,crossfit,d27yuq5,1,t5_2qqfd

IMO especially since all strength programs use some  of your max lift to determine your working sets you should always consider your PR the most weight you have managed with asnear perfect or at least your personal version of perfect form as possible.  That way you are always working off a weight that is based on the form you would use in training.  Ive made this argument in several places before,crossfit,d2dauyl,2,t5_2qqfd

They have a good amount of flex so are fine for box jumpsburpeesjump rope and are not too awkward to do even short runs in. If I were to have two shoes Id go with running shoes and the fastlifts. The fastlifts will cover most workouts without a long run and when you are doing long runs or sprints use your running shoes.

It is designed very nicely.Its also going to depend on your feet as well. Do you have narrow feet or wide feet?

8054885,0,t3_4pgvfh,affiliate owner here for what its worth.  Ive owned my affiliate for four years and dropped into  boxes in  different countries over the last  years.  They vary tremendously.CrossFit IS dangerous.  Just like snowboarding is dangerous.  Just like rock climbing is dangerous.  Just like baseball is dangerous.  CrossFit is also perfectly safe.  Just like the aforementioned are perfectly safe.  Here are the primary factors to consider.  The intelligence of the coach and athlete and their relationship dictate just how saferisky it is.  years ago the population was all police fire rescue meatheads hard core iron born...people who knew what the fuck they were doing BEFORE crossfit.  They self regulated or not and knew what they were getting themselves into.  The population is now pretty much everyone.  That includes some pretty delicate situations and people whose training age is starting fresh at ZERO.  Failure to recognize this and push them in the old school style is why there are so many fail videos.   Qualifications matter.  How well they wrestled in high school how passionate they are about fitness are not qualifications.   A good athlete does not a good coach necessarily make. Our head coach my biz partner has an BA and MS in exercise science  years coaching experience at  years old NASM CSCS USAW worked with actual athletes at D collegiate level   COACHING is his expertise not his hobby.  The least impressive of his qualifications is his CFL.  For many that is their only qualification. The WOD is not strength it is conditioning.  If your program is only a warmup and a wod sorry you are doing it wrong.  Tons of programs I have dropped in on are in this category.  This also gives crossfit a bad name because you have all these super speedy wodaholics that can hit a sub  Fran like that fucking matters but can barely rep out a body weight back squat.  That is ass backwards.  The BEST crossfitters add conditioning to impressive strength not add strength to impressive conditioning.   Conditioning i.e. the WOD should not be punishment and brutal for its own sake. People grind themselves down to little nubs for the thrill of saying they did something.  Yea we all like to bite something nasty every once in awhile but novelty repped out week after week is not training.  Infinite Elgintensity never rips on anyone doing anything impressive  he always rips on people either doing things poorly or getting overly excited about meager accomplishments often done poorly.  Programs often encourage some pretty hard core stuff without proper joint prep andor rehabprehab.  Doing inchworms and m jogs for  minutes doesnt prep you for max effort deadlifts.   We have responsible athletes with great awareness of their bodies and dumb athletes that bang their head against a wall over and over despite our insistence they not do that.  We are super cautious coaches.  Mix a risky athlete with a cavalier coach and theres your problem.Im pretty jacked up on coffee and preworkout so that is pretty much my verbal diarrhea for now.  If this post gets any traction I might clarify the ideas.  I hope you get a lot from your questions OP!  Your concerns are founded in real things a smart path forward can find you very happy productive and stronger with CrossFit!Oh and why do I do it?  Cause I fuckin love it.

The regions give fans some athelets to hope for. It makes it more personal amp more passionate. Everyone wants to cheer for people from their home region. Imagine a case where Cali had all the top athletes lol... I know as if. It would suck for other Americans really suck for Canadians and suck even more for Europeans amp Asians.       Now take the perspective of CF HQ amp Reebok  regions keep all the goegraphical locations more engaged and into it. From a marketing perspective the regions keep your name in peoples minds all over the globe. They dont really care about who is truly the best... they care about sales and expanding market share. Eliminating regions does not further that goal.   ,crossfit,d5s28f3,3,t5_2qqfd

8514840,0,t3_4w77q9,People here can be snarky.  I dont get it but there you go.  rpaleo can also be super snobby but theres some good advice and lots of questions from newbies to browse. Ive done paleo challenges through my gym before and what its done for me has been more about learning how to eat clean than sticking to a strict diet.  Eliminating one thing at a time is a good bit of advice.  Also learn to meal prep and love it.  Its much easier to stick to a diet when you can grab a pre made paleo lunch on your way to work and not have to find something you can eat at the restaurant all your coworkers go to. There are TONS of food blogs if youre looking for recipes.  PaleOMG is a goto of mine or just google paleo whatever ingredient you want for ideas. As you get better at it youll start to automatically sub paleo ingredients for nonpaleo or will learn what you dont need in a recipe.  If youre not trying to be super strict dont focus so much on things like trace sugar or nonpaleo ingredients.  Will eating totally sugarfree mean an uptick in performance? Maybe. But scouring the ingredients of everything in the grocery store takes so much damn time. Finally and arguably most importantly listen to your body.  Dont be afraid to indulge if youre really craving.  People will disagree with me on this but Ive never fallen totally off the wagon after a cheat day.. If youre hungry eat.  Especially if youre working out a lot or lifting a lot youre going to need more calories than you expect so dont starve yourself because you find yourself eating more than youre used to.  If its clean food youre doing ok. Ive heard that cravings take at least three weeks to go away so make yourself stick with it for at least four.  And dont freak out if youre not seeing immediate results.  It takes your body time to get used to this sort of thing depending on the degree of the change so be patient and do what feels right not what some wags on the Internet tell you to do. ,crossfit,d65wwhn,3,t5_2qqfd

8953999,0,t1_d7ntxwn,Holy crap my response was going to be almost identical to yours. I thought Id post on yours instead of what appeared to be a copypasted response.I too atedrank whatever the hell I wanted up until about a  years ago. I was what one would consider to be healthy but had some weight around the midsection that could be lost. Mountain Dew Doritos Cereal fast food you name it was my diet through life and college thus far. I started CrossFit  years ago my last year of college and the main purpose of starting was to get fit and lose the midsection fat I had. I wanted to be fit to do muscle ups lift heavy weights run fast and have a six pack too. I started to pay attention to what I ate a few months after I started Crossfit when I drank the koolaid with Paleo. I was determined to eat better and cleaned up my diet a lot. I ate more greens meats and veggies. Hooray! I didnt really dial in my nutrition until the last year or so when I was more focused on how much I was putting in my body versus what. I realized through trialerror that if I ate healthy foods and hit my proper macros calories amp percentages not only would I have a good performance in the gym but Id feel better outside of the gym too. A side bonus was that I started to lose the weight Ive always wanted to lose.Currently I finished my second round of cutting weight with Rennaissance Periodization templates and am in love with the results. I dropped lbs have had insane results in the gym during the time and am happy with where I currently am at. Im not going to change a thing currently besides maintaining my current weight. Looking forward to my new happy amp healthy life!,crossfit,d7o4xym,1,t5_2qqfd

It looks like there is a little too much arm pull and not quite enough triple extension and pop with the hips. Thats nitpicking though because overall it looks pretty solid aside from the need to catch with a solid base for true front squat. Nice work.,crossfit,d7r7ezu,1,t5_2qqfd

I see people throw on a belt as soon as they start deadlifting because they dont lift properly thinking the belt is going to brace their spine for them. I also see people get lazy on their maximum effort lifts and round their backs not worried about their positioning as long as the PR is made.

Or are you just going off your experiences during the classes?I ask because its really difficult to form an opinion on the programming based only on a couple of weeks of going  times per week.  Many boxes run cycles for their programming.  They might focus on strength for an  week cycle then focus on gymnastics for an  week cycle then cardio then Oly etc. I would eliminate the second box from your list.  If you didnt like the atmosphere thats not something thats going to change.  For the other two talk to the coaches about the programming.  You may have simply caught them in the middle of a cycle which will be changing up in a couple of weeks.No matter which box you choose they should have Open Gym times.

9353514,0,t3_58mmax,Not trying to bring you down but its a really tough market youre trying to get into. Crossfit is a really small  of the whole fitness population and a very specific market youre trying to aim at and you wouldnt be the first independent clothing line aimed at crossfitters. Unless you go all out sell the highest of highest quality that people will deem worth wearing that will feel extremely comfortable wearing during a workout that can be worn in the streets without the design screaming Crossfit thats not expensive yet meeting those requirements. The only way I can think of keeping the cost down would be buying in bulk but that is such a huge gamble. If its print as you go you would most likely need to sell at a loss because people will not spend big bucks on a brand they have never heard of.From my perspective heres whenwhy crossfitters will buy tshirts. Their favorite athletes wear it.. Support their gyms. I have designed at least over a dozen of tshirts for my gym they all have sold well but sales have stopped because they all own over a dozen already.. They sign up for comps they get another tshirt to add to their closet.. Judge at a comp judge tshirtsfree. Crossfit charity events tshirtsfreeTo add a lot of people want to get into this business because its obviously really easy to get started. Have a design have a shirt. Im sure youve probably seen them post here and get downvoted to oblivion. I personally think they got downvoted because the designs lacked thoughts usual cheesy crossfit puns and screamed crossfit or just LivesoreHowever if the design is incredibly interesting and it will have people say I WANT THAT it just might sell. See Slothfit.Slothfit started out in Australia merely as an inside joke and was meant to be sold amongst their members only. When it hit Facebook and Instagram somehow it started being shared all over the world including this sub  and soon enough they started selling internationally. Even I wanted one but unfortunately shipping cost more than the shirt itself.If you can achieve what slothfit did you can do well.Or sponsor top athlete or top local athletes but that would mean taking even more money out of your pocket and hopefully their fans will like it,crossfit,d91miea,13,t5_2qqfd

For perspective I dont think I had ever deadlifted before my surgery and I can pull  with only a little soreness the next day. One more thing Id add is that I notice my abs get really sore from core work likely because I have so much scar tissue in my lower back and those muscles are weak so my abs compensate.

If shes not cutting edges to a lower time would you mind detailing what exactly is the advantage in developing explosiveness by standing still instead of jumping? Wouldnt she be able to produce more work faster by trying to do more work in a smaller time frame instead of reducing the amount of work given the same space of time? Im new to Crossfit but I have spent quite some time in general strength training and I really dont understand how forsaking technique that is created for the sake of developing explosiveness will help you develop explosiveness. Thats like saying quarter squatting for a faster time will help you develop more explosiveness for a competition that requires full depth.

It addresses the  specific functional aspects that are incorporated into CF gymnastics powerlifting Olympic weightlifting. I say exclude Paleo because nutrition varies greatly by person. Not sure if there is a proper order to read them in. Maybe Rippetoes book first since those principles can be applied to a lot of CF work and increases understanding of biomechanics and basic strength programming e.g. how to squat. Supple Leopard also a must read in terms of self maintenance and understanding of biomechanical principles although some of his later theories e.g. squatting with feet forward are a little out there. The rest of it seems to be in order of preference in terms of what you care about or where your weaknesses are.

Work on straight leg RDLs and proper pulling mechanics in general. May be high volume low intensity at first and as you build that strength reduce the volume and up the weights later on. Weak spinal erectors? Work on weighted hyperextensions and snatchgripcleangrip deadlifts in general. Inflexible low back? You should be doing weighted Jefferson curls every single damn day like your life depended on it.While you are injured you could do bench supported DB rows for your lats and upper back. Also DBbarbell shrugs for your traps and rhomboid muscles. Dont neglect your back strength just because you are injured. Life is short. Work around the injury.

In the last . yrs since Ive joined my CF gym Ive gotten so much better at partnersocialevents etc. But its still easy to just slip back into that quiet solitude of just doing my own thing by myself.

I wasnt pulling high enough and I wasnt focused on each rep. On other hand going for  sets on CB pull ups was good idea as my forearms were fresh.I was even thinking about doing WOD again on Sunday but my hand is ripped and I will see how it feels tomorrow.

They are obviously significantly better than you at crossfit.If that person would have done the other two workouts scaled they would be even higher above you. Placing is based on your cumulative standings. Placing last if you dont submit seems like enough of a punishment in what is a community event to me. To clarify what I mean by cumulative standings Ill give you an example. Mat Fraser placed st with a cumulative score of . .....Total score of Chase smith placed second wth a cumulative score of .....For a total of .So whatever that person placed on the three workouts he did plus whatever works out to be last place in those other two workoutsits a tie between everyone who didnt submit so it changes each week was lower than your score.,crossfit,dfm7b5r,1,t5_2qqfd

My finish was a little lower than I did in the Open percentile wise but it was pretty close.

11790654,0,t3_687css,Running jogging will train aerobic capacity is not IMO necessarily the endurance you want to train as it targets type  muscle fibers. I dont know what your after but type  fibers are used for long duration low intensity work. This type of work will not help your ability to perform under stress.  Type  fibers dont generate a whole lot of power they stabilize.Better to do something like an EMOM with sprints burpee or thrusters and try and add a rep each time or each week. I spent a few months doing burpees starting at EMOM  min x a week every morning.  Every  sessions id try and add a rep.  If I failed I stayed there till I could do it and repeate it one more time.  The resulted were a full  minute drop in my  burpees for time between the beginning and end of this little experiment. The difference is this approach and the movements build lactic a byproduct from the phosphocreatine pathway which fuels type  muscles. these muscle fibers generate a lot more power and training in this way will increase you lactic threshold and thus your ability to repeatedly generate power under duress for a duration of time.Running fun it has its place but what are your trying to accomplish?Im a big fan of min EMOM nice and quick easy way to train KISS,crossfit,dgwidr8,2,t5_2qqfd
