An allergy to uranium or Macronesian bee stings for example are things that are never likely to come up in a game and thus would not be allowed.I would suggest insect bites in general as acceptable though suspect as it does not come up often.Other than that it is good to go. please let me know once that is fixed and i will recheck it for you.,shadowchargen,crg14jq,1,t5_36uz9

5022777,0,t1_curfab1,Aight  Just wanted to make sure you had all the info to make an educated choice. Re Code of Honor. Oh yes this is definetly a great point at which to run away. Most of my characters have that except not as an explicit quality. The thing is that as a negative quality which gives you karma this might be too narrow or come up too rarely. Kinda like Prejudice Dragons is probably never going to matter. I am unsure where it was us or the runnerhub which straight out disallowed CoH Kids because of that. Hence my question.Re MunchkinNonononono not your character.  Your character is definetly not a munchkin character. The munchkin pretty much optimises everything as much as possible. What I was trying to say is that one does not necessarily have to be a munchkin character.,shadowchargen,curfph7,1,t5_36uz9

A  fixer is damn near useless because of how few dice they throw to get you ANYTHING. And because fixers need to come through for you more often than any other contact you really should have their loyalty at least not be . Honestly I suggest at LEAST a  so that they have SOME influence and care about your character SOME but a  or  or  are better ideas usually or just max out your points possible on them with a    or .,shadowchargen,cwqr3n7,1,t5_36uz9

6471381,0,t1_czo25er,I would like a quality that reflects that he is in touch with his inner chakras. There is indomitable mental which is thematically quite fitting as his mind has been honed by years upon years of meditation. Sadly it seems mechanically bad for my character. Spirit affinity does not fit well as he is in touch with himself. Not with the spirit world. Anything that boosts his phsyical stats is out of the question as it does not really fit the theme either.First impression is while mechanically great for me utterly not fitting with the theme.I think I am going to go for exceptional attribute magic if that is okay with you? I could not find a houserule that stated that it was not allowed but the rules suggested using exceptional attribute should only be done with explicit permission from the DM.If it is not allowed I would like to go with astral chameleon as Id like to imagine him being able to mildly control the output of his chackras.,shadowchargen,czooq0b,1,t5_36uz9

8104224,0,t3_4pfhzr,Legality Issues The Cde of Honor should be changed. Going up against children or even having them be something he might accidentally hurt doesnt really come up much. It really needs to change to something like the examples in RF or change to another type of person. Or as the book also says is okay you can add another type to the code of honor to balance it out but thatd need approval here as well for it to actually be a proper negative. All of your listed knowledge skills are either language or street knowledges which are both based off of intuition not logic. Should fix that in your chummer. Also Sioux is the name of the tribe Lakota is the name of their language. Only reason i know that is because I used to play a Sioux shaman. Big Regret I am uneasy about letting through it should be a banned quality honestly mostly because its not really a negative. It informs some roleplaying I guess but the actual mechanical negative pretty much NEVER comes up EVER. At least in a community setting like this. I would personally feel better if it was changed to a quality that had more chance to actually come up and affect you negatively. You are free to still keep the roleplaying aspect though what with the orphans and guilt and such.Tips and Build Advice Agility boost is not going to be effective with the muscle toner there since itd at most only increase it by . I suggest you remove the muscle toner and keep the attribute boost to get better use out of it. This would also give you more power points to use so its winwin! That extra point should in my opinion go towards cool utility stuff rather than just dicepool enhancers but thats just me. I am admittedly biased against burnout adepts though but here I do legitimately think its a better option mechanically as well as lorewise. You are definitely going to want around  dice in etiquette at least. Its essentially social stealth and is one of the more commonly rolled skills in the game at least here on shadownet. I HIGHLY recommend taking at least  ranks in it. I dont think your fence will be able to do much that your fixer couldnt. I would recommend changing that to something more niche to be more useful. Maybe a ghoul contact for body dumping or a taxi driver to drive you places? I also recommend typically for  charisma characters having a  point fixer and a  point other contact to maximize usefulness for both contacts but thats just me.Thats all I see for now.

8463945,0,t3_4un0g5,IllegalitiesNeed to change these before you can receive a stamp A small note about your lifestyle. If you want to fluff living above her own shitty little bar that is fine however there are two important things you need to remember. One you can not collect any sort of income from this place. If you want to fluff your working for the man as running the bar or whatever that is fine just no income. Second you can not use the bar to any sort of logistical benefit more than you could your own home. Keep in mind that runners tend to not invite other runners back to their real homes so be careful who you have hanging around there.  Also commercial lifestyles are not allowed on the net. I dont forsee an issue with your lifestyle but whenever I see someone take a lifestyle named something like this I feel the need to state these facts. You have en empty sensor array in your vehicle. Dont forget you can put up to  functions inside of there at no additional cost. You dont have to add one but I would feel remiss if I didnt remind you that you  can take this. AdviceGeneral advice that you are free to ignore or select as you see fit. You are not required to follow this advice it is simply my opinion based off of experience as a GM and many years of playing and most importantly my experience with E.  Once you alter the illegalities you are free to ask for a stamp of approval. You already received a full review and I will only reiterate things Val stated in assurance that you were told or asked about them and you decided to go with them anyways. Ultimately this is your character and if it is how you wish to make them within the confines of our legalities that is your choice. However I want to also be honest with you and tell you I would never take this character on a run. The  best skills you have are spellcastingalchemyartificing. The last one being the worst skill in E and I am not saying that based off of any sort of biased this skill can literally cost you karma to use. You have  and  dice respectively in Etiquette and Perception the two most commonly rolled skills in the game. You dont have a real weapon skill as  dice in pistols is really just nothing you dont even have a pistol purchased. You have no combat spell. You spent  on a power foci that you dont even really need but you didnt get spoof chips and a morphing license plate for your vehicle.  I know you have a lot of experience with the shadowrun system you have been playing the game just as long as I have. However I have been playing in the living communities longer so I ask you to hear me out. In a home game its much easier for the GMs to just sort of tailor encounters themes enemies all to fit the players at the table. While in the living communities it is expected that everyone is going to be able to pull their own weight in a few areas. Everyone needs to be able to spot trouble perception everyone needs to be able to avoid unnecessary trouble etiquette and everyone needs to be able to defend themselves preferably a gun skill but a combat spell will suffice. You should be able to be functional in your role whatever that is in your case being a mage and also have your hook. From the looks of it you want your hook to be in artificing I firmly believe that is not a wise choice but ultimately your an adult and can make that choice yourself. Your skills are spread much much to thin. This character seems more appropriate to be a contact or NPC than a PC.In Closing If you would like a stamp I am more than happy to give you one or you can make any changes you would like. Just let me know what you would like to do. ,shadowchargen,d5zj2v8,1,t5_36uz9

10154097,0,t3_5l2nde,Hey Ill be your chargen minion and such. Before I go over the mechanical side of your character Id like to go over your characters backstory and description. As it stands what you submitted is not really a character. Its just a statblock.Why and how did they get their cyberware? What sort of complications? Why would a noble just pick up and leave to be a Shadowrunner? How did they get rid of their SIN? Why would an awakened noblewoman get so much ware when burnouts are despised in magical socities? I understand having space to build on later but at the moment there is pretty much nothing there.On the description side your character description is so generic it might as well not be there.
