2840919,0,t3_2smkkq,One thing I find very interesting is that this is very much less quantitatively focused than my undergraduate exams which is probably appropriate given the direction of the profession over the last  years. It seems more a philosophy of economics exam today and would probably be most appropriate for a difficult introintermediate macro exam. ,EconPapers,cnr0cy1,13,t5_2t37k

Im simply not going to devote energy to discussing economic issues with strangers online. If I wanted to do that Id have an Econ blog.,EconPapers,cpa48kd,1,t5_2t37k

5298419,0,t3_3nkvv0,Surprising resultgtThis study explores the relationship between mandating anondiscrimination clause in hiring practices along genderlines and the employment of women versus men in developing countries. The study finds a strong positive relationshipbetween a nondiscrimination in hiring clause andwomens relative to mens employment. The relationshipis robust to several controls at the firm and country levels.The results also show sharp heterogeneity in the relationshipbetween the nondiscrimination in hiring clause and womensversus mens employment with the relationship being muchlarger in richer countries and in countries with more womenin the population as well as among relatively smaller firms.I found it in the Feminist Economics journal.,EconPapers,cvoxn3s,2,t5_2t37k

8651858,0,t1_d6lcfqt,Wow thats very interesting. The authors did a great job at selecting lottery winners as a source of income variation while reducing exogenous variables. Often times I appreciate the design of the study more than the results because you have to find some creative ways to measure complicated things like health vs. wealth.,EconPapers,d6n3gdg,1,t5_2t37k
