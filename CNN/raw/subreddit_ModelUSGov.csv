2583967,0,t1_cmvue5a,Certainly.Smitty revised the Keystone Pipeline bill in response to Democrat objections over some things.  Whether it was one Democrat or many is really irrelevant.  He showed his willingness to work with the other party.Its a wonder Smitty didnt just withdraw the bill since you had so obviously stated your intent to veto it no matter what.I believe that Smitty brought some things up in the debate for the bill to repeal Taft Hartley.He was very curtly told that any of his concerns would not be addressed.In fact in that discussion ... many people were borderline rude to him.There is a rudeness problem in general in the subreddit that should not be present.It isnt just the first bill and subsequent veto that have some of the Republicans thinking that things are happening in less than good faith here.gt Stop trying to point fingers and present some more legislation.

3130297,0,t1_comg0op,gt  However that is not the argument here. The argument is about how to fix the economy. Im responding directly to your arguments.  Im not sure how I can be more direct.  Capitalism is the engine that has in a dramatically short time propelled the USA into a leading economic powerhouse.Nations that have tried to move left are abandoning that path and electing governments that are more capitalistminded.I would quote Bono  Aid is just a stopgap. Commerce and entrepreneurial capitalism takes more people out of poverty than aid.    In dealing with poverty here and around the world welfare and foreign aid are a BandAid. Free enterprise is a cure.    Entrepreneurship is the most sure way of development.gtBecause for a corporation it is much easier for machines or third world workers to produce a product than people at home. The corporation seeking only profit wont bring many jobs back to the United States.You mean that it is less expensive.  Not easier.  My solution to this problem is to drop our corporate tax rates to .  This announces that we are open for business.  Our corporate tax rates would be on par with Finland.  I would then propose a perworker tax on foreign workers employed by US companies.  This would encourage companies to keep themselves in the USA and to employ US citizens.gtThereby to increase employment and in turn improve the economy in the long run we must have an increased amount of public works projects such as improvement of roads state manufacturing etc.How much will this cost and where does the money come from?,ModelUSGov,comgblj,1,t5_33mfm

3571480,0,t1_cpzcttj,While I dont agree with the way Septimus decided to voice his opinion this doesnt really do anything more than restrict people who dont speak English even more than they already are by not being able to speak English. As Ive voiced twice already in this thread this needs to have a provision that establishes a governmentfunded language school that specialises in ESL education that is free of charge and accessible to people of all ages. Even if the intent wasnt outright racism the bill in its current form does nothing but further marginalize a group that is already marginalized without giving them an avenue to comply with the law other than to spend their own money on language education which is not possible for many workingclass immigrant families.You seem to be sympathetic with the idea so I have to ask that this bill be pulled and reviewed to provide these provisions. Many other countries do this exact thing to help people adapt to the culture of their new homeland and if that is your goal then this should be a nobrainer.

3596973,0,t1_cq21wqf,You make solid figurative points and such incidents cant be ignored but if youre weighing the occurrences of indiscriminate killing the scale is tipped heavily towards the side of the Palestinians. As another point this time regarding colonization Israel did not invade and occupy a sovereign nation. It established small peaceful and isolated settlements commonly known as kibbutz that didnt infringe on the territory of the indigenous Palestinians or at least the ones with permanent dwellings. Many of the residents of the nation of Palestine were Bedouin and did not settle for more than a few months. My own grandparents were Bedouins in Syria until they settled in Aleppo in their old age.Thats a digression but perhaps the most important things to remember are the reasons that Israel has a right to self defense in the seven weeks of the  Gaza Conflict Operation Protective Edge as described above alone Hamas militantsPalestinian soldiers fired almost  rockets indiscriminately at Israel. Over the years since the mediumrange Jihad AlQud rocket launcher was developed in late  Hamas has launched a total of over  rockets into the State of Israel some killing civilians some intercepted by the Israeli Iron Dome automated antimissile defense system and some exploding on empty land. The most recent version of the launcher the Qassam III as it is termed by Israel has a range of almost  miles and weighs only a little over  pounds making it easy for a militant to fire a rocket the entire set up is only  including  per rocket pack the launcher and ammunition up and leave before any kind of surgical isolated strike such as a small infantry action to be dispatched by Israel. Again the State of Israel is facing a similar problem to what the U.S. has faced for some  years fighting an enemy that cant be recognized easily identified or in most cases even located until they do harm. The UN itself classified the tactic of HamasPalestinian Islamic Jihad rocket use as explicitly designed to kill wound and terrify populations against which it is aimed. the only difference between the Dahiya Doctrine and United States ROE is one is aimed to swiftly end a conflict and one is balanced between the political sides of PR and the use of deadly force to eventually end he conflict. I would be happy to provide sources for the both the number of rockets fired and their specifications. ,ModelUSGov,cq2a58b,1,t5_33mfm

Whether it be the periodical weatherrelated famine in Ukraine the removal of corrupt elements from the Soviet government or the imprisonment of those trying to undermine that government as well as those committing violent crimes all of those events have been distorted and presented without context in order to discredit socialism in the west. And yes the claims of terrible atrocities have been proven factually as well as empirically false. Could we say the same about the Holocaust Generalplan Ost or the March on Rome? These events have been widely documented. Mussolini himself asserts fascism as totalitarian in the Doctrine of Fascism. gt Although you may want a one party CSSA it will not and shall not happen. This nation is founded on ideals that allow people to have their say in the country.Nationstates are monopoly on the use of violence thats all there is to them.

I would direct you towards your own wordsFair enoughgt By stating that equality is idealistic logically you therefore believe that people are naturally unequal inequality means a superior and an inferior group. What I want to know is what group qualifies as superior.I see it as a simple issue really. The phrase The worst form of inequality is to try to make unequal things equal sums up my stance. Each and every human being is completely different from one another. We all have different qualities that obviously set us apart from one another. I can go on and on for a list of qualities that each person has. My point being is that you cannot force person A who is has a different set of needs desires personality etc. to be equal from person B who also has a different set of needs desires personality etc. It makes perfect sense on paper but it is not practical in any sense. Furthermore the whole concept of the individual fits as a gear within the larger structure of hierarchy which contains other gears which makes a culturesociety function.

Before we even announced our party I knew we would be called racists bigots etc. etc. instead of having our party platforms discussed hence why I attempted to be as courteous as possible when we actually did announce our party.gt Now fascists are being taken at face value and youre listening to their nonsense about democratic fascism read Mussolini their ideology is  incompatible with democracy while ignoring the realities of their philosophy.Come now. Youre committing the same fault that many of those ignorant of socialismcommunism do assuming that because x opposes the current form of parliamentary democracy that that means they oppose democracy in general. As I was a previous member of your party Im well aware of the fact that socialistscommunists condemn liberal democracy for not representing the interests of the people. Fascism does the same though it takes a different approach. I recommend you read page  of this anaylsisexcerpt of The Doctrine of Fascism especially this excerptgtGrouped according to their several interests individuals form classes they form tradeunions when organized according to their several economic activities but first and foremost they form the State which is no mere matter of numbers the suns of the individuals forming the majority. Fascism is therefore opposed to that form of democracy which equates a nation to the majority lowering it to the level of the largest numberFascism at least the Italian variety argues against democracy and democratic regimes because in their view they arent truly democratic they dont represent the will or needs of the people. I dont really identify as a fascist as I have a few disagreements with the ideology as a whole especially its emphasis on antimaterialism  but I sympathize with this specific concern about democracies. I like you do dont believe that the current democratic systems found throughout the world really represent the needs and will of the people.

This is not the state of the world. The rich already do all they can to avoid paying their share for federal services much of which goes to improving the lives of the impoverished and the destitute. Responsible and patriotic comrades should be able to pay their taxes as is correct as all benefit from public services provided by the federal government and trust that it is going toward a cause that will clearly benefit the public.Deregulation and disempowering government so that all those who are wealthy enough to subsist and prosper on their own can rule in Plutocratic heaven bereft any positive diversion of accumulated wealth. This turns into hereditary rule as this accumulated wealth and ownership of capital is passed down through the ages. Implemented this ideology would be a disaster for the large majority of people as they will figure out very quickly that the rich and powerful are much less generous than they had claimed to be when they bought congress off to deregulate cut taxes and eliminate helpful programs for the poor and the worker.

4987694,0,t1_cun41vp,gt gt On average every  seconds one unborn human most of the time a minority is killed in the US by a doctor.gt If the doctor were entering the womb and killing the fetus without the mothers permission as you seem to imply you might have been making a point there. But thats not true is it?The fetusembryo was alive but now isnt because of the direct and intentional action of the doctor ie killed.  The fact that the mother consented or the manner in which the child was killed is unimportant there is still a net loss of one human life.gt Im not just talking about the US troops. When you invade a country people who are in that country tend to die as well more so than the troops who are invading. If you add those up they quickly outnumber your figure of  million. I mean the American Indian Wars alone killed tens of millions of natives. And these are full human beings not fetuses who were removed in unwanted or dangerous pregnancies.For many years the estimated civilian casualty ratio was .  Using that number the total US casualty count including civilians rises to  million.  Still less than .  In fact the  number has recently been debunked and  is a more accurate number putting us at  million.The US Census Bureau estimates about  Indians died in the American Indian Wars.  As for the Trail of Tears slightly more than  were moved so the death toll is going to be significantly less than that.  This does not even break  let alone tens of millions.  Not to diminish the tragedy of it but the deaths from small pox and other illnesses brought from Europe dont really count since the settlers had no idea that it would effect the natives so.However you are correct.  If we somehow counted every single death caused funded or involved with the US it would surely be much more than  mil.  But the fact is that abortion deaths still outnumber police and military casualties put together.gt The problem with that is life is continuous. If you consider zygotes human beings then you also have to consider eggs and sperms as human beings in which case wed have to outlaw sexual intercourse since many sperms die during that. So where does it end?I agree.  Your liver is alive too and we can agree that it is not a human.  But a zygote will become a human under natural circumstances and your liver wont.You are correct life is continuous.  You also said that you oppose abortion after  weeks. What happens at the moment the baby turns  weeks old that gives it the right to life?  We can never know exactly when a fetus feels painis viableetc..

We mostly differ with Libertarians on economics whereas Libertarians believe in right wing economics basically full capitalism with no government control we believe that businesses need to be regulated in order to ensure fair practices and to prevent abuse of consumers.

This is exactly the thing you are making the assumption that every convicted criminal placed on death row is guilty. This is simply not the case however. This is  of the main reasons that I oppose the death penalty.gt...but for the death penalty for innocent babies?A simple divergence in our definition of babies and human beings is what causes the difference between our policies. I agree were the process of abortion be to murder live children I would be staunchly prolife. The fact of the matter however is that I do not consider a fertilized zygote the equivalent of a live human being. Thus the removal of a fertilized zygote is not the equivalent of the murder of a human being. I understand and respect your opinion.

Its still minors sending a pic to minor the age isnt the issue. The issue is the leak so it seems like it would be a be better to charge it as sexual harassment or something. In the end Im not exactly sure how much this bill would do anyway at the very least this would be much more impact as a state billl since most sexting prosecutions are likely brought at the state level not federal. ,ModelUSGov,cy3vd3h,2,t5_33mfm

Correct you are not contesting that.. You are right that he rightfully was considered an honorable soldier and a respectable legendary military leader.  I was indeed flippant with my use of the term genocidal he himself was not an orchestrator of such actions at all.. Right again!  Such a revered general lending support to a movement to oust Hitler was remarkable and influential in collapsing the Nazi structure from within.. Not necessarily objecting to his name rather the use of Rommel and Old South slogans for advertising.Now as for your defense of Rommel you are right that he was chivalrous beyond belief especially given the military reality of the day and Hitlers military style.  However you would certainly be playing the part of an apologist historian if you did not concede that Rommel tragically so stuck to the hope of a just battle for Germany when there was none to be had.While he did not necessarily support Hitler and the views he brought to German government it took him a great deal of time to rebel to the point of serious destructive disruption.  Like it or not he undertook an extremely influential campaign to capture resources and cripple enemy flanking strategies so that a genocidal state could carry out an unparalleled Holocaust.Obviously he faced many circumstances that made outright disobedience from the start improbable.  And he did have a desire for a more just sort of war.  But that does not change his complicit role in the spread of Nazism and thereby the deaths of millions of citizens.  So that is why I dont think it is good to be glorifying his image in advertisements for the most diverse country in the world.,ModelUSGov,czkkecj,4,t5_33mfm

However the Clean Water Act of  massively expanded the EPAs funding. I stand in support of the Clean Water Act especially section I and II which authorizes the EPA to give federal funds to local governments. However I would try to cut grants to desalinization plants as that is a very expensive and inefficient way to procure clean water. Instead of the EPA spending money on the desalinization program I would relocate that .B to discretionary spending so the EPA could tackle the more pressing issue of pointsource in the country especially in Western Appalachia. ,ModelUSGov,d2odblx,2,t5_33mfm

Research has been made into using MDMA in psychotherapy e.g. treating PTSD in which a few preliminary studies show promise.Beyond MDMA decent studies have not been made into medical effects. Psilocybin and LSD show some promises too but the research is not there.

It is blatantly unfair for middle class Christian parents to have to support atheist schools through taxes and then tuition for Christian school on top of that in order to get their children into Christian school while atheist parents only have to pay for one set of atheist schools that preach their doctrines. And yeah that means well probably have Mormon schools and Muslim schools and Buddhist schools and wacko hippie New Age schools and whatever. As long as they teach the three Rs and arent doing anything otherwise illegal it should be fine.Local control over the schools is vital for a free society! Everybody should be able to choose what kinds of schools they want instead of having only one Leftist atheist ideology mandated from Washington for all the schools!Edit to circumvent Reddits timer for unpopular ideas When I say atheist I mean atheist. Treating all religions as equal  and since some of them really are absurd treating them all as equally absurd  is not secular.

8786784,0,t3_50eut5,Lets assume for the sake of argument two things. Global climate change is manmade and our emissions are driving that change. . The way we are doing things now fossils fuels is cheaper than the alternatives or else we would have moved beyond fossil fuels already. This act will hurt the economy. Its doing a good thing dont get me wrong but it wont actually solve the global crisis of climate change. The United States cannot act alone stifle its economy and watch as China India and the rest of the developing world emit greenhouse gasses and bring about climate change anyway. gt a. All Federal subsidies to fossilfuel producing businesses are hereby revoked. I dont like the government picking winners and losers any more than the next guy but this is flat out irresponsible. I would like to see an amendment to gradually bring down fossilfuel subsidies and save the American people from the shock of higher gas prices and fewer jobs in the energy industry. ,ModelUSGov,d740ry5,3,t5_33mfm

11036719,0,t1_deiz9tu,Hear hear! Absolutely agree.Furthermore Id like to add that the term dismemberment abortion is not one that is often used in the medical community. In the interest of clarity and professionalism Id like to suggest to all current or aspiring legislators that any future legislation should use proper medical terms.,ModelUSGov,deizqvy,5,t5_33mfm

11304904,0,t1_dfdalz9,I have no opinion on the Second Amendment beyond how it applies to my duties as Sec. of Education.All Im saying is that vagueness is not necessarily a bad thing in most legislation.
