6725243,0,t3_434d1w,gtSkepticism about corporate involvement in election systems is nothing new. During the  presidential election for instance there was widespread suspicion on the left about Diebold voting machines.Hogwash. There was no widespread suspicion there wereare still roadblocks put in place to prevent analyzing the software and comparing any paper ballots to the computer tally. Its not skepticism its an actual concern about an obvious conflict of transparency. And it wasnt only on the left.,electionfraud,d0ey5rr,2,t5_2tmtj

8454708,0,t3_4vf0ty,Protesting signing petitions none of that matter when the government is rigged. If you want Clinton out of office shoot the bitch. Corrupt government is exactly what the nd Amendment is for. If you care this much do something that will actually make a difference. Ending her is the only way to get her out of office. Keep killing them until justice is done. That was the foundation of America. Nothing else you do matters. There is only one way left. If you really believe shes this bad then do something about it. If not then fall in line. ,electionfraud,d5ydgrp,2,t5_2tmtj
