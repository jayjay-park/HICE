466820,0,t1_cfta3vb,If it was only  thats pretty much what Id do  make an ashtray or something.There really is something to be said for tearing into it yourself just dont mistake it for a financially sound move. Itll cost you money but the knowledge youll gain is absolutely worth it if this is something youre into.There is a nice middle ground though. You can always tear it down and read the manual  inspect everything as you go. Then when its reduced to component parts sell them all off separately. Even if the pistons and jugs are ruined and maybe heads? you could probably double your money just by parting out. Granted its a shittier deal when you factor in your time but if youre getting the benefit of learning what the innards look like its a nice middle of the road measure to let you learn about the engine without pouring cash into the rebuild...,bikebuilders,cftbuqo,2,t5_2wxiw

During engine braking all of the slack in the chain will be at the top portion of the chain regardless of there being a tensioner.If the chain can hit something in your current configuration with the chain tensioner removed then it probably will still hit it with the chain tensioner installed just with less frequency.I had to make this protector to keep my chain from touching my oil tank fittings and my chain was pretty tight AND I tried a tensioner,bikebuilders,d7jy2zf,2,t5_2wxiw

Also try to be more objective when describing the motorcycle.  Your review contains no criticism.
