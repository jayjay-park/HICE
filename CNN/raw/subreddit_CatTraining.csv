4716300,0,t1_ctopcpe,Seconding this. My kitty really really likes a form of peekabo  he gets really excited just when things go out of sight. That and watching any cats play... they love chasing eachother when their backs are turned and then running away and so on and so forth. Its part of the game. He will find us and attack us makes it sound like its a game to the cat. If it was pure aggression it would more likely be brought on by the humans approaching him and him reacting defensively.,CatTraining,ctp10zr,2,t5_2w4gn

7213174,0,t3_4anrg8,Do yourself a favor and buy a child toilet seat the one called Mayfair Next Step. The cats probably afraid of falling in so the child seat will give him more confidence. You just have to remember to put BOTH seats down.,CatTraining,d1y2yen,1,t5_2w4gn
7938924,0,t3_4nzyuw,He learned it really fast.  Since Im inexperienced with this what should I teach him next?  He loves attention and behaves like a dog most of the time.,CatTraining,d48ermy,3,t5_2w4gn

11127146,0,t3_5yedxt,To have any chance of this working youll have to start over from introductions.Id separate out the one whos being a brat and allow the others free roam. Then do a proper introduction  from step one taking at LEAST a month before you allow any contact.The month will allow everyone to destress a bit especially if you use a few feliway plug ins. They have a manual spray bottle you can use too if multiple diffusers isnt in your budget. And you can try reintegrating them once theyre all calmer.Short of that...you could try just exercising the trouble maker a lot more...but TBH its unlikely to work in my experience. Ive had some luck with doing treat time everyone in one room receiving treats. Anxious kitties get fed higher up with our whole kitty family to smooth stressful times over but its not a whole solution.,CatTraining,det93of,1,t5_2w4gn
