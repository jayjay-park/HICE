5323006,0,t1_cvrxvsc,TBH I rarely use AV stuff because if you use an updated browser and are careful what you download you should be fine but if you want to scan something ClamWin is always an option. afaik it still supports Windows x You may also be able to run a modern AV that still supports XP with this patch but dont take my word on it.,windowsxp,cvs2qvp,1,t5_2tqa7

8783994,0,t3_50bfvo,Why is it not possible to have them all use a shared network folder?  Seems kind of silly to upload to the internet and have them all download from the internet and that sounds so very not PCI compliant,windowsxp,d73o706,3,t5_2tqa7
9147726,0,t1_d805wji,Key word MAIN! Windows XP is still perfectly usable but yes you should probably still have a computer with windows  or  in your house not windows  or vista... theyre bad. Also Windows XP is a very compatible OS being able to run MSDOS winx and windows  apps. If your worried about internet safety get Firefox. For an antivirus... aVast doesnt work on my xp laptop but Malewarebytes does which is a great program. Also I have found that most SteamDVDROM video games work on windows xp. Hopefully that helps.,windowsxp,d8bjhd3,1,t5_2tqa7

10647759,0,t3_5sd4t7,Dont use gmail. Dont use chrome. You shouldnt anyway. Use Firefox. Case closed. On the other hand if youre using gmail and chrome you really dont have to worry about security on your PC you already installed the spyware voluntarily.Oh and btw Firefox will still run on XP and get security updates the article got that intentionally? wrong. Even the new features but only once a year. ,windowsxp,dde8g1g,0,t5_2tqa7
