1355926,0,t1_cim4ngd,Not to nitpick like fuck but take out your shiny weedcrusader armor or take off? Also who exactly? Youre are now having this argument where there isnt one with like half a dozen people including myself who felt the need to respond. No one is putting words in your mouth. By referencing rtrees you suggested her behavior had something to do with marijuana apparently  a number of people felt that was presumptuous or out of line in some way. You could have just deleted the comment but instead chose to argue defend backtrack blame shift etc. Now its too late because Ive screencapped the whole thread and am posting it to rsubbredditdrama which reminds me OP should post this pic to rtrashy before someone else does.Finally I think you mean strain not strand. I dont know what youre smoking.,badparents,cim9881,1,t5_2wg7v

5795844,0,t1_cxf4uhv,I was going to suggest phoning your social worker. I had the wrong impression here. I dont know your whole situation like schooling and everything else.. but you ultimately are the only one who can change your future! Take it as rude or however you want but you are the only one who can make it better. Id get a job and be long gone.  Ive also been on my own by choice since I was  paying my bills by myself and always worked. You end up being trapped if you dont.  Its nice to have options. Maybe give it some thought. ,badparents,cxfj241,2,t5_2wg7v
