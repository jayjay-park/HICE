7934069,0,t1_d47sl0h,My assumption for how it will work is thisAll console games are built with set tech specs in mind so Project Scorpio needs to be able to simulate the tech specs of the Xbox One for the cross compatibility support. As such more than likely Project Scorpio will use a Polaris chip similar to the AMD Radeon RX  but not the same obviously since it will be part of a SoC SystemonaChip and then when a Xbox One game that is not patched for Project Scorpio is played the OS would put the VM into a compatibility mode where the specs would be set to what is available to a game running on the Xbox One disabling CUs reducing core and memory clocks and not exposing new architecture extensions.Edit Also to the people saying its just an overclocked RX  its highly doubtful they are just taking the RX  and overclocking it. The GPU will be part of a customdesigned SoC made by AMD so they will probably be integrating the Polaris technology but not by just taking the RX  silicon and integrating it into the SoC. If I had to guess I would think the GPU will have more CUs than the RX  but running at a lower clock to make it more compatible with a SoC layout.Edit  Lastly the fact that it uses an SoC makes NVIDIA extremely improbable since NVIDIA only makes ARM SoCs and doesnt have a license to the x architecture.,xbox,d47v46g,2,t5_2qoih

9825170,0,t3_5fyt5x,I did but Im still not as good as I am with mampkb.  I generally keep my sensitivity a click or so below the default on most games.  You have to be more deliberate but it helps on aiming.  Very important you dont really need to go for head shots unlike on a PC.  They are very hard to get with a controller plus remember everyone else is using a controller too so everyone has the same disadvantage...  It takes time...,xbox,dao8o0w,1,t5_2qoih
