3393060,0,t1_cpeyww5,I cant argue with Queen seeing as how I only have their greatest hits and never delved further into their catalog. Foo fighters Ive listened to and enjoyed all of their albums. I dont think they count at all. Weezer doesnt make any sense at all to call them a singles band. Even forgetting their first two albums that are almost universally considered well produced beginning to end Ive found most of their singles suck compared to the album. Beverly Hills We are all on drugs and memories are some of their weakest efforts. Besides I think it is rare or at least not entirely fair to call any band a singles band. Id say most listeners are just singles listeners. Most people dont actually listen to albums regardless of how great it might be. They listen to the single for a month and move on. Im pretty sure three of the best songs theyve ever released obviously just my opinion so grain of salt werent singles across the sea Angel and the one and Foolish Father. ,weezer,cpf1aiu,4,t5_2s48r
3398643,0,t1_cpfajve,Id say pop is the only genre that could legitimately be called a singles band. Because the whole point of the genre is to put out a few throw away hits that will be fun for a summer and then move on. If we are going off of fans of the bands Id think most fans of any one band dont just like the singles. With the probable exception of pop artists. Whereas Id we are talking what the general public thinks Id guess that the general public believes every artist as band are a single band. I mean thats kind of the point of singles to begin with. Sell a single song to the masses and hope a select few will latch on and enjoy the rest. ,weezer,cpfo6gd,0,t5_2s48r

There are some great power pop songs that are just classic weezer to me Perfect Situation The Other Way and some darker really emotional songs that I love Pardon Me Damage in Your Heart This is Such a Pity Haunt You Every Day.

For the results it could be that the BlueWhite formula is consistently strong which is dominated by the Pinkerton formula while not by the EWBAITE formula. I have to say that Blue took a while for me to get into the whole album while Pinkerton was instant love shouldnt it be the other way around haha? I think my love for Pinkerton is so strong because I was together with a psycho ex when I discovered it. So White may take a while for me and its only been one month.

11674924,0,t1_dgja9a0,I agree to an extent but while a lot of punk uses the basic pop structure and can even be pretty melodic its very often very sloppy and messy and distinctly unpoppy. Which is very unWeezer. That said Weezer has delved into the poppunk territory and clearly takes some inspiration from poppunk.,weezer,dgjdah1,2,t5_2s48r
