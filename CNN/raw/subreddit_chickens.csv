6427459,0,t1_czk0sjv,All of my hens freerange. I converted half of my  x  barn into a coop with nesting boxes and all. We have a lot of acreage. We have one rooster named Frank. Hes very nice. I suppose we get a couple dozen eggs a day  sometimes more. We always have more demand for eggs than supply. A lot of my hens are getting a little long int the beak to be laying much these days but theyre pets.  I love my gals. ,chickens,czk4xyd,1,t5_2r4wm

7468936,0,t1_d2r0ldk,thanks for your advice  you are right.  I have spoken to a game keeper who said the mild winter has caused a lot of problems  lots of fox pups born then a cold snap has killed the baby rabbits so the vixens are out desperate for other food.  I am in UK so need a game keeper to kill the fox  I have spoken to one today.  I have tried the flashing light etc repellents but they are useless. ,chickens,d2r67pg,2,t5_2r4wm
7611191,0,t1_d3745lz,So first off do your home work before you go spouting your mouth off about fear mongering. The reason no one tells you not to let your dog lick you is because the amount of transmittable diseases from dog to human is much lower then almost all animals if yours root up dead animals and you let them lick you thats your thing. Samonella is pretty damn contagious EASILY transmitted from bird to human and cam cause seriouse side effects. The cdc puts out warnings for a reason. It because idiots like you run around and tell people its ok to handle birds like this and not wash your hands. Chickens are live stock first then pets.  Also Amprolium is a b vitamin complex that attacks the parasites thiamine processing ability. So yes wash your hands when handling live stock. Dont put your mouth on animals you probably shouldnt let your corpse eating dog lick your face either. And amprolium isnt scary and wont kill your birds or turn them into mutants.,chickens,d37cpo2,-3,t5_2r4wm

9377621,0,t1_d94nnnx,Yeah. This is something I really wanted. And maybe one day Ill be able to have some chicks of my own. But ustormecho and uAUSBackyardFarmer made me realize just how inappropriate of a time it is to do that now. I had told some other friends and they thought it would either work out or be a funny story to tell later on if it didnt. But there as young as me. I didnt really take this too seriously. But it is a serious thing. And thankyou ustillimproving. Your words are kind. ,chickens,d94ohes,5,t5_2r4wm

I have a great aunt and uncle up in Pennsylvania and their children brought THEIR two boys down to Texas to explore about. Their boys were in elementary when they came down and I was in high school years ago lol. They were simply amazed and enthralled when they visited my grandparents ranch with me there. I took them around and showed them everything. ,chickens,dexcq13,2,t5_2r4wm
