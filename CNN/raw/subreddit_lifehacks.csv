We sell a good number of replacement ovens because people think this is a good idea. Many new oven range systems have hidden oven elements which are concealed in the bottom of the oven and not visible. If you cover the bottom of the oven with the aluminum foil it will overheat and combust. Yes aluminum will melt in the bottom and destroy your appliance. Restricting the airflow in any way will adversely affect the safety and performance of the appliance. Most all range owners operation manuals specifically caution not to do this. ,lifehacks,ceno24j,21,t5_2qj5n

If you fill out a survey for them it probably cost you more than giving you a free doughnut.And they dont get nothing in return.  Ignore the poll results.  Instead imagine the impressive return on getting a posting on Reddit!  By itself that is worth lots of boxes of doughnuts.

My father is still using his original Droid even.Also if you honestly dont think that planned obsolescence is a main factor when they design just about any electronics youre naive. Their  goal is to make money and if they made phones that lasted a long time and stayed up to date through upgrades people would have less reason to buy a new phone every year or two and they dont make as much money. Your processor should have been plenty fast enough to browse the internet and Facebook but they increase the amount of processing power needed on purpose so that you have to buy a new phone. Theres a reason you cant alter Apple products in any way they dont want you improving your device before they can release a new product that forces you to spend more money on a new device to improve your device.,lifehacks,ch3jfkg,2,t5_2qj5n

Keep doing this until you actually believe your leg is heavy you will know when you get there Do the same for the other leg followed by each of your arms.

To minimize this effect eat less but more frequently maybe avoid too much carbohydrates.You might have boring work and after lunch you can not focus enough to keep Your mind running smoothly.I think it is second case. Try to eat not as much and see if this mitigate your problem. Try a bit of keto diet. For couple days avoid carbohydrates. Pick something from keto diet eggs cheese red or white meat some vegetables avoid fries potatoes bread noodles and so on.

Cant watch TV or use the internet its too close to bedtime! If Im lucky I get to play with my kids a bit but if theyre older than  guess what? Theyre watching TV or using the internet....hmm not enough time to take up a serious hobby....I guess I could read a book or tell my significant other about my workday a bit more then go to sleep. BIG DAY OF THE SAME SHIT TOMORROW! thank god I have no time to get informed on world events or I might actually become a smart executive!Guys I think we found why it seems like high paid folks are living in a bubble. And this was a very optimistic schedule chances are they actually dont get home until  or later by the time they eat and talk to their family its  by the time they prep for tomorrow its past  and chances are theres some household chores that need doing.

3162333,0,t1_copn323,As its been said. It is hard on an in tank fuel pump to be run low on fuel. It has nothing to do with range.The fuel pump is an electric motor that in most cases runs at  duty cycle any time the engine is running. It is submersed in gasoline and that gasoline keeps the pump cool. Repeatedly running a car low on fuel will shorten the life of the fuel pump. That being said this is not something that you need to be worried about just aware of. Running on E a few times over the typical  year life of an electric fuel pump isnt going to cause any issues.Most fuel pumps actually have baffling that keeps fuel on the pump even when there is almost no gas in the tank also.

4344366,0,t3_3aq1wc,Good tips but to expand A guide from a very frequent flier on how to get the best flight for you in terms of not just cost but overall valueConsider all costsSure you found a great flight on Spirit or Ryanair. And youre a savvy traveler youve heard all the things about fees for luggage exit row seats and other things you dont need. However dont forget things like fees for a carryon your budget airline may have smaller limits than youre used to fees for getting a printed boarding pass in the airport or exorbitant fees for changing your ticket should something come up.Also have you considered that your transportation to that lowcost airport will be expensive andor time consuming? That whatever you buy airside or onboard will be extremely markedup? That you may be flying with a carrier with no partner airlines  if youre delayed and you land later than the last bus from your outoftheway destination airport a taxi will set you back several dollars more?Consider your valueSure staying over on a Saturday reduces cost on a roundtrip ticket. However if youre going to work Monday morning it may not be best value to arrive home late on a Sunday. Sometimes its just not worth screwing up your whole week to save  on airfare.Also dont fall in love with a price tag on a computer screen. Once youre lodged into E in the middlemiddle seat of a  with a  configuration youd wish youd forked out hundred dollars to be in the Economy seat riiight there in front of you. Remember the rule if your flight is long enough to involve more than one meal its long enough for you to do whatever you can to fly a better class than coach.However ... thats not always an option fear not Get the good seats. Also in Steerage. Pay for them.Whatever you have to do to prebook your seat do it. Use seatguru.com to find out exactly what type of flight youre on and use the information to your advantage. Prebooking a seat even at a smallish cost is usually good value. Theres a lot of difference between being in your preferred aislewindow seat in the side row with just you and your seatmate  maybe with extra legroom if you can snag an exit row  and then being in the dreaded middle seat in the back row next to the lavatories. Except usually the price. Because you pay the same for your coach ticket at purchase. On international flights forward is always better. Yes it is.Remember the line from boarding? Yeah its also going to be in immigration when you land. Time to exit JFK terminal  from a business seat?  minutes if youre the only plane landing from LHR at that time. Time to get out from a coach seat? Up to  minutes.So even if youre still flying coach the difference between seat A and A can be half an hour extra in line. Even if A isnt a premium seat compared to A its still a motherfing premium seat when you exit the aircraft. So long suckas!.Before you buy premium seats check the loadFrequent flier sites dont want to plug search for em have several members with subscriptions to Expertflyer.com that let you see exactly how many tickets are sold on a given flight. With experience we learn to gauge pretty much if a flight will be full or not. Ask them to help you if youre just on that onceayear flight. PM me if you need help with this. Why? Because getting four seats to yourself in coach is way better than anything you can get from an Economy seat. Generally though airlines are getting better at filling up capacity ... but not always. On my short flights for work on smaller planes a colleague and I describe this as The Perfect   you have nobody in your row of three nobody in the aisle across of  and nobody in the back front diagonal forward or backward. The Perfect  seats of which you occupy  with all the space and privacy in the world.I want to splurgeYes you do! Ive never looked back since I learned you could actually lie down for a good sleep on flights. Get into the miles collection game but for everyone remember that we business fliers have JulyAugust off. As were speaking you can get Business class lieflat bed champagne upon boarding the whole shenanigans for under  between the US and Europe in July. Roundtrip. What a perfect way to start and end a week in Paris huh?In summaryFlying is fun. And while your destination is surely the goal of flying youre getting a lot more vacation out of it if you make your flying time enjoyable as well. That may be worth a few bucks ...,lifehacks,csfcann,2,t5_2qj5n

After periods of physical exertion voluntary fluid intake may be inadequate to offset fluid deficits.When youre a kidgtDuring exercise children may be at greater risk for voluntary dehydration. Children may not recognize the need to replace lost fluids and both children as well as coaches need specific guidelines for fluid intake. Additionally children may require longer acclimation to increases in environmental temperature than do adults.  Recommendations are for child athletes or children in hot climates to begin athletic activities in a wellhydrated state and to drink fluids over and above the thirst threshold.Apart from what was already mentioned the higher rates of kidney stones and the ability to better withstand symptoms of severe dehydration mild dehydration mind affect cognitive function.gtThis is heath advice based on broscience which is what Im responding to.Youre reading way too much into this.

The fact that its at such high tempos  generally means that dynamics are a vital part of retaining space between all the elements.Squashing it a bit is good for drums sometimes and can be good for sub bass but its also important to know where to ease off on compression and limiting.

If you have bunch of time and are looking to get built like a bodybuilder yes biceps curls and benching are going to be part of the regimen. For others with only a few hours a week to workout what should you do? The experiment being performed is simply what if I just do Hill Sprints  days of the week? They are insanely taxing work the bigger muscles of the body and blend together lifting running up a hill is like a mini squat and intense cardio. Because of this Hill Sprints seem like the ideal exercise for getting both strong and cut which is what most people want.

5586754,0,t3_3rmwfp,Be careful. Brushing too long and vigorously can lead to tooth abrasion and gum recession. Toothpaste often has abrasive particles in it that essentially work like sandpaper to take off a thin layer that hopefully mostly consists of plaque and stains. However once you get past that point you start taking away enamel and push your gums up which may lead to sensitivity and whiter teeth eventually getting yellower as you get past the white enamel into the inner yellower dentin layer. This is more prevalent with certain brands of electric toothbrushes as well mostly sonicare. ,lifehacks,cwpl7n8,10,t5_2qj5n

If you get caught without a ticket you have to pay a fine but most people assume they pocket some of that money. If you refuse to pay the fine theyll call in the actual police but most people especially tourists who are on a schedule dont want to waste the time dealing with the police.The thing is the last time I was in Prague the ticket machines werent particularly the most intuitive things in the world so tourists who dont speak Czech are the most likely people to not get a proper ticket which means the undercover control agents do seem to check tourists for their tickets more than locals.,lifehacks,cx1hhfu,1,t5_2qj5n

6158419,0,t1_cypfd7d,There are  possible ways in which a magnet will begin to demagnetize. Via heat via an opposing magnetic field and via shock.The point at which a magnet begins losing its magnetization from heat is known as its Curie temperature. For Neodymium magnets this temperature is  degrees kelvin approximately  degrees Fahrenheit. This would obviously not be an issue in a kitchen setting.Opposing magnetic fields would likewise not be an issue and these would last very easily beyond a human lifespan. Finally shock such as from a fall can partially demagnetize certain older technologies such as magnetic steel. This again should not be an issue in this application or with these type of magnets.TLDR these magnets are indeed permanent from a human perspective.,lifehacks,cypncvp,3,t5_2qj5n

7002769,0,t3_4bjutk,Several of these are rather poor advice particularly the bear and the cobra. If you see a cobra with his hood flared you should slowly back away. That is a warning telling you to back the fuck off. You should heed that warning. They rarely ever strike while flared. With a grizzly which is the bear pictured punching it in the nose would result in a mauling. How you handle an encounter with a bear depends on the type of bear and while fighting back with a black bear is advised fighting back with a browngrizzly or a polar bear will very likely get you killed. ,lifehacks,d1a3x22,8,t5_2qj5n

7011701,0,t3_4bmzeg,No knead bread. Youll look like a magician. This recipe is modified from the Jim Leahy one that the NY Times made famous. This makes one gigantic and delicious loaf of heaven. It does take a long time to create BUT if you do one rise overnight and the fridge rest while youre at work then you will have bread for dinner time. Use an enameled Dutch oven for best results. If yours isnt coated then line with parchment paper before adding dough. You can halve this recipe if you have a small Dutch oven. Ingredients cups allpurpose flour teaspoons finely ground sea salt dough can be up to  salt before it inhibits the yeast I like salty bread but you might want to reduce to  tsp teaspoon active dry yeast not instant cups warm water  not hot or youll murder the yeast cup corn mealIn a large bowl whisk flour salt and yeast until well mixed  a good two minutes of whisking. Pour in warm water slowly and use a spoon or spatula to stir and fold until a shaggy dough forms scraping down the sides. The mixture will be wet and very sticky. It wont be like traditional dough at all so do not worry when it looks like a mess. Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place  preferably overnight  for  hours.After dough has risen and looks all bubbly and flattened out in the bowl put the mix in the fridge for another  hours.After the fridge rest heat oven to  degrees with your Dutch oven inside. Keep in oven  minutes after oven comes to temp.Flour your shaping surface. Scrape dough out of the bowl. Quickly shape the dough into a ball shape. Dont work it too much. Let the dough rest while the Dutch oven heats up. Sprinkle the dough with corn meal.After heated remove Dutch oven from oven CAREFULLY. Sprinkle bottom of Dutch oven liberally with corn meal. Transfer dough to Dutch oven. Put lid on and return to oven.Bake bread  minutes covered then another  to  minutes uncovered until dough is baked through and dark golden brown on top. Use a thermometer to check the temp should be between  and  degrees as this is a very wet dough. Let bread cool for  minutes or more or youll have slicing issues.please forgive all formatting issues and feel free to ask any questions you might have!,lifehacks,d1b4g86,2,t5_2qj5n

7075184,0,t3_4cgfer,Airline passenger service system software developer hereThis is just bullshit. The price increase that you see is true but its not because the software is tracking your moves and try to score a higher price but mainly because when you search for a flight and continue for at least one more move it creates the PNR for you in order to save your seat from the inventory. And of course with each seat saved the prices may or may not increase depending on your booking class Not just economy business but the actual class created for each price range.These PNRs get destroyed when you dont complete the booking but of course after a certain time which depends on the software and the choice of the airline. And when these PNRs get destroyed the prices go down as well.Another price difference that you might notice is caused by promotions to certain customer groups. Its not that theyre trying to sell at a higher price its the opposite. For certain customer groups the seat might be cheaper. This might depend on several different parameters like where youre searching from what actions you take before you search depending on your behavior you might just fit to a certain pattern and get a promotionThere are also other factors in play as well. The sales channels of the airline are not strictly online there are tour operators global sales agencies and such which might have a better offer because of their agreement with the airline.This can get really really complex at times which Im not going to be able to explain here. But I can assure you among the airlines I have worked with and the software Im aware of which are used to book a total of  million airline tickets per year there is no such thing as increasing the price because youve done this and that none at all.,lifehacks,d1ic3gi,128,t5_2qj5n

Me and my girlfriend were just waiting for the rest of the tour group when a guy comes to up and offers me a rose . I didnt want it so I kept saying no . But when I started checking my camera  the guy drops the rose onto my camera. Im like ok maybe hes giving them for free but no  he begins asking for money . So I keep handing back the rose but he just wants money. I keep calm and keep trying to hand back the rose . People in my tour group just said to drop the rose which I should have done . I just kept pushing the rose closer until he took it which he finally did. One that I did not see is the petition ladies and groups of seller . While I was at the Eiffel Tower with my tour group . My group and I were acting like any tourists would and began taking photos of the tower . While we were taking photos  a few ladies came up to my group asking to sign some paper . My tour guide told us before we got off the bus to ignore them but one of my group was not listening and my group member named Samnot real namesaid yes. I swear when Sam said yes . All three ladies came together swarming her . Me and the rest of the group stayed together watching the ladies and Sam . Sam realized that the petition asks you to put your credit card info. She just gave back the paper to the ladies and the ladies began following her  and actually grabbed Sam . My group including Sam just moved far away from the ladies while they just called us crazy . The sellers at the Eiffel towers are not as crazy unless you provoke them . When my girlfriend and I began leaving the Eiffel Tower . She wanted to buy a tower from the sellers which she did .the moment we started walking away from the seller . Two more sellers followed us telling us that they had a better price . The sellers followed us to our group and asked everyone until our tour guide told them to leave . Traveling is still really fun but keep your guard in a populated area ,lifehacks,d1oowc8,4,t5_2qj5n

When that bloom has been washed off that layer of protection is lost and eggs begin to spoil due to bacteria being absorbed through the shell.

Giving us disgusting barely edible oils that we can barely eat more than a tablespoon of is what makes people think low fat is good.

8845561,0,t3_51bq5f,Dentist here. This guys gotta be trolling right?Full disclosure I closed the video after he mentioned the ingredients.Firstly the alcohol in mouthwash is not in any way a part of the active ingredients. It is used to evenly suspend the active ingredients of mouthwash. Thats why there are nonalcoholic products. Also rubbing alcohol is not the same as drinking alcohol and is not safe for consumption not that ethyl alcohol is safe.... Alcohol can actually dry out your mouth and encourage bacterial growth leading to cavities and gum disease.Secondly mouthwash is not just toothpaste and alcohol. Toothpaste isnt really even the most important part of brushing. Its method of action is as an abrasive that also delivers fluoride if it is a fluoride toothpaste. The toothbrush itself is the most important factor.This video is just a way to make your breath a little fresher which you could do as easily and less silly by brushing or chewing a stick of gum.As a side note hydrogen peroxide is not something I would generally recommend as a substitute. It is a strong oxidizer and may cause more damage than good unless sufficiently diluted and even then it is generally not recommended for internal use. Theres a reason why it causes sensitivity to teeth when used as a whitener. Its potent stuff.,lifehacks,d7b40ef,9,t5_2qj5n

I mean...seriously?

It basically said that because of how much lens based content is being made people devalue the photograph as an art. Its interesting that photography has always sort of been fighting to be recognized as an art form yet has been continually been made the opposite. Its sort of depressing.

It doesnt take a genius to recognize that stepping back from a situation momentarily and doing some deep breathing can calm you down.The real problem with this article is that it does try to target people with anxiety disorders. Anxiety is anxiety regardless of its intensity or how recurring it is.

All this emphasis on GIVING to the homeless. A person begging on an exit ramp of a highway can makes hundreds of dollars a day. These people dont need anything given to them.

Throughout the day you deal with thankless people for the majority who hate you because you have to tell them when theyve done something wrong and need to be punished. You get told I pay your salary I pay taxes do you have nothing better to do? youre worthless. Do you feel good about what youre doing!? Ive used the ultimate word to describe what the policing field is thankless. You hate them until you need them and when you need them you treat them like garbage. Yet would you be brave enough to do it? Are you intelligent and compassionate enough to do it? I doubt it because here you are on the internet putting down a profession that you know nothing about except that theyre assholes out to get you.

10325251,0,t1_dcedqhm,Ive been using the first two techniques for  years the song and the  pegword systemMy  Presentation of Three memory techniques for my Toastmasters Group.There is a Russian proverb that says Being absent minded means looking for the horse you are riding! But while we can laugh at such a joke many of us are concerned about our memory. Is it early senility that makes us forget so many things? Is it the stress in our lives? Are we destined to develop a worsening memory as we grow older? For example one of my clients yesterday gave me  things to remember ground beef tomatoes mozzarella soup bell peppers butter milk syrup mascara asparagus and Fruit Loops.Use the following song to help you to learn to associate the items which make up the song thumb shoe etc with things you want to remember and practice this technique often.So for the first item  I pictured burning my thumb on a skillet with ground around.For item  I pictured walking in shoes made of tomatoes.For  I pictured my friend standing in a tree her last name is Mott.For  I pictured closing a door on bell peppers that were making crunching sounds.For  I pictured several bees trapped in butter.For  I pictured sticks splashing milk.For  I pictured these angels putting syrup on pancakes.For  I pictured a gate with a mask on it with mascara.For  I pictured a asparagus in a jug with someone pouring wine on top of it.For  I pictured a hen with Fruit Loops cereal around its neck.I then easily told the items in order and after that I said the evennumbered items from ten to two bananas peach carrots etc. and the oddnumbered items from one to nine milk sugar tea and so on and could tell say any combination of the items. For these techniques practice practice practice. And the more real you can make the associations colorful noisy strange etc. the more effective the associations will be.This method also lets you be aware of what item is missing  e.g. number what did I picture goes with wine?. You can also combine this method with other methods such as the following pegword system or the Method of Places apparently made famous because a famous poet was able to remember who lay dead under the rubble of an earthquake in Greece by bringing to his mind his view of where the people had been sitting. He left the hall just before the earthquake struck and people did not know where their deceased relatives etc. were but he was able to accurately point out their dead bodies.A great book on memory is MoonWalking with Einstein by an American journalist who reported on an American memory event and then won it the next year.The following technique has been around for over  years and it is described in a variety of places including in Harry Loraynes How to develop a super power memory by Harry Lorayne Fell Publishers .   This is probably impractical for most people but I found it fun to learn the  pegwords and now can associate them with many different objects. I also use it to help me fall asleep at night at times. I practice saying it to myself in grocery store lines etc..TD. N. M.. R. L. Jshchdg. Kcg. Fv. Pb. Zs. The sound for  will always be T or D. The letter T has one downstroke..

Disease Another set of Memory technique is that of Method of Places  one of the oldest ways of remembering things picturing items at places in your home e.g. and by walking through your home or elsewhere being able to recall them in order. In our house I would line up the items in this way .  Mailbox.  Walkway. .  Front door. .  Living room. .  Dining room. .  Downstairs bathroom. .  Kitchen near stove. .  Garage. .  Stairs..  Landing..  Computer room..  Grandmas room..  Als room..  Our room..  Our bathroom..  Als bathroom..  Camping room..  Loft area.By associating different ideas topics etc. with different portions of a home I can mentally walk through our home and summon up the things Im trying to remember.  In the Middle Ages this was widely practiced in Italy with people visiting very complex homes to learn how to remember many different items.  The above technique stems from Greece with a famous poet being able to say where people were buried where under rubble that had been caused by an earthquake. He had left the dinner just before the earthquake struck but he was able to remember by location where the various people were buried in this help the relatives recover their bodies. Why not try it with your own home or with a home you are familiar with?       Associate these areas with the items activities etc. you want to remember in as vivid a fashion as possible.         And practice practice practice! ,lifehacks,dcefagf,6,t5_2qj5n

If it were that easy to control our emotions then just the first part of the tip would be sufficient. Keep calm. This can win you most arguments debates and even fights. But we cant always just keep calm thus the escalation. This tip is the equivalent of saying Want to be rich? Get a better job and save more money.

Besides a significant amount of the time either nothing will be seen on imaging or the report will show problems that arent actually symptomatic like mild arthritic changes.  Its a lot of expense for maybe some information that maybe is relevant.Speaking as someone with back pain from an injury they dont even jump to imaging for injuries.  They evaluate the symptoms amp movement patterns and perform some special tests that provoke certain types of injuries in order to get an idea of whats going on functionally.  These are generally as simple as sit on the edge of this table slouch as much as you can then straighten one leg.  If that makes the pain worse youve got a piece of the puzzle.

And there was also a lot of irony involved.For example for a six to eight year interval the Dust Bowl wiped out thousands of farms from Texas to Canada.  But at the same time those farms outside of the Dust Bowl region were so productive that crop prices collapsed.  This hit at the same time as a substantial deflation of the currency as well as a currency shortage.  A bushel of wheat was  cents and corn was being burned for fuel instead of being sent to market.  As the saying of the time wentYou could buy a pound of hamburger for a nickel but nobody had any nickels.This resulted in it costing more to ship produce to market than it was worth when it arrived.  So many more farms but not enough went bust while many people in the cities starved.FDR created the most hated government agency ever the Federal Surplus Relief Corporation who with armed men went from farm to farm destroying crops and farm animals and telling the farmers that they were forbidden from farming and to go to the cities.  One of their first acts was to slaughter  pigs in the very decentralized pork industry.  They also confiscated crops to send them to city soup kitchens.Hard times indeed.  It was common for physicians to take trade goods like chickens or eggs instead of money.  People who had a little money often hired the poor as home servants in exchange for a little money and what were called totes such as leftover food scraps of material needles and thread often not given to them but allowed to be taken without complaint or notice.A big change happened with the publication of The Joy of Cooking starting in .  It contained all sorts of frugal recipes and less popular but inexpensive ingredients like organ meats allowing people to save a lot of money.  It also meshed well with wartime rationing.Depression era programs like the Tennessee Valley Authority also resulted in unexpected benefits.  For example the TVA produced abundant electricity but nobody had appliances to use it so appliances  like lamps toasters and vacuums were given away or sold at much less cost.  Some of these are still treasured as relics of the past.,lifehacks,degs53v,5,t5_2qj5n

11209546,0,t3_5zxm4j,Heres how I lived off of  USDwk  Found the discount grocery store this place sells Annies snack foods for about  bucks or less their produce isnt quality but it gets the trick done. Have a pantry staple of Salt Pepper Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar.  For the week buy  One pack of greens   cucumbers  One pack of carrots  One pack of onions  One loaf of bread  Two jars of peanut butter  Create a salad for yourself dress it with saltpepperoil and the secret is to use a lot of vinegar. Store the salad in the fridge. Take bites from the salad throughout the day If youre doing the keating diet which I recommend for people with lower incomes then take a few bites every hour during your allotted meal time. Drink LOTS of water and if you get the hunger pains then have a peanut butter sandwich to satisfy yourself.  If you dont like peanut butter then you can curb the hunger although slightly more expensive with a block of cheese and cheap tortillas.,lifehacks,df2l84k,4,t5_2qj5n
11228275,0,t1_df4pi0g,I dont use ratios but it doesnt take much. For a small pot to medium a TBSP will do the trick sometimes a tad more. I never measure just pour so that a small surface bubble of oil floats there. ,lifehacks,df4pkrl,3,t5_2qj5n
