152578,0,t1_cevgnd7,Hazlitts character studies is a great shout. Its a real shame that Bradley was so viciously attacked for talking about characters as people with real emotional complexity and lives outside the plays. My supervisor at university who was tutored by Ricks so stands in a direct lineage all the way from I.A. Richards to the present day always defended Bradley if you stop thinking about them as people you miss opportunity to really engage imaginatively with the text.Ill try the Booth.

167329,0,t1_cetfbxt,I also wouldnt classify Hamlet and Falstaff as deeply evil. I dont think the MacBeths are deeply evil either. Granted that is far more arguable. But I think the fact that Lady MacBeths guilt drives her to insanity and suicide? show a conscience and a soul that is not pure evil. She does a horrible thing and it destroys her. And MacBeths initial reluctance and pure lack of joy in his ruling after the fact show a similar soul. None of these people are good. And some are worse than others. The MacBeths are surely worse than the other two right? But I think they are pretty complex. And all are redeemable up to a point. I would say Falstaff is redeemable until the very end and never falls over the cliff. On the other hand Iago is in my opinion the epitome of pure evil in Shakespeare. But I dont know if there is much aim for us to sympathize with him.  And then Richard III and Edmund tying for second. Both of these men have brief moments of reflection and guilt I dont think Iago is capable of but they are surely evil to the core.  I think it is pretty much as black and white as you can get there. ,shakespeare,cexhq6b,1,t5_2rouy

3953448,0,t3_35qn38,Orson Welles Falstaff in Chimes at Midnight looks and talks like the real thing a glimpse into a lost history despite Orsons intense familiarity as an actor. Toshiro Mifunes Macbeth in Throne of Blood is amazing and Shinnosuke Ikehatas fool in Ran King Lear is so perfect subtly undercutting the very premise of Lears authority and place in the world. Im a fan of Romeo  Juliet in general and I think it has many excellent performances. But John Leguizamos Tybalt and Paul Rudds Paris seem nearperfect to me. Leguizamo is so vivid an archetype the idea of Tybalt even more than the character itself. And come on Paul Rudd dressed as an astronaut at the ball? Thats beyond brilliant casting and costuming. Anthony Hopkins Titus again feel viscerally real. He has the grit of a Rome long eroded and ground down by time and myth and in a sense its almost a shame the role wasnt his last. It strongly helped cement Titus Andronicus as one of Shakespeares great plays for at least the next  years if not permanently rehabilitating its reputation. Its hard to believe that relatively recently it was fashionable to think this classic of Shakespeares early imagination was written by someone else.Ian McKellens Richard III is indeed great but Im partial to Olivers as well. Theres just something wrong with the way he looks at the character. I enjoy McKellens evil while Olivers makes me uncomfortable. Though the choice of smashing from the speech to the urinal for now is the winter of our discontent is epic. Oddly enough my favorite film Hamlet is probably Mel Gibson. The guy is truly mad and I think his wideeyedinsanity fits well. But my favorite Hamlet recording is Johnston ForbesRobertson. And on and on. There are many many great Shakespeare performances in film. In his book the Shakespeare Wars Ron Rosenbaum makes the point that any lover of the Bard has access to more great performances on tape than anyone could hope to see on the stage in one lifetime. While the medium robs Shakespeare of some of its immediacy I think Rosenbaum is right. ,shakespeare,cr6xdcf,5,t5_2rouy
3993421,0,t1_cra65uv,First of all congrats on directing Shrew! I dont even like this play and its still been an absolute blast to work on. Its extremely energetic and that energy is infectious. gt They trust each other and in Shakespeare where people fall in love in a matter of minutes trust is better. If you described Petruchios behavior to someone in the BDSM community as if they were a real person I bet youd be told he was clearly an abusive manipulator who represents a real problem. Consent is key in BDSM. Petruchio bullies Kate and lies to her father to make her legally his property before nonconsentually depriving her of food and sleep and constantly gaslighting her. None if this is done at her behest none with her consent. The fact that he manipulates his way into marrying her instead of earning it is absolutely crucial. Kate protests extensively but Baptista clearly isnt a listener and buys into Petruchios absurdly thin cover story. And the only moment where Petruchio displays trust in Kate is the final bet. Assuming he cares about  pounds which isnt necessarily the case considering hes flush with dowry gold. So he trusts her after she finally gives in to his abuse and agrees hes always right even when hes lying and wrong. gt Nothing he owns is by his own merit. His money is his fathers his servants were his fathers.If he is to be believed Petruchio says he has bettered rather than decreased his fathers fortune. gt The only thing he gets without invoking his father is Kate and the only reason he gets her is because no one else wants her. He invokes his father many times in acquiring Kate. Specially to Baptista. Specifically before negotiating her dowry. You knew my father well and in him me. In fact Baptista has basically nothing else to go on but Antionos fame and the fact that Petruchio insists on being interested in the curst Kate. Its cool you took some classes but the answer isnt in some external tradition but in the play itself. Its far more interesting to ask whats happening in the play than it is to obsess over the falconry metaphor or project a modern consensual BDSM relationship when nothing even remotely like that exists in the text. And in the text the only trust either of them ever show is Petruchios trust that his every word will be obeyed. But then again in his very first lines that same trust in his servants loyalty is betrayed. So I think the play fundamentally questions Petruchios authority which he so desperately insists upon. So its very easy for me to see Petruchio expecting Kate to obey because he expects everyone to obey him. He doesnt need to trust her because in his mind he always should be obeyed. Thats his explicit characterization from his ordering around of Tranio on their first meeting to his marvellously froward meeting with Baptista to his scene with his servants to every scene with Kate or Grumio. So where specifically do you see this mutual trust in the text? Im curious. And I should reiterate that Im not deluded into thinking I have an exclusive reading on this text just because Im working on the character now. Im just arguing for my own position and am genuinely interested in your differing take. I just want to hear about it in terms of the text itself. ,shakespeare,crbhexq,1,t5_2rouy

7181267,0,t3_4du61x,gtFor the duration of King Lear many characters put on facades and pretend to be someone they are not. These facades are very important to the plot development but also play a very symbolic role. As a whole however the drama disposes of this early hypothesis appearances come eventually to be understood and properly valued Heilman . This leads to appearances being discarded the truth coming to light and exposing the sin for what it is. You are saying that the characters false identities are integral to understanding their true sinful natures. Interesting observation.gtThe first facade is Caius who is played by Kent. Caius ironically replaces Kent as the Lears gotoman and is able to give him advice which eventually helps lead to Lears revelation and redemption. On the flip side of the coin Avoid cliches.gtGoneril and Regan put on a facade in the beginning of the play and seem to be overly devoted to their king and father but in reality it is only an act in order to gain his blessings and bounty. Their true nature is revealed later on showing that they are both incredibly selfish prideful and lustful. Edmund too seems to be hardworking loyal and kind in appearances but it is quickly revealed that he too is very selfish and just desires wealth and power. These facades provide us unique insight into each of the characters allowing us to see their cunning and dedication to greed and sinfulness as well as their morality and persistence to bring Lear on the path back to wisdom particularly in the case of Kent Throughout the play there is a systematic commentary upon appearances that are misread upon the difficulties of perceiving the world truly upon the failure which may itself be a spiritual affirmation to put up a good appearance upon that is naivete defenselessness innocence Heilman .I am struggling to connect this passage to your argument as a whole. Assuming a false identity itself a sin is revealing of the characters true nature based on the contrasts those identities reveal. For Regan and Goneril their wholesome loving facade hides their lustful selfish true selves. For Kent his false identity as a stranger is what gives him the kind of access Lear would ordinarily only give a trusted advisor. Keen observation but this paper is about how sins are committed punished then redeemed.gtLike sinfulness punishment also plays an important role in King Lear showing a key step in the path to redemption. In each of the characters punishment they have a moment of realization which leads to their eventual redemption. For Lear the first glimpse is in Act  Scene  when he reflects on his actions toward Cordelia realizing he did her wrong ... He then begins to see his sinfulness further during the storm where he realizes his mortality and naivete You owe me no subscription then let fall. Your horrible pleasure here I stand your slave A poor infirm weak and despised old man ... His own realization doesnt seem like a fully realized punishment. Isnt he most punished for his bad decision by Regan and Goneril who disrespect him and throw him out in the cold?gtAfter meeting back with Cordelia his biggest moment of redemption comes and he confesses how wrong he was and how cruelly he treated Cordelia. He realizes that Cordelia truly does love him and he realizes the truth of how foolish he was You must bear with me.  Pray you now forget and forgive. I am old and  foolish ... It is in this moment that he recognizes and acknowledges his own foolishness and then redemption can finally come full circle and bring about a level of humbleness that Lears pride had blocked from coming to the surface.gtThis redemption is important for to understand human nature how to seek redemption and to avoid future sinfulness. The first step is to try and avoid sinfulness Lears sinfulness was in his pride and ignorance.Ignorance still not a sin.gtSimilarly to avoid that sinfulness the cause must be prevented. Provided everyone messes up the next step is to figure out how and to go through whatever consequences may come and see that less as a punishment and more as a step towards redemption. It might be helpful to draw a distinction here between mistakes those missteps that come as a result of ignorance and sin those missteps we take willingly and with knowledge of their taboo status. gtThen redemption can be received in full when the path has come full circle in acknowledgement repentance and work towards repairing the damage that has been caused. In King Lear Lear and Gloucester are rescued through the suffering they have experienced. Lears suffering is not without compensation. He learned the truth and discovered himself through his suffering. And through his suffering he has understood what humans suffering and need are all about Liu .gtThe importance of the all of these characteristics can be easy to miss but understanding the sinfulness punishment redemption and their nature is paramount to understanding Lears journey. Lears sin is his foolishnessYou just said it was his pride and ignorance. Nevertheless foolishness also still not a sin.gtthat comes as a result of his pride and ignorance. Though he has lived as a king for a long time he has remained ignorant and foolish. After the division of his lands and property he expects to live a comfortable life with little responsibility. However it is when he has everything taken from him that he learns the truth that while he was in his position as king he was missing the one thing that mattered the most his wisdom. It was only when he was left with nothing that he realized his error and he became drawn back to what was important. After the suffering one may realize the truth thoroughly Lear finally realizes his misdeeds and obtains a deeper understanding of life Liu . It is this understanding that leads Lear to repentance before his daughter Cordelia and that same understanding that pushes him to his hope that she might be alive even as he holds her dead body.gtThroughout the tragedy of King Lear Lear goes through a process of sinfulness similar to that of Christian beliefWhats your reference point for what Christians believe? It seems like you made up that whole side of this paper.gtfrom his sinful actions the consequences for those actions and finally redemption from those actions. While some of the themes may draw upon Christian elements King Lear is a unique play that also portrays the humanist ideals of that time period. Shakespeares play provides an exceptional perspective on morality seen through the lens of Christianity and Elizabethan humanism.I get the sense the prompt for this paper was something like write about sinfulness punishment and redemption in King Lear so you decided to cherrypick some moments from the play in which characters do bad things and also some moments where they do good things and compare and contrast. That however is not an argument and doesnt satisfy the argument youve promised to deliver. If youre going to talk about sin you need to define that as a concept and a term. Right now youre just making it up in a way that is convenient to the passages youve got highlighted. You cant just say ignorance and foolishness are sins without providing a reference in Christian Theology one contemporary to Shakespeare would be preferred that identifies those characteristics as sinful. In fact Christianity is pretty big on the notion that ignorance and the actions of a person who is ignorant of their sinful nature are NOT sins because to sin is to willingly transgress against the laws of God. So as commonly understood sin is the seven deadly ones pride wrath sloth greed envy lust gluttony and willful disobedience to the ten commandments. Thats our modern interpretation of sin. As the Elizabethans understood it a king treating his daughter the way Lear does is probably not sinful in fact SHE is the sinner for running afoul of honor thy father and thy mother. Im not going to pitch you a different paper as part of these notes but there is an interesting gap when it comes to the sinful actions you describe which are actually just shitty things people do but are not sins as recognized by Christianity and sins as defined by Christianity. In a number of cases you point out the sinner is not the person who is call it what you want sinning acting immorally really it boils down to being a dick. Cordelia dishonors her father. Kent bears false witness. And so on. You might have identified this as a trend and had something interesting to say about it but instead you redefined terms in a way that suits the language you were instructed to use without offering any source or history for that decision.If you turned this in to one of my classes I would give it a low C.,shakespeare,d1ug3dj,1,t5_2rouy

8077377,0,t3_4ptin4,Theres at least some indication that Shakespeares clowns were prone to ad libbing  particularly Will Kempe who played those parts in the first half of Shakespeares career. Supposedly the Hamlet line And let those that play your clowns speak no more than is set down for them is a dig at that tendency coming not long after Kempe left the company. Armin who would likely have played the Porter wasnt as known for adlibbing as Kempe was but I wouldnt be surprised if he had a bit of leeway.,shakespeare,d4nz0yj,3,t5_2rouy
8337585,0,t3_4tqgfi,A Funeral Elegy for Master William Peter. I know its disputed but it reads convincingly as Shakespeare to me and its certainly in contention for least known.

8435093,0,t1_d5vwbn5,Of course he was writing about the royal succession  it was the primary political issue of the late Elizabethan period since the Queen had no obvious heir but he was very careful to avoid even the hint of sedition.So he wasnt implicated in Essex plot or any plot at all and that itself is telling evidence that no one saw him as party to it and he avoided any of the controversies that his friends Ben Jonson and Kit Marlowe found themselves in  because this was a society that was willing to imprison or even kill playwrights.So no I see no evidence that he was involved in political intrigue  and this is why I doubt that The Tempest is strongly autobiographical in the allegorical sense.,shakespeare,d5vxcd7,3,t5_2rouy
8772058,0,t1_d7132ky,Glad you got to see it! Im with you on the language felt the updates were unnecessary and ultimately pulled me out a bit. I actually got to participate in a QampA with a couple of the actors and was able to ask them about it. Happy to pass along their responses which were really interesting. The ugly bitch line came out of Emma Rice wanting to replace the racist epithet ethiope but find something that would be equally vitriolic and shocking. Changing the vocations of the mechanicals was part of her love note to the Globe this is her first production there as the new Artistic Director and their dedicated volunteer staff.

8935005,0,t1_d7ls841,Well if youre reading Hamlet theres a ton of interesting material on the differences between Protestant and Catholic theology. For example purgatory is an exclusively Catholic idea so no Protestant would see a ghost as a persons spirit instead theyd likely see it as a devil in disguise. This also extends to Hamlets ruminations on the afterlife. Greenblatts Hamlet in Purgatory and Prossers Hamlet and Revenge go into lots of detail on the CatholicProtestant split.,shakespeare,d7lut3c,3,t5_2rouy

9977935,0,t1_db84enw,Its in the sidebar that This community is not meant for homework help.Its not patronizing to ask students to do their own work. If the kid had asked for help with analysis or asked for opinions about examples of his own it would be a totally different conversation. But just asking a community to come up with ideas for you because youre too lazy to read a few plays is just asking someone else to do the work for you.Nothing would make me happier than for this kid to get interested in Shakespeare and start participating in conversations on the sub. But hes not. We get three or four of these posts a month where a student posts asking us to do their homework and then never posts here again not even to thank the saps like you who get them their B in the class.The kids who post here looking for help are by and large rich lazy suburbanites not struggling underprivileged youth.Also you cant insult me especially knowing absolutely nothing about my Shakespeare work and then criticize me for not being polite.,shakespeare,db85ijj,2,t5_2rouy

Ive done it with high schoolers before and it went over great. Ive got a cut thats about  minutes that Id be happy to share if youre interested. You could also look at Comedy of Errors.
