8881169,0,t3_51pwrw,Well I usually play support only in duo with my friend on ADC but we are now getting used to play passively and safe for the first one or two levels. Basically I start engaging at lvl instead of . I know that lvl is a big powerspike but I found that I like having also my W for a little extra tankiness and dmg when I go in and furthermore not seeing an engage at lvl gives to the enemy the impression that were afraid and struggling so that they are more prone to make a mistake by feeling more confident.Youd be surprised how many times this strategy works D,LeonaMains,d7fe3fm,2,t5_38ana

11760606,0,t1_dgt2seh,Im a bronze scrub but I feel like the shield from gold item can be very helpful for your adc.  The cdr is great too since I have a hard time getting as much as I want.  To each their own I guess but I agree with you on fully building good item.,LeonaMains,dgt3enm,1,t5_38ana
