If I had been a more careful reader I would have realized that Bill did indeed explain why income is identical to output and output is identical to expenditure which by the transitive law implies that income is identical to expenditure. However Bill himself actually concedes that the identity between output and expenditure is arrived at only by imputing the value of unsold inventory to the profit of the firm. But this profit is generated not by an actual expenditure of money it is generated by an accounting convention  a perfectly legitimate accounting convention but a convention nonetheless. So I continue to maintain that income defined as the flow of payments to factors of production per unit time is not identical to either expenditure or to output. Bill also notes that as Nick Rowe has argued in a pure service economy in which there were no capital goods or inventories output would identically equal expenditure. I agree but only if no services were provided on credit. There would then be a lag between output and the expenditure corresponding to the output. It is precisely the existence of lags between output expenditure and income that allows for the possibility of noninstantaneous adjustments to changes thereby creating disequilibrium transitions between one equilibrium and another.,stockflow,csgz3u7,1,t5_32vdv
