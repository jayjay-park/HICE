1689752,0,t1_cjs5lb9,Honestly once I get through the contestants I find really actively offensive still a couple left if there are still dull people from Cook Islands left Im probably going to do multiple writeups that consist entirely of Cook Islands was a horrible season almost completely devoid of entertainment and contestant name did nothing to remedy this. Same for Caramoan. Maybe Ill give them one or two bullet points listing whatever else I remember but thats it.,SurvivorRankdown,cjs5ny3,1,t5_32s4p
1696597,0,t1_cjt0k1y,I yawn loudly. So what are your take on Marcuss actions between the time he was put on Kota . and the time he was voted out then?Because the way I see it Kota had a  majority on both tribes and he could very very easily have saved himself but made a series of horrible decisions that led to his demise.,SurvivorRankdown,cjt0pg5,1,t5_32s4p
1704108,0,t1_cjtyhxe,I do love when she freaks out and attacks the tree. Thats classic. If only James had been there to tell her No karate chopping.,SurvivorRankdown,cjtyqq2,6,t5_32s4p
1718419,0,t1_cjv57wz,He absolutely was hard on Semhar. Even if she fucked up the challenge that doesnt mean you berate her and act like a dick when shes trying to apologize and it has nothing to do with his misogynistic personal attacks on her later where he acts like the only worth she could possibly have is sex appeal.,SurvivorRankdown,cjvrpro,1,t5_32s4p

1809745,0,t1_ck78vlg,I think she made it unwatchable. Shes the one who pushed a lot of the bad people forward while also having her own awkward scenes with Eddie and Brandon. And she directly kept Malcolm from finding a new idol ending his game and likely her own in one swoop. ,SurvivorRankdown,ck78yl7,1,t5_32s4p

1868346,0,t1_cke71ui,Thats insane and  unlikely. The goal of the producers is to make good compelling satisfying television not to further some imaginary agenda to make women look lesser than on Survivor. Kim is charismatic likable and great at survivor but not great at giving soundbites and she just isnt a big character. Ive listened to a bunch of itnerviews with her and this corroborates whats show in the show. Everyone has their strengths and weaknesses if they had better confessionals to show they wouldve used them.,SurvivorRankdown,ckebv4l,2,t5_32s4p

I might not even catch it at all until tomorrow so can people not bring SJDS convo into here until then?

2048922,0,t1_cl07th7,TYRONE WAS GREAT. I LIKE HOW CALM AND COLLECTED HE WAS AND HOW SNARKY HE WAS. HE HAD A GOOD HEAD ON HIS SHOULDERS AND I ENJOYED WATCHING HIM AND THOUGHT HIS ELIMINATION WAS BULLSHIT.

2072272,0,t1_cl37rum,I think Id have him a bit higher definitely so relative to the others still in this but this is a fair placement. Honestly Im quite surprised he made it as far as he did.,SurvivorRankdown,cl38c6h,1,t5_32s4p

2204059,0,t1_cljzkon,You didnt use them on Crystal so theyre wasted no matter what.I wont be cutting her just yet though. Giving her the benefit of the doubt that I dont really remember her season well.See my other comment where I asked for reasons why people love her so much. I am more than open. I want to like her more than I do.,SurvivorRankdown,cljzn05,2,t5_32s4p

2227321,0,t3_2kkvmv,Imma be straight up and say that however we do it I would kind of like to be the one who handles votes. Id just make a Surveymonkey poll and do it myself before posting the link or something. I was the first one involved with DB in planning this before it started and figuring out who else should do it and Ive been the most active in posting the rounds and the sheets to record whats been going on the whole time and whatnot. If people would be okay with that its something I would really really like to do and I do feel like I have been more active than the other rankers in doing other stuff throughout this whole thing including going back to before it started when DB and I were first deciding how exactly we should even format this. He and I were kind of the architects of this and then Nobull joined in and then everyone else. And then DB died dude. So idk just since Ive been with this longer than anyone else here and was involved in forming it I dont think its a fully unreasonable request and Id really like to be responsible for it unless other people majorly object for some particular reason. seems like a good number to me compared to  or . I still dont know that I fully dig or see the necessity of multiple writeups but whatever works.,SurvivorRankdown,clmy2au,-1,t5_32s4p
2296064,0,t1_clvdpzj,Shes claimed both wanting to take Woo and Tony. I dont really trust Kass  when she talks about Cagayan.,SurvivorRankdown,clvicpp,2,t5_32s4p
2298521,0,t1_clvbx30,gt Whether it is that they just love Cirie or hate Terry or have issue with his comment about her slapping her kids I have never seen someone rationally explain how Terry was wrong to call her out.Your disqualifiers make no sense given that much of the perfectly rational distaste over Terrys callingout centers on his comment about Cirie slapping her kids. Was she in the wrong to drop her torch? Perhaps but that barely matters in the face of such a gross retort on Terrys part regardless of whether hes upset. But Im not surprised that you think that whether a person is justified in calling someone out is unrelated to how that a person approaches that callingout.Also if Cirie was intentionally trying to hobble Terry thats just pluspoints for her the same way youre using this cut to draw out an obvious idol.,SurvivorRankdown,clvta7n,3,t5_32s4p

2764184,0,t1_cni9uc6,I honestly cant even think of what would top my list. I guess itd be this one by default because Russell went home? But it was still so devoid of substance.I definitely feel confident that even if You Own My Vote tops your list Keep Hope Alive wont bottom it. So thats.. something to look forward to... maybe..? The fact that it gets even worse?,SurvivorRankdown,cni9z61,1,t5_32s4p
4430856,0,t1_csp6tkn,Yeah pretty much everything you said I agree with.i would argue that Hunchback is the darkest disney film but I remember Pinocchio being pretty scary as well. I also remember thinking Pinocchios a bit too episodic for my tastes rather than having a flowing storyline. But well see after I resee it today or tommorow.Fantasia is something Im worried about because I dont know how to go about reviewing it. I think its brilliant but its not a narrative and it doesnt really gel with anything else Disney has madesame with Emperors new groove actually only in opposite directions. Emperors is more of a looney tunes kinda thing than Disney and Fantasia is way more highbrow than what the company has generally done. the writeup will be kinda hard.Best song is a good idea! Not a huge fan of the Snow white songs they all sound kinda the same but the winner is pretty obvious. Some day my prince will come indeed.,SurvivorRankdown,csp75pt,2,t5_32s4p
8259059,0,t3_4sft4p,I dont agree with all of this but I LOVED your Ozzy and Cirie writeups. Definitely completely nailed what I like about those characters. Also your point about Jason being a ripoff second rate Ozzy whose blindside was a ripoff second rate version of Ozzys blindside is so perfect I dont know how I never saw it before. ,SurvivorRankdown,d59xu7c,2,t5_32s4p
