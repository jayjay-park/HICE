I sometimes add another flavor of tea but with the mixedherb abv its not always necessary. Then I drop the teabag into boiling water and let it steep for several minutes. And thats about it. Its not the sexiest method but its super quick and it works for sure,HerbalTherapy,da3yyp3,2,t5_3gcs5

I know that the convection ones are the expensive kind but they are also the best. Was the one you have for  the convection type? And to answer your question regarding herbs other than weed you can use green time or camomile depending on the effect you want one awakes you and one calms you. You can mix it with your green flower or smoke on its own its pretty nice. I prefer to mix  ,HerbalTherapy,dcgslsw,1,t5_3gcs5
