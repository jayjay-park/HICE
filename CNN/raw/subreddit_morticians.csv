Every state has a different setup regarding licensing in some places you have to at least be trained in the ways of funeral directing in order to also get your license to embalm. That said even in states where you can get your embalmer licensed spearately its not common to do that alone. For all the effort of apprenticeship and mortuary school you may as well get your FD license if required by law at the same time. Not only does it give you an understanding and appreciation of the other side of things but it makes you more valuable to employers. I know most of the embalmers with our firm have an assortment of tattoos and piercings in various places. Theyre asked to cover visible tattoos and to remove facial piercings or replace them with a clearnude color when in front of a family. They do have to interact with the public when doing removals and transferring decedents to the funeral home. As long as youre professional about it you shouldnt encounter too much resistance. ,morticians,d9iyy6f,2,t5_2wc7t
