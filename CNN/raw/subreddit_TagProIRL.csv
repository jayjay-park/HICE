3762268,0,t3_33hp3i,Typing this with one hand while holding a baby. Forgive the brevity or spelling errors. Read the last two paragraphs first then come back here. Take a deep breath through your nose. Hold it for a second. Blow it out your mouth.  Realize that you may not be cut out for the same old go to college then get a job then get married then have kids then die A  thats quite an oversimplification B  thats not the only choice you haveThere are plenty of jobs out there for introverts because well there are a lot of introverts. National Parks have openings for people who go out and manage trails for days at a time. Some people pretty much live out near a watchtower and call in the weather measurements and keep an eye out for fires and respond to emergencies when and if they happen. Sometimes they only speak once a day. The point is it doesnt matter what you want there is something out there for you. If you dont want to do anything though well there may not be something for you unless you want to save up buy a boat and live as a drifter and catch your food in international waters because everybody has to help out if they want to take advantage of stuff like infrastructure or protection of government lands or else society collapses. Allow me to be blunt for a moment? Thinking that suicide is a viable option at  IS ignorant. Thinking that there isnt anything for you is just being pessimistic refusing to acknowledge reality or ignorance. Pick one theyre all things people can work at if they are hindered by it.What can you do? Seek some different help like many people have said. Youve likely got a chemical balance that doesnt work for you. Dont say that to play the victim but to acknowledge that its not something you have done wrong. As for the meaning of life nobody can tell you that. For me I like helping out the few people around me. I used to want to do macro stuff help a lot of people at once but that burns me out too quickly. Being a parent was a way to help a few people in a BIG way and a lot of people in smaller ways. You may not want anything to do with people but want to find some sort of inner fulfillment. You may want to just live in balance with the world around you. Whatever it is there isnt a wrong answer because if its not working out you can always try something else as long as you dont subscribe to the Im stuck and theres no way to get away from this philosophy. Killing yourself is a wrong answer. Theres no going back and once you follow through with it theres no way to just try something else. Yeah itll likely mess with the world around you in a big way and for quite a while. I still feel a little sick when I think of a friend who killed herself over  years ago. Time doesnt really change that. I can assure you its worse for those who were closer to her like her sister and her parents.Do you mean nothing? I dont know about on a cosmic scale but on a personal scale no we dont mean nothing.Okay last thing. Ive changed two poopie diapers since I started writing this. how the hell you adults got so far and how the hell you manage to deal with life every day Day in day out mostly the same old stuff. Is it boring some times? Sure. Is it frustrating having to do the same thing over and over with minuscule changes and very little reward for the effort? Sure. The key for me is not working to see progress. If I did that Id give up teaching my kids a lot of things because the progress is slow. Ask my wife and shed tell you the same thing on the order of magnitudes as she works with kids who have learning disabilities. Its even slower progress and sometimes there are things that some people just are incapable of doing and you just gotta give up on that and move on to something they can learn. The point of this paragraph is that I just live by this if someone has come away from an interaction with me better than if they hadnt come in contact with me then I call it a success. If at the end of the day Ive helped someone in some way minuscule or massive Im happy with that. If I look at my hands at the end of the day and think I havent done anything worthwhile I look at them again in the morning and think how I can do better. Little stuff. Lifes gonna stink sometimes. The future is uncertain and sure thats scary but you know what? Its more scary to me that there are people out there who havent even started yet and theyre already thinking about checking out without having seen or experienced a tiny fraction of what the average person does which to be clear is itself a tiny fraction of what there is to experience. TLDR I dont know read it when youre sitting on your bed staring into space for hours. Take what you can from it and pitch the rest. At the very least though? Share this with professionals and if you arent happy with the care youre receiving ask for a referral to someone else and make sure you dont say it in a way that they take it personally.Chin up buckaroo. Im not even gonna proofread this. YOLO. Now laugh at the guy saying YOLO and if any of this makes you feel like crap ignore it and take the stuff that helps.,TagProIRL,cql4kjj,26,t5_32g08

6471408,0,t3_44a2nq,Ive more or less been in your shoes before and I can say that the game becomes infinitely easier to stop playing once youve spent a significant amount of time away from it like a week or two. People stick to the game for a variety of reasons community gameplay commitment etc. and the easiest although maybe not the best thing to do to stop yourself from playing it so much is to find something else to occupy your time especially if it can take over the same niche that tagpro gave you. The hardest thing about not doing anything mildly addictive is getting out of the habit of doing it but once youve gotten past that initial hump the rest of it becomes way easier although like anything mildly addictive that want to do it is still going to be there just easier to ignore.Theres a ton of other stuff I can say about ways to more easily manage your want to play the game but I dont know anything about why you liked playing the gamewhat makes you stick around the community so I feel like saying a solution that worked for me isnt necessarily going to work for you.,TagProIRL,czootmc,10,t5_32g08

8731852,0,t1_d6wty0l,Ive got mixed feelings here. The first thing I thought when reading your post is that quitting a league over whole number scoring seems petty. Like if my dad wanted to play fantasy football with me Id play even if it was like a QB league. You know its a couple decimal points.That doesnt justify the things he said to you though. He ought to be a source of comfort. The thing is I guess he is what he is and you have to accept that and work around it. If hes not going to give you advice and teach you things youre going to have to educate yourself which is totally possible with the right mindset plus you have us as resources!Im curious to hear more about your relationship with your Mom and whether she might be inclined to help you a little more or at least listen.You should try to get a few bucks together and go down and open a checking account at the bank whenever you can. I know its hard when you cant drive but with some determination you can make it work. Generally it takes a  initial deposit. Also look into online banking.What kind of jobs are you applying to? Hopefully youre not letting pride get in the way here. Do fast food if you have to. You need to get some positive cashflow going.The driving thing is tough but important. There are other ways to get around but I cant deny having a car is useful. Id try to work with your mom on this one or find a bike to ride or something. Anything to get you a little independence and give you a feeling of control over your own life. When I worked at Best Buy years ago this kid named Jose was so determined that he walked  minutes to get to work and do his shifts.I guess the final thing I want to say is that if you really want these things you need to make them happen on your own. Nothing youve described is insurmountable. You can do it. Were here to help.,TagProIRL,d6x4lnl,2,t5_32g08
