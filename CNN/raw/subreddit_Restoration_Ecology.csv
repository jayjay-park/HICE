3380510,0,t3_2wvzpz,Heres my experience but Ive been doing natural resource work for  years and things have changed a bit.  I have a BS degree only.  I started my field work and slowly worked my way up through one agency.  I am now at a sufficiently high level to say I am very successful.I mostly stuck with one agency so that may have helped to get to know people as I worked my way up.  I also think the world has changed a lot as we saw the huge collapse in the economy and wholesale losses of jobs that used to be secure.I think there is so much room out there to do your own thing that you should really think about that.  You can start your own business and should think about that.  You dont need an MS to do that.  Find a pain out there that people have and solve their problem.  You can now start a business for  through a website as you get your message out.What is your message?  What are you passionate about?  I am now trying to do this myself as I try and connect new natural resource professionals to a community so they can build tools to do great restoration work.  Maybe you are in my target market?Long story short  I think you can do it without a MS but you are going to have to work your butt off.  Find the passion and you will enjoy working your butt off.  I know I do.dave,Restoration_Ecology,cpdlq0q,2,t5_2tlun
