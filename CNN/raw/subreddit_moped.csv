1061890,0,t3_269j1p,if you are going to own one of these its worthwhile to learn a bit about  stroke engines as they are simple and fascinating machines. the long hose with a clamp is for fuel to gravity flow to the petcock. the petcock is a valve which controls the flow of fuel from the gas tank to the carburetor. in your picture the petcock is right next to your pointing finger knuckle if that makes sense. from the petcock the fuel flows into the carburetor fuel bowl the cylindrical horizontally mounted bowl on the bottom of the carburetor. the fuel bowl acts a reserve of fuel for the carb to supply to the piston in the case of rapid acceleration. the fuel bowl contains a float and seal to moderate the amount of fuel siphoned into the bowl in the case this float or seal is malfunctioning the carb needs an overflow in your picture the diagonally cut shorter hose that is attached to the fuel bowl with the brass clip maybe it is hard to tell in your picture as there seems to be a tube coming from the other side of the fuel bowl. typically i have seen overflows come from the bowl and not the top of the carb. regardless it is mounted to the fuel bowl and cut diagonally to prevent anything from plugging itor attaching aka dont mess with it. the throttle cable that mounts to the top of your carburetor controls valves inside the carb that moderate the flow of air mixing with fuel before going to the piston for combustion. awesome stuff good luck with the moped be safe!!,moped,chozpcl,2,t5_2rd89

1542007,0,t3_2bwbk6,Obviously dont give up! If it was just running its probably something simple.First thing you need to do any time your moped doesnt run is narrow down the problem. Its almost certainly either a fuel issue or an electrical issue. Easiest thing to do is squirt a bit of fuel directly into the cylinder through the spark plug hole then try firing it up. If it momentarily runs its a fuel issue. If it doesnt run check for spark.If its a fuel issue your carb is probably still dirty.,moped,cj9kc2f,3,t5_2rd89

I live in Seattle and I can go weeks without seeing a moped and when I stop people ask me what Im riding like theyve never seen such a thing. then theres this stupid movement where people think you should be huffing it on a bicycle  miles to get around town like its no big deal to be covers in sweat everywhere you go bikes have limited use like  mi or less and they are slow.

5078600,0,t3_3khovh,Im probably not gonna influence your opinion much but batavus are literally the worst. Difficult to work on even harder to keep running. For these reasons there is almost a complete lack of aftermarket. There is basically zero overlap with other moped types unless you are lucky enough to find the rarer models equipped with Peugeot and Sachs engines. That is relatively cheap for a moped but I know many people who wouldnt take a batavus for free. As a beginner I would very strongly encourage you to look for something else. Its a bummer that Vermont seems to have a pretty limited moped scene but you could likely find a nonrunning puch or mineralli v bike for that cheap without driving too far into New Hampshire or Massachusetts.

Looks crazy lean on both fuel and oil but looks like you didnt chop long enough to get a good reading. You want to run WOT for no less than  minutes just rip up and down the street and there needs to be load on the motor you cant just run it on the center stand. ,moped,d3go9jc,1,t5_2rd89

Im running a mm bing currently with a  jet on the top notch of the needle and its just not hitting high revs.If I move the clip even one notch down on the needle i cannot make the bike idle any sense as soon as I come to a junction or a stand still it just peters out and dies!,moped,dars19e,1,t5_2rd89
9874124,0,t3_5gp7e2,You might need to readjust the metall brackets on the side of the float. After you seperated the carburator leave the bottom tub open and blow some air into the the petcock entrance where your fuel hose is located. Controll the angle of the float readjust and check again to see if its closed when the float is in level depends on the angle the carb is attatched to your engine. Put the carb back together and mount it. Check again for function. If you are not able to fix it that way you might need a new float. Just search for bing    on ebay and just get a whole rebuild kit while you are at it pic of float in googleEdit maybe the floats for all those bing   xxx are identical so you might want to check that,moped,daumeak,3,t5_2rd89

9964678,0,t3_5i9az3,yo! im also a student and had the exact same requirements as you. definitely do not recommend any vintage models like pre or . That pretty much excludes most of the models you see on this page except the Tomos line which has models leading up to . Of the Tomos line theres the sttarga targa lx streetmate sprint all of which have different specifications and looks. depending on what you wantneed more specifically performance parts etc ideally youll favor one over the other. please also do your own research into the kind of ride youll be expecting to make around campus. for instance the area around my campus is hilly so i wont be able to use smaller front sprockets when considering performance parts thus limiting topend speed.as with all mopeds youre gonna need to tinker a bunch regardless of whether or not you have a recent model. i got a  tomos st but spent a number of days tinkering around it making sure i got familiar with the parts and getting the tools i need. the only exception to this are those highlymaintained puchbatavus mopeds with hefty  price tags you see while cruising CL.general word of advice unless you can score a good price sub  for a vintage moped from a moped enthusiast stick with newer models. also im located nearabouts the bay area so ive already got a pretty hefty coast tax on my purchase so my numbers may be inflated. otherwise do LOTS of research! more knowledge will never hurt ,moped,db6f9d5,2,t5_2rd89
10020527,0,t3_5j4ufq,I think starting it up every day just to start it and idle rather than USE it is worst than just leaving it alone. Frequently running a wide tolerance engine like that while cold will just add lots of extra wear and tear on it if youre actually going to use it that is different. If it doesnt sit for more than  months there isnt a need to drain the carbtank or put fuel stabilizer in it. Just park it keep it dry and salt free and youll be fine. It will start right up in the spring. I found with winter driving the salt is the biggest enemy not the cold. As it was already said keep it clean and youll be fine.,moped,dbdpavt,2,t5_2rd89
