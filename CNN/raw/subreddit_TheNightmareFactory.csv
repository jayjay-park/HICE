4752897,0,t3_3g0hor,I will start the discussion by asking what is your favorite creepypasta? Or if you dont read creepypastas what is your favorite horror story?I would have to say that my favorite creepypasta is The Russian Sleep Experiment just because for the longest time I actually thought it was true. I was young at the time okay? I also like the Disney creepypastas because it is a matter of fact that the happiest place on earth has a lot of dark secrets. The true dark things about Disney are sometimes creepier than the fictional stories written about it.My favorite horror novel is MEG which is pretty much Jurassic Park with prehistoric sharklike things. But I like it anyway.,TheNightmareFactory,cttnc2s,1,t5_39809
