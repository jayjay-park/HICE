6006639,0,t3_3xqxez,Congratulations! July will be here before you know it.     gtjust save everything until the kid gets here and the dust settles?Yes! This is one of the  things Dave would tell you in this situation. Pause Baby Step  until mother amp baby are home amp healthy piling up the cash you would normally be using for debt reduction. IF either mom or baby needs something out of the ordinary medically speaking you want to be able to address that out of savings while keeping your focus on the joy of having a newborn and not worrying about medical bills.After the babys home amp everyones fine restart BS and throw all that saved cash toward the debt.The other thing he would tell you is that it is a much harder row to hoe if youre not married. Dave would go more into detail about how impossible it is keep finances clean amp separate while living together. Essentially youre paying your roommates bills which is as tenuous as it sounds. Since youre committed enough to have a child together your might consider getting married so that the blending of your finances is more seamless.  Something to think about.Then if your parents make a generous contribution to your new family you can either apply it to whats left of your debt in BS or if youre through that use it to fund BS the  months of expenses. Either way youre right it would be incredible amp humbling and probably make everyone cry. Sweet folks!Best wishes! Sounds like youre on the right track.    ,DaveRamsey,cy701ul,6,t5_2qjeq
6105304,0,t3_3vrkuu,Weve been following DR plan for a while and are also on bs after  year probably another year or so to go  what we do for those scenarios is have a max for each fund. For medical unless you dont have health insurance or have super high copays or a history of tons of medical expenses a  cap should be fine. Once your fund hits that just stop adding to it. This isnt even totally necessary bc you should have a  emergency fund which would usually come close to covering the out of pocket costs for an emergency medical expense for a single person.For auto  I think that depends on how carefully you figured out your budget. Ours ends up like that some months bc we renew both our cars at the same time replace all tires at the same time etc...so we have BIG amounts that come out at once every so often in that fund.  We keep every fund as lean as possible  As you get going youll notice that you spend less if you have less. So having less in those funds is motivating for spending less and paying off more. Make sense!? ,DaveRamsey,cyjlzva,2,t5_2qjeq

7663611,0,t3_4k5dlc,Whole life insurance used to be a really popular option.  It was sold as a way to invest and get life insurance all in one tidy little package and the sales people were and are very slick at selling it.  One of the things the sales people harp on is that if for some reason you become uninsurable cancer diabetes etc then when your term life expires youre screwed.  Dave counters this argument by pointing out that once youve been following his plan for  or  years that you wont need life insurance anymore because youve spent all that time investing the money you would have wasted in the whole life policy and more.   You wont need life insurance to take care of your family because theyll have actual money.Shes likely saying its a scam because she has been sold on whole life insurance and doesnt want to think she might have been wrong.  Id just nod politely say Thanks for the advice Grandma and get term anyway.,DaveRamsey,d3db4rf,2,t5_2qjeq

Uber has lots of riders and keeps us busy but Lyft does more to take care of drivers and maximize your pay. Lyft has generous promotions as well where you can get a bonus for signing up to drive and completing a certain  of rides. Use the code DRIVEAWAYDEBT and you will be eligible for a driver bonus of up to  if your area is eligible. We got  but regardless of the bonus it is a flexible way to get out of debt.

9236921,0,t1_d8la175,Glad youve decided to take on this journey to be debt free so yeah Dave would say this is not barebone enough but take it one month at a time see if you can knock one of these item out one at a time.For example Dave would say you will not see the inside of the restaurant unless you work there So maybe cut out that restaurants and fast food budget and see if you can work on eliminating the cloth and gifts budget so you can make some progress towards paying off at least one of the cars. As you gain momentum youll find new ways to entertain and enjoy each others presence without the need of . I understand its not easy but that car loan and personal  loan got to get paid off first because when you do you have just freed up  in your budget along with the other things you are cutting so maybe  towards keeping the cars running for several more months till you pay off your credit cards then youll have  to go towards student loans or an alternator if needed.Granted Im simplifying your situation somewhat and thats not entirely fair but just think of scarifying for a period of time so you can enjoy a nice vacation or a newer used car that maybe something that will keep you going.

9804904,0,t1_dakzuar,The counter is that youre not following the program. To build wealth you need to get out of debt and get yourself on a solid financial footing with an emergency fund. Whats the difference in timeframe of paying off your debt with or without the k cash? For me it was a year. I absolutely paused my retirement for that jump in timing. Also do the math for when youd make up the paused contributions. Doing  makes up for whatever you were doing before in no time. You have a big shovel and a big debt.
