In fact you can use this method to make jam out of any fruit but if you dont have a blender or a food processor at hand the fruits that work best are strawberries and bananas since they are easy to mash with a fork.RecipeIngredients cup of fruit tablespoon of drinking water or fruit juice  the quantity depends on how juicy your fruits are tablespoon of chia seedsSweetener of your choice  optional PreparationMash your fruits in my case banana with a fork or use a blenderfood processor. Add water I used cherry juice and mix them well. Then add the chia seeds and mix again. Put the mixture in a jar and let it sit in the refrigerator for at least an hour until it gets a jelly texture.
