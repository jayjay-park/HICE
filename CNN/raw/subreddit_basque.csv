2491342,0,t1_cmjr69f,So zurrunbiloa is the most correct way to refer to it as a subject?ALSO this has zero to do with my question but while Ive snagged the attention of someone with Basque knowledge can you explain what exactly it means to be ergativeabsolutive?  I feel like Im close to understanding what this means but I havent had an aha moment yet,basque,cmjr8wl,2,t5_2u3rw
6179115,0,t1_cyrz64w,This makes so much sense . Thanks for the response brother! I appreciate it. I read that the basque are the only individuals never to get conquered due to their mountainous region. Is that true?,basque,cys01qz,1,t5_2u3rw

8479464,0,t1_d619gnc,Thank you for the great response.  First thing I should apologize. I talked to my mom and it turns out I had not only a bad pronunciation but also a bad definition.  To explain a little further this was a game my grandparents aunts and uncles etc... would play with us as kids they would give a prolonged hard hug.  Basically grab a kid wrap them up squeeze while sayin tiiiiiiiiiiiii and quickly let go saying nkia! Then the kid giggles and asks you to do it again.  Which leads me to my first error  apparently they were saying tinkia not kinkia.  Second I remember being a little kid and asking for a kinkia actually tinkia so I always assumed it meant hug.  Turns out it means tight and they were just saying that for the game.  Like squeezing tight.  Once I was able to clear that up I looked it up and found the correct word to be tinko not tinkia.  This doesnt shock me.  Ive been over to the Basque Country with my mother a couple of times.  She grew up in a small pocket of Basque immigrants speaking Basque and can still speak fairly fluently. However she pronounces some words very differently and says she cant always understand native speakers. Apparently she grew up with a pretty isolated dialect and a lot of pronunciations are very different from what is correct. I dont know if any of this makes sense but after talking with my mother thats the way it was described to me. ,basque,d61h59t,1,t5_2u3rw
