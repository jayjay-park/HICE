343676,0,t3_1y0vsp,For one with TMobile after two years your bill would go down by about  if you dont get a new phone. With Verizon youll continue to pay the same amount. You would have also paid some upfront cost in case of Verizon usually  but sometimes less.From what you mentioned both of you will be getting .GB each thats more than double of what Verizon is giving you right now.,mobile,cfge3mn,3,t5_2qh4s

1013364,0,t1_chj6f1y,Thanks for the response Ill also post over there for more opinions.  You ever think about trying to get your sub added to the sidebar on some of the bigger phonerelated subs?  Youre hard to find.Anyway I stopped by a Verizon store and handled all three phones.  Funky rear buttons aside the G feels a lot like my Nexus surprise right? and I almost certainly dont want to carry two such devices  if the others offer decent performance.  The Droid Mini is a bit smaller than the Moto X but feels a lot cheaper in hand and doesnt necessarily feel as much smaller as the specs would suggest.At the moment the Moto X is feeling like the winner but Ill likely ask around a bit more before making the decision.Thanks!,mobile,chjh5z6,2,t5_2qh4s

Just because you morons prefer one phone over another doesnt make it better for the next person.What the fuck is wrong with you people? Rhetorical This is a perfect example of an iPhone users mentality over ANY other person who prefers another platform. Yall are so closeminded its painful to witness.

3789467,0,t1_cqo0cwt,Not true. Like I said I have been on verizon for years and have been shopping around for a new carrier for two months. Verizon customer service has been out standing the entire time I have used them. They have always been quick with correcting problems. Also even when they couldnt help me they were nice about it. I am only leaving them because their prices are pretty high. Here is another observation I have made while shopping for a service. The T mobile and ATandT store are right next to the sprint store that tried to screw over my SO. Now when I walk up to the t mobile or ATandT store someone immediately opens the door for me and ask why I am their. When I said I wanted to switch carriers both stores immediately broke down their plans for me and got me a quote. I gave sprint a chance because they are the cheapest carrier. Walking up to the store no opened the door. Thats ok I find that kind of awkward. In the store the sales reps where to busy chatting to come up and greet me and see what I wanted. So I waited at their sales counter. After about five minuets the employees suddenly noticed I was waiting for them.  I guess standing directly in front of them wasnt enough for them to tell I need help? And they didnt even really try to sell their product. They just handed me a pamphlet and I left. Even the metro PCS store tried to sell my their service. So no not all carriers are that shity. If you get that kind of service all the time you should switch to someone else. ,mobile,cqo89l6,1,t5_2qh4s
3841857,0,t3_34fqpr,Based on reviews it seems that the Samsung Galaxy S  has an excellent camera but shoddy battery life youre going to want at least one turbo chargers wireless chargers at places youre frequently idle and maybe a battery pack or two if youre out and about much e.g. Ingress.The LG G not out yet also seems to have an excellent camera based on the initial handson reviews that have come out. Though theyre still using prerelease software and battery life is unknown at this point so things may change by the time that phone hits shelves.Then of course theres always the iPhone which has a good balance of camera and battery life but would mean switching over to a whole new platform and unless youre invested in Apples ecosystem have a Mac computer and use iTunes youre probably not going to be as pleased with it as a new Android phone.If you want a good balance on the Android side theres the Nexus . Available from Google Motorola and all of the US carriers it has a good mix of battery life decent camera and the best software since it comes straight from Google no carrier or manufacturer bloat though not everyones a fan of its size.,mobile,cqu7es1,1,t5_2qh4s

8086483,0,t1_d4ocruj,If it was an access issue though the phone should be redirected to another site assuming there was one in range. In my network at least if you kill connectivity to a site the signal disappears and the UE fails over to another nearby site.Every time Ive seen a case where the phone shows full signal and stays locked onto a site but has no connectivity its ended up being a core issue or occasionally a service degradation where the NodeB manages to stay up but quality takes a dive to the point of being useless.,mobile,d4ozt49,1,t5_2qh4s
