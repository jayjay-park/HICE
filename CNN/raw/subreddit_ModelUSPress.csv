7146746,0,t1_d1qhsl9,Thank you for that correction it was only  am where I was currently and I was quite tired. I will say that as an Economics and Political Science major I found your dissertation quite too lengthy to make a point. If any point was made other than that there has been an evolution of economics systems that coincides with technological and societal development. The only other point that Ive gleaned is that you are insufferable  I wish I could say this was a jest. In all seriousness maybe the economic system will be absorbed by the state or maybe something completely different will take its place. That is the fun part about conjecture.  The comment I initially posted was intended to defuse a situation rather than engage a dialogue with you. Which has become increasingly less enjoyable as Ive attempted to make clear that I am brushing you off.    ,ModelUSPress,d1qidyo,1,t5_39erm

10555545,0,t1_dd4i5rd,. The biggest issue with fracking is contamination of local subsurface water which can lead to towns and cities left with no source of clean drinking water not to mention the sheer amount of water required to perform fracking activities  billion gallons for  wells in . Falling away from fracking activities coincides with weening the United States from fossil fuels such as oil and natural gas. However rather than outright ban fracking and immediately stunt growth and drop jobs fracking should be subjected to commonsense regulations that include proper wastewater disposal and intense penalties for those who fail to meet the regulations.. I would like to present legislation to reform our current healthcare system which even if it cannot be overhauled must fix gaps and ambiguities. Also I would like to present legislation for renovating the Capitol Building to include a pool.. Of all renewable energy options the United States can pursue nuclear is a questionable option due to the high volume of radioactive waste. In order to store radioactive waste the location must be stable for a very long amount of time to ensure that the waste does not spill and infect the environment. The sheer cost environmental concerns and various other issues contribute to the idea that Yucca Mountain Storage Facility should not be reopened of which I agree. In the end we should really take steps to move towards renewable energy sources that do not produce such extreme negative externalities and promote development of onsite storage measures to be as safe and efficient as possible.. Sounds like a plan.. Pro. ,ModelUSPress,dd4l91b,1,t5_39erm
