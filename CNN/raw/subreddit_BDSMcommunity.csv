107608,0,t3_1vbo8w, Shades is a kink inspired romance novel and is no more accurate about sex than any romance novel.As a label BDSM is a big umbrella. There are people who find being spanked hot and their are people who find the dynamic and ritual of being spanked hot. Some people certainly switch and safe words are real and are a serious thing because consent especially when you do some of the things we do is really really important.I think most people dont understand how much caring and connection can be part of healthy BDSM dynamics. ,BDSMcommunity,ceqoldc,5,t5_2r9tk
109904,0,t3_1vc8ii,Have you guys done Ds at all before this? I only ask because one of your other comments indicated some of the rules you have in place arent really getting done and neither of you are really enforcing them. I wonder if youre not getting bogged down by all these rules and expectations. You think that because you have a contract in place the Ds will just happen naturally and intensely. Full disclosure Im not in a  Ds relationship. What I am in however is a temporally blurry Ds relationship. There are no clear set lines for when were doing power exchange and when we arent  it just kind of happens when I am feeling subby andor when my partner is feeling dommy. However from what Ive seen and heard from people who do more  power exchange its never going to be all the time intense play. Part of those dynamics is a built in intention to serve  you have to really want to do it for its own merits and not just to get play or punishment or funishment later. Rather than arbitrarily picking rules to use or protocols to put in place I more frequently see Doms in these situations say that rules came naturally and were specific to the relationship. Yes there are some repeats like picking out  approving clothes which is also something I happen to enjoy! but in the end rules are decided based on whats practical and desireable to both the people in that relationship.Unfortunately figuring out whats practical and desireable takes time especially if you havent played with power exchange much before. If what youre craving is intense play it might be beyond what you can implement on a casual daytoday basis especially with kids around!. Instead you should consider discussing some of your fantasies with your Dom and if he is interested in them as well setting aside some time to actually act them out. Its still going to take time to figure this stuff out to see what levels of play work for you and it might be frustrating in the meantime until you figure it out. But hopefully itll be rewarding enough once you get it right to be worth it in the end. ,BDSMcommunity,ceqy1ab,5,t5_2r9tk

There are a shit ton of trans people including a lot of gf people. They have varying degrees of success with finding partners but it seems to have more to do with how comfortable they are with themselves than their gender.

Why? Because us bisexuals have been used as whipping boys of the various chunks of the LGBT community as to why gay marriage has not progressed further. Now that it has become more and more uncouth to do this Ive seen the kink and poly community become a target of the same hatred that parts of the LG community once put on us bisexuals. Another reason I also take notable offense at the term marriage equality because there are a lot of people in the LGBT community who will literally fuck over the poly community to seem more appealing to chunks of the straight populace.So piss off.,BDSMcommunity,cf8gi1o,-1,t5_2r9tk

370718,0,t3_1yaprx,I want to share my personal technique for dealing with depression when I feel it coming on with two caveats One is that you should seek therapy. My advice is not professional help. Seek professional help.  Two is that you may already do this and it may not work for you.  What follows is only what works for me.When I feel myself growing depressed there are four things that I do in order.  These steps keep my feelings from spiraling out of control.First acknowledge when you are getting depressed.  Learn the signs and know that they mean you might start a depressive phase.  Observing when you start transitioning into depression will help you communicate with others and yourself about your depression and recognize any previously unknown triggers or behavior patterns that lead to depression.Second perhaps most importantly DO NOT MAKE YOURSELF FEEL BAD BECAUSE YOU ARE DEPRESSED!  Nobody has the right to make you feel bad because of your depression including you!  This is a emotional psychological and yes even a physical condition of your brain. Do not shit on yourself you are your first and last line of defense against this.Third forgive yourself. Once you agree not to attack yourself for your depression you can forgive yourself for being depressed.  You might not be up to that scene you had planned and thats ok.  Would you expect your sub to kneel on a broken foot?Fourth remember that having depression does not make you less of a dominant.  Yes you may need to work through some issues before you can focus more on Ds but doing so will actually make you a better dominant! Dealing with your depression is necessary to you and beneficial to your development as a dom.Finding professional help is a good idea even if you are not currently in a depressive phase.  You may find that there is only so much a therapist can do for you and then you will know where you need to do work on your own.  You may also find that the therapist can help you with some of the roots or unknown triggers of your depression.  I have found that any given therapist can help me to a certain extent and then I go the rest of the way by myself.It doesnt make you less of a dominant to be human.,BDSMcommunity,cfj6v01,10,t5_2r9tk

Sometimes people dont reveal their red flags for a good while. Also you dont yet know how youll react mentally emotionally to this kind of situation when it actually happens. And you absolutely need to be in a safe space where you can have a way out and space time recovery if needed.I agree with others that this isnt something to rush into.

But relax and have fun. Dont be afraid to ask your sub for some help you could even be commanding about it.

And its always marvelous to just be called mine. Hearing those words you are mine or you belong to me. And then being told to repeat it.... Makes me so happy every time.Someone else mentioned to be yourself retain your personality and work it into your role of Dom.

528207,0,t1_cg09jig,Fucking hell. Okay presuming youre not a troll be very very careful here. A newbie has no business jumping straight into  TPE. What you need to do is read and learn everything you can. Start with rbdsmfaq find copies of the recommended books and read.If you two are actually doing this start slow. Even if you were both experienced youd start slow. Start with play sessions only and slowly escalate until things are at a level youre both comfortable with. Its very easy to hurt each other with this shit.Alsi dont fall into the trap of thinking doms are meant to be cruel and heartless and have to know everything. You are a human and as such are fallible. Keep each other in the loop and only do what you are confident you can do right.Finally and this is perhaps the most important thing I mention its largely the sub that gets to make the final call in the relationship. We allow our sons to do what they do with whatever conditions there are attached to it. While you of course also have limits and shouldnt be pushed to do what you are uncomfortable with more often than not we see newbie doms thinking true masters can do whatever they want or some other bullshit.If you want I can provide links on how to videos the books provide all this info and more though but its important you get the mindset right first.

We both love tabletop RPGs and video games and in fact met on World of Warcraft. Im pansexual my husband is genderqueer and heteroflexible. We share an apartment with one roommate a bisexual ciswoman I am close friends with. Her girlfriend stays over a lot to the point that shes almost another roommate.We have a catchild but no plans for human offspring for several years though we love talking about getting me knocked up during sex. Im am super alphafemale in our relationship outside of the bedroom. Like my husband actively dislikes making decisions for us and prefers me to do it.

610576,0,t3_214l2w,I would suggest having at least one very in depth conversation with him about what he means. One of the cornerstone concepts of BDSM is consent both parties need to be in agreement. If you dont know what being his sub means to him you are not able to give informed consent in other words if you agree without knowing what it is to him you are giving him a signed blank check. Do you know this person well enough to give them a blank check?My cynical impression with what you have included here is someone who may just be interested in being able to tell the sub to come to his place once there tell them to kneel and suck then get the fuck out. Again you need to find out what being his sub means to him.It is very likely that you two are looking for very different things and are not compatible.

725409,0,t3_22gtnt,This isnt a special trait limited to the kink world hes just behaving like a douchebag. I meet vanilla assholes all the time. Being a dom master top whatever doesnt mean you get to treat those who are not your slavesubpetwhatever any differently. Example Just because I love giving verbal humiliation doesnt mean I get to do it at work or to my friends without serious repercussions they dont want it didnt consent and are not in a relationship of that kind with me.My first advice is to see if you can privately talk to the rude guy in question without your friend around. Tell him you respect the relationship he and your friend have but you feel that he isnt being very respectful nice or polite to you. That since you and your friend are very close youd like to work this out among yourselves thus saving your friend from being the middleman or causing discord between the two. Tell him he is not your dom master or lord and to be courteous to you as any real adult would.If that doesnt change his behavior for the better you can then bring it up with your friend. If hes really an asshole this also might not change anything and your friend might just shrug it off or make excuses.  In that case you can say to your friend how you dont want to hang out until he acts like a reasonable person they end it or she makes time for the two of you to hang out privately. You might not be able to force the guy to act appropriately but you can certainly refuse to be around him!You could also consider stooping down to his level ignoring him refusing to talk to him etc. Not a great option but an option nonetheless. Although this is rather petty and he isnt worth the time effort or energy of such an approach. Best of luck! Tell us how it goes? ,BDSMcommunity,cgmqdoy,6,t5_2r9tk

741570,0,t3_22ni59,gt I was wondering how I would decide if Im DomSub or a switch?    Dont pigeonhole yourself.  These are roles.  They describe how people interact.  Some people strongly identify their person in a general sense with the way they play with others.  But not everyone does.  Dont feel you have to.  Especially when you havent engaged in the types of play these terms point to.  Furthermore many people see their preferred roles whether or not they identify closely with them evolve over time.  And Finally within each of these terms are a plethora of distinctions and subdivisions   To some their domsubfetish identity is what they always were with their principle kink claiming them utterly and singularly in adolescence.  Some of us honestly just never really spent any time thinking about vanilla sex at all.  To others kink is a path and their relationship to it evolves grows and changes as they learn making permanent identities completely contrary to the exercise.  Many fall somewhere in between.    Obviously you dont subscribe to the prior extreme.  Likely you are closer to the latter.  Dont try to make your path into kink a search for a final or allencompassing answer if this does not describe your experience of it.    gt Also I dont know where a munch would be or if there are any rules to a munch? Any information would be appreciated.     Munches can be found in your area on fetlife  Each will have a unique set of rules.  But generally these rules focus more on ensuring they are a comfortable environment for people like you who are still investigating than on making them a suitable environment for old guard kinksters.  So you shouldnt find them alienating.  ,BDSMcommunity,cgokl4m,7,t5_2r9tk

Can I be really direct about stating my interest in doing a scene with someone?Well hanging back is understandable while youre just taking everything in but theres no kinkwide rule of protocol to make you just watch for awhileunless thats what youre into. Waiting for others to pull you into play is neither required nor in the longterm most suitable for your goal.  How to go about initiating is going to vary but I think your idea to make friendly overtures by extending invitations to outside kink events is probably a very good place to start for building rapport enough to ask about the possibility of play and again it varies.,BDSMcommunity,cgqpibd,2,t5_2r9tk

828858,0,t3_23moa0,Yup you have to talk to him about it. Communication is tough but being a master or dominant doesnt give you free rein to do whatever you want unless that fact has been negotiated thoroughly. This is a good opportunity to discuss what both of you want how you have evolved together and what your limits are.For what its worth if someone wants to do something that wasnt negotiated feel free to safe word at the time if you can. You can safeword just because it wasnt negotiated just as much as when you are in serious pain.Personal rule for me is no renegotiation in scene. People arent always able to give fully informed consent in the heat of the moment or when high on endorphins. Bad feelings and regrets can come from in scene renegotiation and that defeats the whole point of it all.To paraphrase a class that my organzation recently hosted consent is a skill. Proper consent leads to hotter more satisfying scenes through communication. As such it requires practice and dedication to make it happen.,BDSMcommunity,cgyhr6l,7,t5_2r9tk

903141,0,t1_ch6v7li,gt Porn is not cheating. Period. I have yet to find a single logical argument which lays out how porn is cheating. Thats absurd.    The arguments simply this people negotiate whatever parameters for the definition of their relationship they deem important.  In my relationship we dont fuck other people and that is a defined parameter.  In the relationships of evidently a fairly large swath of the population abstaining from porn is a negotiated criterion for their desired relationship.    It might seem like a silly criterion for the negotiation of the relationship to you.  But were here most of us because were willing to be openminded about how people define their desires with respect to sexual relationships.    Heck in our relationship its important my wife remember shes to wear skirts at home and greet me with a curtsey when I return home.  Surely many people in society at large would respond to these rules the way you did this rule regarding porn thats absurd.  But few would object to it here.

I think my master typed that as hamster at first BTW would feel uncomfortable if I did fight him on it actually because it would make him feel like I dont want it and he likes knowing I want to do everything I do.I dont think people are not submitting when theyre forced to submit though because theyre still being submissive.  Being submissive doesnt always have to be willingly falling at your dommes feet and following every rule perfectly and doing every little thing for them or whatever.  Being forced or putting up a fight but submitting in the end is still submitting just in a different way I guess.  I think not everyone who does that will identify as a submissive maybe theyre a switch or a service sub or whatever but plenty of people still do like brat types as you mentioned.

1215151,0,t3_280x7b,From another postThe past few months I have seen quite a few posts about finding and keeping partners in the kink community.  Im sure many of you have seen the same types of posts and questions popping up about where to go where to post who to talk to if this or that place would work all in search of a way to connect with someone and either explore a new found kinksexuality or to continue a journey that has been ongoing for a while.Having talked to a few people privately about this very thing recently I wanted to post something about my perspective on this topic.In the vanilla world finding a partner is different than finding someone to hook up with.  Sure its altogether possible to find out that your one night stand just happens to be perfect in all the right ways but I think thats a bit more rare than movies and TV shows have made us believe.  So lets focus on finding a partner.  Someone that is going to be your other half in a relationship lasting longer than a box of condoms.So what do people look for?They need to find someone that is  the right gender either male female or in some cases either in a close enough location to make it work valid for both LDR and close proximity relationships physically attractive lets not kid ourselves here this IS important and not shallow unless its the ONLY consideration of agreeable sexuality doesnt matter if youre in love with him if hes gay and youre a female does it? interesting enough to hold a conversation beyond wanna fuck and pass the taters sharing interests with youThats just the basics here.  But lets look at this closer.  Assuming that you prefer one gender over the other the first point eliminates HALF the population in the world.  Right off the bat poof  gone.  The second point eliminates BILLIONS of people in the world and hundreds of millions of people in the United States Hey Im American and this is from my perspective alone.  Now the third point is a bit trickier since individual tastes will vary but I think its fine to assume that this will reduce the pool by a further  at a conservative estimate.  Hell some of you will reduce the pool by  or more percent if you have a specific type in mind. The fourth point can shut out say  of the remaining population depending on your sexuality.  The fifth point will again vary but I think its safe to say that we can lose another  of people here.  The final point on our basic list can reduce the numbers by another  easy.So if we start with the idea of someone being one in a million lets go with that.  Out of a million people we lose  due to gender.  Ill give everything the benefit of the doubt and not factor in relative location here but mention that we still lose  of people with our conservative estimate of physical attraction leaving us with .  When we factor in the sexuality of potential partners we are down to .  If we get rid of the half that cant really do more than have the physical interests in common were down to  remaining.  Last lets remove the  that have NO common interests with us to leave us at just over .And thats just the basics.  Weve managed to eliminate roughly  of the population here with very VERY common stuff that we all do without really thinking about it.  But lets get more specific here. How many of those  are in relationships? ?  ? What percentage will find YOU attractive? ? ? ? ? What percentage will have a compatible personality with you?  ? What percentage will hold beliefs that mesh with yours? You prochoice and theyre prolife? Religionatheist? DemocratRepublican? ? ? What percentage will have the same values as you? family friends gambling education and the like ? ?You can see where were going here.  On purely vanilla aspects weve been able to whittle down the million to what? Hundreds if youre lucky? Dozens if youre not? That are even VIABLE OPTIONS for relationships let alone a perfect match.Now factor in the BDSM and kink aspects. . .  Are they on the right side of the slash? dominant to your submissive masochistic to your sadist Are your limits in the ballpark? no bloodplay vs. must have Do you share the same philosophy regarding kink? SSC vs. RACK vs. reckless Are you both lifestyle or is she in the bedroom only to your ? Are they trustworthy and someone that can be responsible for your safety?Again. . . you see where this is going.Im not saying that looking for love or relationships is a hopeless endeavor in the kink culture.  Hell Im living proof that its possible.  I happen to be in love with my girl and know every day how lucky I am to have found her.  There are so SO many of us that have worked through all of this whittling down to have found someone that is special and that works for us.But I wanted everyone else out there looking for partners or relationships or even just someone to talk to to understand that its not nearly as easy as just declaring Im waiting.  This thing we do doesnt make things easier.  BDSM and kink culture isnt a speedpass to relationships NOR sex.  It adds on additional weight to the choices that we make and to be honest additional barriers to happiness.Those of us that are in good working long term relationships can tell you that it is very much worth the while to persevere through the obstacles and pitfalls along the way.  But we will also tell you that you need to be patient take things slow and not to rush into anything.Your one in a million IS out there. . . theyre just going to be harder to find than you thought they would be.  Dont give up. And dont rush.  You have the rest of your life.DS,BDSMcommunity,ci6bmzz,5,t5_2r9tk

In essence you are creating a loop with a bulb on it that keeps it in place and keeps the end of the tube from rubbing against her legs or wrists.  The cuffs would clip to the loops.

He says anyone with knowledge of top rope or lead climbing should know a decent amount about makeshift anchor points and emergency harnesses as well as avoiding nerve damage and such to be helpful. Basically look for people who climb recreationally.

The moment you start with bondage you must put health and safety considerations first and foremost  your partners welfare being obviously far more important than kink.Both partners could optionally also agree that the key is within chainreach length but hidden say under the mattress so that in an emergency she could find it  but not while you are present to stop her searching.,BDSMcommunity,cipmhlw,2,t5_2r9tk

1421544,0,t3_2aeuve,Very nice overall advice!! I would add that each conference will have its own personality if you attend one your impressions are not a guarantee that a different one will have the same response.I strongly second the encouragement for volunteering another bonus I would suggest is that by volunteering it provides someone new and potentially hesitant or nervous a purpose for bing there. My experience is that the level of commitment needed for full waiving of fees is substantial. The conferences I am familiar with provide discounts for fees for a majority of the volunteer staffing needs. Some conferences are moving to a reimbursement model for compensating volunteers due to the unfortunate reality that many will volunteer to get a discount and not fulfill their commitments. The reimbursement model assures that one will not get a discount for not following through.I cant stress  enough. I have recently read a post by someone new that was complaining about a DM at a conference play party not interrupting a scene that that observer was troubled by seeing. In the responses to that rant the bottom for the scene described their disappointment with the interruption and how jarring it was for them to not complete a long discussed and due to life issues deeply desirable scene.Ones best intentions may end up severely backfiring on the desires and intent of others. ,BDSMcommunity,ciugv4h,2,t5_2r9tk

1428330,0,t3_2ahxwr,Being kinky hasnt interfered with my finding special someones at all and Im pretty sure one of the reasons is that I dont hide it.  Fellas looking for a girl like me and those who wouldnt want one for that matter dont find it difficult to identify me as such.  Guys who are neutral but good giving and game walk in with their eyes open.  And there never comes a moment in the relationship where someone who likeslovestrusts me suddenly realizes Ive been hiding my real self from him and feels tricked and betrayed.  I find that helps a lot on the intimacy front.As for straight dudes in lace panties  One of my most serious attachments is to a guy who greeted me at the door on our second date wearing a dress and high heels.  He knew Im not attracted to feminine guys and was a little concerned his crossdressing might turn me off.  But he also knew it was a big part of who he is and wanted me to know him.  His willingness to take that risk with himself touched and impressed me and I continued to be impressed by his courage honesty and openmindedness as the relationship progressed and we revealed and explored more of our mutual and individual quirks and kinks.  He wouldnt have become nearly as important to me nearly as fast if hed only offered me a shallow connection and a partial view of his self.,BDSMcommunity,civbh6c,20,t5_2r9tk

But at the time I was pretty headoverheels for this girl and would have been happy if she had turned out to be The One.The example I used to use during our disagreements over this was blondes and brunettes. I fancy both blonde and brunette girls. Most guys do.But that doesnt mean that a guy in a monogamous relationship with a blonde cant be happy for the rest of his life without ever sleeping around with a brunette on the side. She never quite accepted that analogy unfortunately.As an aside   The implication of your question is that no one is truly monogamous in their head  because we all see people we fancy in the street all the time.  Which might actually true if were closer to Bonobo monkeys than to Orangutans.Actually Id like it if society moved on a little. Now that women have their own agency and society protects single parents and their children and with the invention of successful contraception a lot of the societymodel of marrying having children and staying together for life is looking rather oldfashioned. So I think were going to see a lot more openrelationships in future. On the day that the contraceptive pill was invented every adult on the planet should have hunkered down together in a group and said Hey guys all these old rules for how to live need to be chucked out of the window. We need a new set. All the stuff that we do because traditionally women got pregnant once a year and so needed the protection of a male long term partner is oldhat and irrelevant now. What are the ground rules going to be from now on?But of course that didnt happen and we all still live in our parents moral framework from our childhood upbringing always one generation outofdate with whats really going on in society.,BDSMcommunity,ciw5k9h,2,t5_2r9tk

1526744,0,t1_cj7fw6y,It really depends on how much it subtracts and how you do that math.  Does it subtract so much that theres not enough other things left in the relationship to keep the sum total as a positive number?  You guys are the only ones who can answer that.Being kinky or not kinky is in some ways like being male or not male.  Your girlfriend cant give you the sexwithaman experience because she doesnt happen to have a penis.  Not that theres anything wrong with not having a penis and you guys seem pretty straight up on that.  If she cant give you a kink experience though its more or less the same thing.  She might just not be built that way and theres absolutely nothing wrong with that either.  If you guys do discuss opening up I think it would serve you well to discuss why there would be bruised egos about you going outside the relationship for kink if there are no bruised egos about you going outside the relationship for sex with a man.  Theres no shame in not being absolutely everything your partner wants all the time and the shameinsecurity issues should probably be dealt with before anyone acts outside the relationship.

Not into humiliation or being degraded.  However I love certain things which others may think are in this category I. E I love being called things like cock whore or fuck toy etc this to me is dirty talk.  All dirty talk is a turn on to me.  I also love hair pulling breath play etc where Im clearly not the one in control. . Being owned. I dont think Im owned Im not a slave Im a subbottom.  But also in a long term monogamous relationship. Im not available to play with others we are not poly in any way possible fantasy play only.  So I guess in some respects Im owned. I personally need a connection outside of bdsm to want to play.  Trust etc essential. . I like being commanded because its sexy and a turn on it makes it easy to please as theres no guess work. It makes me happy to please my Dom. . Who likes punishment...not me... But funishment and sexy spanking and flogging forced orgasam etc bring it on. Always had sub inclinations. now . Yes I had abuse in past as child and raped as a teen and in s but this is NOT why I want bdsm in my life.  I want bdsm because I like the way I feel when I please my Dom.  In fact the past experiences I had are a reason I put off acting on my feelings desires for a long time.  I do not engage in any form of consent non consent play its a hard limit.  . Not insecure about being alone.  But if my partner were to leave or die yes Id be devastated for obvious reasons I love him and would have normal loss if he went around this has nothing to do with bdsm but would be the same for any relationship which ended . No secret signs I know of..... COMMUNICATE! . Well as stated by some others Im not your sub so you cant command me to do anything.... But for my Dom he can command me to do anything he knows is not a hard limit.  He can push my soft limits in fact this is how you can discover new pleasures I. E anal play breath play etc but this needs negotiation like anything so again you really need to ask your own sub play partners how you want to structure your relationship or play sessions. I would bear anything for my Dom as long as it doesnt cross my lines which because we communicate I trust him to not do anything he knows wont work for meus.  But if he wants something new or different then Im open to him. I hope you get the insight you were after.  Good luck. ,BDSMcommunity,cjcrq74,5,t5_2r9tk
1571464,0,t1_cjcpzg7,Story time! Im sorry if I wax eloquently a bit here but I think its relevant to your situation.So  years ago I was attending a dungeon in Tenn. while on vacation in the area. I was with my secondary at the time and she came with me to the dungeon. While going through the requisite paperwork in the front lobby a nicely dressed  woman walks in the front door and starts the same admission process. She speaks quietly and reservedly and sits very straight on the couch. Once we gain entrance I make small talk and introductions but she seems uninterested in talking so I move on to the other people in the sitting area of the dungeon. At this point I have her pegged internally as a dominant not that it matters much to me. I treat everyone the same and guesses like the above one are just so I can make a guess as to your standard behavior and not good guesses either I always keep in mind.Later that night I do a firecupping and fire scene with my secondary. When I look up from the scene I realized I had garnered quite a crowd. Apparently that type of scene had mostly disappeared in the local kink scene and I announced that after I had finished my aftercare I would happily do demos for any bottom who was interested though I couldnt teach any aspiring tops due to time constraints.Two women came forward afterwards one of them being the tall woman I had met earlier in the night. After explaining what I had done and why I performed the demo and acquired contact information for her so I could check in the next day. This is a standard procedure for me even for demos so I can make sure the individual is not having any mental or physical problems the next day and to help as best I can if they are.After checking up on her she expressed an interest in asking me a few more questions. After making as big a dent as I could in them she was very new I discovered I offered to spend a dinner with her while I was still in Tenn. to keep answering everything she could ask. years later and shes been my slave for  of them.This is only about half the complete story but the relevant part is this Good kinksters will look well beyond any initial preconceptions they have and hopefully they treat everyone equally anyways. I wouldnt consider dating anyone I didnt know so why would I consider being a dominant or master to someone I didnt know either?My slave has worn some form of collar either a training one or the real one she has now for many years and people STILL assume she is a dominant based on her behavior when separated from me. Those people are stupid especially when she is wearing an obvious collar but they do exist. You dont want a relationship with stupid people anyways right? D,BDSMcommunity,cjd990f,1,t5_2r9tk

In  there was a situation involving a play party getting busted by the police in Attleboro. The chain of events is known more widely as Paddleboro TLDR someone was charged with assault for hitting his partner with a wooden spoon at said play party. This was the case that made BDSM essentially illegal in the state of Massachusetts.Now there are no legal or public play spaces in Massachusetts so kinksters usually go to Rhode Island for parties events or public play.,BDSMcommunity,cji3u1s,3,t5_2r9tk

That way you can still veto it for the spouse.Second have a frank discussion first with spouse then then together with sister. Presumably things like control of icecream are DampS but not directly erotic right? Perhaps that needs explaining. Or perhaps the underlying logic of your control is for your spouses own good?

They could also be perfectly complimentary. But you wont know until YOU ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT SEX OR HAVE SEX WITH THEM. To say that you can determine what kind of sex turns an individual on or not without actually discussing sex with them is super dumb.

1918381,0,t1_ckk7ril,I think Thtb means that such a club naturally tends to attract creeps who view it as a sort of easy in to find targets for their creepitude.Pretty much any bdsm group eventually attracts a few predatorsabusive types looking for vulnerable or insecure targets to glom onto mostly in the form of Dumbinants aka bullshit Doms who are using bdsm lifestyle to justify their abusive tendencies but who either dont believe in things like safewords or sub boundaries or who simply pay lip service to the rules but dont respect those lines in the moment and then blame any issues on the subs. Guys like this are always looking for high concentrations of people who are exploring bdsm but arent educatedexperiencedconfident enough to call them on their shit.Youll also get run of the mill creeps who think any sexfocused group is a singles hunting ground with an official cover or just treats it that way. Usually these are just your run of the mill pervsskeevs who cant let an opportunity pass by to hit on anything that seems even remotely sentient. Kinda like how they hit up nude beaches and cruises because they equate people being nude a lot with must be an orgy. Finally youll get your polyfolly creeps the ones who claim to be poly but who are really just in it for all the sex they can land but want a coolersounding label than sleeps around a lot not that theres anything wrong with that just saying that official sexpos labels make them think they sound cooler. These are the type who tend to leave a swath of emotional mayhem in their wake because theyre less polyamory handled in a mature manner than they are fuck anything that moves but dont bother with all that stupid boundaries and respect and its a real relationship just bigger crap because it cramps my style.,BDSMcommunity,ckkco9m,2,t5_2r9tk

1925305,0,t3_2goeed,This is a great question.And the more you think about it the more complicated and wide the implications are.Why is there no female equal?You might ask why are the sexes so different on lots of sexual topics. Where are all the female dommes? Where are all the female fetishistic crossdressers?Feminist understanding usually says that men and women are blank slates. Most people probably view the sexes as products of biology and culture.If you follow the logic that forced fem culture is misogynistic you have to go round in strange circles of logic. It implies that men think less of women and seek to humiliate and punish women. But why would they do this to themselves?When a feminist criticizes BDSM play of a dom man and sub woman its said to be playing out what they believe all men really want to do with women.If a feminist criticizes the ultra fem sissy and forced fem play of BDSM they are saying this is how men see women. But they cant say this is how men really want women to treat men.On the wider topic if erotic crossdressing this is largely a male thing. Feminist critics say this is because the femininity is commodified and fetishized. Which to me is a way of stopping debate. As if forced fem men picked this sexuality of a box just to get at women. Men with this kink are largely tortured souls  the reality of this kink social isolation and disgust. How can a sexuality based on the power of men over women lead to nothing but disaster for the man make sense?But then a lot of critics often believe sexuality is a political act. Orientation and desire as an active choice. Something I have never believed.,BDSMcommunity,ckl6omd,2,t5_2r9tk

For me if I ever did feel this way that would a red flag that something wasnt working  either that somethingsomeone had gone too far consciously or unconsciously or that something else about the dynamic was off such as me no longer feeling safe in myself or with that person.For me sub drop and guilt about having to use my stop word for the first couple of times do not make me unexcited about playing again.

2105600,0,t3_2j15yi,I am not a doctor or other medical professional but from my limited understanding NSAIDs including advil can thin the blood which can increase bruising if taken prior to the paddling. They also wont make it feel less painful although they may make the pain not last as long afterward. Id say you might get some benefit from them if you took them immediately before so there wasnt time for them to actually take effect until the paddling was over but they would do so almost immediately thereafter.However NASIDs are still medications still have side effects and can still cause damage to your body.

Withholding information breaks the trust i had and makes me more tentative the next time.In short talk to him before during and after play whenever there is something that might impact your ability to play at the usual levels. Never feel bad able being honest and providing needed information.,BDSMcommunity,clby9fr,3,t5_2r9tk

2268927,0,t3_2l6jzv,I have this exact problem.  It drove my mother nuts when I was little as she would buy the most adorable turtlenecks in the winter and Id ruin every last one of them within a couple hours pulling at it so I couldnt feel it against my neck.  It has to be REALLY. FUCKING. COLD out for me to wear a scarf in the winter.  I get the same irrational fear as you  I seriously doubt a turtleneck is out to get me but I still start feeling like I cant breathe and get all panicky if I dont take it off.  I have been able to try and enjoy! a belt wrapped around my neck even with it pulled a little tight and slightly restricting nowhere near cutting off just slight restriction of my air flow.  The only way I could enjoy it however was the complete  faith and trust in my ex.  I had a bunch typed here to try to convey the world of difference between what most people mean when they say complete trust in someone that youre in love with dating long term etc. and this  level  but I think in this subreddit I dont have to type it out.  People here are probably some of the very few in the world who actually will understand that level of trust.We started lightly  his hand resting there for a moment then moving elsewhere that sort of thing.  In the beginning I did have to fight my brain some and it often pulled me out of the happy sub mindset but he was patient with me honestly he would have been completely okay never doing it at all  I pushed because I knew he liked it.  I was so happy the day we finally got to me on my knees at his feet sucking him while he pulled a belt tighter around my neck I could still breathe fine but there was definite pressure there.  I found that if he got me very worked up and in proper submissive mindset first I could be okay with it.  It never turned me on but it stopped turning me off.  The minute sex was done and my brain started turning back on though off it went.  I could have a belt around my neck for an hour while going at it and be fine and then before Ive even got my breath back afterward Im tugging it off or telling him to if my hands are tied.  I guess normalme never got over it but subme was able to deal because of the let go and put yourself in his hands mental state.It took time though and levels of trust that most people might find a bit odd.,BDSMcommunity,cls5qnj,1,t5_2r9tk

2621047,0,t3_2puigu,I think the lg aspect has nothing to do with any of it. The real issue is her being a friend or even just being a decent human being. Her support or should I say lack of support is showing you what type of friend she really is. I have a best friend and we do not agree on everything but there has never been a time that we dont support each other. I can nicely tell her that I dont like something but I would never treat her like that. Her kinks may not be my kinks and I may not live my life like her but Im ALWAYS in her corner and want her to be happy. If it was a friend that I was very close to and really wanted to keep I would have a sit down heart to heart conversation and point blank tell them how their rudeness and lack of care about my feelings hurt me and what I needed from them for support. Even if shes under a lot of pressure that does not give her a right to treat you like that. Are you not under a lot of pressure with trying to get pregnant would you behave that way towards her?Infertility is so stressful as it is and you need to have people around you that are supportive they dont have to like kids but care deeply for you. Being a little is not an excuse for bad behavior littles are still grown women who can respect other people. I think you need to forget the little part of all this and deal with the friendship part. What she said was definitely mean and you should not put up with it. You deserve better in a friendship. I do have friends that dont like kids and I respect that. We go out instead of them coming over. They are respectful and nice when they are around kids but we can enjoy each other without kids around. But never ever are they rude or mean about it. Mutual respect for each others differences makes it easy to keep our relationships and enjoy each other.Good luck on your having a baby I know how hard it can be and I wish you all the best. ,BDSMcommunity,cn0piyr,3,t5_2r9tk

2683482,0,t3_2qp5ri,The other comments in this thread have been great so far but I just wanted to chime in as a masochist who likes spanking that hurts First I totally agree with Wordsworthswarriors explanation of pain being just another sensory stimulus...This next paragraph is a long explanation of sensory stuff feel free to skip it if youre not interested. Its nonessential.Im autistic and Im both very hypersensitive and the way I process sensory information is in many ways different. Have you ever heard of how autistics like deep pressure? Temple Grandins squeeze machine? Weighted blankets? Well this comforting immensely fabulous sensation of deep pressure is something that most people like actually! Autistics just seem to like it more because of our sensory differences. Deep pressure in the muscles and joints feels pretty universally good and thats why people like yoga massage and firm hugs. Have you ever heard of how some autistic people will do things like hit themselves bite themselves or bang their heads against the wall when experiencing severe overload? Most neurotypicals are confused and afraid of this for obvious reasons! It can be very dangerous! but really the reason that many autistics do this is the same reason I like to be spanked. Its deep pressure pain. Its like an overwhelming very intense version of ordinary deep pressure and its something that is unignorable taking up your entire attention and focus and filling you with lovely chemicals which is why its so inviting for a person experiencing emotionalsensory overload it drowns out everything else.I noticed you said something about feeling uncomfortable with the idea of identifying as a masochist. I would never have identified with that label a few years ago! I would have called myself the opposite even because Im so sensitive to pain. Even being tickled feels like unbearable pain to me! Being hit hard with a riding crop leaves wonderful welts and redness but it feels AWFUL!!!! But... I am a masochist. I just didnt know what the word really meant before I learned about the kink community.Masochists dont like pain in the general sense except for the very rare occasion of a person with a nervous system difference that processes pain as something else entirely. Every masochist Ive ever met or talked to says that they hate stepping on a lego as much as the next person. We squeal when grease pops out of the pan and we hate papercuts! Its all about what type of pain youre experiencing and its also all about the context.I like deep pressure thuddy pain in literally any context. But thats me. I only like light stingy pain in sexual contexts. And even then I only like a little because its very intense! Being hit with a riding croplightlyon my upper back makes sexual arousal x more intense for me because its an incredible endorphin rush to have stingy pain that close to your head. It feels like the euphoria of an hourlong spanking session injected in a split second. But hitting me in the same way in a nonsexual context would freak me out and be really upsetting and uncomfortable!Masochists usually like one type of pain stingy vs. thuddy more than the other. Bare handed spanking is both thuddy and stingy pain in one so its a pretty universal sexenhancer for masochists.My advice for discovering your preferences would be to experiment with different types of spanking. Heres a visual guide to spanking that I really like. Try different levels of hard or soft. A cupped hand makes a more thuddy spank and a flat hand with fingers spread makes a more stingy spank! Play around with where youre being hit too. I dont like the thighs too ticklish for me! but I like the fleshy part of the booty and so on.Good luck!,BDSMcommunity,cn8unpb,4,t5_2r9tk

Theyre all individuals who are smart in their own way and none of them fall into the normal character tropes. I also love the total lack of taboo regarding sex in their society sex is basically considered part of their religion Phedre is a courtesan and rather than it hurting her reputation it only makes her a stronger and more influential person in society. Jacqueline Carey is a phenomenal writer each series is written differently for which ever character is the POV its awesome and not something you see authors do very often.

3014707,0,t3_2upeqr,gt  has anyone else overcome a Sub with a similar personality before and if so any advice?Youre pretty much asking how to override or remake someones personality and sexual preferences presumably against their wishes. Can it be done? Sure absolutely shatter their self image or self esteem until they feel theyre somehow flawed for being themselves. Should that be done? The answer to that shouldnt be difficult to come up with.Your styles arent compatible within your current framework. You could try talking about a compromise that works for both of you or perhaps both indulging the others preferred style. Youre not likely to turn a preference for fighting and being overpowered into a preference for docile submission though. As for planning scenes what is it youre uncomfortable about? We dont or at least very rarely script our scenes but we do tend to have a general idea what were aiming for in mind specifically in terms of the intent. What are you trying to do? Control arousal catharsis subspace endurance what is it that youre trying to make your bottom experience? What are you trying to get out of it? We tend to have a general idea what were aiming for and a general idea of what were going to use to get there. Some types of play are better suited to specific aims. If youre trying to make your bottom floaty hypnotic rhythmic flogging is likely to work better than rough body play for example. If youre trying to turn on and get submission out of a fighty bottom rough body play may be the way to go. The evil one does tend to plot out devious shit in advance though Im not always privy to it. The big edgepushing stuff we plan together. The evil surprises do you know how hard it is to stay still being caned?

And theres the study about how porn watching affects peoples beliefs about women in the workplace I mean these studies are always fundamentally flawed and tend to have bias because theyre done by humans and its about self reporting not testable data.

Ultimately a dom isnt there to command you but to provide a stern guidance toward what you want to do even if it means telling you to do things that you are uncomfortable with at the time they are actually being done. Ultimately from what it sounds like here you are feeling as if he is being dishonest with you which compromises the trust relationship that is needed between a dom and a sub. Sit down with him in a nonpressuring environment and explain this to him. Try to get him to agree to going out for a coffee or something with this woman so that you can talk to her.

After the scene was over and during aftercare I asked her her favourite part and least favorite. Her reaction was... Less than what I expected considering it was my first time bringing out a lot of the toys with her.The whole interaction kind of left me feeling lackluster about my skills in sensory play and domination so I made a decision I posted on Fetlife asking for an older more experienced dom to take me under their wing not as a sub but as a pupil. My call was answered and I meet with him next week.Turns out she was just really worn out from the scene and didnt have the energy to answer me properly.

Honest and TRANSPARENT communication. ANY bottled up concerns or fears WILL come out and explode. Be HONEST with yourselves and eachother all the way along. Integrated poly relationships are hard because basically youre each doubling the good AND the bad in any relationship.  Also you guys will have to have a hard conversation on whether exploring this aspect of yourselves is worth jeopardizing your own two person relationship.

I ABSOLUTELY HATE IT I think its uncomfortable I dont feel sexy and I can never even drool because my mouth gets so dry. That being said he likes to do it himself when he is the sub. I dont think its an attractive face to make and it really is one of the quickest ways for me to lose my libido and one of the quickesy ways to get his through the roof. So I usually just go along with it. But it puts me in a very unsexy state of mind where I feel like I just would rather get it over with.I have a piece of advice regarding this My Daddy has kind of a spitdrool fetish as well.  He often instructs me to spit or drool more on his cock likes to spit on my pussy etc etc.  One thing he will do often which I find surprisingly hot is just grab my face and straight up spit in my mouth usually followed by kind of licking my mouth and face.  So maybe actively spitting onin him rather than just sitting there waiting for drool to form?  Thats all Ive got for ya sorry.,BDSMcommunity,cp2850r,1,t5_2r9tk

3338210,0,t3_2yek3i,Choking is one of those things that can be fun yet dangerous. The easiest way for him to do it is watch your reactions and movements. Its better to ALMOST cut off the air supply so youre pulling in a small amount of air enough to get light headed and kick the adrenaline in but not cut it off completely and make you black out. Have him start off and slowly increase pressure until you give him a prearranged signal and you can gauge when you can still draw breath but barely.

Find out what works for him and then explore how aspects of that could also be fun for you.If taking control isnt something youre super confident doing using props to get and maintain control can help. Blindfolds and bondage take away sight and control of movement without requiring much effort on your part. Blindfolds are your friend if youre hesitant or nervous as well. You can always pause for a moment and figure out what the hell youre doing and for the person blindfolded that pause will just add anticipation. If youre going to play with rope practice your ties first and pick something simple enough that you can do it fairly smoothly.Sensation play mixed with bondage is an easy place to start playing with control in my experience.,BDSMcommunity,cpja8u0,1,t5_2r9tk

It was the first time Ive felt so completely helpless I have bad eyesight even normally which makes me completely freaked out when my glasses are gone and the amount of trust I was putting in him was overwhelming. I was trying to not panic and the moment I let go was one of the most beautiful things Ive ever experiance.And he didnt betray my trust. He responded to me when I mentioned that one of my wrists felt too tightly bound when I wasnt sure if I had spoken loudly enough. He didnt leave me.

Men and women have a huge variety of likes and dislikes and preferences and within such a diverse subreddit as this that goes double.  applying your private dynamic to strangers who have not specifically consented to it. If youre a Master with a consenting female slave and you bring gender inequality into it thats fine. If you apply it to most women you encounter thats not fine. Portraying your way as the One True Way. Applying double standards based on gender. This is not the same thing as acknowledging double standards.

3721687,0,t3_330c8m,TLDR Youre perfectly fine a dom turned on by a set of rules for your sub. Better than fine in fact because you want to take care of your sub and not shatter himher. And this list is actually pretty okay even among the sane! Its just a contract. Positive judgment friend.I think its definitely Ds material. Just keep in mind that you are a Dom and not a madman. Your sub chooses to stay with you and can choose to not go through with anything.For instance rule by rule this can be translated into something very enjoyable! Their written presence would give my sub comfort in all honesty because he would have something to hold onto when things get rougher than he likes. Im a mothering Domme and all of these can be translated into a loving rulebook that explains the hows and whys of my orders. The first rule translates to Ive got a gameplan here follow it and youll be just as fantastic as you told me you want to be! Basic hygiene and selfcare is important to your health as well as my own. Making your bed and cleaning your room is important because of the confidence you will get from it trust me on this one its just good to come back to a made bed in a clean room.Rule number two translates to Wise men are the quiet ones. Think carefully and offer your thoughts on what Ive said and answer my questions as I ask them. Unless its an emergency let me have the challenge of anticipating your wants little one. Even eye contact would be too big of a giveaway for me.Rule number three You can trust me. You might not like what is going on but I have your best interests at heart when I am working with you. I dont want to have to fight you outwardly when Im trying to help you change inwardly. You need to trust me please keep your posture neutral if not inviting. This is a tough thing Im trying to do and any help would be appreciated.Rule number four Trust me! You might not understand the whys but I do. If I told you you would not learn what you need to to change in the most permanent way. You would lack the pride of accomplishment because you would have walked into it knowing what was going to happen.Rule number five When you have time to introvert introvert. Meditation is excellent for the body mind and soul. Do it in the downtime I schedule for you dont let your mind and body waste themselves with anxiety.Rule number six I tell you to do certain things in perpetuity stretching at night and when you wake up for instance or wearing certain colors certain days of the week. I plan on building on these things to help you achieve the goals you told me that you have for yourself better physicality style. There are consequences for not following through with these guidelines because you need these habits built into your life to grow and become the man you want to be. You told me that you want this dont fight me as I help you to achieve your goals.My little whore and I are partnersI would never intentionally overreach or run him through muck without a purpose or final goal in mind. And he in turn has asked for me to structure things for him and to keep him accountable. This list can mean anything to anyoneyour being turned on by this is just another Ds determining thing. Imagine someone saying Get on your hands and knees and crawl to me if its your voice youre a dom and if your knees wobbled a little youre a sub kind of thing. All of this still falls into safe sane and consensual or even riskaware consensual kink.,BDSMcommunity,cqghyjx,6,t5_2r9tk

This is all probably still an ongoing process.With my first sub  the one who introduced me to it and the first one I played with as a Domme it helped that he had a clear idea of what he wanted and was willing and patient to let me experiment and practice with things in a nonjudgmental patient environment.  He did top from the bottom quite a bit because he had to  I needed the guidance and the mentoring at that point.  I wouldnt tolerate that now to the same degree but it was great for me at the time.  I wasnt ready right away to be a full holistic Domme to a total sub.  I basically needed an awesome switch I could experiment with without the goal of a  relationship.On the practical side I just revamped my OKCupid profile and realized I had a lot of outdated BDSMrelated questions that I had to change.  I had to tweak my Fetlife profile.  I started attending a munch for Dommes that has been a great space for getting advice and venting frustrations.  I had to learn to be more confident and direct in how I interacted with potential partners since some of the burden shifts to the Domme in a way I wasnt used to and the people I was interacting with were different.  I found along the way some of my personal style shifted too.  I could be more comfortable wearing certain clothes if that makes sense because I felt my personality and image of myself shifted a little bit and I naturally wanted to express myself physically a little bit differently.Ill PM you something about the beginnings of my transition that might be of interest.I have no idea how these things translate to the dom gt sub flip.

The risk of death and neurologic injury are increased when strangulation activity is performed alone and when ligatures are used .The presenting complaints of children with less severe episodes of hypoxia whose findings ultimately are attributed to selfinduced hypoxia may include Recurrent confusional episodes and seizurelike events.

Direct translation from the common English use of Master to mean male dominant really isnt applicable in Japan. Men who top in Japan dont use a selfappointed title. They dont insist on others calling them any special names. The term goshujinsama is sometimes met with a snicker as it literally means Husband in the high honorific form. Uesama is a genderneutral term used in feudal Japan for the highest ranking of that clan. When Americans ask for the translation for Master theyre likely to get some hemming and hawing or a quick brushoff with the word Goshujinsama.,BDSMcommunity,cra00ru,4,t5_2r9tk

4024751,0,t3_36lk5z,I feel more comfortable using plain english than safewords which of course only works when youre not also doing any kind of consensual nonconsent. I find it a lot easier to just update my tops when appropriate and if its been a while for them to check in with me and make sure Im still good. So if something starts approaching say where someone might call yellow Ill instead actually say thats right on the edge of what I can take oh my god no more on that spot not so far with the hair pulling need more of a break between hits that sort of thing. I know it would be faster to just say yellow and then stop to have a discussion about it but my tops know to pause when Im saying words so its basically the same thing. Instead of red I much more easily say stopstopstopstopstop. I have problems saying red but none saying nope repeatedly. Anyway that works much better for me than safewords it doesnt feel like a safeword Im not disappointed when I do that like Im spoiling everyone elses fun. I know I shouldnt have that reaction to safewording buuuut I do and this works fine instead for now.I also like to push myself and adjust to discomfort and get to that spacey zoned out state and just this weekend I forgot to say something wasnt okay until one of the tops it was a group scene checked in with me about how I was doing. That was when I realized that wait no I was being hit too hard. I also am really prone to forgetting to pay attention to if my hands gradually become tingly when tied up so thats something I let tops know theyll need to check in on. Id love to be able to remember to pay attention to my hands but I just cant do that and enjoy the scene at the same time. I could see a top not wanting to play with me because of that but more often Ive been with folks who are fine remembering to check in every so often so I guess thats also a normal enough way to do things that you could suggest to your top. ,BDSMcommunity,crf1v37,13,t5_2r9tk

We dont do this in nonkink relationships and kink doesnt suddenly make them necessary.  Thats not to say that normal nice people shouldnt still care about their expartners so all this support can be given anyway at the natural end of a relationship. The care might well be in the opposite direction too in a servicesub relationship where the sub has been doing all the practical work and the Dom wouldnt be able to find the remote control for the television let alone pay bills.  So yes Be a nice person even if the relationship ended badly. Support the human being you once loved.  But better than writing Release Agreements at the start of the relationship  Use that time instead to decide whether youre rushing into a relationship with the wrong person. If so dont go further.

I identify as a Domme so I was thoroughly confused as to WTF was going on with me.

Sorry if I sound silly I just dont know anywhere else to askDisclaimer My SO enjoys petplay from time to time but its a few days of  pet play then a month break and then another few days of  and only during the summer. Outside the  days we are your normal BFGF couple.For inspirationMy SO likes to play a wild tigerlionbear that i need to tame. So i make furniture out of cardboard boxes paint them and then she smashes them. Its something she enjoys immensely.When she is my pet she wears furry bdsm gloves knee pads collar and sometimes body paint and fur tail plug its normally for an hour or so and i will take it out.She sleeps either in her cage on a soft cushion or in her dog bed leashed to a bedpost.She is not allowed to stand pr speak at all she will only growl or make other animal sounds. she can only sit on furniture if she has been a good cub will eatdrink out of a bowl.Another activity we both love is me walking her on a leash. Her parents have a house near the sea with a big walled in garden so when they are away during the summer we will care for the house and ill walk her on a leash or train her in the garden during the day and take her for a walk in the sand dunes at night.Other then that i try and train her while she acts like a wild animal.

4457566,0,t1_cssjrpo,This is without a doubt an abusive relationship.Here are some key questions to ask yourself when deciding whether its abusive or a Masterslave relationship.  Does he do these things for your benefit or for his?  My master has spanked me and slapped me before.  Hes left bruises many times but it is because I have accepted these things as a punishment in order for my own personal growth and for our relationships growth.  It is never because he is angry with me or angry at something else..  Can you end the current relationship?  If you cant end right now then its definitely an abusive relationship or true slavery which is illegal and not acceptable..  Does he make you happier than you were before him?  If not its not a good relationship regardless of the relationship dynamic..  Does he risk permanent harm against your will?  This is abuse by definition.  This is not okay at all.From what youve said I would either sit down and talk to him about your fearsthoughtsquestions if you feel like he could talk to you without hurting you or I would advise that you leave immediately and call him to talk.  If he cant be civil about the way that the Masterslave dynamic is affecting you then its not a good relationship.I really hope that this helps and even more than that I hope that you can get help from what I am assuming is a very abusive relationship.

However this is a gross overgeneralisation as a lot of possible combinations exist. You can be both a masochist and still get pleasure from pleasuring another you can be a masochist and a sadist at the same time switching.In response to the final question you asked if you enjoy pain and it gratifies you in anyway whatsoever youre a masochist.

4529305,0,t3_3d37t5,While I dont want to take away from anything that ucravebdsm said I do want to put in my two cents which are a little different. Specifically related to gtShe has some disorders that have been vaguely diagnosed and others that we have concluded about her. Emotional abusive childhood leading her to need to serve someone in order to feel validated about herself. She doesnt view BDSM as an entertaining activity but rather a coping mechanism or a solution to fix herself. In my opinion this is not the correct way to handle the issues. But she has stated that in the past her play sessions have allowed her to quiet her mind yet only temporarily.She needs more help than just a dominate partner. I dont know what it means to have a disorder vaguely diagnosed but if there are issues they need to be figured out and attended to. Based on my experience just using BDSM as a coping mechanism isnt likely to fix anything its a temporary distraction as you said.I am a wreck. BDSM has helped in that its given me more confidence in myself and my body and has helped me recognize that I am stronger than I thought. But it hasnt fixed my messed up brain chemistry my incorrect thought patterns or all the other things that are wrong with me that Im not going to list here.There was a very similar post a month ago about this and I still feel the same way here she needs therapy. She needs help to figure out how to get past her past to find her own self worth to get to a point where shes not just using this to hide but to actually enjoy it.,BDSMcommunity,ct1jz68,6,t5_2r9tk

I totally get the feeling of being low when your Dom is low takes a few rounds in the mind to come up with something that can make the situation at hand easier. Now death is different because there is no solution there is only coping with the loss and all the thoughts and fears that comes up with it. That is a hell of a place to be at.You know it will take time and in that time Im sure this roller coaster will run its course up and down for both of you until it levels a bit with life and every day living. You know hell pull through you just dont know when.I do think that he needs you to be you. Nothing else. If that means crying or being positive be you as much as possible because you know each other well. He doesnt need you to change I think that would be just another burden to him. Be you. Strong when you can weak when that happens were humans foremost. Do as you do and some days hell be ok other days he wont. Some days he can take your submission and appreciate it other time he may not be able. Its not you he cant handle its all that death brings forth. Remember that. Dont fake things positive when theyre not some people in grieving have a hard time being around overly positive people too because it becomes too much. Grief takes time and youll be there no matter what because youre HIS sub and he knows that and he loves that.Hes the center of your world and since youre in a  submission if I remember correctly?  this should be the dynamic. I totally get the that you can feel his pain physically because your connection is that and you have enough experience of life to deeply understand it. He feel youre there and supportive you really dont have to do more than that. Do as you do  We all have something that bends us and this may be his. That hes not jumping right back must be a change youre scared about. Totally understand! Im REALLY sensitive to my Dom changing patterns which makes me know when hes not fully ok. I take that as a good quality to have I ask if I can do something extra for him. Just general being close as people to eachother. What to say? I think you do as you should  dont change because he needs you to be you paranoid and all if thats how you get PI would develop sentences that are more communicative not only Itll be ok because in his mind he might not be able to see how thats possible. Say It will be tough and be painful and some days it will be shitty but in time it is possible to come past it because.. insert your own thoughts based on knowing him. Dont say he will because hes strong. Strong people are weak too facing things that bend and break.Now I think youre awesome so you might have done this already Its important though in coping to get the help of tracing thoughts and move them towards a destination to overcome. If you get what I mean?Aside from all this be you. Take one day at a time. In grieving thats all that is possible.Aftercare for both of you extensively if need be.Muah and hugs,BDSMcommunity,ct3xxrz,2,t5_2r9tk

4582997,0,t3_3dsl1i,My domme has an unfortunate sexual history.  Her first sexual experience at far too young an age was not loving consensual or healthy in any way.  Since then she has struggled greatly to enjoy sex.  For her as it is with so many women sex was something that found her while she was looking for something else.  She learned that participating was necessary to keeping whatever boyfriend she had at the time happy but none of the fool boys she hooked up with were ever capable of being selfless enough to focus on anything aside from their own immediate physical pleasure.Being dominant has given her the opportunity to retake control of her sexuality.  It is no longer a chore she needs to complete an obligatory part of being in a relationship that she needs grit her teeth and tolerate.  It is about HER.  She gets exactly what she wants when she wants it and exactly how she likes it.  No more and no less.  Being the person to give her this control thrills me both because I love being under her control and because I love her and I want to heal her wounds as she is helping to heal mine.The healing process has not always been easy but it has been deeply and richly rewarding.,BDSMcommunity,ct8aej4,27,t5_2r9tk

However just like clamping the head of the penis you need to exercise extreme caution  more so than when you clamp your nipples  and go SLOW.  Feel every tiny bit of pressure over at least  seconds while you close the clamp the first few times you do it dont just let it snap tight unchecked.  The slower you go the easier itll be to take the pressure and the safer youll be.Crushing the clit just letting the clamp snap shut on it could cause nerve damage and since the clit is literally just a bundle of nerves...yeah Id avoid that.,BDSMcommunity,ctpkad5,9,t5_2r9tk

Instruct her to stop answering those calls. Is there any reason to answer those calls? Why are you giving all the orders and sensation during sex? My non submissive is always anxious to  give me pleasure. All I need to do is ask her and if I want a little change in sensation I give feedback. Then I lay back and enjoy while she very happily runs the fuck as we say. Tell your sub that you want the worlds best handjob or whatever. Explain to her that you love and trust her enough to give you pleasure. Remember that any act you do as a dominant can be done dominantly.

4895161,0,t3_3hxfro,Howdy.  I think you may be in the wrong spot which you have probably seen from a lot of the comments here.  BDSM is extremely consent focused for many reasons.  One of the chief reasons is that many of us have seen someone abused in this sort of dynamic and are emphatically not okay with it.  Heres my storyWhen I was first experimenting with BDSM I did a number of one off scene type things with people online.  I enjoyed the writing challenge and it was enough for me to learn.  I encountered one person who was really titillating for me and pursued them in the Hey we should totally be longer term writing partners sense.  I later on found out that she very definitely enjoyed the sexual dynamic and we started tending towards more mentally harsh language  a bit of humiliation.  I pulled back at that point and asked to establish a safe word for her.  I should have done that earlier but i was learning back then and didnt really understand what this thing was just that I liked it.Upon trying to establish the word she told me straight up Safe words are for sissies.  This caused me some concern and I emphasized that was absolutely not the case and wanted to understand where she got that idea from.  Then I learned about some rather horrific abuse that was perpetrated under the moniker of BDSM.  I will not participate in something like that and refuse to come even close.  The idea that it could occur is incredibly repugnant to me.  Just typing that story out has me somewhat ashamed of my kink.  So theres my perspective.  Rough sex is fun agree.  This guy seems to like that and might like more agree.  As someone who has seen things like the above before which this community as a whole sees too frequently I read right past your question and right into Wait! I dont want to see this again! It scares me and makes me worried! This isnt BDSM! territory.Do as you will enjoy as you will it seems he might have some dominant characteristics that you would enjoy.  But I wont tell you it feels like safe play to me.  Because it immediately sends me back to that one time when I realized this new thing that I really really really liked could be incredibly abusive psychologically manipulative and wrong at the most basic human levels.  So yeah.  I really want you to get with the program because I react viscerally to this.  Youve seen the advice to communicate etc. etc.  If he knows how he can push you youll both have more fun anyway.  Maybe thats the best argument you would respond to.  ,BDSMcommunity,cubkosn,2,t5_2r9tk

4927004,0,t3_3idzgs,Youve noticed that too eh? I think theres a simple problem these are inexperienced overeager girls in the  range who are being expertly manipulated by usually older men. Like many young ladies they have normal fantasies and believe they cannot have a normal relationship that transitions to kink. Probably because many of them are in their first relationships with similarly inexperienced relatively immature men of their own age.So a man takes interest. He gives her sexy commands. He is confident. He demands dedicated daily interactions. They take this to mean the male is actually interested in their well being. They pour their hearts out to this man who seems to understand them and has all the solutions. FYI so do I but Im not a sexual predator. And these girls being mostly unexperienced in love and relationships throw out caution. They see this as their only true chance for twue domination. And he for his part does nothing to encourage safe and healthy behaviors. That would interfere with his ability to do whatever he wants to a hot young thing.The inexperienced screwups of two  year olds is sadly unsurprising but then again a lot of sex at that age is awful.But arent you a dirty old man with your knee sock fetish and your rather ahem young looking girl?  ,BDSMcommunity,cufl69f,1,t5_2r9tk

As for the timing a few hours by a few hours Im assuming you mean like  hours is a long time for a first ever BDSM scene lol Again slow it down. Make it around an hour or so and make it light and easy to process. If she likes spanking then just do spanking. If she likes forced orgasms then JUST do forced orgasms.

5083211,0,t1_cuydpoh,Forgive this stream of consciousness! Im taking my meds and pondering ... Where is this going? is a scary question even for normal people. And a little over a month might be too soon for him to even KNOW. And LDRs make everything more tricky.You say hes not comfortable communicating presumably you mean outside of the play because hed have to be good at being a DD or you wouldnt be interested so thats where to start getting him more comfortable by talking about things that are NOT as charged. Maybe you could get him talking venting about relationships from the past what has worked and hasnt. Then ask gently to what is his vision for this one.You are not unreasonable BECAUSE good communication is key to make an LDR any R work. However he just might not have the skills right now. If all you can get from him is what youve already got then its your move to decide whether thats enough. You will then get to decide whether to let go of this month youve invested and look for another partner who will meet you halfway.Im guessing that when he says I am overwhelmed by your feelings there is something complex behind it and these are just examples to show the possible variety such as  a My boundaries arent good so when you have feelings I share them without being able to protect myself and that scares me orb Because of past experiences every expression of emotion from my current partner feels like a demand even though it may not be on your side but thats what it feels like on my side and I hate demands and want you to stop bugging me.Try I want to communicate with you outside our dynamic. How and when would be a good way? One positive thing would be if you wanted an inaccessible person so you could work out some of the issues that YOU have had with these kinds of folks in the past ... and this time have a better outcome. Sometimes we are drawn to people that kick off our unresolved issues or folks in AlAnon can pick the ONE alcoholic out of the group and feel drawn to them because it feels right ... Masculine gender roles are absolutely crippling for some people. We tell guys they arent supposed to cry always have to be strong. We punish them for the least infraction of these social rules. And then we want them to get all connecty about relationships. No wonder some of them are angry about it.I have also had really good times with inarticulate distant people. Once I understood that what I was getting was what I was getting and stopped trying to get more from them.tldr If hes not willing to communicate even with you giving him choice of time and space and tools then you have to decide whether you can live with that. ,BDSMcommunity,cuypy1q,5,t5_2r9tk

Its great that you communicated and I could be completely off base but the way that they failed to respect your limit and how they reacted to you makes me suspect they valued their existing relationship more than they valued you.

5292523,0,t3_3nbk5n,Similar experience. Entered into a relationship with a Mistress as a male stype with a thing for crossdressing. Eventually I explored myself and desires more and realized I was more trans. Partner flies the pansexual banner but likes cocks and guys and masculinity. As I grew more fem she was more and more turned off. We had lots of open communication about it. She was totally cool with trans folks and even helped me explore that more just wanted dudes. Eventually we split for other reasons but it was a big deal and a bit of a mindfuck knowing that while youre sexing or whatever youre viewed as less than. As others have said talk talk talk talk and more talk. If hes not open to sharing his thoughts about his sexuality thats... not cool. Partnership yo. Communication is key. You can initiate a conversation several ways. One of my more Msstyle friends have porch talks where they sit down as equals and have a conversation about the relationship since being in a TPE Ms kind of relationship can be... daunting for lack of a better word to initiate this depending on the stylefeel. You could mention some guy you find attractive and see if he shares an interest. Playing it off like thats cool and natural and chill can open him up to a discussion more. I dunno theres lots of good advice here already I just wanted to share something other than my small snippet of a story. ,BDSMcommunity,cvo6jl7,1,t5_2r9tk

5334534,0,t3_3o1qqw,IMHO these things just seem inconsiderate not dominant. Or at the very least everything you described seems as though they are punishments. What sort of aftercare is given after a scene such as one of the above? amp are these things typically limited to a scene for a certain length of time? Furthermore does your sub receive some sort of recognition or reward when they have gracefully tolerated such treatment?Im in a  dynamic He exercises His dominance over me each amp every day even when the sexy BDSM as you described spanking binding etc. doesnt occur daily amp its not boring in the least. Were He to do anyall of what you described without an explanation Id wonder what Id done to warrant such treatment. Were He to do anyall of the above without end Id wonder whywhen Hed become such an asshole. Most BDSM dynamics even degradationhumiliation incorporate a sort of cyclical energy exchange both parties giving amp receiving yours seems one dimensional amp selfish. Its not surprising in the least that subs got bored. Being surrounded by amp involved with inconsiderate selfish people gets tiresome quickly. Edit The sexual harassment scene seems more like degradationhumiliation incorporated into role play. Where hopefully there is a set time limit amp prescene negotiation Id consider this an exception to what I mentioned above. ,BDSMcommunity,cvtjnr0,47,t5_2r9tk

If yourself is awful rds wouldnt be fine with you.A metamour once interrupted my aftercare of a heavy scene with our shared partner to say he was leaving the party in part because he was uncomfortable with how heavy we played. She got up and went to talk with him and they both ended up staying for the rest of the party.He messaged me the next morning telling me that Im a bad top for not doing enough after care and letting her go speak to him. I told him that I make it a rule to never interfere in my other partners relationships and discussions even if that involves interrupting my aftercare.He now goes around telling people Im a dangerous bad top who does aftercare poorly.

But not inviting him to anything seems to be no option for the group because Anna most likely wont come without him.

5363139,0,t3_3ogyzf,I sympathise  unfortunately I have definitely found that the trope of women never responding on dating sites is absolutely true... or at least it is in my experience. I suspect in part its due to the fact a lot of gay women on OKC which Ive found has the best kinkqueerfriendly environment seem to be pretty antibipan women and the majority of bi or curious girls are either seeking vanilla threesomes or experimentation with other bi femme girls. Not that theres anything wrong with any of the above I dont like what I perceive as the biphobia on there sometimes though I can understand why people might react that way but it is frustrating. Personally speaking I straddle some kind of fuzzy boundary between ostensibly female and genderqueer I dont mind being gendered as female but its not really my first choice and Im dominant but I dont really dom in a way that matches the interests of a lot of male subs so I have found it difficult sometimes to make that work. Then again I met my current partner also genderqueer and someone whose kinks line up very well with mine most of the time on OKC so there are certainly nonconforming people out there.My frustration is a bit doubled by the fact I dont have access to a good local community. There are a few events relatively close to me but transport is a problem for me and honestly the community close by doesnt really match my interests too well. That said if you have events you can get to that have given you any modicum of positive experience in the past Id say thats definitely your best bet. Carry on meeting people in the community and see who they introduce you to. Groups on Fetlife might also be useful if you have a better experience on there than I have. Good luck! ,BDSMcommunity,cvx79r4,2,t5_2r9tk

The most effective thing he does is he doesnt let me speak negatively about myself. No one talks that way about my girl. So its not punishment but it makes me stop saying these things.

5429171,0,t1_cw5ltqv,Id say youve got a pretty good understanding.gt where people talking about having the subOr slave as they would say be forced to do this in front of people who were not a part of the scene and children which is why I was curious about this aspect. As others have said that is extreme fantasy not reality.Like youve come to know that aspect is extreme fantasy. The most a majority of couples will do is make discreet comments to one another around people outside of the scene amp its just for shits and giggles. For instance say my SO amp I are having a night out with our friends he tells me to refill his drink. I could say right away sir with a big ol smirk on my face. Hell catch it but everybody else wont at the most theyll just think im being playful. At the end of the day sex is meant to be a fun amp enjoyable experience. Theres this stigma surrounding BDSM that were really extreme amp serious that were freaks. Everybody has their own things theyre into in the bedroom.

Weve had this kind of onesided open relationship since we started dating so nothing about this was really challenging.  The worst I can think of right now is that his main group of friendsbuddies kind of fell apart so he doesnt have a whole lot of people to hang out with anymore.  It was nice when I could schedule my play dates to when he would be busy with friends.  And now Im still going out to do kinky stuff and hes at home more in front of the TV.

If you are into a cute aesthetic Kittens Playpen has a TON of really fun options to play around with. I love my hello kitty one and my sub loved her pink princess one. Their TAT can be a bit long for non premade collars but for most other things they come quick. If you are going to use it just for play I dont see anything wrong with stopping by your local pet store. Just make sure you measure your partners neck.

5835285,0,t1_cxk3ypr,They do and people telling you Well you just need to suck it up and get out there! really just pisses you off more.While I wont tell you that I can tell you what worked for me. First I got a gym membership. Stay away from the free weights and even the weight machines unless you are already comfortable with them. Camp out on an excise bike an elliptical or a treadmill. Pick a pace that you can maintain for about  or  minutes. Now do that every other day. Doesnt matter what time you do it as long as you arent the only one in the gym. Your goal is not to loose weight or get fit though those are fringe benefits which I think you should take advantage of. Your sole goal is to make eye contact with someone and nod and smile at them. The gym is perfect for practicing this. Everyone is busy everyone has headphones on and most of all no one actually wants to talk to you. Even if they do you have a great excuse to let the conversation wind down and or kill it at any given moment because youre So out of breath.After a month or two of this youll be ready for step two. Small talk with cashiers. You arent allowed to buy things online anymore you must go to a store for all your shopping. No drive through foodcoffee either. You go into the store. Now youre going to use that eye contact practice you will look the teller straight in the eye smile if possible and ask them how their day is going. You will come up with one or two friendly responses to whatever they say then you will walk away. Again you can end the conversation whenever you want so zero pressure. These people are all strangers who you are unlikely to see again. As a general rule they are not going to start cussing you out and making fun of your hair. Again practice this for a couple months. Every time you have a social interaction like this low pressure safe because you can end it whenever you want and without anyone screaming obscenities at your you will get a little more confident. This is a  to  month process and must be done with intent. Meanwhile you have homework. You need to get on all and pick one random nonclick bait storyarticletoday I learned. Read it. Now while youre brushing your teeth look yourself in the eye and try to recite in your head to start with everything you can remember about the article and at least  questions about what you read. This is awkward as hell. Keeping eye contact with yourself that long will wig you out a bit. No worries this is a long game. After a while you need to start talking out loud to yourself in the mirror. Theres no one around. You have a couple goals here. One looking at yourself and getting more comfortable with who you are and what you look like. Two learning some hopefully interesting conversational topics that dont involve the words I Meor Mine. Three practice coming up with intelligent questions on the fly to the topic at hand. The secret to easy conversation is to actively listen to the person you are talking to and then ask them a question about what they just said. Let them do all the heavy lifting. Most people LOVE to talk give them the slightest justification and minutes can go by without your having to say anything possibly embarrassing.The last step was to find a group that meets simi regularly for me it was once a month that is based on a hobby I am good at and enjoy. For me it was a kink class but it doesnt have to be anything to do with that. The second year in to class I met the girl Im now madly in love with. Were both still kinda social recluses. But were working on it and its easier when you have a partner in crime. ,BDSMcommunity,cxkj6rb,3,t5_2r9tk

There is a lot of kink porn as a sort of art form  artistically portrayed bottoms that tend to convey a lot of emotion and the bottoms spirit. There is a complete lack of that on the male side of things though which is my beef.Edit I think the easiest way to convey my message is to replace strength with perhaps spirit or character.,BDSMcommunity,cy6giln,1,t5_2r9tk

6013570,0,t3_3xrpix,Okay this is something I have to chime in about having had secondhand experience as a confidante of someone who pursued and achieved this in the s.First though Ill give you the same advice that I give trans people when their transition is intertwined with a kink relationship  largely because what youre talking about is similar in that its not merely a body modification its a life change it is something that can result in a lack of desire after all.  Its a decision that needs to be made independent of any power dynamics in your relationship.  If you want to add a power exchange or force dynamic to it afterward thats fine but its something youd need to take at your initiative something that considers your needs something you would be prepared to carry yourself through even if you didnt have help and something youre prepared to live with if one day that relationship and power dynamic were gone.  Maybe it is maybe it isnt but its a question you need to answer for yourself.That said when my friend pursued this it was not trans related but rather something she did of her own interest she was unpartnered at the time more from an interest in denial.  I dont remember the name of the practitioner offhand and will have to look it up but its possible that she may no longer be around andor practicing.  It is however highly illegal.  This is something that has been practiced coercively andor nonconsensually on women and girls in a few cultures and there are justifiable laws banning it which are pretty aggressively enforced.  Culturallydriven FGM female genital mutilation  sometimes called circumcision but its only like male circumcision if the latter involved removing the penis also often ends up with tissue damage health repercussions and hygienic issues.  If you decide to proceed youre best to do so with someone in community and with whom you build up trust over a length of time beforehand for their sake as well as yours.  They should be both kinkaware and have some medical training.  My friends practitioner was a respected person within the body modification community and had excellent references.Im sad to say that she passed away about ten years later so Im not able to ask her things directly.  However we did talk considerably about this before and afterward.  It didnt happen for a few years but she did come to regret her decision... though not completely.  Part of the regret was simply that the enchantment that accompanied the wish to lose it didnt remain after it was gone.  She developed depression and while it wasnt entirely as a result of this she wasnt previously inclined to depression so I do believe it was a factor.I wont tell you not to pursue this.  I will tell you to take your time and to take intermediate steps.  Jumping straight into this is sort of like learning to swim by jumping into the ocean without a floatation device.  Fortunately there are intermediate steps that can be taken such as piercedon shields or belts.  From your doms perspective this should also be a wise approach as well.  We know that BDSM isnt automatically abuse but it can blur the lines.  If youre going to grey this particular line its prudent to take whatever time and intermediate steps you both need to be fully informed.  From his standpoint the enchantment loss effect I described earlier can affect doms and subs alike.  Waiting will give you both time to taste what the consequences will be and see if the life change will also negatively affect your wellbeing and temperament.  You can always proceed later if thats what you both still decide you want to do.,BDSMcommunity,cy7wny6,7,t5_2r9tk

6028597,0,t3_3y1naq,Im a switch and have noticed the more I dom the harder it is to get into subspace. It takes longer and sometimes I feel mentally resistant even though I love it. If Im not in subspace properly taking punishments well is extremely difficult. I just get resentful and bratty. Similarly my sub can enjoy domming and when I let him dom hes very hard to dom later. Two things have worked for us so far. One sometimes we put time outs in between switching. We let enough time pass half a day to a day for us where we hang out vanilla. Eventually the domming energy goes away. Alternatively when we were both regularly switching one of us would dom for a week two days off then the other doms. You start off slow at the beginning of a week and then by day  can introduce stuff that may warrant punishments. Two even though Im a switch Im really the Dom in our relationship right now. When my sub doms me he follows my rules. Even as a Dom he cant take his panties off without my permission he can never orgasm on or in me and he must ask permission to have sex with me. Even when Im subbing Im still in control. That way when he switches back to subbing its a lot easier as he never really left it. In our dynamic him domming is service and more about mutual pleasure. The training punishments and intense pushing are left to me domming him because thats our main dynamic. We are in it the most and can actually make ground in it. We mostly do this second option because Im a switch and he heavily leans to subbing but if we were both really switchy Id focus on the first one. YMMV.,BDSMcommunity,cy9vaoa,5,t5_2r9tk

Wont happen again.Anyways!Lets start with the basics There is a community created BDSM FAQ over here that might answer some of your questions but should be a good read regardless.Now onto my spielCommunication. This should come WAY before anything else be it educational or physical. You two need to talk to each other and have an open and HONEST dialog about what you like dislike want are curious about refuse to try ect. If either party involved isnt honest then youre risking not only hurt feelings but possible harm done to the other. Keep this communication thing going though. It shouldnt just be a one time thing it needs to continue as you grow in your relationship as well as grow in your BDSM knowledge base.Well get back to the communication thing in a bit.Next step!Education! Before you throw a lasso around your SO and string them up from the rafters its a REALLY good idea to learn what in the hell youre trying to do and make sure it is physically mentally and emotionally safe for all parties involved. To get to this there are a number of books that you can read my personal suggestion for someone new is Screw the Roses Send me the Thorns. If it has to be in book form try that one. If youre more the type that likes to read on the intrawebs you should really check out  www.fetlife.com as a starting place. It is not a meatmarket but more of a social outlet for kinksters. A place to learn about BDSM as well as find your local scene.Please note I do NOT suggest anything by Wiseman for newbies. He is very pretentious and elitist in not only the subjects he writes about but also in his approach to the entire scene. I am not saying he doesnt have some good ideas and articles merely that his SHOULD NOT be the first introduction someone has to the BDSM world.Throughout this education phase you should be sharing and talking with your SO about what both of you are learning. Share what gets you hot what gets him hot what squicks either of you out what questions you are working on. In short share EVERYTHING that youre finding!Next step?Get out there! I am a HUGE proponent of becoming a part of your local scene. Meeting those that can help and support you in your journey cannot be overstated. Not only will these people make you feel like less of an outlier sexually speaking they are a font of information in your travels. Looking for a local kink shop? Theyll know. Looking for where to get the right rope? Theyll know. Looking for someone to teach you how to rig? Theyll know. Looking to learn about fire play? Theyll know. Looking. . . well you get the point.So now what?Now? Now you need to remember that regardless of all the rules and the right way and wrong way the ENTIRE PURPOSE of BDSM is to have fun. Thats right. It may well be a lifestyle for some and a minor kink for others but if you arent having fun shocking your SO with a cattle prod then why in the hell are you doing it?! So make sure you and your partner are having fun!Keep your mind open and stay safe!DS,BDSMcommunity,cyum5y3,3,t5_2r9tk

Tell people youre brand new and ask if theyre willing to talk about stuff answer questions in the social area. Leave people in aftercare alone to recover. Most will be happy to answer any questions. Tell someone you liked their scene ask how they learned how long theyve been doing kink. The answers might surprise you.          Edit find out and be able to recognize the hosts. If anybody makes you feel uncomfortable or wont leave you alone go to them asap. Attract attention make noise indignant excuse me? etc to anybody behaving inappropriately or nonconsensually. Violators depend on you being too unsure or scared to say something. And staying quiet and not making noise. This should be a rare thing but its best to know since theyll go for newbies.

She has that with her husband now and is much happier as a result. In my case a big part of it is just that I dont care anymore.

6352620,0,t1_czboxwa,gtI want to train you to accept pain even when youre cryingI think it was you who posted the thread a while back about your dom saying he wants to train you to accept pain to the point of crying. I remember you saying that its not necessarily a limit of yours but that him saying that made you go cold..I dont want to let you down but.. if you dont WANT to do it you shouldnt push yourself to do it. It will only be enduring pain physical and emotional with no gain to yourself. If youre not into it yourself you shouldnt do it just to please him. That will lead to you feeling hurt everyday and developing serious resentment towards him. gtWhy should I do that? Why should I work on ramping up my pain tolerance? Why should I be trained to endure more and more horrible things just cause he likes doing them? If its just to work up to the implements hes turned on by using why not just give me some Oxycontin and go nuts? I dont understand what I am meant to be getting out of it unless its just the satisfaction of knowing Im tougher than I was or something. I dont understand what he wants from me why he wants me to learn to accept more and more pain how is that anything other than a purely selfish desire?If he doesnt care about YOU your desires your fears and doubts your limits your EVERYTHING.. then you shouldnt do it at all. There is no reason if you dont have a genuine feeling inside YOU that you want to do it. If youre not getting anything out of it then it IS a selfish desire on his part. If hes not considering your emotions feelings and safety then he IS being selfish. If you dont want to up your pain tolerance and you dont enjoy pain and you feel hesitant you dont have to do it. You never have to do anything you dont want to do. gtfrom the minute he said I want to train you to accept pain even when youre crying I have felt completely confused like this person I thought was nice is really a monsterDid you talk to him about that? And how that made you feel? What did he say? How did he treat you? If he told you to get over it and said tolerating pain is what subs do thats bad news. Hes not a dom hes an abuser. If he apologized and reassured you and has been genuinely trying to do good by you and put your wellbeing before his desires... then there might be hope. Trust your instincts if you feel like he is not who you thought he was thats probably true. It sucks but MOST doms arent really doms they are calling themselves doms just to get away with whatever they want. They are abusers hiding behind a dom label. gt how its meant to bring us closer instead of teaching me to fear him more and more?Its only meant to bring you closer if YOU WANT to up your pain tolerance. If you want to do it for both of you. Picture  situations.. One in which youve spent a LOT of time getting to know your dom and hes spent equally as much getting to know you. Everyday every second youre communicating negotiating being honest about everything.. and he accepts all your thoughts feelings doubts and fears without rejection or guilting you. You listen to each other and respect each other. You see him putting your wellbeing desires and health and safety before his own desireskinks. He cares about you more than his own pleasure. When you make a mistake he treats you fairly. He never yells abandons you or guilts you into things. You work on your dynamic together. When you have a bad scene you talk to each other and work through it. He respects your safewords leads you slowly into new territories of kink and always gives aftercare. He treats you like a HUMAN BEING not just a toy. That leads to trust and closeness... To intimacy. Thats a bond. Because of how much trust and respect youve developed for him.. you crave to improve yourself for him. To show that you want to do your best for him. You tell him I want to be a better sub for you will you help me up my pain tolerance? He says yes of course but we will go slowly and find your limits. You WANT to push yourself through it because you feel like you can trust him. You want to be the best you can be for him. The next situation.. is the opposite. Maybe hes not as communicative or you feel guilted into things. Maybe he doesnt negotiate as much. Maybe he doesnt go very slow or consider your feelings in every situation. Maybe he pressures you to be a perfect traditional sub. Maybe he cares about what he wants more than what you want or are okay with. You dont develop respect for him because you feel like youre walking on eggshells or you feel too much pressure to be perfect. You dont feel a desire to push yourself for him because he hasnt earned your trust. He says I want you to be like how I think a sub should be Im going to train you to accept pain and crying. You express concern over this.. and he tosses it aside. Your feelings are being invalidated like they dont matter. So you dont want to push yourself for him. There is no reason to there is no trust there is no respect. Those were hypothetical and I wasnt trying to imply that I fully understand your situation. What I wrote probably isnt what happened since I dont know what happened. But the point of those  situations is so you can see the difference in wanting to push yourself for someone solely for them because you trust and respect them so much because you know they will always put YOU before their pleasure. And the opposite of that... just being pushed and shoved into doing something coercion out of guilt. And how that doesnt lead you to wanting to push yourself for a dom. Pushing yourself for him will not benefit either of you unless YOU WANT TO DO IT. If you dont want to do it.. pushing yourself for him and upping your pain tolerance and crying during scenes.. that wont be good for either of you especially you. That is dangerously close to abuse and coercion. If youre just going through it because you feel like you HAVE to.. not because you genuinely want to. So it wont benefit you in any way unless he is a good dom.. and its not meant to. You WILL only learn to fear him more and more if you dont want to do things and he pushes you to do them. The bonding the bringing you closer together doesnt come from the ACT of engaging in pain play it comes from your relationship.. the stuff OUTSIDE of scenes and sex. It comes from him accepting you making decisions always in your best interest taking care of you listening to you encouraging you to be honest.Sorry I wrote a wall of text.. it just seems like your situation is quite rough. lt many hugsBtw playing with soft limits is something I would never even consider getting into with someone unless Id been with them for many years had tons of scenes with them knew them extremely well and they knew me equally as well.. Someone I trusted with my life. Soft limits are dangerous to mess with because they are so close to hard limits. Its not something I would do if I was inexperienced or if I was starting a relatively new relationship with someone. I wouldnt expect my dom to play with my soft limits unless he discussed it with me first. ,BDSMcommunity,czbq0o4,3,t5_2r9tk

6374726,0,t3_42ymqg,By now you should know what she likes both in and outside the bedroom. Movies music food etc... Your rewards dont necessarily have to be sexual especially if shes a little in addition to being a sub. Take her to a show or to dinner or pay for a manipedispa treatment thingy.Some options that are a bit sexual but not entirely are massages foot rubs baths as in bathe her clothing items. I realize that talking to her about this might bring up unwanted feelings of inadequacy due to her difficulties orgasming so dont just ask What can I give you as a reward other than orgasms? but you should talk to her about her desires while framing it in an entirely positive manner. E.g. What do you enjoy most of the things I do tofor you? or What are your top  memories of out time together?. You should be able to tally up ideas pretty quickly. And try to keep a list so you dont forget them all and you can mix them them up frequently.Good luck!,BDSMcommunity,cze8ivr,5,t5_2r9tk

Chains and locks where you both have access to the others restraint key would work well. If you dont already have them double locking handcuffs and leg shackles are fast and easy to use for play. I picked up a set of both for  bucks or so on Amazon. The only problem you run into there is I believe theyre all keyed alike. But if you get creative with positioning you can probably manage something. Its all about creativity!Idea off the top of my head. You could use handcuffs or the restraint of your choosing and chain it to an anchor point with a lock. Use two differently keyed locks for each of you and the other gets the key.Apologies for rambling a bit.,BDSMcommunity,czpdqts,6,t5_2r9tk

6512051,0,t3_44tyha,I think one of the best ways is to go to IRL events. People involved in the community tend to watch out for each other. And reputation tends to be important so people take it seriously. Its not foolproof but it helps to identify some great trustworthy candidates.I think peoples red flags and what they want vary. But I think there are few general guidelines that can be helpful in finding a quality trustworthy Dom.One big red flag online for me are when people try to dom me right away or before we have established a rapport. Being pushy in the beginning ignoring my needs ignoring limits rushing things ignoring safety guides or not taking no immediately are all red flags and likely dealbreaker for me.Focusing on sex right away or pushing sex in the beginning is a red flag to me. Talking badly about expartners especially frequently or aggressively is a red flag.A lack of a communication or inconsistent details can be potential red flags. It depends on what the context is.You can always ask for references and talk to prior subs.And I think trusting your gut is important. If it feels weird then it might be weird.

6569805,0,t3_45k409,He thinks he may be more subby but I swear he only thinks this as if he has no choice because of his penis size.I would advise caution with this sort of logic. The first time I explored bdsm with a now exgirlfriend she laughed at the notion that I thought I was submissive. I have a leadership role at work and have been said to have a take charge attitude so i understood why she may think that. But when I expressed my honest and most vulnerable side it was extremely hurtful that she thought I was wrong about it and i m not sure she ever realized just how bad it was for me. It really isnt easy for men to admit they have a submissive side since society seems to frown upon it. In the end I tried to hide my disappointment and I tried to be a dom for her but my heart was never in it. It was a huge factor in the relationship ending but also repressed me further and it was years before I was able to try again. Now a days I identify as a switch and have come to love being dominant but I dont think I ever would have gotten there if I hadnt been given the chance to express my submissive side first.I see you have said you are not trying to mold him and that you would be ok if he turned out to be submissive and that is a great.

Sure that can be hashed out with a good old power struggle but sometimes one of us doesnt really want to fight to be the sub so we have a system of necklaces and rings. The quick and dirty of it is if he is wearing his ring hes feeling submissive and if not he is either dominant or hasnt made up his mind I have a similar ring with the same concept. We havent figured out anything to symbolize ownership of each other though we both keep the keys to the locks for the collars and handcuffs on us at all times for safety reasons.Apparently I do everything everyone else already suggested haha dont mind me Ill show myself out.,BDSMcommunity,czzaniz,9,t5_2r9tk

6669603,0,t3_46zgv7,Cue standard Intro to Kink post!Lets start at the very beginning. A very good place to start. . . dammit! Slipped into show tunes. Wont happen again.Anyways!Lets start with the basics There is a community created BDSM FAQ over here that might answer some of your questions but should be a good read regardless.Now onto my spielCommunication. This should come WAY before anything else be it educational or physical. You two need to talk to each other and have an open and HONEST dialog about what you like dislike want are curious about refuse to try ect. If either party involved isnt honest then youre risking not only hurt feelings but possible harm done to the other. Keep this communication thing going though. It shouldnt just be a one time thing it needs to continue as you grow in your relationship as well as grow in your BDSM knowledge base.Well get back to the communication thing in a bit.Next step!Education! Before you throw a lasso around your SO and string them up from the rafters its a REALLY good idea to learn what in the hell youre trying to do and make sure it is physically mentally and emotionally safe for all parties involved. To get to this there are a number of books that you can read my personal suggestion for someone new is Screw the Roses Send me the Thorns. If it has to be in book form try that one. If youre more the type that likes to read on the intrawebs you should really check out  www.fetlife.com as a starting place. It is not a meatmarket but more of a social outlet for kinksters. A place to learn about BDSM as well as find your local scene.Please note I do NOT suggest anything by Wiseman for newbies. He is very pretentious and elitist in not only the subjects he writes about but also in his approach to the entire scene. I am not saying he doesnt have some good ideas and articles merely that his SHOULD NOT be the first introduction someone has to the BDSM world.Throughout this education phase you should be sharing and talking with your SO about what both of you are learning. Share what gets you hot what gets him hot what squicks either of you out what questions you are working on. In short share EVERYTHING that youre finding!Next step?Get out there! I am a HUGE proponent of becoming a part of your local scene. Meeting those that can help and support you in your journey cannot be overstated. Not only will these people make you feel like less of an outlier sexually speaking they are a font of information in your travels. Looking for a local kink shop? Theyll know. Looking for where to get the right rope? Theyll know. Looking for someone to teach you how to rig? Theyll know. Looking to learn about fire play? Theyll know. Looking. . . well you get the point.So now what?Now? Now you need to remember that regardless of all the rules and the right way and wrong way the ENTIRE PURPOSE of BDSM is to have fun. Thats right. It may well be a lifestyle for some and a minor kink for others but if you arent having fun shocking your SO with a cattle prod then why in the hell are you doing it?! So make sure you and your partner are having fun!Keep your mind open and stay safe!DS,BDSMcommunity,d09703g,4,t5_2r9tk

Just as the presenter can say whatever he wants others can think hes wrong to say it and express that to him.  Freedom of speech works both ways.I dont think its unreasonable to ask a person who puts on presentations for groups of people to be respectful of their audience when its already been shown that members of that audience do feel disrespected.

6686217,0,t1_d0at0do,I think there are a lot of viable answers to that question. I suspect that a big reason why the term punishment is used casually is that in pop culture porn whatever its just what you say to get spanked. I bet its also a way to circumvent social standards that say hitting is wrong so saying youve been bad and need to be punished is a way of signifying that spanking isnt hitting and therefore isnt wrong. Culturally spanking punishments are an exception to the nohitting rule so asking for punishment legitimizes the practice for both parties.But yeah I dont ask for punishmentasexcuse either. My husband and I have set up a few rules that if broken would result in actual punishment so in a sense I asked for that. Weve also talked about how I felt than a sort of initiation punishment was something he should do. For the past several years  the intense young children years  I have been pretty emotionally unavailable to him and definitely physically unavailable. It is what it is and were not assigning blame for how that dynamic came about but it is something I feel guilty about. Punishment would help to assuage that guilt. Were still experimenting with where all of our limits and likes are so were not ready to do that sort of heavy scene yet but I expect it will happen and be cathartic for both of us. But it still all comes down to expressions of control and possession. It is his and only his prerogative.,BDSMcommunity,d0awvwg,1,t5_2r9tk

6718895,0,t3_47ng5i,This is quickly becoming my default copyandpaste whenever someone asks about getting started with rope bondage. In this case also look at the last time I saw this question asked there are plenty of other good answers there.TLDR Be safe first. Handson classes are the best way to learn to be as safe as possible but there are several excellent resources available as well.Looking for local groups on FetLife is one of the best things you can do especially for something like rope where there is a strong element of risk. In almost any midsized city and up there will be a local rope community teaching classes organizing munches public social gatherings skillshares and the like. Done wrong you can cause permanent nerve damage or even death. Dont just rush in without learning the basics of how to do it safely. Along those lines Crash Restraint and Remedial Ropes both have excellent resources on how to have a lot of safe fun with rope bondage.For the basics you can go a long way with some simple single and doublecolumn ties. With a singlecolumn and a half hitch to a bedpost you can easily have a lot of fun. My personal favorite is the Somerville Bowline because its fast easy to tie and it wont cinch tight after being tied unlike many other methods. Its also the first step in making this great wrists behind head tie Topologist the guy in the video was teaching this recently actually and I got to see firsthand how quickly a number of novices picked it up. Easy fast built from a few basic reusable techniques looks great lots of utility and a bunch of fun ways to expand on it say going down between the crotch before starting the wraps and tying it off in the front rather than the back so that trying to pull your arms forward serves a dual purpose. Twisted Monk and Two Knotty Boys who also have several wellrespected books have some very good video tutorials available for free online as well. They get many recommendations but I find Two Knotty Boys to be a bit too focused on aesthetics and decorative ties.But you want to get some books instead? The Society of Janus has an excellent book list to get you started with a wide variety of BDSM topics. They cover a lot of the standard recommendations Midoris The Seductive Art of Japanese Bondage Jay Wisemans Erotic Bondage Handbook and Lee Harringtons Shibari You Can Use.  What they dont list however but I would suggest above those titles is Douglas Kents Complete Shibari. Start with Volume  Land Suspension is an advanced topic and something that not only requires strong floor skills but should really be learned handson from someone experienced. Its quirky and has some odd choices I would like far more text personally and his single column tie though popular and often taught will cinch under tension but it has excellent illustrations and does one thing that most other books ignore it teaches you in a buildingblock approach where basic ties are shown and then used to create a variety of more complex ones. This shows you how to start developing on your own rather than locking you into just repeating what youve been shown and makes it easier to learn since its not just rote memorization. It also makes learning new things simpler since you understand the concepts at play and can then focus on how theyre combined and the details to making them work well together.As for rope itself you said you already had some but its never a bad time to learn more about whats out there and why people use it. Japanese silk from major sex toy companies is just cheap cotton rope dyed in various colors avoid black rope when starting even though it can look great it makes it hard to see knots. Especially buying from Spencers or most sex shops youll be overpaying badly for short lengths of cheap rope. My girlfriend were both rope tops has a  spool she bought recently from Amazon for about  and while its OK its not great. Stretchy squishy... it holds and feels better than nylon but thats about it. You could probably buy something cheaper or equivalent at the hardware store. I personally started with nylon and I dislike it quite a bit but its another cheap starter option. In this case though we both moved on to hemp within a few months after having more time and experience with natural fiber rope and realizing that wed be getting plenty of use out of it.If you want to get inexpensive rope from the hardware store check that it doesnt have a core made from another fabric. Cotton clothesline often has a tough plastic core and should be avoided. Many braided nylon ropes have a thin wadded layer inside as well. Try to check it out first if possible or look around for solid nylon braid rather than just nylon braid. Twisted nylon will work and wont have a core but it comes apart too easily and isnt ideal.Ive been happy with the hemp from Karma Rope personally. Its a good inexpensive option pay what you want and their hemp requires minimal finishing. They also sell jute but I have no personal experience with it. People have stated good things about the jute from MyNawashi however and if you want another inexpensive option theyre worth looking into.Youll be paying roughly twenty cents a foot from either of them and approximately the same price at the hardware store for cotton or nylon rope. Id say go with an inexpensive natural fiber vendor to start with and skip the cheap beginner rope step.If you want to pay more Twisted Monk is very popular for finished hemp rope although Im partial to DeGiotto Maui Kink Mco Jute very popular for jute rope Douglas Kent Rope by bondage author Douglas Kent Jugoya respected Japanese rope top Arisue Gos shop Knot Normal sometimes it seems like a new shop selling good quality bondage rope opens up every day. For these shops you can expect to pay closer to foot or slightly higher but youll have very nice fully conditioned rope.As for length and thickness a lot of that is going to be personal preference. Topologist has some good advice on rope sizes here It says just about everything that I would although he recommends a slightly more complete kit. For beginning Id suggest going with about  long ropes and  short ropes roughly half the length of the long ropes. Im currently using m and m lengths of mm hemp.,BDSMcommunity,d0eaiwg,7,t5_2r9tk

6746772,0,t3_484djm,What type of relationship that youre in doesnt change anything. There will be emotional connections some unexpected dependencies and a built up level of trust. When a breakup happens to any of these relationships how you deal with it is always similar.Personally I tend to curl up with my cat and binge watch something on Netflix. Go to work put on your best face and then come home and do it again. In a couple of weeks everything will feel less intense and you can start putting your life back together but dont skip the grieving period or itll force itself into your life at another time possibly in concert with some other tragedy and itll be twice as hard to deal with.So get some hot chocolate and find a relaxing position.And remember House of Cards season  starts in a few days.,BDSMcommunity,d0h68d0,5,t5_2r9tk

6783223,0,t3_48nikl,Unsolicited advice OK my personal opinion reading this is that you should take yourself off for a week without him and seriously question why you should be in this relationship.  OK on to the butt stuff.Your anus is a tiny little brain all of its own.  It can feel pain and it can feel pleasure but thats all it knows.  It does not see it does not hear it does not communicate with its owner at all you I mean not anyone else.  All it can do is guess what the hell is going on at any given moment and do what it thinks best.So when things  fingers dicks trees  start poking at it it responds by clamping down just in case things are bad out there.  Think for a moment of a poor hungry abused kitten trapped in a corner.  How do you make friends with it?  Unremitting love and patience.  Your anus needs to learn that no matter what happens the sensations its feeling are pleasure not pain.  And if you want your anus to be railed hard thats a lot of teaching you have to do.Lets say your aim is to have your helpless little bottom fucked mercilessly one year from now.  Thats  weeks.  Knock off eight weeks for illness holidays out of town folks staying over and all the rest of it.  You might manage twice a week if youre disciplined about it.Thats about  sessions of progressive training.  Id suggest that the first quarter do not involve anything being put inside you just gentle working up to firm external stimulation.  I suggest that the first few dont even involve your ass getting touched you and your ass need to learn to feel safe just bending over in front of him.  You could do all this on your own but going back to my starting point if hes not willing to work with you he doesnt respect you.,BDSMcommunity,d0l5wz9,6,t5_2r9tk
6793634,0,t1_d0mbuhs,Lol  the implication that people who engage in nonsexual kink are mentally unstableI engage in nonsexual kink because... I like nonsexual kink. I enjoy pain and power exchange in and of themselves with or without sex and I love the connection I feel with my play partners experiencing that connection is usually my primary goal when playing and I dont need sex for that. I often find certain kinky activities to be more intimate than sex actually.Of course I want and enjoy sex too but quite frankly there are so many things out there that you can do to enjoy and connect with someone other than fuck them. Sex is one option but its far from being the only option.Its totally cool if you are only interested in sexual kink. Lots of people are. Its hardly abnormal to also enjoy nonsexual kink though.,BDSMcommunity,d0mcjho,7,t5_2r9tk

I enjoyed being hit and spanked and tied up before I even knew it was a thing age  or so.I just didnt have the internet to exploreunderstand it so I probably did a lot more stupid and dangerous stuff than some of the kids these days.  Theres a whole world of information out there on how to do it right so if a kid is going to be sexually active...why not let them learn about it?And yes I understand the disgust behind the whole Im a  year old master.  Its laughable.  But honestly Ive met  year olds that act like  year olds and Ive met  year olds that are wise beyond their years.  We were all kids once too  and thought we knew everything.

It doesnt have to be some surprise. Once thats established you can start to think of some variations of what you both talked about. And its ok to giggle if you say something and it turns hilarious.

Poly has its own hierarchy which may go counter to Ds rules as well  so be sure that any poly partners ESPECIALLY if theyre more vanilla are involved as well and understand the dynamic.IMHO best option would be a single owner however  or at least a primary who can be the mediator  rule setter  whatever.

We checked in a lot with each other and her throughout the experience and a good time was had by all.Also aftercare. Our friend stayed over after I slept in the middle and bf cuddled me all night while I cuddled her. When she left in the morning he jumped me and couldnt stop talking about how sexy I was.

7301089,0,t3_4fa7nh,Well first of all you need to stand up for yourself.gt A person telling me who I should speak toassociate with what to wear ordering my food for me without asking what I wanted ordering me around speaking to me in a degrading and inappropriate manner with the intention of humiliation.If you know people who actually do these things to you theyre assholes and you shouldnt take that kind of garbage. I myself am a sub and when physically being a sub I love being taken control of and used totally at their whim. However what youre describing is manipulation not domination. Its important you separate those  things. There are few things that make me physically enraged and manipulation is one of the biggest things.gt they dominate me because I dont put out the boundaries that I should beNo No No NoTheyre not dominating you because you dont put up a defensive front theyre manipulating you and being assholes because they know you wont say no.I used to never be able to say no. I didnt want to disappoint anyone or burn any bridges. Then eventually I found out that the girl I was seeing was only dating me to try to get to my friend. So when he told me the situation I realized what and why it had happened. I found the easiest way to break my silence wasnt to calmly say No but instead standing up and shouting No Go fuck yourself and walking away.TLDR theyre not dominating you because they know you like it theyre being manipulative assholes because youll sit and take it. Stand up for yourself get angry tell them off and then find a person to dominate you who actually cares about you as a human being. You deserve that we all do.,BDSMcommunity,d2831j9,2,t5_2r9tk

7308566,0,t3_4fhd1z,That was a lot to read and you skip all over the place so much it was hard to follow as well. Maybe because I am not a native English speaker but damn.For the first point there are as many different ways to do  honorifics or anything BDSM relation wise.. as there are people doing it.Look at BDSM as your own personal all you can eat buffet and only fill your plate with things you know you will enjoy. As for the Daddy honorific that doesnt have to be from a DDlg dynamic.. but just the word that fits the person who helps you grow keeps you safe and sets the rules yeah.. it is that simpleIf you wish to explain to your partner why punishment is important.. Because getting punished means you can let it go and not do it to yourself. a punishment needs to be as quickly after the infraction as possible. However a punishment does not need to be physical and should never be something that could be enjoyed.What works for me personally.. is to look her in the eyes and just tell her your actions are disappointing to me trust me.. thats punishment.The point of when I punish is that once I have done so.. it is done over forgotten.. she is not allowed to kick herself mentally.As for your own statement.gt Which pretty much means I normally do whatever I want to do and the people in my life are happy to let me do so.You should try to.. defer.Really you can change this.. dont pick what movie you want to watch dont pick what you will have for dinner.. and ask him if he would.and let it grow from there.,BDSMcommunity,d28xn3g,4,t5_2r9tk
7309624,0,t3_4fhdrm,Theres more than one way to get to a successful BDSM relationship and theres no one twue way but the following is a mechanism that I know worksThis isnt the time to be coy or use euphemisms.Since youre already sexually intimate you can certainly be adult and open enough to tell each other how youre interested in exploring BDSM together. Just go for it with Id like to try x. What do you think? and go from there. Shes entitled to have her Limits  you could ideally complete  together to see where your interests overlap and to trigger further conversations.In one sense BDSM is not rocketscience  its just the minimum of the bullet points below. Of course like all relationships the devil is in the details and you fix that by open honest frank conversations. . Both of you should do your research  starting with all of rBDSMfaq and the reading list found there. . Discuss fantasieshopesneedsdesires. . Agree mutual Soft and Hard Limits. . Agree Safewords  not just Red but YellowOrange as well so that a scene does not get killed dead by Red. If youre afraid she will be too zonedout to communicate withdrawal of consent then add Green as well so that you know to stop immediately if you dont hear it when you ask her Colour? . Agree what Aftercare you both might need  and dont forget to implement it later after each scene. . Go play with an experimental mindset with you as the Dom picking activities not outside your joint Limits. . Dont forget that Aftercare now! . Review. Once youre both back in the room ask and talk about what worked and what didnt. Reveiw. Never stop communicating. Never bottle anything up. . Rinse and repeat.Tell her show her this process. Insist that both of you follow that process being fully open about your wishes feelings and responses to scenes. This alone will ease your nerves.,BDSMcommunity,d291z00,6,t5_2r9tk
7334155,0,t3_4ftkza,Most couples will try it out. Theyll do some light bondage a bit of spanking some rough sex a blindfold and probably some sensation play of various types e.g. ice feathers etc.. The key difference is that most people wont make this a major part of their sex life. It will likely remain an occasional and very mild thing. They wont buy much in the way of equipment they wont seek to learn more and they definitely wont be looking to take part in the wider community or show up to play parties. Most probably wont even really think of it as BDSM to any large degree. Just that generic sort of spicing things up. The type with a pair of fuzzy handcuffs used once and then left ignored in the back of a nightstand.Even among the people who do get more into it many still wont take it any further than their own bedrooms. The idea of joining a sexpositive community is just a little bit too far for many people and if theyre primarily doing it with a single partner they might not feel any need to.Part of it is that many people dont talk about it much but even beyond that most of them just never really get too far into it for a wide variety of reasons.,BDSMcommunity,d2bucuy,16,t5_2r9tk

7514444,0,t1_d2wcffh,Im not an expert on the US side but people often say the same thing of Canada BDSM is illegal because you cant consent to assault.In Canada the law is that you cant consent to assault of a nontrifling nature except for in the cases of socially acceptable activities. Given its Canada hockey gets a written exception and other sports and martial arts get included by similarity  which is why no one tries to press assault charges after a broken nose at a hockey game.BDSM fits the conditions of nontrifling so you shouldnt be able to consent. But I suspect if it went to any court it would get defined as socially productive and there have been prominent court cases involving BDSM where the concern wasnt pressing charges for assault but consent Jian Ghomeshi and some smaller ones.  Since no court seems interested in implementing the law this way through  or  court cases you have a precedent that your concern with kink is not about the assault but about the consent.I dont know the US situation as well but I suspect that there are similar situations across several states.,BDSMcommunity,d2wcsbu,12,t5_2r9tk

Is it a requirement to take somebodys money and be spending it in a forceful way?Wouldnt it be also domination if he had to hand over all his paychecks directly to you and you only gave him an allowance?Then you take the difference between paycheck and allowance and put it into a savings account. If he misbehaves could be irresponsible spending of  the allowance money his allowance gets reduced for the following weekmonth gt more money goes into saving.Do book keeping so that you know at any given time exactly how much of the saved money is his. Also be open about this to him. Basically he can see the money the whole time he just doesnt have access.Putting money into a savings account sounds to me very much like planning for the future.

7899540,0,t3_4nh5k9,Im sure Im going to be rephrasing a lot of what other people have already said well  that you can ease into it. But Id like to add a vanilla perspective on this because until recently all I ever knew was vanilla. If any of my partners had asked me to slap them as an intro to kink  as though that was something simple and fun to start with  it would have freaked me the fuck out. Slapping is SO loaded so violent for a newbie. Id be thinking Why would my partner want to be slapped?! They want to be abused?? Thats upsetting and sick! I want to be kind and loving to them and slapping is abuse!So I think as others have said the way around that is to start with something totally nonviolent like restraint to begin with. He wouldnt be hurting you by tying you down  but hes crossing the vanilla line into taking control. Talk to him about how fantastic that is for you. Then maybe introduce something like spanking  spanking to the layperson seems pretty innocent like you cant really hurt someone with just a spanking. It would be a less intimidating and emotionally charged situation and you can let him know again how much you like it as opposed to it being abuse. It may take some time but if you reassure him every step of the way the first time he slaps you he wont feel like a shit for doing it. ,BDSMcommunity,d43zdem,5,t5_2r9tk

If they want to go for it Ive done stuff with a lesbian more than once and it sure wasnt sexual for them Ive also done stuff with guys and Im not really into guys but I still had a good time. Granted this was all with other very kinky people and asking for your ass beat at a kink party is far different from asking your vanilla friend to do something. I dont know them and if this would be something that is okay to ask them is something I have no way of knowing thats on you.Personally if you asked me Id be happy too give some guy a slap in the balls.,BDSMcommunity,d44lb17,-9,t5_2r9tk

7922844,0,t3_4nn8zv,One of the groups I am a part of locally has a red flag FAQs on their page. I cannot take credit for written it but it should be what you are looking for.Red Flags amp Warning Signs  ESPECIALLY HELPFUL FOR NEWBIES!With all the new faces popping up around here thought Id start a refresher course on some lifestyle red flags. Please keep this post on topic because it could become a sticky . But feel free to add yours.What do we mean by a red flag? A red Light means STOP. A red Flag means ALERT Proceed with Caution. You have been warned.This is not about True or Twue Doms or subs its about safety in Relationships. Its a serious matter. CKC always takes the safety and security of all our members Very Seriously. We do not tolerate Predators Stalkers Harassment or people just looking for easy sex. If you have an issue please immediately contact one of our facilitators. All complaints are taken seriously and we do the best to keep things as confidential as possible. If it happened to you chances are its happening to some one else.CKC is about BDSM and the lifestyle that surrounds it. WE are about educating our membership on how to be safe and sane in all we do. We do not claim to be experts in everything. We just know what we have found out works for the majority of people we have encountered in our lifetimes.Its of utmost importance we be respectful in all we do. We should be passing on to future generations the lessons we have learned in the lifestyle. In order that they are provided with the best information to allow them to live and play safely and make the best informed decisions in their pursuit of lifestyle.Rule Number One. There is no one true way to live the lifestyle it is as varied as those living it. If it works for you Its probably right for you.Rule Number Two. This is a consensual lifestyle no one is forced to do anything with anyone else without both parties agreeing to it. Period no exceptions. Use the S.S.C. or R.A.C.K. Systems! What we do has inherent risks no matter what skill level you are or how safe you play.Rule Number Three. This is a lifestyle where Honesty Integrity and Communication is paramount to safety. This is especially important during negotiation of a play session. Health details left out during negotiations could cause an injury or death. And set you partner up for possible jail time. Because your ego wouldnt let you disclose your medical issue to a prospective playmate.Rule Number Four. Safe Meetings Safe Calls and Safe Words are there for all of us to use. It doesnt matter who you are. You should learn about these and and use them when appropriate. If a bottom uses a Safe Word at a play opportunity and a Top does not honor it. Chances are you will not be invited back to a CKC event.Just a small list its late and I know there many more.Red flags are not hard and Fast rules but should add a pause and raise eye brows and elicit more questions to be asked.There actually are web sites out there that promote being a Predator on our lifestyle submissives they sell a kit easy sex with submissive women for . Its shameful. Id love to see them shut down permanently.Red Flag  A partner will not accept phone calls when your not with them. Because they probably are hiding another partner or S.O.Red Flag  A potential partner says they do not associate with the community for one reason or another. Because they have been expelled for reasons. Because they will try to isolate and manipulate you. Because the fear being exposed and not knowing as much as they state they do. Because they fear being outed  Not generally valid as most people have no interest in outing you. Because they dont play publicly you dont have to play publicly to be part of the community.Red Flag  some one trys to strongly suggest or force you to become their friend protectorprotectee mentormentee play partner or giveaccept their collar and you feel uncomfortable about it. This is a relationship relationships take time. Because  DOM or sub frenzy. Because they are desperate. Because they do not understand this it is a consensual lifestyle. Because they are bullies or predators.Red Flag  Does not negotiate honor limits honor safe words. Negotiation is not always necessary in long term relationships. This can be considered abusive behavior. Think long and hard here. Because they dont know better. Because rules dont apply to them. because its about them not you.Red Flag  un apologetic for improperly aimed hits or injuries. We all make mistakes dont play when tired or under the influence. Admit when you make an error and correct it. People wont play with dangerous players. Because they dont know better. Because they are playing above their skill level. Because they dont care.,BDSMcommunity,d46lph7,3,t5_2r9tk

8019561,0,t3_4p1xo3,I recently started protecting a friend of mine so Ive been thinking a lot about what it means to me.I see me being my friends protector as being a way to ward of a lot of the daddies which seem to prey on little in the scene as well as being able to try and support her when it comes to meeting new dominants making sure she stays safe.However I do have sex with her but that is something that weve talked about long and repeatedly  shes a friend and someone I try to explicitly protect within the scene. However as a friend we play a bit but we ensure to remain clear that this doesnt mean that there is a deeper level of Ds occurring.I should add that in the past she had a mentor who did abuse that position and fucked hermade her do stuff she didnt want to do so these positions can sort of go both ways.TLDR I am protecting my friend from the shittier elements of the scene we have sex because FWB is a thing but we understand that thats where our interaction ends.,BDSMcommunity,d4hh292,8,t5_2r9tk

8050646,0,t3_4phk2h,For the first point its important to start thinkin about the difference between kink and a use. And thats consent. You talk about the framework you want to play you you have an agreement. Either party can put a full stop to everything and withdraw consent at any time and that will be respected. For the second point if you decide to partake in this you will be respecting your partners right as a human being to have autonomous control over her sexuality. Healthy kinky play is nothing but respect no matter what roles each player takes on. None of this is to say you should do this if you just dont want to. You have a right to consent as well. But if you want to try it out start small. Dont try to do everything at once. Find a couple of activities that you both feel comfortable with and try them out. After talk reassure cuddle and reconnect also called aftercare and it is important for both tops and bottoms. Finally dont feel like you have to live up to preconceived notions of being dominant or rough. Reality is often a lot more playful fun and silly than what you might see portrayed in porn or the media. ,BDSMcommunity,d4kyv0q,8,t5_2r9tk

8096130,0,t3_4q40vc,I assume all sounds are good sounds if my sub doesnt complain verbally because thats how we agreed. Feedback in case something is hurting or wrong is critical but I dont like or want more general constructive criticism. That can wait until later. Compliments also depend on how theyre delivered what sort of language is used. Begging for more touching and kissing is A. It depends a lot on your dynamic and what you get out of the scene. If my bottom told me Thats a great tie or If you loosen that knot itll be perfect Id be downright annoyed. The biggest thing for me is dont hold back those nonverbal reactions those are my favorite. But you should definitely talk this out with the rope top and see what they actually like. The best thing is to actually understand ties and your body as much and more than the rope top so youre always aware of what is happening to you and you can speak up when its important. Im the happiest tying up people who are also rope tops.  ,BDSMcommunity,d4q2tc1,3,t5_2r9tk

So I fought being a submissive tooth and nail. I would give into it but then get angry with myself for being weak and lash out. It took me a while to realize that I get to set the terms and define that word. I choose what how and who I submit to. It is not something I have to do it is my choice. It makes me happy and fills me with peace so I decided to stop fighting it but I also realized that in accepting myself and being honest with myself I got stronger.

8115948,0,t1_d4s1r5p,I feel like this logic can be applied to a lot of BDSM. I feel like this is more of a MKINYKBYKIOK situation that is outside the boundaries of your comfort level or desire but is not necessarily a clear cut moral issue. Some people say that not stopping when your partner says no is immoral or that hitting someone is immoral or that a Ms situation where the slave doesnt have a safe word is immoral. As long as you have taken steps to establish consent with someone who is capable of informed consent and you dont put their health at risk I dont think think this is a clear cut immoral issue as much as a boundary issue.,BDSMcommunity,d4sb0sm,6,t5_2r9tk

8190112,0,t3_4rfmp1,The point of punishment is to teach. Youre teaching that the behavior exhibited is unacceptable and will not be permitted. If you punish out of anger youll teach that your touch can not be trusted. Youll teach that you lack the ability to maintain control of your own behaviors. Youll teach that acting out is sometimes ok if your emotions are involved. It is imperative to the growth of both your submissive and you as herhis dominant that you lead by example and punish with love. If this is a reoccurring issue you need to find out what the true root cause is. Never ever punish out of anger. Never continue a scene of any type if you feel the rush of negative emotions. Doing so can harm herhim and you. ,BDSMcommunity,d51bd93,7,t5_2r9tk

Is there terms to distinguish this type of choking sensation from actual choking breath play?And yes choking is high risk and it is edge play.

There are a million ways to get it wrong and cause harm that you didnt intend to. Go to munches and events go to peer workshops etc get to know people and become known and respected in your community be patient.  If you go in thirsty and half cocked best case you get a reputation for hitting on everyone worst case someone ends up hurt in the totally not sexy way.

8603422,0,t3_4xm9xg,I think its right to do it when it threatens your relationship.  Same for nonkink relationships.  My husband and I have an agreement in our marriage to maintain a healthy weight to  stay fit active and eat healthy. He has MS so this helps extend his life and improve his quality of life.Ive been criticized before but I honestly dont see anything wrong with maintaining a healthy weight and fitness level to stay attractive especially for ones partner.It comes up in a lot of subreddits that someones significant weight gain is adversely affecting their sex life and their relationship with their partner.Id rather be told pointblank by my partner that weight gain has lessened his sexual desire for me than to have him stop initiating sex and make me wonder what happened... and vice versa.  gt but at what point is it too much to ask of someone?I think when it reaches the point that your relationship kink or outside of kink is adversely affected its time.  gt When should a dtype even allow themselves to ask?dtype or stype should say something when they feel they need to.This post from rdeadbedrooms made the front page of reddit a few days ago  It was then that I recognized a truth that crushed and liberated me at the same time our bedroom was dead because my husband no longer sexually desired me because I had allowed myself through years of selfneglect to become sexually undesirable.,BDSMcommunity,d6h0sqv,9,t5_2r9tk
8609715,0,t3_4xr41l,As someone who has struggled with body image issues I get it. Sir has me do porn star training which means recreating pictures he finds which is normally awesome and sexy and makes me feel good about my body... But there have also been times where I took a picture and hated every inch of my body in it. Im working on becoming less skinnyfat and Sir is helping to motivate me to do so but the thing that he emphasizes constantly which is awesome is that I am his images of my body? His. If I dont like a picture? Too bad it was his right to request it even if it makes me uncomfortable. At the end of the day I find my relationship with him is way more valuable to me than any momentary comfort. If that changes if the asks get to hard if I for some reason feel like I dont want to be a sub any more then we will have to address it on a relationship level. At the end of the day we are in a Ds relationship and our compatibility as BF GF is based around keeping our roles. Im afraid that if your sub and GF no longer feels that she is willing to be those things then maybe it just wasnt meant to be. Im sorry that she ended it this way as the way you describe it it doesnt seem very fair to you. But I have no way of knowing her side of the story so Ill take this as a no fault divorce if you want her more than you want the dynamic talk about it renegotiate figure it out.

8610557,0,t1_d6hw3ki,Sometimes the appropriate support is to direct someone to the right resources.  Especially when dealing with emotional and or other types of abuse.  There are certain boundaries that many people put in place when it comes to addressing certain issues.  This is an issue where many people dont feel comfortable taking on thay role as the recipient to a vent.  This isnt a support group so to speak.  I know this may frustrate you as you are seeking a sympathetic ear but perhaps chalk it up to learning to respect a boundary.  Which would be a great tool to learn in coping with what you are experiencing now.  Which subsequently is something you can learn from working with a good therapist.

I met my partner when I stopped ruling out all these traits that dont actually matter in the end. Prioritise what you want for definite in a partner but dont let this be your deciding factor. When I gave up looking and just enjoying playing with kinky partners was when I found someone I really clicked with. It takes a few play partners to help figure out what you really want anyhow.

But I also accepted that risk before I brought it up. I knew what could happen and just because he may not have shown it I know he knows what can happen too. Hes a good man so are plenty of doms that make these mistakes once in awhile mistakes. Not abuseMy prior experience with choking wasnt bad I just didnt enjoy it when we tried it and thought it felt awful. I know what you are saying believe me but accepting what might happen kind of comes with the territory and neither of us fulfilled the measures we previously did.And last I was at work and sort of texted it to him when I told him. He felt bad but wasnt wallowing in it or anything.Im sorry if I sound like Im jumping down your throat here but the point of this post wasnt to demonize anyone it was just to serve as a reminder that communicating and being attentive is important.,BDSMcommunity,d6ohi29,1,t5_2r9tk

8753171,0,t3_4zxrqe,Hi Im new to most of this so please do forgive me if what I say is completely off. Ive read about dropping but it isnt something Ive experienced as of yet. Ive not even done what seems to me would constitute a scene. We just have been slowly adding in and trying different elements of the things I want slowly into our normal course of sex. Taking it slow. I just want to point out what strikes me as significant in your post. In the start you talk about your friend and that what you would really like is someone to explore kink with who you are in a relationship with. Then later you mention that when you are coming down you lose the feeling of intimacy. Maybe it is less an issue of dropping and more an issue of coming to the point you need more from your relationship. Or what I mean is these drops could be softened or prevented from happening so frequently if you felt more security or stability from knowing you still have your partner beyond the sex. Maybe it is time to approach the subject with your friend if you feel like a relationship with him is something you want to take further. Perhaps if not is time to start looking for a more committed partner? I know that I need more than the sex and I get that everyone isnt wired the same as me but you bring up the lack of intimacy like it is important. Gold luck!  ,BDSMcommunity,d6zsxzu,10,t5_2r9tk

8764511,0,t3_4yz8bk,Im a C quadriplegic paralyzed from the chest down and it affects my hands. I also cant orgasm so you can only imagine the sexual frustration the builds up especially after  years post injury. One of the very few ways Ive found to release sexual frustration or just frustration in general is BDSM particularly using a flogger. It was like talking a very nice long hot shower after years of taking cold ones the first time I used to a flogger and didnt have to hold back.For me my injury has taken almost all of the control I have over things in my life away. Ive gotten independent but still majorly depend on other people. So when I order my girlfriend around and she does everything I say I get the kind of control back that i dont have anymore in my day to day life. Theres also an extra level of submissiveness that some like. I cant physically grab and tie my girlfriend up or slap handcuffs on her so I tell her exactly how to do it herself. She has said that for her it is a turn on that she has to not only submit but voluntarily go a step further and put her own restraints on. So I had to learn to speak with full confidence and complete authority since I was having to say exactly what i wanted a lot more. Thats came in handy elsewhere.The biggest challenge is always logistics and accessibility but luckily kinksters are very creative so a lot of it is pretty easy to adapt to. I dont have a grip so normally holding something like a flogger would be difficult but most have a large loop on the handle that I stick my hand through. Same thing for collars with leashes. Toys and vibrators have also became my best friend. Bondage tape world great because I can use it to strap something to my hand or strap up the GF. It just takes practice and patience in finding something that works.Ive gotten straightforward about it and learned that if you are ashamed about it it will never work and neither will enjoy it. Ive learned how to make it enjoyable for both me and my partner through trial and error. She is very openminded and has a ridiculously high pain tolerance so it works out. Most new partners are curious about how it all works especially if they are into it already. People that are into BDSM have been way less judgmental about my disability in general in my experience. Its something different and I think that resonates with people that are naturally into the kinky shit. I couldnt go back to not having kinky sex.,BDSMcommunity,d7184wo,1,t5_2r9tk

But its my decision where to go from here. Its my life and my decision.Living with parents and hiding bdsm is extremely difficult. All the guilt and lying was eating me up. My parents ended up crossing several boundaries because they knew I wasnt telling the whole truth and they were scared. You need to establish the new role of adult child. This is a difficult time in general for many parents. Finding out you have interests outside the norm or outside their beliefs can be a shock to the system. Establish that you are an adult and separate from your dad. It is your life and your decision to make. Edit As a side note I wouldnt even bring up the BDSM. It will derail the conversation and make your dad feel he is in the right to worry about your mental health. At the very least make it two separate conversations. ,BDSMcommunity,d7bfyel,44,t5_2r9tk

8863101,0,t3_51h84i,It can take a lot of directions. It can be about obedience i.e. her telling you what to do and punishing you if you dont. It can be able loss of control like being tied up having a chastity device locked on you or being hypnotized she is a psyc after all. It can be about fear like fantasy blackmail or the anticipation in pain like whipping or hot candle wax. It can be about humiliation like being pinned by her being peed on by her or being feminized. It can be about worship and devotion like tending only to her sensations or always tending to her before you get any pleasure. Peggingstrapon can be a thing whether shes penetrating you as a dominant act or youre humiliated by using a strapon on her instead of your real thing. It can just be female dominant sex acts like her mounting your face for pleasure.

8869077,0,t3_51pmhh,Uhm... shit I guess its just self esteem? I know Im not worthless and honestly if someone told me I was Im secure enough to identify that the problem is likely on their end. I know what my flaws are and a lack of value as a human being isnt one of them. If someone genuinely accused me of promiscuity in a negative sense I might be hurt that they were trying to hurt me but I just dont see anything wrong with sleeping around in any way that would turn it into an insult in the first place. Im probably pretty slutty by many peoples standards but also... eh? So what?I wouldnt play in the first place with someone I didnt feel certain respected me which is something I determine through their actions before we even get our clothes off and after and in an ongoing way throughout our whole relationship. Someone who really thought that my promiscuity made me worthless wouldnt take the time to chat with me about cats or video games or invite me out to festivals or the myriad things my friends and sexual partners do. Thats how I know that when theyre telling me Im just a dirty whore they dont mean it. No one goes through that much effort to cultivate any sort of relationship with someone they consider only worthy of housing their cum. Theres way easier ways to just find someone to fuck than that. Theres lower maintenence sexual partners than me out there.When I tell a partner that I want them to watch me while I fuck someone else in front of them because they could never satisfy me its as much a part of the roleplay as their obeying my order to stay still or not to cum without permission or whatever. Were all actually free to leave at any time Im not genuinely in control of them theyre not genuinely obligated to do what I say and I dont genuinely believe that they cant satisfy me sexually with their pathetic cock. Its just a part of the scene same as we pretend the walls of his familys vacation condo arent covered in pictures of grandma and grandpa when were trying to bone there.

9090766,0,t3_54sfn3,BDSM is a very broad term. It encompasses hundreds of different activities most of which have very little to do with your marital or relationship status. By Googling the term BDSM followed by something to do with your relationship status youre going to narrow your search down to ones that are related to it  things like swinging polyamory and the like.Instead think about what you want to do with each other. Is your dynamic going to be based around protocol? Play? Spankings rope etc Search for how to do those things. There are literally thousands of guides out there.Practicing BDSM is no more difficult for a monogamous couple than it is for a single person or someone practicing polyamory or anybody in between. Nobody in the community is going to care if youre monogamous I promise. In spite of what the overrepresentation of polyamoryswinger media may lead you to believe most people in the BDSM world are also monogamous.

9370229,0,t1_d93qbsy,With all respect you dont decide which part of this hurt my feelings. Its completely about our fidelity to me and me sexting nude pictures to other women would be completely unacceptable and supercede all other things if I did that to her. As for breaking my promise I totally agree it was wrong and she deserves an apology however to me the relarionship had effectively ended at moment. The difference is I broke my promise due to an action she took not the other way around. As discussed before of course I would be allowing her to do something since she is doing something on HER part that would affect or hurt me related to our relationship.For example if I wanted to take the same action I wouldnt do it without her permission and she would have to allow me before I did something like that. And before she would allow me we would have to agree and discuss that. I think youre getting hung up on the world allow and projecting perhaps due to your own personal experiences. Youre really being overly pedantic and arguing semantics. Ive made clear what we did prior to the whole thing heregtshe asked if I felt comfortable I said ok but here are my reservations and things we can do we came up with some rules then agreed. the idea that we stay monogamous in a monogamous relationship is somehow controlling to you is hilarious.

Is he allowed to play with other people? If yes are you okay with that imbalance ? I think this is worth a discussion between the two of you.  About the limit between being a brat and being disobedient theres no general rule about that. Its really between you and your dominant. What does he tolerate ? Whats okay with him? Have you discussed that with him ? Why did you disobey ? To see what would happen if he would punish you or simply because it was too difficult to follow the rule and not play.

Same way that doing shots of everclear will legit fuck up your throat I learned this the hard way.  Your balls and her clitoris are extremely different in terms of sensitivity.  Clit is a mucous membrane balls are not.  Itd be more like spilling alcohol disinfectant on the tip of your cock if you are uncircumcised or basically on your urethra if you are circumcised.  If you wouldnt put it on your urethra dont put it on her clit. ,BDSMcommunity,daojku9,12,t5_2r9tk

9888776,0,t3_5gxlfp,I think uSocietyofJanus had some great advice. My sub likes a lot of control and we are  so we do have a list of rules she is to follow. Its not a huge list but about  clear and precise rules. Id say the more specific the rule the easier it is to follow and enforce. So for example Rule  always address me as xyz. Well then when you are around familyfriends that may change so you are ignoring the rule. Its like a routine it works if you stick with it but skip a day or  and next thing you know you stop following it completely. So it has to be very specific like You will address me as xyz unless we are with family or vanilla friends in which case it is abc. Some basic rule ideas are how to be addressed no orgasms without permission how to dress when to check inkeep in contact. And as uSocietyofJanus said you can always add more rules. So if youve got  rules youve come up with say here are the rules I will add more as we go type of thing. Then youve added some suspense to it and you can make new rules as you learn more about your sub. ,BDSMcommunity,dawj3sb,4,t5_2r9tk

Im thinking of arming more mostly selfies tbh and maybe one or two mirror selfies or something. I hope I dont sound irrationally paranoid but since there are assholes on fetlife just like every other social website I dont want them to get a hold of my pics and use them or whatever. So I guess Im a little bit reluctant. I might do what you do and maybe crop  my selfies so my eyes dont show or something?Kinks are important to me but they arent as important to how we click as a person. I have however added a list of fetishes and will add one or two sentences about the kind of domsdomination I am into and want to meet. I havent reached that stage yet though where Ive talked to someone about kinks purely because the person has been weirdly explicit in their first few messages or not within my age range one guy asked for my ethnicity and when I told him he said he loved Asian Pussy which just put me off.I am pretty much following your steps but reversed and I feel that approach works for me. I find that some people on fetlife get weirdly explicit about fetishes during the beginning and thats not really sexy lol. Like if they were just listing what they liked Id be cool with that but when they try and incorporate a weird level of dirty talk with it its kind of a turn off. Haha am I just being a prude though??

9912426,0,t3_5hegi8,Put your laptop up on a piece of furniture and turn on the webcam. The better way would be to get an actual camera on a tripod. Easier to frame a good scene then and can be dismounted for handheld shots. Best way would be an actual camera operator who knew what they were doing but that might not be your bag. Set up some actual lighting. Lighting will make or break your footage. Bright room lights add some extra lamps. Go all out and get some actual lighting kits if you get really into it. Try to get nice even lighting. Have one of you sit on the bed and move the lights around until youre not casting shadows on yourself from the cameras perspective.Sound can be done from the camera or set up a proper mic somewhere out of shot but closer to the action to pick out those little details in the moaning groaning slipping and sliding. I dont think you want to hang a boom mic but even a karaoke mic can get you some good pick up. Experiment and play around with the set up.

We were friends before we started dating and moved very slowly from friends to full time Ms.  It is likely if things had not worked out the way they did i could have cheated so im glad things happened ethically.  I see the Mister usually  times a week one standing weeknight evening while husband has martial arts class and often  or more other days as life allows.  The Mister has  kids i have  we both work demanding jobs he has  other partners and an aging mother so its not perfect and plenty of our time together is focused on doing boring life stuff andor kid stuff.Its hard to balance it all i wont lie.  You have to sometimes make concessions for the good of the marriage so having a dominant who is on board with that is important.  The Mister amp my husband are friends which makes things both easier and harder.  The Mister knows my marriage is important and takes that into account.  We try to schedule things when husband is busy which is nice so that im not necessarily alone so much.

Maybe you just need some time to heal from what seems like a really rough time or maybe you are trying to find a balance. Its all OK. Honestly submission can be a way to care for yourself. This seems to be it. This whole Its my duty to save the world! business sounds stressful. People change the world every single day and its rarely with monumental stuff. Its the little things that are important. Sometimes just being there for a friend while they go through a rough time can change their entire life. It happens. Ive seen it happen. Sometimes its just smiling at someone and telling them their hair looks pretty today that can cause a butterfly effect and save someone from jumping off a bridge. Anyway. In my opinion trying to save the world types deal with high pressure and a lot of unnecessary stress that they put on themselves either from an unreasonable high sense of self or from familial pressures. Either way... the submission allows her to focus on her it sounds like. And it seems like shes really pleased with focusing on her and getting the things done that she needs to.

10247194,0,t1_dc5i8uw,One of the single most important things I believe a Dominant can do whether they are just starting out or firmly on their path through the world of BDSM is focus on finding your own personal Dominant voice.What does this mean?In order to lead another person whether it is in the bedroom or everywhere you must understand what you want out of a Power Exchange relationship.How can you expect another person to submit to your will if you dont really understand what your will looks like? The more selfaware and confident in your Dominant voice you are the easier your relationship will be to lead.When trying to map out what kind of Dominant you want to be you need to start by asking yourself a series of questions about what kind of relationship you are hoping to find. It is helpful to put pen to paper and map out this relationship. Answer for yourselfAbout SelfWhat are the cornerstones of your Dominance?Are you monogamous or ethically nonmonogamous?What are your top  strengths in leading a Power Exchange Dynamic?What are  weaknesses in your being a leader?What experience do you have?What turns you on the most at the moment?List in order from most to least important  Power Exchange SM kinky sex.Do you consider yourself a sadist or masochist?Are you a switch or interested in switching?Do you believe in punishment dynamics? Or reward based leadership? Combination?Have you ever collared a submissive before? Give a brief description of the dynamic. About Dominance and submissionDo you want a physical emotional spiritual or sexual relationship? A combination of these?Do you want an in person submissive? An online submissive?A full time submissive? A part time? Bedroom only?Are you seeking somebody interested in SM sadism and masochism?Are you interested in having a service submissive? Financial sexual or domestic submissive?What are deal breakers for you?Do you want or require an oral or written contract? For how long?Start here. If you dont know the difference between some of these things research them until you do. Then once you know who you are as a Dominant you can begin looking for somebody to submit to you.This is an excerpt from an article found online.,BDSMcommunity,dc5kr8q,10,t5_2r9tk

My Dom and I have a few things we dont match on like how I enjoy my butt licked but he isnt into it but I have other partners who enjoy it and since were poly and open I can satisfy those parts elsewhere. Im also a bit of a swotch so weve talked about finding another sub we can both play with and hes far more sadistic than I am masochistic so we want him to have a partner who enjoys the pain slut side of things. We do most stuff together but its also open to others. He has my truest devotion and I love him utterly we both want to spend our lives together so weve found ways to make it work.Now basics. It might do you good to start small I definitely think humiliation and degredation arent your thing Im also not super into them but I enjoy my Doms attention when I do it for him and it doesnt bother me to do it for him but I dont think youre up for it. So maybe try lighter stuff just cuffs then maybe just impact play or go extra light in my mind with a planned sensation play starting small just a blindfold and your partner can use a bunch of touch kisses maybe a Wartburg pinwheel and other light sensation toys. Go small test things out with YOU as the focus for a bit. Let YOU explore what you may or may not like and then you can discuss it and see what works easiest. You are NOT a failure. Especially with trying so hard. There is NOTHING wrong with you not liking the same things as him its okay. I dont want to be a slave sub especially not  we have a lot of ddlg elements that happen to be  for the most part because it matches our personalities and makes us happy but the harder kink stuff is more bedroom side. We dont do ordered service outside the bedroom or play we dont do punishment just funishment of things I like spanking flogging etc.. We constantly test and try things making sure we both still like them.Its a journey and an adventure and takes a lot of time safe experimentation and communication so so so much communication we talk about everything and often in depth so that we know each other very well.  Please do not feel bad for not liking everything he likes. Instead I suggest taking a week  or month maybe longer depending to see what YOU like. Its a team thing take notes read up on different kinds of play. I never would have learned Im a little and LOVE ddlg as well as a puppy and kitty girl  and that i enjoy pet play if not for a friend I made at a kink event. There are hundreds of ways to play so explore a little more please.And if you find that you dont like any of it THAT IS OKAY. Perfectly okay. If you find that your SO having a sub to play with helps him and you then that could be perfect I have many friends who play in a similar way or are poly andor open and it lets them satisfy themselves and sometimes each other Im very excited for a day when I can double Dom with my SO. Give yourself a break youre doing great doing everything to your best ability and that is fantastic I dont think youve heard enough how amazing that is you are being a great partner showing so much love.,BDSMcommunity,dcie1i0,3,t5_2r9tk

Its part of a larger pattern of incompetence and poor customer service that I think will eventually make users more receptive to a serious alternative.  Maybe not this year or the next but eventually Baku will screw up something big simply because he cant help himself.  Fetlife became popular because he happened to set it up at just the right time when a lot of people were fleeing his predecessors.

10403115,0,t3_5ozhw9,Planning is good but if she feels like there are goals and those are causing her to feel pressured...then make sure thats not happening. Make it clear from the outset that you just want to talk about activities and limits so you have a framework of consent to work in. Make it clear that the session itself will progress naturally without a specific endpoint in mind. From there instead of talking about the specific scene you have in mind talk about what youve done in the past. Dive into what each of you liked what it made you both feel like. Find areas where things could build off of what youve done. Again dont set out goals or a script. This is just a back and forth conversation about yourselves as people and your interactions and feelings. The most important thing you could do here is listen. After that take all this new information and make some proposal of activities youd like to try relating them as you can to the earlier insights. Avoid anything that has a specific goal in mind. Just things you want to see what she thinks and invite her feedback and thoughts. Invite her to provide her own suggestions too. Refine as needed. From there you should have enough to have some fun. Hopefully framing the process as mere discussion starting with what youve already done being sure to listen and actively solicit her thoughts will help her feel more at ease and help you to craft this together as a team. Maybe most importantly do be sure after sessions you are making time for aftercare where you can reconnect reassure and appreciate each other. If she still feels pressured while you are trying any of this try to find out exactly what you are doingsaying that she feels as pressure so you can be sure not to do those things. Be sure not to dismiss how she feels. Take it seriously listen and find out from her what would work for her. Dont try to problem solve for her. ,BDSMcommunity,dcn9dh8,9,t5_2r9tk

This instance wasnt about yalls sexual relationship your mental health is more important than your dynamic. By getting angry and upset at you after you explained to him what you were experiencing he shows that he isnt thinking about you or putting your best interests first. He flips it and makes himself the victim by making it seem you insulted his position in your life. This was not about him it was about your need for him to be there for you. It seems like he is not interested in you as much as he is in yalls sex life or sex in general. Thats why he tried to bring other people into it.

10471586,0,t3_5pz77i,Not every ds relationship has punishment. One thing you might consider is finding ways to reward her for good behaviour rather than punishing bad behaviour.But you really need to deal with her behaviour outside of your dynamic. Trying to punish or reward it out of her would likely be an uphill battle to say the least.Her acting this way is not healthy and its a  times worse in a BDSM relationship because there its vital that youre mature and open and honest about your feelings and its just confusing if shes a sub who doesnt want punishment.I personally wouldnt recommend playing with her if she cant be mature about it although I wouldnt recommend being in a relationship with her either so I guess mileage may vary.Have you considered relationship counselling? An experienced impartial third party could really help you with working through your issues.Youll probably need to sit down with her and discuss all of this. Ask her how she wants you to handle her getting snappy you may want to reference a specific example rather than phrasing it like this or you could just make it worse Ask her to use a safeword if theres something she really doesnt want to do if she agrees bring this up next time she gets snappy... carefully Are these things she doesnt want to do consistent? Meaning theyre probably pretty much her limits. Have you discussed limits? You should.  They may not strictly be her limits but it may be things shes not interested in which you could also discuss and then try to avoid asking her to do. Have you considered making a contract? It could help clear up what exactly she wants the dynamic to look like and may make her act up less often.,BDSMcommunity,dcv28on,6,t5_2r9tk

10523856,0,t3_5qipv4,Greetings!So many people have given you great advice. I really hope you are able to find some pieces that will help you. You are in my thoughts.I did want to give you my two cents. You are amazing for opening up to everyone here with your issues and seeking help. I am proud of you! Please find a therapist. I know you said you can only see one once a month  is that with your university or are there not many therapist around your area? My one psychologist worked online. She would Skype with patients. Look into the laws in your statecountrywhatever and see if you are allowed to find a psychologisttherapist online if you cant find one in your area be absolutely certain they are legit of course. I know it is hard opening up to someone I hated it but they wont judge you  they truly want to help!Back in highschool I used to selfharm. Like people have said it was a form of stress relief. I didnt think too well of myself and the self harm seem to help. But it doesnt in the long term. It leaves you feeling even more down about yourself. But please dont blame yourself for it! You seem like an incredible person  and I hate to see you in pain. You mentioned you used to see a therapistpsychologist did you talk about selfharm with them? Or just your depression which obviously plays a part in it?As for medication while I dont have bipolar I have two other serious mental health issues I take medication for. I have been admitted to a psych ward twice in my life for the one. I see a therapist once a week and a psychiatrist once a month ish. One of the medications I was on caused a lot of weight gain which I am now fighting tooth and nail to reverse . I dont have an ED so I cant imagine worrying about the weight gain on top of that. However I really hope you can talk to others with ED andor bipolar. It might not seem like it is worth it to you but you might find some reason to talk to your psychiatrist about your medications. You DESERVE to be on meds that work. It took me a long time to find a combination of drugs that reduced my symptoms but I found them. Once we found that ones that work my life got so much better. Others have talked to you about organism but I wanted to add you arent alone. Many people have trouble with that it was years before I learned what they feel like. If it concerns you please talk to a therapist or doctor. From your replies to others it sounds like you might have a reason for it so look into it!I wish you nothing but the best! I would love to hear from you again to find out how you are doing.Kindest Regards,BDSMcommunity,dd0zri6,1,t5_2r9tk

Its a good chance to learn about people and find those with the same interests as you some of them might be good to know down the line and you might be able to get involved in some play just dont go around begging for it before you had a chance to really talk to people I dont really know how it works in every group but in mine there is a certain amount of respect and a way to go about getting play and people tend to frown on new people coming in and just asking everyone they see to do stuff with them.

10648287,0,t3_5sd97u,Conceptual difference between bbw fetish and overweight? Im not sure I understand. Do you mean when at what point does a certain size become a fetish? That is an individual preference. Is it healthy  in what sense? For the the viewer indulging? As healthy or unhealthy as any other kink or fetish. If its for that persons sexual enjoyment not harming him or anyone else or infringing upon his life why not?For the heavier person? I dont think anyone is overweight for the sole purpose of being a kink or fetish but if its what she enjoys the same conditions apply. And needing to visit a dietician is an individual choice.I dont understand how the BMI measurement is relevant in terms of kink unless again you are trying to make a distinction of what point it becomes a fetish. I dont think the porn industry or those who engage in this fetish care about such a scale. Again boils down to preference.I think you are applying some judgements here.

10661104,0,t1_ddfgxnv,Im very glad I could help So I responded to the original couple with an explanation of this but basically we had a tough time with that until we went . Now we are doing enough stuff from the other side with the little daily things that our dommingmuscles and subbingmuscles stay exercised and ready to go as it were. And the little things also keep our tanks topped up so we dont have such a desperate need to be one way or the other and we dont run dry if the other does need an extended period of whatever.Weve crafted personas so we can play the role even if we arent feeling it there are set expectations when were playing in persona  Maam is very firm and quiet if Im Maam even if hes suddenly souffl he knows Im not going to be indulgent like Mommy. If hes Daddy I know hes not going to be able to be harsh and spankings are for fun not to make me cry but then it is a good time to ask him to pop the pimples on my bum because hell cope well with me crying about them because hes taking care of me.Also the list of questions I mentioned in responding to them that helps us help the other even when we arent feeling the dynamic. Sometimes we can take the Ds out of it and fulfil the others needs with simple topping and bottoming like with bondage or sadomasochism.Taking it out the bedroom for us means subbing can be done without putting too much extra strain on the dom  sitting on the floor when the dom is on the couch making all the drinks serving as a footstool casual blowjob whilst doing something else etc. In the bedroom theres a lot more inflicting of dominance its a lot more active and involved out of the bedroom submission is easier to offer and often all the one being submitted to has to do in return is give little orders and pat the subs head.,BDSMcommunity,ddfm18w,3,t5_2r9tk

Ive actually suggested couples counselling a few times but hes flat against it and so far it hasnt been enough of a problem to force the issue. Admittedly part of that is my own failing. I tend to be the more dominant partner in our day to day lives and I honestly didnt realise how often he would say that he agreed with something just because he didnt want to talk about it or conversely dismissing something I said out of hand. Its always been stupid little things like what were having for dinner or how much time to spend with the inlaws.

I dont know how much the membership fee is but even members pay a  entry fee. I honestly had no idea that that was expensive. They are the only local group that Im aware of and Id never looked  in depth into groups outside my area the next closest group is over three hours away. I actually mentioned that he might be topping from the bottom a while ago. He got seriously offended... and completely ignored the fact that at one point he was topping from the bottom to such a point that he actually switched our roles midscene. Im not joking. I had him tied down he spent the whole time trying to get out of said ropes and when he actually managed to get untied he flipped me over and suddenly hes topping me... I actually safe worded on him because my brain couldnt handle the switch... Our ideas of submission are so completely different. I like the loss of control the freedom from decisions and responsibilities the anticipation of not knowing whats coming but being pretty sure that youre going to enjoy it. He hates being out of control. Even restrained he refuses to use restraints that he cant get out of. Took me a while to figure that out to be honest. We have a nice set of cuffs but hell never use them on his wrists because he probably Ive never tried couldnt undo the buckle. I like the cuffs and I trust that he would undo them if I needed out. He just cant put that kind of trust in anyone and Ill be honest I dont understand that. I accept that its a hard limit for him and we only use scarves on his wrists hes ok with ankle cuffs but I totally dont understand the thought process behind it. I dont know if he has any specific aspects that put him in a submissive mindset except for pain. I will absolutely be asking him. ,BDSMcommunity,ddl0t3d,4,t5_2r9tk

Fetlife can be very intimidating and I havent had many good conversations through it. Sometimes you get lucky and find really cool people though. Certainly not everyone is like your college boyfriend on there though. Many people understand limits quite well myself included. It sounds like you have a good relationship even with the BDSM stuff. Not everyone is ready or needs to be a dom. The fact that he tries to meet your needs and desires even when hes not  comfortable with it speaks highly of him. So about the toys it seems that hes not really involved in it? Perhaps you could encourage him to play with more of the gear. Maybe instead of having a subdom sort of thing for it or even worrying about sex you just explore the toys and get him to figure out how to use them. That might inspire him more as well. I think your power dynamics wishes are very similar to many peoples. By being the sub youre relieving tension you have from the roll of breadwinner or so Im guessing.

The act of dropping a pretense helps us explore what we are inside but also gives us the feeling that we are plural beings. Nowadays however its more the case that I accept I am who I am. I am not a beast covered in the skin of civilization. I am a unified whole who can do or do not at my own wishes. That I act differently in session is merely a consequence of circumstance. As you would speak softly in a quiet room or yell over a cacophony. You simply change what you do. Some might perceive that as changing ones persona.

So weve hit the point where weve agreed on me playing with him were dating now too  but thats besides the point and over the years a few other people.

11337125,0,t3_61rlbj,I cant speak for others but I can speak for my own relationship with my sub.I call her my livein sub when I am speaking in kink but the literal truth is that she is my wife and KinkBDSM happens in very specific timewindows of random frequency.  The reason for this is because my wife has a teenage daughter my stepdaughter that is unaware of our kink and we intend to keep it that way.  So real BDSM play can only occur during the time windows when the daughter is off at visitation with her biological father which can be random and infrequent because of his schedule or the current level of sophomoric pettiness he is feeling at the time.  The rest of the time we are a normal married couple enjoying normal married couple things and activities.  However when the child is away and the bedroom door closes the collar comes out and we have a Domsub relationship.  I can accept the label of being a closeted or cloistered BDSM couple because we do indeed engage in play behind closed doors and when conditions are right but I rankle when I am labeled as not Truly Kinky because I dont have a  TPE relationship with my sub and I dont keep her naked and in full Gorean  sirik  chains all the time.  ,BDSMcommunity,dfh1kof,18,t5_2r9tk

A service Top is someone who builds and designs scenes around the specific and immediate needs of the bottom to give them what they want. A service Top is just someone who sees what they do as an act of service to someone else. That doesnt make it submissive. It also means that they dont get fulfillment out of it.

11606655,0,t1_dgaex1u,Ok so first thing that pops in my head regarding the ropes is again something Mr. D and I do. One of the problems we have is that we both get off by getting the other off. So when I hit subby mode all I want is to make him happy and he wants to make me happy but what do we do to get us both there?  its a horrible problem to have I tell ya! One way weve found to wiggle around that is with ropes. I get tied up so I cant wiggle away and he goes down on me as long and slow as he wants. My brain is tricked into thinking that its ok to relax and enjoy the oral because sometimes subbrain thinks its being selfish and cant relax. Stupid. Hes going down on me how he wants to and the ropes help with that because Im held in a comfortable position for him and I cant wiggle away when it gets too intense. I also cant dig my fingernails into him when I try to pull him up to fuck me! Your husband can look at it as he is pleasing you while being restrained tricks that part of you that wants to be dominated. gtIm thinking the specific act is a way to signal you want that direction of play ... The only thing I can think of is like deliberately dropping a fork so I can bend over and give him an eyeful.Another thought is in regards to the quote above. One thing people do to differentiate between playtime and regular life is a specific piece of clothing or jewelry usually a collar. Sometimes its used to signal the transition between fuckslut and beloved wife sometimes its used to ask for play or signal willingness to a consensual nonconsensual CNC  for short scene. For example I could put my collar on after i finish cooking dinner and Mr. D would know I was hoping for a spanking. So since you two arent going to be in a solid Ms relationship you could work out some kind of signal like that or even just leaving the collar out on the table where he can see it. gtIf and when he gets the hang of it and figures out what hes going to get out of all of this the specialness will be off the charts.TicklishKinkWife said that above and it is so fucking true.  My heart grew three sizes the day Mr. D said Theres something about seeing my handprints on your ass...  Especially because hes doing it for you not because he get something out of it too. Thats not to minimize the interactions between long time players but the sense of bonding from that and tbh mildly corrupting someone is a great feeling! gtOne of the big things that led to our declining sex was that I have chronic back pain caused by injury and congenital disease. My pain was often the thing that stopped a sessionOk first off read this article  then have him read it too. There are more in depth articles on this process but this is a good overview.So besides the obvious part above there is something very freeing about pain you can  stop at any point. When you spend all day suffering knowing you can raise a hand and say Thats enough! at any point it makes both pains easier to bear. I dont know what your chronic pain is like but for me its  a semi constant low level maybe . So a slightly more intense andor irregular pain will drown that out or distract me from it. Like nipple clamps will drown it out so Im not focused on or distracted by it. And during a spanking Im thinking more about the next strike when is he going to do it? How hard? Where? And then because its different from my regular pain which is constant it drowns it out.Does that all make sense? Its kind of hard to describe! Let me know if theres anything I can clarify. ,BDSMcommunity,dgbmh90,1,t5_2r9tk

11671489,0,t1_dgippa2,Poly is hard enough when its something you actively want for yourself. Its really hard when its something you want to try because you love someone who wants nonmonogamy and its even HARDER when youre dealing with her already having an existing kinky relationship outside of your dyad. Go slowly and take the time to figure out what YOU want. Lots of mono people try to want poly because they love their poly partner and they mean well but Ive never seen it end well for anyone involved. But I have seen monopoly relationships where each partner is able to accept the difference of philosophy so it can be done.I think youve gotten a lot of good advice from other commenters so Ill try not to pile on but I do want to say that while its not necessarily a bad thing to hope for some benefit from practicing dominance I would also caution against hoping to get more out of a practice than you put in. If youre struggling to find ways to feel in control of other areas of your life having complete control here wont help as much since youll still lack control in those other areas.But it can be good practice for assertiveness and selfawareness. My BF has had to get comfortable with figuring out what he wants and asking for it and thats something hes benefiting from across the board. Its built up his confidence so hes more comfortable stating what he wants even in circumstances where I have no obligation to obey and thats wonderful for our communication in general.Good lord I cant say anything briefly.
