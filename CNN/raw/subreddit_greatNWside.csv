609917,0,t1_cg9k0sh,They stay open until  PM on most nights which is pretty normal for coffee shops I guess. Its just kind of a bummer that so many coffee shops close so early in Chicago. Toward the loop you get more that are open until  and even some open past  but around here I think the only one open that late is City News PM. While City News is awesome its not my ideal environment for studying or doing work as the tables are kind of cramped and there isnt really much of a view inside or outside. While Portage Park isnt really a booming college area we do have quite a few students that go to Wilbur Wright and there is a  hour Xport right next to Portage Grounds. I think they could make a profit after  if they did stay open. Its a pretty cool atmosphere. I work from my computer at home so switching environments and working in a coffee shop is kind of nice sometimes at night. ,greatNWside,cg9lm3d,1,t5_2w9yy
