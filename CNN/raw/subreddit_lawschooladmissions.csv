5836845,0,t1_cxj7og4,You have been extremely helpful thank you! Yes I am about to start buckling down on a study plan for the Feb LSAT. I havent quite figured out my plan yet but Ill be starting it within the next week. I took a medical leave of absence. This means that I am able to return to school in the fall without having to reapply. I chose this option over taking a full withdrawal because I have a full tuition scholarship there with no GPA minimum or anything. The leave allows me to maintain the scholarship and also allows that I will still get  years covered despite having been there for  of a semester. The only thing I have to do is contact the school before April or May to let them know whether or no I want to come back. I would love to call them up ASAP and tell them they can start using that scholarship money for someone else but if I end up with no other options my parents want me to have that school open. I have an oncampus interview tomorrow with admissions as a t school. I am very nervous about how to address the situation with having enrolled and dropped out. I guess my plan as of now is to just be honest about how the school wasnt really on radar that the plans were very last minute and all of that coupled with the health issues just made me feel like I wasnt performing as well as I could. Any advice for dos or donts about how to handle that conversation? What should I say about my status with the other school? If the school I am seeing tomorrow needs me to cut ties with the old school I am more than willing. However I would like to maximize my options without doing anything to hurt my chances elsewhere. Id rather lose my spot at the other school than hurt my chances at this reach school. Also I was waitlisted last year at this reach school despite my low score and very late application submission. That makes me feel somewhat more confident. edit also I plan to address the drop out in an addendum to my app. What tone should I try and take with that? ,lawschooladmissions,cxkqk2f,1,t5_2y2gn

Im sure youve heard it before but acceptance is  LSAT and GPA and both of your numbers are below the th percentiles. Even if you were accepted I doubt you would receive any scholarships and cost of attendance for residents is slightly over . Couple the cost with only about  of grads obtaining barrequired positions  months after graduation and I think it paints a bleak picture. Its already getting late in the cycle to apply as well. My advice get another year of work experience which is always helpful when job hunting after school. Start studying again in a bit and prepare to take the June and October LSAT. Even with the GPA you could manage a full tuition scholarship with a  LSAT. ,lawschooladmissions,cypkwkx,3,t5_2y2gn

6308963,0,t3_420s8c,Dont force it. Make sure you feel comfortable with your essay and you feel like its the best statement about you. I hired some lady when I was writing personal statements to transfer from community college to help me with everything and she wanted me to do what I thought was a run of the mill PS even though I had already wrote what I thought was a pretty good and more interesting one. I submitted my cool one and I felt great about it I figured if they are going to reject me let them reject me not her idea of me. My point is that youre going to read a lot of boring run of the mill personal statements online. If thats who you are then use them as a template. If thats not who you are then dont get too caught up in them but use them to find out what points you might want to include but dont force anything. As for your other question I do work as an artists assistant and a lot of what I do involves copying famous works and changing them slightly so I wrote about how I did research to make sure what Im doing is legal its questionable at best and downright illegal at worst but oh well. I wrote how doing that research sparked an interest in IP law and how I wanted to make sure content creators both have their work protected and are able to use other content to express themselves as long as they do it fairly and with good intent. That really happened and it let me include that Im an artist which is what I really wanted to get across in my PS because I think thats the thing thats most likely to set mine apart from another. It looks like wrestling is that thing for you so Id focus on that and if you can link it to law do it if you cant dont force it. ,lawschooladmissions,cz6rb39,1,t5_2y2gn

I personally wouldve probably preferred trying to take it again I only took it once...but missed like  questions a section so there wasnt any clear weak points to improve on wouldve been more of a luck of the draw on test day but didnt have the time to study again.Your financial situation doesnt make a difference for admissions but cost is definitely something you cant overlook when deciding where you will actually attend. They dont make scholarship decisions until February and March so I dont know if Ill be getting any money yet...but GULC seems to be notorious for low scholly offers in general and the lower your numbers the less likely you are to get money.

Other factors to take into account UPenn is ranked higher than Yale according to ATL. YALE. Why is that? Possibly because many Yale students go into academia are paid less and thus have more debt? Thats a possibility. Though no one would argue that one will have an easier time getting a high paying law firm job from Penn than they would have from Yale. Furthermore no one would argue UPenn is an overall better law school than Yale.What Im saying is this Take these ratings from ATL with a grain of salt.

Whats wrong with that? If you can afford to and wont mind paying off the loans it seems to me that law school would open more doors than it would close. There are so many things you can do with a law degree especially from Harvard. Maybe you could be a judge maybe you could just do pro bono stuff in your spare time maybe you have a quiet little firm of your own. I have a philosophy degree so its crossed my mind to do healthcare ethics. My current plan is to mostly do research from home. Like you I love reading cases and figuring out the nuance of why they decided that way. Im only going if I get a full ride from the decent regional place so I wont have to worry about loan repayment and it doesnt really matter if I dont end up working as a lawyer.

7539442,0,t3_4ilzn8,Thanks for the post! I think Im adequately sold that UVA is a better choice than Georgetown but with the different range in lsatgpa scores it might be reasonable to assume that an applicant that is looking at Georgetown isnt necessarily able to seriously consider attending UVA or a better ranked T. Of course I think most people would agree that a better ranked school that has a more favorable CoA is the way to go. The question of prospects between GT and a lower ranked school is particularly interesting. For Big Law GT is indeed at  and UCLA at  though Texas drops down to  If Big Law is your shtick however arguably Cornell is by far the superior choice. Perhaps easier to get into than GT Cornell is at  for Big Law better than NYU and UVA with a very sexy  employment score however LST calculates that. Pretty good for a non T imo. Hell pretty good for a T though I have no idea what kind of finaid they offer but it seems like a safe bet that its better than GT. That said these metrics should probably be taken with a grain of salt as Yale has a worse large firm score than GT at ! Its likely more about what students want to do and presumably Ls must not be picking GT or Yale for Big Law. What is the incentive then for going to GT?I think a lot of people choose GT just for the sake of getting into the DC market. They might not be able to get into a better school and they arent as motivated to go to a worse school just for Big Law which is arguably a miserable job despite the salary perks. These people are likely looking more for something government related and GT does indeed surpass many schools for public service with a  score. With loan forgiveness programs for people in the public service perhaps that makes it worth it. ,lawschooladmissions,d2z7508,1,t5_2y2gn

7996871,0,t1_d4ekfoj,I would just like to weigh in on this point absent any discussion of the article itself. It is certainly true that applying to law school should be approached as a balancing act between level of fiscal risk and likelihood of professional reward and also that the determination of what would constitute an acceptable risk in that case is a personal one. However objective employment indicia strongly counsels that the T on a full ride or bust mentality is probably overzealous in its admonition. While employment outcomes are obviously the single most important factor in determining where to attend and the T offers the best outcomes although notably not pursuant a straightline correlation in rank it is not as if youre incapable or even unreasonably unlikely to get as good of a job from those schools as you are from lower ranked schools  up to a certain point of course. Scoring  also wont get you a full ride at most if not all of the T whereas it reliably would at most lowerranked schools.Edit I suppose I should add that I did not intend this as a rebuttal to your post but merely as the thoughts of someone whose idea of acceptable risk weighs somewhat further to the other side. ,lawschooladmissions,d4exaig,2,t5_2y2gn

I think its a rather personal decision that others cant really weigh in on because depression looksfeelsimpacts people very differently. Im applying this cycle so I can let you know how things go but I think if law is something youre really interested in then do it. I also think its good to learn how to deal with depression and work with it as much as as you can rather than simply try to avoid it. I always found my attempts to avoid it just made things seem worse. But on the same token you also have to be vigilant about your mental health throughout the process. I dont think law school is completely unrealistic with your stats though Id recommend trying to max out your LSAT score if you have the timemoney to do so to help with your low GPA. Im not sure how PI placement looks outside of the T but I DO know that PI work is apparently the kind of work that isnt getting as much interest mainly because of the lower salary so Id imagine that its possible to get into PI from a higherranked school... if you were interested in big law maybe not so much.Anyway good luck!,lawschooladmissions,d6cywjp,1,t5_2y2gn

8743079,0,t1_d6yhdtl,To answer your question no. Federal Stafford loans do not cover anywhere near full COA. For example I pay about k a year in TOTAL college related expenses but I can only borrow k or so in Federal loans. Now this varies depending on what a families expected contribution is but for the average person who does not qualify for FAFSA and who is a member of a family that makes an average income Federal loans DO NOT cover anywhere near the total COA. You can borrow privately but there is not Grad Plus option for undergrad so it makes it significantly more stressful to pay for in some cases. ,lawschooladmissions,d6yjdc4,8,t5_2y2gn

9883263,0,t1_davnv1s,Working after you graduate for a year or two while you study for the lsat is probably your best bet because you can distinguish yourself from other applicants who did not obtain any work experience.  This will look good to potential legal employers during and post law school as well.Its unlikely that you can raise your LSAC GPA that much by trying to pad with additional classes and even if you could youd still be so far below schools th gpa medians that it wouldnt be worth your time or money.I would graduate with your justice degree try to find either corporate or legal work and study the hell out of the test. I highly recommend working in the general counsels office of a major corporation if possible. You have the benefit and support of working at a company and the ability to possibly move into other positions if you find that law school wont work out. That company may also partially pay for education although it might not be able to help you finance law school unless you go part time.I did that after ug and its worked really well.

Youre arguing something thats FAR beyond what was stated and hammering something that Ive already explained is NOT what I was saying. Could I have worded what I meant better? Apparently for this forum I shouldve. Is what youre assuming I said what I meant? Not even in the slightest. You all made a MASSIVE assumption for a reason Im not quite sure I understand and turned it into a huge issue when it wasnt one. Never said Texas sucks OR I dont want to live in Texas. In fact what I was saying is assuming that someone is willing to live in Texas which I would consider a massive qualifier in UT being a good decision for any L considering it is the only difference the places graduates tend to get work. The underlying question was Is there a huge difference outside of job placement that I am missing when comparing these two schools to each other? If I wanted to take a jab at Texas Id do it bluntly not in some round about way. I have no reason to take a jab at Texas and if I wanted to wouldnt choose a subreddit as the place to do so.

As of now I am in at several top  schools with substantial merit based scholarships. While part of me wishes I started law school sooner it is impossible for me not to think about the value that getting a good score has added and I dont think I could have done it without a gap year.

If you improve your LSAT score you could probably get into a better school with better employment outcomes. And even if you dont retake you would be able to go to a school that has a good reputation and a strong grad base in the area of the country you want to practice.  After the T all the schools become very very regional.Getting a dual degree from a not good school isnt going to help you nearly as much as getting a single degree from a better school or at the very least a school in the market that you want to practice in. The only case in which I have heard of a dual degree really helping with job prospects was with a tax LLM.Do you have a hard science background?

Also just speculation but I feel like Chicago the city has enough problems in it that there are going to be civil rights opportunities everywhere.Harvard sounds nice too though.,lawschooladmissions,dftfkkx,3,t5_2y2gn

Obviously stronger the farther north you go but surprisingly robust even when you cross the MasonDixon. I specifically asked about Iowa WUSTL ND and Emory.
