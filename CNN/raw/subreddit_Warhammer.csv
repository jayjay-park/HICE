3711,0,t1_ceeuofh,While its obviously difficult to add some character in the abstract sense to nids I think that well see more variety in how lists are setup. The new WD playlist for nids doesnt have troops but instead has a handful of really powerful MCs and such.

304774,0,t3_1xktvo,A few thingsOldblood doesnt need a shield. If you stick him in the unit he wont be able to use it at all with the great weapon. Id also give him the Dawnstone because it makes him virtually unkillable in combat.I might make the Skink Chief the BSB just because you dont have one otherwise and its just such an important part of most armies. Blowpipes on chiefs tend to be a better choice than javelins because the ballistic skill is much higher. Im not sure the cloak of feathers is a great choice because he can be shot off rather easily but it should be fun.Heavens is a pretty solid lore if youve only got the one caster but beasts can be good in low magic games too. I think Id take beasts and hope to roll transformation or savage beasts.Spears are generally worse than hand weapons on Saurus I think. Theyre pretty strong for core but giving them that parry save is better than an extra rank of attacks in my experience. Given their low initiative theyre almost always striking last and you may not even get to use the additional rank of attacks  you probably want to be charging with them more than weatherring charges.Skink Cohorts are just worse than Skink Skirmishers if youre not putting the Kroxigors in them. Poisoned closecombat attacks wont matter because theyll all die too fast haha.Unstoppable Stampede is interesting but Sharpened Horns is the really strong Stegadon upgrade. Charging units of ogresmonstrous cavchariots etc. goes much better with D wounds.Cold Ones are pretty solid in this list. Id think about putting the Oldblood on a Cold One and in this unit if you want to get him into combat faster. Spears are pretty good on them too and I might drop a couple of Saurus to squeeze these in.Kroxigor are solid but Ive never played with them outside a cohort personally. They seem ok though!Overall looks like a relatively fun  point list but you could eek out a bit more power by making the changes Im suggesting.Saurus Oldblood Armour of Destiny Dawnstone great weapon. Skink Chief Battle Standard Bearer The Cloak of Feathers Talisman of Protection blowpipe light armour shield. Skink Priest Dispel Scroll Level  Wizard Lore of Beasts.

567267,0,t1_cg4qv4u,It is not as bad as most people think but a lot of good Tyranid lists tend to look very similar due to how limiting the codex is too many crappyoverpriced units in each slot that usually never see the light of day and Synapse creature tax taking up good FOC slots. I was hoping for maybe some kind of expanded FOC for regular nid armies seriously  more Elite slot would make a HUGE difference by allowing greater variety since we did not get ANY allies but so far it looks like we arent getting anything.At least the dataslates are pretty good some almostYmgarl genestealers can now hide in terrain twin linking artillery organisms and endless swarms of gants are all awesome.

Purple will look much better if you give all the areas a thin layer of bright grey first. That way the purple will look brighter and more vibrant.  Model paint is never  opaque this is so that multiple different layers of colours wont look streaky. However if youre working on a black primer then the black will appear through the thin purple colour. Thats why you basecoate these areas with grey first and then add a second layer of purple.,Warhammer,ch9juk9,2,t5_2qqd4

Yes its an expensive hobby and we know that going in but I feel like it hasnt been that long since the most recent edition came out and honestly stuff like the unbound concept coming from a company that is so against competitive play isnt exactly breeding hope for rules that will be better for playing more balanced games. I get that they need to sell models but itd be nice to have the company working for the fans.,Warhammer,chauj1y,2,t5_2qqd4
939780,0,t1_chara71,i played WE in th and th quite a bit. one of the main diffrences is that now there is no riskreward for getting close and personal to the enemy. way watchers can nuke knight units from across the battle feild archers can nail warmachines from  away with poison. i also set up the archers as the bait unit something relitivly slow that they could actually march towards then when they are almost on them i moonstoned to a wood across the battle feild. im thinking of doing this with a large unit of scouts as they can moon stone and shoot in the same turn. just have them appear in whatever wood is most useful and shoot safe in the knowledge that they can hope to any other next turn. ,Warhammer,chb3x8w,3,t5_2qqd4

965564,0,t1_chdib4x,They have their place theyre great if youve started a new army and want to field it but dont quite have enough stuff ready yet so you can ally it to your current army and play some proper games.The problems are from the min maxing that one can do giving units special rules from other codices has led to a lot of overpowered combinations. I think a lot of this could be alleviated by removingtoning down battle brothers.I would probably restrict it to Inquisition only that book doesnt function without BB and maybe a couple of other special cases Chaos MarinesDaemons and different Codex chapter tactics springs to mind. Everyone else goes to Allies of Convenience which I think is fine from a fluff perspective  Eldar and Dark Eldar do cooperate but the Farseers dont want to hang out with the guy whos jacket is made out of Farseer bones. Marines and Guard often fight alongside each other but the Chapter Master isnt going to lower himself to leading guardsman when his honour guard is still around. Eldar are quite willing to use Tau to accomplish their goals but no self respecting Farseer wants to spend too much time with a race that is even younger than the Monkeigh.,Warhammer,che1l4d,4,t5_2qqd4
982932,0,t1_chfwdmy,This. A million times this.The whole unbound armies thing and watering down the FOC with all kinds of stuff you now can take like LoWFortsAlliesInquisitors... is just GW way to say Sorry we dont even want to try to balance this game anymore..Rerolling useless warlord traits will not help either as you still have to choose from lists that are FILLED with useless stuff Exceptions apply for some armies.The play who you want rule did exist before. In fact this rule applies to all games. Sadly some of us cant realy choose because there are just so few other players around. Its not a game of MTG that has players on every corner. Usually a k game is a pretty big commitment in terms of time and effort not to mention money like transporting building or painting. If you dont have several big gaming clubs in your town you cant be too selective or you will play always against the same person. Nothing wrong with that but I would prefer a game with balance and rules that would make pickup games easier not harder.,Warhammer,chg0my8,3,t5_2qqd4

997659,0,t1_chhezk8,Game balance has never been their objective. The points are there to roughly balance the size of opposing forces and to give you a loose structure to then tweak however you need to in order to vaguely simulate cool battles. The people who have a problem with their rules are the kind of person who thinks that WoW and Warhammer k are in any way analagous. Computer simulations dont have human discretion. When youre playing with real people in meatspace common sense and the rule of cool trumps anything else especially when it comes to k but there is a contingent of loser wastes of space who wrap their egos up in winning and losing a ridiculous game that has never never ever. EVER been about competition except in the most tongueincheek manner. Thats why they have to go pay money to play at tournaments they are assholes who cant find regular opponents because they are that repugnant to play with. Thats another key philosophical difference youre not playing against your opponent in GW games youre playing with your opponent. Rules Lawyering and WAAC play is expressly against the intent of the game and the basic human goal is vastly different from a computer simulation type of game.I hear that there is a Total War based WHFB game in the works which isnt all that related but is awesome.,Warhammer,chhow2k,1,t5_2qqd4

1017795,0,t1_chjz0ws,Seems like GW may finally have found a way to punch through the mess that th caused. Some people have complained that unbound will only make power play worse but frankly if local meta allows it without staunch permission a la Forgeworld up to the past year or two lists will have to balance out to avoid being stomped in objective games and by other minmax or leaf blower lists  Psychic phase looks more fun with higher rewards but greater risks and with much more universal ability to counter it  Assault phase looks set to have a nice but not OP buffing  consolidating into combat makes sense and stops shenanigans about limiting damage to avoid being left in the open challenges now make sense and powerful CQC characters now have far more utility and transports are more survivable,Warhammer,chjzaw2,1,t5_2qqd4

1034573,0,t3_25xxbt,Ive never played Warhammer or indeed any miniatures game. I have however played and enjoyed greatly many of the Games Workshop themed boardgames such as Space Hulk Chaos in the Old World and Relic. I also like painting boardgame components.I was wondering if I should consider buying the Dark Vengeance starter pack. I have pretty much zero desire to start building armies or collecting figures as the cost seems prohibitive and Id prefer to spend my money on boardgames anyway but the idea of having a taster box of Warhammer on my boardgames shelf for varietys sake is an attractive one seeing as I enjoy the theme so much.So I was just wondering if the figures contained in the Dark Vengeance boxset offer a fun balanced game on their own seeing as it would be selfcontained and its highly unlikely Id be adding more figures to it jokes about becoming addicted to glue aside. I hear a lot about fluff and aesthetics but really my interest is if its a particularly crunchy game to play after Ive painted everything.Also what does the th Edition mean for Dark Vengeance? Is there a new starter pack coming out for the new rules? ,Warhammer,chlvwdb,1,t5_2qqd4

1075159,0,t1_chqhk8q,Casting is pretty simple.  First you decide how many of your warp charges you want to use to cast your power.  You roll the warp charge dice and anything  is a success.  If your power requires three warp charges youll need to have three successes.  You get Perils on double s but even if you get perils the power still goes through if you rolled enough successes.Denying the witch is a tiny bit more complicated.  The unit targeted by the power decides how many warp charges they want to roll and any roll of a  is a success.  You need equal or more successes than the powers caster to nullify the power.  You add plus  to your rolls for the following special rules. The Psyker Psychic Pilot or Brother of PsykersSorcerers special rule. A Mastery level higher than the Psyker manifesting the power. Adamantium Will Special Rule.Each of the bullets is a static modifier meaning that the maximum you can add to your roll is .  You can also try to nullify powers that dont target one of your units like a blessing or conjuration but youre not allowed to add any of the previous listed modifiers to your roll.  Psychic hoods allow a psyker within  of a target unit to take the Deny the Witch roll in their stead.,Warhammer,chqhzfs,1,t5_2qqd4

Now as for why Im leery of the actual changes well the psychic phase seems to fail to address my concern about blessings.  The fact I have to beat all your success to cancel it out rather than each dispell removing a success.  Additionally several blessings got even better.While yes you dont have EW on iron arm anymore a guaranteed  to S and T is stupid.  Its one more subtle way to try forcing a need for D weapons.

1492370,0,t3_2b9a85,How was the table set up?  It seems odd that you would lose so many models on turn one werent you using some line of sight blocking terrain?I had some similiar experiences with my first time playing in a shop with strangers.  They acted really nice but quietly moved terrain around to give them a huge advantage.  Be especially wary if people want to use a specific demployment type.  Never let the person who set up the table pick the sides.  Its kind of a shame that Ive had such negative experiences early on with strangers too.  Not using enough terrain can give a shooty army a serious advantage.  Its widely accepted that Tau are better than Nids so maybe clear it with your opponent to have a bit of extra terrain down to make it a fair fight.  I forget what the rulebook states but there should be at least  of the board covered in terrain and one large line of sight blocking piece in the middle.EditWhile this article is written for th its still helpful today.,Warhammer,cj3cday,1,t5_2qqd4

Cover saves or hiding behind los?  Smart missiles.  Deep strikingoutflanking?  Early warning override interceptor.  Shooting?  Dont make me laugh there isnt a single army in the game that can just sit back trade volleys with tau and actually win.  Not even the muchvaunted eldar.Literally every shenanigan Tyranids had has either been taken away by the BRB or hard countered by the tau. And the funny thing is all it would take to bring things back to an even playing field is a slight points rebalancing.  If it were easier for Tyranids to spam hordes or harder for tau to field riptides maybe there would be a shot.  But as of the current state of the game there arent any tools in the tyranid kit that arent already countered by either default wargear or extremely cheap upgrades in the tau codex.Did you know that the riptides ion accelerator is only  pts?  ,Warhammer,cj3dj3f,0,t5_2qqd4

1965829,0,t3_2h4y6a,The ork codex is a classic case of lots of nice things but not good and obvious ways to glue them togeather.The morkanaut and gorka are beasts but no assault vehicle makes their troop carry function a useless additionThe changes to the battle wagon and looted wagon wargears make them irrelevant as troop transportsNo wazzdakka makes ork bikers armies noticeably worseThe fancy New artillery are cool but they favor a playstyle thats unorky by many and some are only situational.The morale changes are sad pandas all around. Where to begin with that abomination. Though on the positive side dark angels easy access to fear makes that kinda nice nowThe codex supplement fixes some of the gaps in the codex but theres so much that still needs to happen.The orks have lost the linchpin units that other books have to bring great competitive armies togeather. And with special rules that work against them a lot of the time and as a result the book just sucks competitively.On a beer n pretzels fun and games level the ork codex is actually without peer. Get two ork players headhead and watch the car crashes explosions and flaming piles of garbadge that ensue. And with other books that isnt the case.What I think gws rule writing team were trying to do here is casualize the game in a big way. The writing is clearly on the wall there. And with them pulling even further away from supporting major tournaments and events its my theory that gdub isnt just fighting a patent war its waging war on events cashing in as well.If theirs a fantasy tournament they want to organize and fund and hold it all themselves. They dont want nova or lvo to happen. They want them to shutter. They tried holding events of their own in the past and they didnt work. So they binned that idea and now their doing this.Even look at the gk and sw codex. Tournament wise their pretty terrible now. But from a casuals point of view the books probably dont look half bad. In fact the sw looks pretty Damn fun me jelly of the flying ice gun. So tournament players enjoy the matches u have at your events the codecies and brbs will only get worse and worse from here for you.and I wouldnt be surprised if one day those events say fuck it and cancel their support.,Warhammer,ckq30rz,3,t5_2qqd4

Or  devilgaunts.The Toxicrene looks like it could be useful at dragging down other large multiwound models like MCs Wraithlords Dreadknights etc  because while its only WS it wounds on  regardless of Toughness and if it rolls  To Wound thats Instant Death.Also that mechanic applies to its really shitty range  Large Blast as well so you can attempt to plink those big targets on your approach.Then again the Dimachaeron has Instant Death on ALL of its attacks if it uses its Sickle Claws so I lean towards the Dima more in the end.

A good example is Space Marine backpacks  attaching them beforehand usually makes painting shoulder pads a lot harder so its better to leave them off. You used to be able to do this with bolters too! For the Knight I assembled the skeleton completely and painted each armour piece separately before attaching it.

The fact that GW has yet to update the models for certain Ork units has also been a big let down.I feel that th edition was also a big let down.  Now to be fair I have yet to play a game of th but I have read the rulebook cover to cover.  I just dont like some of the new rules and for me some aspects of the game are more tedious now than before while others are not.  Overall I think  has been a tough year for GW.

Its also a rather worthwhile model to build.  If you dont want to do that a jump pack and artificer armor with the shield is almost as good.  For most of my HQs I just pick whatever fancy bits I have lying around and build from that rather than try to modify from any of the single figures out there.  If your local group doesnt strictly enforce WYSIWYG you can just say hes got it and see if you like playing it without the bike.  th Edition is heavily dominated by either constant mobility or being able to alpha strike and occupy the opponents side of the board early.  The Maelstrom missions encourage you to have highly mobile threats.  A Biking CM hits all of the high points.  Theyre able to cover  in one turn if needed can move  and charge functionally immune to small arms and can take on pretty much any melee threat out there if hes got a power fist.

These massive ballistic weapons are deployed in batteries and destroy their targets through the delivery of powerful broadsides of shells fired in volley to overwhelm their enemy in a barrage of destruction. Macrocannons are giant edificesize weapons covered with gantries cranes power lines and pipes manned by a crew that stands hundreds strong. Macrocannons can also be deployed to serve as potent artillery weapons by Imperial ground forces though such instances are rare as these weapons are not very mobile and their range and accuracy drops tremendously when deployed within the confines of a gravity well and atmosphere to the point that their massive firepower can present as much danger to friendly forces as to the foe. The greenskinned and savage xenos known as Orks are also known to make extensive use of crude Macrocannons on their Kroozers and refer to these monstrous weapons simply as Gunz.gtgtImage igtImage igtImage iInteresting Gothicclass Cruiser cruiser | Dominatorclass Cruiser cruiser | Auto Weapons weapons | Capitol Imperialis imperialis Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcnri oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecnri.

Given that units arent under any obligation to retain coherency the odds of a blast template actually hitting more than one model are lowered and you also risk scattering off completely.

2897146,0,t1_cnvayxd,I think the nazi reference is a little strong but I get the point. Its hard to completely take his decision making at the beginning into account mostly because I feel that GW was having to make shit up and some of it didnt match up so you gotta allow a little bit a leniency there. The way I see it the Emperor with his psychic abilities unmatched in the galaxy could and this is just me speculating have some strong sense of seeing the future like the Eldar Farseers. He sees only one way for humanity to prosper but even in doing that there are dangers and risks he must take just for that future to even be a possibility. Just finished the Priests of Mars series the last book talks about the Eldars abilities of this So he takes his risks creating the superhuman primarchs but everything is not perfect and the chaos gods somehow find out probably figured out there had to be a reason for this huge blank spot in the galaxy they couldnt see.The one flaw in his workings that hasnt been addressed is why the primarchs genes allowed them to be imprinted upon by their upbringing. Why did Leman Russ DNA randomly acquire the Canus Helix which just so happened to fit perfectly with the area he was recovered? and so on and so on. I believe the qoute from Ian Malcolm Jurassic Park fits perfectly here something along the lines of you stood on the shoulders of giants and continued work as if it was your own you focused on what you could do and never stopped to think if you actually should do itTo have that burden of knowing if you dont succeed humanity is doomed drove him to do things obviously a little too quickly once he thought he was finally on track. He had to wait until the time was right during the age of strife to finally take the reigns and unite the world. Seal the pact with Mars and make his sons. Then and this was obviously his biggest mistake left his favored son in charge of his armies knowing his sons squabbled like any other brothers. He attempted to tell his psychic son to quit it because he didnt want to feed the Chaos gods which happened to basically be his undoing. I think the Emperor did what he had to do for a chance at having humanity live. I dont know if its been talked about as to why he wouldnt attempt to bring about some sort of pact with other races of beings but that I would like to know.  ,Warhammer,cnxes4e,2,t5_2qqd4

3006463,0,t1_co8thep,Its not the imbalance that makes the game fun its the ability to play out a scenario and role in a universe youve invested in with an army you feel as your own. You take responsibility for your army as you play out the game in front of you. The amount of balance in the game should be created by the player and not the developer. If you want to try and play a  vs  pt game than thats your prerogative. This said i have to repeat that those decisions should be user made not inherently brought upon the player by the game creator. The worst thing that could happen is if you start getting circular levels of power within the game. This is only true for k table top because of how expensive it is. You need to have all armies be in equal footing while the customization occurs when youre building lists. But for armies like eldar tau and deamons its just broken. Yes its a challenge to play them and for some thats enjoyable but often times it gets old fast when you realize the armies are broken at their core. On the other side of the coin you have armies like dark angels and CSM who were brought to their knees by th edition. Hell half of the dark angel codex rules are useless now that unbound is brought in. And especially having an army that prioritizes bikes ends up biting you because of what happened to jink saves. ,Warhammer,co9m900,0,t5_2qqd4

3097924,0,t1_coj39ay,Thanks for the detailed reply. I got back into the game last April. Ive now got about pts of Eldar so i can make a variety of different lists with them. Ive got to the point with them where I almost never lose but I dont find them that much fun to play for various reasons the main one being that its not very dramatic to constantly run away shooting.The idea with this army was to build the exact opposite to my Eldar. I pretty much bought the Chaos Attack force plus a few additions so i knew going in that it wasnt going to be brilliantly optimised. My opponent has been playing CSM exclusively for about  years.The first game  the relic went ok. I went first the Rhino drove up the field and the marines got out and grabbed the relic. The cultists went with them. The Raptors Bloodthirster and Maulerfiend charged up the field to try and delay his army in CC whilst the marines got away. Then his land raider blew up the rhino killing almost all my cultists. His blob of cultists charged into the maulerfiend and held it up for the rest of the game. Turn  the CSM ran away a bit. and the Raptors shot and charged the land raider taking it down to  HP. The bloodthirster failed to charge his CSM blob. My terminators misshaped and went back into reserves. Then his Berserkers got out of the land raider and charged the Raptors his Obliterators and Terminators deep striked and killed the Bloodthirster and the CSM whittled away a couple of my CSM squad with plasma.Basically from this point on everyone was bogged down in CC except the CSM who got shot up by the Oblits. Then turn  I finally managed to get the Terminators in who grabbed the relic. Turn  they still held it and the bloodletters finally managed to turn up without misshapping but all they did was get shot. Turn  he killed the last terminator and won the game on first blood and warlord.Game  was much the same. The mauler fiend went for the Landraider but ended up getting tar pitted. Just too many cultists spread out. The Bloodthirster failed to charge again. The Raptors failed to charge. They both ended up getting destroyed by the Berserkers and Kharn. Kharn turned into a Daemon Prince which was cool. Eventually all my stuff got killed in CC.The Heldrake was good but it only managed to shoot a couple of times each game. It killed a handful of guys each time it shot but never managed to break anything or destroy any units. The terminators did nothing really. The blood letters did nothing. The Bloodthirster was OK but Kharn was better. The mauler fiend got tar pitted and eventually destroyed by the Apostle both games. The Rhino got destroyed immediately both games and achieved very little. Pretty much the only unit that was any good was the Raptors and even they basically failed to achieve their goal.,Warhammer,coj3kc9,2,t5_2qqd4
3098076,0,t1_coj3taf,It was certainly a steep learning curve but then i noticed that I was doing things that I would never do with my Eldar. Youre right deep striking the Bloodletters was a mistake and I would never do that with an Eldar CC unit.

I dont blame you its a stubbornlooking thing. And yes from some angles it looks decent namely the ones where you cant see the WWstyle suspension nor how comical the turrets top profile is.But any proper redesign would have become just as iconic over the years without being marred by the nonsensical oldschool flaws the Russ still has.Its a bit like the old Rhinos and Land Raiders imo. People loved them way back when GW realized there was value in updating them and so they did and people love the new design.I wish theyd do the same for the Leman Russ. Make it slightly bigger now you can actually fit the amount of shells it supposedly carries for protracted combat the  or  man crew it packs the interchangeable power plant the road wheels and suspension the gun breech optics etcetera.Size down the tank gun caliber a bit make it look less Orky.Give it running gear with actual clearance etcetera.Right now its a tank that relies on one argument to continue existing as it does its iconic we cant change it.,Warhammer,coyxxdc,4,t5_2qqd4

3374673,0,t3_2ysbni,All GW wanted  was to take things off the rails it has been stuck on for so long.  Personally I like mundane Warhammer. Modest armies with a unique background and eccentric general marching around for whatever typical reason they found and engaging with whatever host they cross.  th Edition was really powerful in this. It encouraged players to carve out their own piece of Old World without worrying too much about the own narrative GW said out. Even the Storm of Chaos was just another incursion by Archaon getting his ass kicked by Grimgor and booted back to northern wastes again.   After that technology allowed for bigger models and the lore grew around it. Stakes kept climbing to the point of the End Times.  But in the end its just a scale that you can pick a point on yourself. Whether its a few obscure regions in the old world or yeah the fucking End of Time is up to you. ,Warhammer,cpcxrjh,14,t5_2qqd4

3541302,0,t3_30tqr3,As a mechanized guard player Id say dozer blades are a must. You have recovery gear but I say that it is more important to avoid being immobilized in the first place. Buying dozer blades allows you to hug terrain closer and possibly gain a save while recovery gear means that you essentially have to lose a hull point before it becomes useful. Now Ive never used a Wyvern but I used to use Basilisks. Id ditch it and possibly try to squeeze in a basic Russ instead. The Wyvern is going to die without protection and at  points its not going to have the protection it needs in a mechanized list. Extra armor on the Russ squadron is interesting youll have to let me know how that goes with the new th rules! Im also rejoining after a hiatus That  is stunned now is big. Vehicles can live! In that same train of thought though your HKs are far less valuable and may be better spent elsewhereNow for the troops!Id ditch the vox casters unless you have points to spare your troops will be mounted up a lot so they wont be receiving as many orders. You have Meltas in both vet squads but depending on your foe it may be overkill. Swapping that out for some grenade launchers could keep you mobile with some longer ranged fire power. Finally Id ditch the regimental standard for a medipack and take some plasma guns in that ccs Though honestly I always take a Standard in addition to the medipack because they look coolI like your list overall though! Its tons of fun to play mech guard now that hp are a thing. Oh and one last thing you cant take autocannons on chimeras. I hope this helps somewhat.Oh and just saw your last thing I dont think that master of ordinance gets it unless you buy it for him.

I dont want it to clash with black templars or iron hands though. I also dont want to highlight it as much as either of those two.Maybe if I drybrush the edges with necron compound or edge highlight with runefang steel.

The shooty hellbrute in a  point dreadclaw is one of the worst ideas Ive ever seen sorry no offense but that is a giant tactical turd you would be so much better off using the murderpack formation with base hellbrutes for the deepstrike and target saturation   points gives you  deepstriking ITWND hellbrutes that all come in on one roll and dont take up any elite slots.  Alternatively grab maulerfiends they are a great unit that if played smart and tactically are insanely effective for their points.Burning brand andor black mace on chaos lord will serve you well taking just a power weapon on your CC warlord isnt gonna do much of anything for him.  I would drop the chaos bikers and take nurgle chaos spawn and give your warlord a bike for him to go with them they move at the same speed and you get a ton of T ablative wound for him that still are decent in CC.

4110317,0,t3_37mo8s,My very first game ever was flailing useless Marines vs. Tau. One squad Id picked because they looked awesome was a man Terminator Command Squad th ed when such things existed with a Terminator Chaplain and a Heavy Flamer dude.  My army got systematically disassembled by an experienced Tau player for the first couple turns but start of turn  I rolled for my Terminators to come in from reserve. He had his fire warrior squads in literal gun lines  warriors deep on his side of the table and I successfully deep striked directly between the two squads. Turning my flamer on one I wiped it out except for one guy who I couldnt get because he was too close the narrow end of the template coould only cover one of the two guys immediately in front of me. That Fire Warrior preceded to run for his life and eventually exited the table.His turn comes along and the second squad of firewarriors went ahead and opened up every pulse round pinging uselessly off my nighindestructible tactical dreadnought armour. I was thinking things were turning around Id be able to chase everything down and maybe at least tie the game. But then he had one last thing to do to them.Just behind his firewarriors he had the spotter for a sniper drone team. The drones had be destroyed earlier when he misjudged distances and flew them too close to my Dreadnought and his assault cannon so the spotter had nothing else to do. My opponent pulls out his codex and starts checking wargear and comes up that yes the spotter does have a pulse pistol. He then moves up to within pistol range and immediately snipes off one of my Terminators with his pistol.Comes around to my turn I plow through the second fire warrior squad leave them bolting for their table edge and consolidate my terminators to go after them. His turn starts he rallies the fire warriors and again pings a dozen odd pulserounds off my armour. At this point the spotter is already within range of the pistol so he planted his feet and opened fire. In th ed if you remained stationary you could elect to double tap with pistols but that prevented you from charging. Now since he had no intention of charging a lone Tau at a quartet of terminators he took this option... and killed two more of my terminators.Statistically it was basically impossible. I had lost  terminators in  turns to a dude with a pulse pistol. Anger overwhelmed me and I charged the spotter instead of the fire warriors determined to eliminate what seemed to be the biggest threat to my squad. In the first round of combat my chaplain whiffed everything at I then the spotter went at I and I can only assume walked up to the squad sergeant who wasnt paying attention put his pistol against the mans eye and blew his brains out. One Tau spotter had killed four terminators essentially with his bare hands. My opponent was talking about giving him a medal until his assault phase rolled around and my chaplain finally connected with his Crozius leaving a large bluish smear on the battlefield to recieve those commendations. My Chaplain then charged his firewarriors but they just swamped him and beat him to death in close combat on turn  and I lost the game badly.,Warhammer,crosutc,9,t5_2qqd4

4470494,0,t1_csu3zjj,. Working out magnetisation is fairly easy. Just count how many arms you have. Youll need one magnet in a models shoulder hole thing then one attached to each arm type that you want. I believe Nobz should be fairly easy to magnetise because I dont think they have many twohanded weapons. Twohanded weapons are a bit trickier to magnetise because you need to align them. Assuming Nobz work primarily with weapons in each hand then its simply gathering up all the arms and sticking magnets in all of them then sticking them in the shoulder whenever you want. The only tips I can give are drill carefully and be mindful of magnet polarity. Test the magnets to make sure you inserted them in a way that lets them stick not repel each other before you start pulling out super glue.. Not my field Im afraid. Cant answer that.. Unbound Lists are not inherently evil. The hate mostly stems from the potential evil. Generally when a player wants to bypass for organisation limits theyre planning on bringing something that is imbalanced. Also keep in mind the main draw of Battleforged armies is Objective Secured but a lot of players never play with objectives. They just play to kill each other.Unbound Lists get hate because players use Unbound Lists as a way to get  Riptides into a  point game. Or bring an Imperial Knight to a  Point game. There is essentially NO practical way to deal with those kinds of setups if youre playing Battleforged lists at the same size and geared up for killing infantry and light vehicles normally present at these point sizes. It just isnt fun unless you specifically tailor your list to engage the enemy.The main issue with Unbound Armies is that going Unbound implies you are trying to get around restrictions to bring something that is impractically powerful. Players who play fluffy lorecentric armies can generally do just fine with the basic  HQ  Troops restriction. Unbound isnt even about fluff. Its about taking multiple superheavies into  point games or bringing Leman Russes into  point matches where nothing can even penetrate the armour effectively. And since a lot of players dont play with objectives the loss of Objective Secured is irrelevant. When players use Unbound to do this sort of thing it makes it seriously unfun for the opponents.There are situations where Unbound Armies are okay but those are by and large less common but I honestly cant think of many. Most of the time when the word Unbound comes up people conjure up images of gargantuan creatures stomping on a player whose heaviest vehicle is a Chimera or a Leman Russ dropped into killteam sized matches.,Warhammer,csu6hhq,4,t5_2qqd4

4558177,0,t3_3dh68s,I remember when I started k when I was in th grade and me and my buddies all had our own named characters and our favorite squads. We would put our what felt like personal armies into a variety of home made scenarios any where from enacting some hopeless defence outnumbered  or a small skirmish escalating into a larger battle as we brought more of our armies on the table. At no point we ever thought to argue about what was fair or about the composition of our armies we played with minis we thought were cool and had a sentimental value to us.As time went on and I got older and k progressed to later editions I started playing less in my basement with my friends and started playing at the local GW since many of my friends stopped playing. At the local store there were a lot of different people not bad people or that guy in any way but people who liked to put models on the table to win. Over time I guess I started hating seeing my character and his group of brave warriors pounded into the dirt over and over so I started changing more and more things trying to get to the point where my heroes would come out on top. And honestly I think I lost something on the way.As I write this now I havent played a game of k since early th edition I lost pretty much all drive to play the game I still paint a model or two every so often just for fun but I never have a desire to put them on the table. Its kinda funny though I had binders full of notes about my original army and their background that I always had so much fun writing up. Maybe this all is nostalgia but I think the moment we start caring about what the units do for us in a gameplay sense and start to forget about the for lack of a better word spirit of the game.My resolution Im having right now is with my new Stormcast Eternal army Im starting Im going to keep a journal of all my heroes and battles to keep track of their brave deeds and maybe though some way channel a bit of that feeling I got when I put my army on the table every school night in th grade.,Warhammer,ct56du7,3,t5_2qqd4

4559659,0,t3_3dia14,The topic of points and balance have thanks to the recent release of Age of Sigmar been a hotly contested topic for the last few weeks. I generally tried to stay out of flame wars because after all this is the internet and we all know what is said about internet arguments... However I was no longer to stay silent when I saw an older article pop up written by Game Workshops long term strategy manager Jervis Johnson titled Points Values Who Need Em?!? You can read the article in the pictures belowPoints Values Who Need Em?!?Page For the remainder of this article you should have the context of this article so please do read it. The first page and the first column in particular I found both insulting and wildly out of touch. The main thrust of his article makes a few points. Tournament gamers only play to win and a disproportionate are beardy or WAAC. Tournament gaming and tournaments destroy what the hobby is really all about. Tournament gaming is directly opposed to painting and the playstyle is unimaginative and uninspired. Scenario based games and campaigns are the pinnacle of the hobby as it should be. Scenario and campaign games have no need for point values or preset win conditions. Points and even matchups are the cause and death of casual play and scenario and campaign based gaming for the wider community.One thing that needs to be defined from this list is in Mr. Johnsons terminology scenario based games seem to be inherently unbalanced. He cites and dismisses that players will not attend tournaments that use what he defines as scenarios because they are unfair. From this and his further use of the term scenario Mr Johnson defines scenarios as narrative stories that give a background to the game and as stories go do not involve a fair fight. Well come back to this in a bit.Starting from the beginning of the article Mr. Johnson comes across as accusatory and alternately insulting and dismissive to the tournament community. Yes the root of tournament gaming is a competition but that doesnt mean the majority of players are only there to win. Some are sure but that holds true at the local gaming store too. There is also a difference between competition and winning many people myself included dont go to events expecting to win but instead to measure themselves against their peers and evaluate the strength of their list and their play. Next he accuses tournament play as destroying what the hobby is all about which looking forward in the article seems to be about a combination of the hobby side of the game and playing narrative games only. From a current point of view this feels like a game developer getting mad at gamers for only playing the online multiplayer mode of the game. I will concede that without requirements for painting people will bring unpainted armies. However again this is not something that is unique to the tournament setting. Games at my local store more often than not feature partly or completely unpainted armies. Same goes for games at my house unless were making a point of only playing painted models someone usually wants to try out something new and see how it works in game. If anything big tournaments have become some of the best showcases for the hobby. Every year at NOVA I try to make a point of wandering the hall and check out all of the cool armies. The Adepticon Teams Tournament is legendary for the themed displays and armies. With the death of GamesDay in the states there is really no other forum for hobbyists to show off their beautiful armies to a large number of people and fellow gamers than at tournaments.For point  this is frankly an opinion. According to Mr. Johnson we should all aspire to narrative gaming. This is how he gets the most enjoyment out of the hobby and I have to question why it has to be in his mind the only way the hobby should be enjoyed. Again this seems like a creator getting mad at his audience for connecting with it in different ways. I have nothing against narrative play and campaigns as a tournament gamer. I would love to play narrative games and have epic campaigns but the reality is that I do not have the time. Additionally as his article concludes to some degree the game shouldnt be taken just as it is from the company which really calls into question why Mr. Johnsons preferred mode of play should be the esteemed way to play to begin with. In the fifth point Mr. Johnson states that points are superfluous when crafting a narrative scenario for a game. This is true but not entirely. Mr. Johnson and his friends in the design studio are fully capable of tossing the points out the window and still having a reasonably balanced game in large part because they have institutional knowledge they invented the game and have played it in some form or another for decades. On an instinctual level they can balance the two sides without points.Not all players have access to the knowledge of how all units and models match up on an instinctual level like Mr. Johnson would. So while he would know that a narrative story where  Space Marines try to stem the tide of daemons lead by a pantheon of greater daemons wont go as planned without breaking more elements of the game someone just picking up the game wont without referencing the fact that his story might be pitting  points against . In this instance points help newer players balance their own scenarios even if those scenarios are intended to be unbalanced. Point six is where I get lost a bit and return to an old adage from NOVAs Mike Brandt Balance doesnt hurt casual play and it helps everyone. Removing points and balance doesnt help anyone but it hurts attempts to play strangers in an organized fashion. Balance on the other hand helps everyone. Its well accepted that if youre running a story based game you dont need even points but having points in place in the background does not hinder that style of play at all. Removing balance hinders people who dont have the time or community available to them to regularly sit down with other gamers and talk out all the unresolved issues in an unbalanced game. Removing balance also hinders people looking to join the hobby as they lack the institutional knowledge of the entire game and how to work out a balanced game. Finally removing balance hinders anyone not in a regular gaming group and makes gaming groups insular as theyve adopted house rules that can exclude people from joining. A balanced game is inclusive an unbalanced game is not. In reading this article I consistently go back to the thought that its a reflection of an author not happy about the way their work is being interpreted. There are entire tomes of essays on Authorial Intent and the fallacy of it but it boils down to dictating that one approach is superior to another which is simply an opinion. Mr. Johnson expresses the belief that any semblance of competitive organized play leads to the death and destruction of the game as he envisioned it. The idea that a healthy competitive game precludes a game with an immersive narrative is patently false. You only have to look at other game systems that have immersive backdrops for the game and tightly balanced rules sets with recommendations for tournament play. Fantasy Flights Star Wars games and Wyrds Malifaux come to mind. Wyrd has chosen to somewhat split the two with their release of Crossroads an RPGlike campaign take on the main game but theyre still based on the same system they also provide narrative missions and scenarios for people to play out and have immense amounts of original backstory items being released regularly in their free newsletter as well as other publications.Fantasy Flight has the immense Star Wars universe to pull from and tons of narrative elements that can be inserted into any game be it Luke making bombing runs on a Star Destroyer in Armada or Darth Vader force choking opponents from his Tie Advanced in XWing. At the same time the game is balanced regularly FAQd and Fantasy Flight provides guidance for tournament play which includes advised ways of setting up forces for a standard game. Part of force creation in Armada is selecting missions that have hints of a narrative element and could be easily expanded to fit a narrative or campaign if so desired.The main problem I have with Mr. Johnsons article is that it is in the end adversarial and divisive. As such its somewhat a wonder that a company would publish such an article when it demeans and demonizes a portion of its consumer base. That said divisiveness is a serious issue for the gaming community and one that is not helped by Mr. Johnsons article. There is no right way to play the game despite Mr. Johnsons assertions and everyone should be free to play the game as they see fit. I dont have the answers but I can say that blaming a consumer base is not the best way to solve a problem and removing balance does not increase the appeal of a game. A tight ruleset with definitive answers to rules questions makes for a more straightforward and enjoyable gaming experience. Edit This is the article text,Warhammer,ct5d2fa,2,t5_2qqd4

4618152,0,t1_ctc1czy,Yeah my friend gave me his old tyranid army so I painted it up and played a few games with it.  I feel like most units have almost no options and expected them to have many.  I feel like after reading a ultramarines novel about fighting them the rules do a poor job of letting you really customize and evolve your bug swarm.I think in the old book you could buy extra carapace for increase armor saves and you could buy extra attacks on most units and extra strength and poison etc.Right now it feels pretty limited you can add poison but its expensive and you cant give them armor at all.  You can also buy furious charge but again its pricey and only works if you get a charge.  Finally you can get poison which is probably fairly priced but nothing else.Hell I would think an army based around evolving swarms of bugs and monsters to kill all foes would have a lot more army wide options and unit options.Itd be super neat if you could take chameleonic skin for all units giving them stealth for example and shrouded if they already had it etc.Itd also be neat to be able to do a feel no pain upgrade for units like a sort of frenzy or regeneration themed upgrade maybe on the big bugs they could make that upgrade give the current regen  feel no paint to make it actually good in big games.Itd also be cool to be able to give your base units flesh hooks or some other assault grenade option.  Hormagaunts really lose some of their mojo if the enemy hides in cover so do genestealers.I just felt like they could have had some really cool evolution themed things in the book and could have even done some neat things that could be for each hive fleet make them work like space marine chapter special rules etc. so its just some missed opportunities for real flavor.The orks got it worse of all though I feel like they used to be so random and fun with neat rules and random stuff all over the place trukks being my favorite example and now trukks are just boring and stupid.

4668538,0,t1_ctj06ul,Oh its cool I dont blame anyone but myself.  It was already bothering me when I kept seeing the flat surface on the bolt pistol and the storm bolters so I went to the net and then tried it out.  I most likely will just do it on the unpainted arms next time as I have quite a few extra commander bolters and the hobby knife idea is a good one.   The paint seems to make the drill slip a bit and that is especially problematic with things like the bolt pistol as it has the hollow portion in the barrel.  Ive masked it was paint right now and the meltagun is just a small hole so I can handle that with green stuff without any issues. I doubt youll see me doing it on the next Valkyries Lascannon as any kind of mess up there would not be fun but once I get some practice in on my bit box I will try again!,Warhammer,ctj0tjr,1,t5_2qqd4

4724921,0,t3_3fmaco,Another sentiment Ive seen written on the Wood elf Forum that I really feel captivates my feelings about AoSgt Unbelievable unfreakingbelievable.GW designs a game to produce fun casual beer and pretzel games for the living room basement or wherever. A game that before it starts both sides can agree on what their going to play the terrain they are going to use etc. Theyve already decided if they are going to play each other. And whats the first thing we do? We arrange tournaments. All options are taken away from the players. Jim cant say Aw come on Joe. Are you really going to play that? Are we doing WAAC or what? The only option Jim has is to not play against his assigned opponent. If he does that he automatically loses. Heck he might even be thrown out of the tournament. So now a game that was designed for creating a fun shared experience becomes a game all about winning.gt We start fretting about balance . If there was balance in point based games everyone would play Lyrans as likely as they would play Federation everyone would play Italy as much as Germany. If there was balance Space Marines wouldnt be the number one selling army and Beastmen wouldnt be the worst selling army. If there was balance even in our own book Treekin models wouldnt be collecting dust on shelves. Balance is an illusion. Play chess checkers or go if you want real balance.gt Warhammer Fantasy roots is a combination of historical miniature wargaming and Dungeons amp Dragons. Back then most of wargaming wasnt point based. What one fielded on the table was representative of the troops that were at the actual battle. With AoS GW is giving us an opportunity to play a nonpoint based game. Lets at least give it a full hearted try before we start distorting it with house rules.So where does the balance come from? The balance comes from us. We talk to our friend about what he or she is playing. We get each others opinions about what each of us has and whether this would balance. If they dont then we adjust. The more we play the more experience we have and we can adjust accordingly. Of course the more fun way is simply to get into an arms race. That would be the incentive for me to finally assemble and paint all those models I havent gotten around to yet.gtAlso If Ive arranged a game with a WAAC player Ill bring a WAAC list. If its someone less experienced has fewer models etc. then Ill place models on the table accordingly. gt We are accustomed to building a list that requires core units we even refer to it as the core tax. For years we have built our model collection filling core requirements first and then the really cool models we wanted all along. To address a fast growing market GW has flipped that. With AoS a new player will get the really cool models first and as he or she build their list they will add the rank and file later. They also require fewer models to begin playing.gt Not going to take this game serious. Thats being way too serious about AoS. I think in general we are way too serious about this hobby of ours. Whats the harm if someone has to cluck like a duck or whatever to get some benefit? If that person has a big enough sense of humor to choose a unit that that is a requirement what right do any of us have to spoil the fun by saying Oh no you dont have to do that. Is this too embarrassing for us. Lets not be hoitytoity about it. Relax and enjoy the fun. After all it doesnt matter how finely detailed our models are it doesnt matter that the painting is museum quality to an outsider they see grown men playing with little boys toys. I would rather they see us grown men laughing and smiling with surprise and delight when one of our own breaks out into clucking session rather than wearing a serious scowl while we play with our toy soldiers. Who knows maybe they would like to join in on the fun? So I think we all should step back a bit adopt a teeny bit of a sense of humor and try not to make AoS into what it isnt.By Sidewinder on the Asrai forum,Warhammer,ctq46y3,6,t5_2qqd4

5294479,0,t3_3nh4dn,Rust Tear off a little bit of blisterpack foam Dip an edge of the foam into your rusty colour of choice I would usually start with a lighter brown colour like Balor Brown or Tau Light Ochre Dab the now paint loaded foam onto a dry paper towel to get most of it off like dry brushing you dont want it to be too wet. Lightly dab the foam onto the areas of the model you want there to be rust. Dont just bash it on all at once. Take your time and build up the colour. You should get a broken and randomised pattern of rustylooking spots. Repeat the process with a lighter orangelike colour Trollslayer Orange or Jokero Orange. Again take it slow and try to get the lighter orange on top of the areas youve already covered with brown. If you find that youve covered up too much of the metal you can use the foam again to dab on some Leadbelcher. Alternatively you can use a fine detail brush to draw some scratches or scuffs onto the metal areas to make it look like the rust has been scuffed off.,Warhammer,cvofjbn,3,t5_2qqd4

Now there is more freedom space wise which also contributes. Personally as someone who plays k but never really got into Warhammer I appreciated its unique and detailed universe and the different rules.

5533740,0,t3_3qwq9l,OH MY GOD YOU ARE ADORABLE COME LET ME CORRUPT YOUOkay umm. Yes. Its a great hobby and its easy to fall in love with. And lots and lots of people myself included got into the hobby from the games. Despite GW being a bunch of dipshits and seriously saying that the games arent as major an investment because it attracts few players to the miniatures hobby. Morons.Anyway uh. Your questions.. Painting miniatures and armies in colour schemes not directly from lore is one of the main practices of the hobby. GW is quite explicit about their display models and lore colour schemes being a guideline and inspiration for your own army. The key point is YOUR army. An army you make truly unique and your own. This is the exact reason the Space Marine codex has many many pages dedicated to nothing but Space Marine heraldry colour schemes symbolism and symbol arrangement and then notes in these pages that these are simply guidelines and chapters literally do what they please in reality. And why the Imperial Knight codex has dozens of pages depicting example heraldry and arrangement of heraldry and symbols then gives you Freeblades Who paint gates and pink and skeletal birds onto themselves and theres even one knight who marched into a volcano to burn off his heraldry. Fucking badass.A major part of the hobby is painting your army how you want. Most players who build customs chapters or regiments or craftworlds or septs or whatevers with their own lore try to paint and develop their lore in a manner that might plausibly fit into the universe. But a lot of players dont even do that and just go nuts. YOU are spending an outrageous amount of money on this hobby and YOU deserve to paint those miniatures however YOU WANT.If you want to paint the Dark Angels a different scheme do it. However anyone who is particularly picky will note that Dark Angels have distinct symbols like winged swords covering their armour and capes. If youre a lorerealism junkie you need to justify that. Otherwise theyre your models. Paint them however you want. Cloaks and winged swords are badass.There are people who have painted Hello Kitty and Angry Marine themed armies. Its less of a matter of which colours you pick than the quality of the work and whether you are satisfied.,Warhammer,cwizfon,1,t5_2qqd4

They only fire as if it were a single unit and only if they target the same unit at the same time they do not count as being a single unit in any other circumstance or for any other effect. And no Fire Team and Tank Hunter are different. Tank Hunter specifically applies to any model in the same unit as a model with that special rule. Fire Team specifically requires a unit to be made up of  of the same model as in one elite slot  ghostkeels not  elite slots  ghost keels. Not  elite slots  ghostkeels and a riptide.

5579541,0,t1_cwohrpj,Thats an interesting theory. My personal theory is that they want a constantly shifting meta. By repeatedly moving the goal posts of what armiesunits are most effective they create interest in new products. If everything that they released was perfectly balanced I actually think the community would stagnate. There wouldnt be all the blogs and forums. It would be oh look another perfectly balanced unit to go with all my other perfectly balanced units.  What they should aspire to is making every model effective. The Eldar codex is a good example of a rule set where every unit is effective. It might be more powerful than some other armies but only for the time being. Something else will come out that is better. And then another thing and well all debate it and itll keep the game fresh. ,Warhammer,cwoozph,7,t5_2qqd4

5677952,0,t3_3svx75,I have to agree with people the odds of them merging the codexes are very slim.  What I think GW needs to do if they are going to make these armies more and more individualized is to start adding more specific elements to them to further separate the marines.  For example when the Space Wolves were released and I heard of the new ice guns I was so sure that the regular marines would get a hand held version similar to the grav guns.  This didnt happen and I was a bit surprised since it would have really highlighted a cool new option.  You could do the same with dark angels and blood angels as well Im not sure what  maybe something plasma for the DA and something blood for the BA haha.  I do wish the dreads would at least get an errata stating some basic changes to consolidate the codexes a bit like giving all dreads  attacks base something both BA and SW would make sense for since there is a cc focus,Warhammer,cx0wmk3,2,t5_2qqd4

6137484,0,t1_cyn623g,I have played a few.  I downloaded the wall scrolls for the th edition army units and used my current army setups.  Dark Elf fast units and cold ones with  sorceresses and a Malus Darkblade rule set that my opponents agreed was fair.While they were setting up in manners youve described I just set up my army on the outside edge of the field numbered my target groups then charged.As long as I used that strategy I won.  As long as I used that strategy I couldnt loose.  No one found a way to break it.Nuke the spellcaster with mine rush the heavy hitters so they couldnt move far.  Smash with the cold ones repeat for the next unit.Now to answer one of your points.As much as Ive lauded th edition...  To be honest its only because what its rules accomplished was making the game feel like I was in charge of a battle.AoS doesnt.It feels like Im playing checkers or Magic The Gathering.th was too overcomplicated totally ill conceived and no matter how they adjusted it it was always exploit broken.If we took AoS and expanded it to maybe  to  total pages for the core rule book and keep the wallscrolls for the units.  I would be happy with unit based organized move shoot charge system that allowed for a few bonuses for terrain and battlefield tactics.If that were the case I probably wouldnt have anything to complain about.I agree with you th needed to go.  But AoS doesnt feel like a good replacement to me.A good parallel game a good skirmish intro game but not a war game.,Warhammer,cyn9myp,4,t5_2qqd4

Youre not not getting anything from it Id it switch to a Combined Arms Detachment. This way you dont have to have the Vyper or the pointless single Warlock on the Jetbike. Also if you switch to a CAD all of your Windriders will get Objective Secured which should help. With the minimum squad Windriders youre not going to be getting much done. If one dies youre likely to run away in the first turn. Consider putting a few more in each squad and definitely look at swapping the Catapults for either a Cannon or Scatter Laser.The Aspect Host is strange Id go for the  Ballistic Skill instead of Weapon Skill with the units you have in it. Also Id take the Scorpions out of the Wave Serpent and let them Infiltrate. Also Id upgrade the Serpents to have a Shuriken Cannon instead of the Catapult.You can put the Fire Prisms in the CAD but take Cannons on them as well you dont want anything within  of them so Catapults are useless.The Seer Council can be good but its expensive and it dies easily especially if its not on Jetbikes. Plus youre going to struggle keeping up with the rest of your army on foot. Also take the Spirit Stone of Anathlan its amazing and you should always have it on a Farseer if you have one.Youre missing antitank apart from the Fire Dragons and antiair.

Sometime around late DecemberEarly January you publish an article basically saying A Preview of the Year Ahead. You offer a slight preview of your first quarter releases and hint and tease at what might come over the following three quarters. Release windows should be one month as opposed to one week and not  months like FFGs. This gives people enough time to set aside cash for purchases gives retailers enough time to gauge interest establish inventorystock levels and place orders some of my local gaming stores have cut back sharply on GW orders because they kept getting burned they would either over or under estimate interest in releases resulting in severe overstocks of some items and lost sales due to product shortages on other items as well as allowing GW to ride some marketing hype for its own products because currently there is no hype.

For the red on this kit I airbrushed  progressively brighter shades of red over a black undercoat then I washed the recesses with agrax and highlighted evil sunz scarlet and wildrider red over the raised areas by hand.

6988113,0,t3_4belki,Ambitious for a first model to post! Horus is a tough model with a lot of detail and my first major compliment is that youve kept your paints pretty thin and preserved a lot of that detail. For most people who feel confident enough to tackle a Primarch youre halfway between base colours and additional layers. Youre off to a great start but theres still a ways to go. It looks like youre very very heavy on dry brushing as a technique. Theres nothing wrong with dry brushing but it has its time a place. Id set this bad boy aside for a little while and experiment with some wet blending for the cape and shading using inks and shades face the gold etc. Again good start but Horus deserves a lot of time and I think youve got the brush control to make him shine  you just need some practice with other techniques and hes a tough model to learn on. ,Warhammer,d18fzjt,6,t5_2qqd4
6999023,0,t1_d19aaer,Id agree with uspecolar on this one. a Mortar is best when you have multiples of them to take advantage of Barrage. Likewise your low BS  means that a single shot heavy weapon is a  hit chance. id only be taking one if you are really lacking in heavy AT.An autocannon is a good compromise in strength and shots. Id only take a heavy bolter against lighter armies such as eldar orks or nids.Are you buying the gun for the Line?

All I would say in far of suggestions is to make sure the coat of white on the toesfingers is more solid the color looks a bit splotchy. Personally for the bony bits I would Base coat them in  coats of Rakarth flesh then wash with Agrax earthshade then dry brush or highlight with Ushabti Bone. Other than that try drybrushing Ryza rust on the bumps and fins on his backs and other highly raised areas it will make those bits stick out more and give the model more definition ,Warhammer,d1d9154,2,t5_2qqd4

7102496,0,t1_d1krno0,Chaos DoombullViolent and brutal shock troopers from the Abyss Chaos Doombulls are Baphomets most prized warriors. These fiends are the spirits of Minotaurs who went on rampages so bloodsoaked and destructive to impress the Horned Lord himself. They roam the massive labyrinths and the scarred plains of their masters realm occasionally massing together in great hordes to wage war on another layer. Unhampered with burdensome strategy or tactics Chaos Doombulls fly into rages so mighty that many earthly Minotaurs worship them as minor deities and pray for the chance to become on in their own afterlife.Chaos Doombulls can generally be described as even more demonic Minotaurs. Standing  feet tall their great horns are now complemented by tusks jutting out of the creatures mouth. Doombulls rarely wear armor instead letting their rage carry them through massive injuries. Hanging from their necks and belts are often skulls horns teeth and other trophies from past battles that allow a Doombull to place its stake in whatever horde its moving into.Like most demons Chaos Doombulls dont work together well. In fighting is common and the only thing keeping a horde together is a stronger more violent leader. While Doombulls are mostly confined to Baphomets layer some can be seen bullying lesser demons on other layers into forming smaller hordes. During battle Doombulls can often be seen cannibalizing their foes sometimes before death has taken them. On the rare occasion a Doombull comes to the Prime Material they set about reorganizing whatever cult brought them there into a band of roaming warriors. This has the intended goal of either slaughtering the entire worlds population or more commonly killing all the cult members in bloody battle.Example Encounter While investigating several occult occurrences the party finds a farmstead where the father is conducting a ritual to fill himself with demonic energy. The ritual is botched when the PCs show up and the resulting magic flows into a cow who swiftly begins to mutate...Example Adventure The party tasked with trying to find Baphomets lair must speak with the only Chaos Doombull that knows its location. Unfortunately he was captured by Yeenoghu and is chained up in his realm awaiting a torturous death.Example Campaign It is often said that a Minotaurs soul is a maze in and of itself and if one were to memorize its layout they may bend the creature to his or her whims. The party receives a letter from a mysterious figure named Sudelaad who promises to pay them heavily for completing a maze that he has built. Even though this has the words bad idea written in flaming gold above it the party ventures inside anyway. What they encounter is a structure larger than should be physically possible with hedge mazes populated by roving bands of Twig Blights ice mazes crawling with four armed Yetis and sandstone mazes where strangly pacifistic Ogres speak about the Horned King dethroned. The only constant is the Chaos Doombulls who for the most part ignore the party but seem to be keen on keeping the maze well maintained. One thing is for certain the party must reach the center of the maze. But where are they? Who is Sudelaad and why does he want you to complete the maze? The reveal is up to you but Im partial to the idea that Sudelaad is using the party to help memorize the maze layout so he can take control of the Demon Prince Baphomet himself. ,Warhammer,d1lfv94,10,t5_2qqd4

7255607,0,t1_d22vj0w,Unfortunately not  each Detachment has its own set of corecommandauxiliary formations. You could however look at the Angels of Death supplement coming out on Saturday as it has a number of new detachments for things like Iron Hands Imperial Fists Raven Guard and White Scars that you could take a look at! Looking at the Raven Guard detachment called a Talon Strike Force the core option looks nearly identical to a traditional Demi company  captain or chaplain  command squad  tacticals  assault  devestator  scout or scout bike squadsHowever some of the auxiliary formations would be right up your alley for using these models and you can always use the formations along side a Combined Arms detachment if you want!So Id take a combined arms detachment with Chapter Tactics Raven Guard and add on a Bladewing Assault Brotherhood formation  which includes  captain or chaplain  vanguard squads and  assault squads. Formation cannot exceed  models and everyone must have a jump pack. It gets some cool bonuses  once per game in your movement phase the entire formation goes into ongoing reserves  even if locked in combat  so you can run away from a bad fight. And even better when this formation comes in from reserves it arrives all at once  so no need to roll for each unit just roll once for the formation and when they come in you draw a line across the board and each unit deep strikes onto a point on that line  and can reroll the scatter dice for deep strike. Its a great way to get your units out of a bad fight late in a game and then make sure they deep strike the next turn onto any objectives you need to capture  or into parts of the board that you can assault from later. ,Warhammer,d22wsqc,1,t5_2qqd4

7427134,0,t1_d2m9arz,Thats a great theory actually with the Crusade of the Ophidium Gulf. This ship led by Castellan Raimer and the  marines on board has not been heard from since. Maybe the Dark Angels sabotaged the warp drive to destroy the vessel with no survivors after they discovered the Dark Angels hunting the Fallen worst as the Black Templars brought the Fallen onboard their vessel meaning they could have gained some information. Maybe we now know where the vessel ended up as it crashed into this Space Hulk with Genestealers overwhelming the vessel and turning all crew and serfs into hybrids. Raimer and the rest of the Black Templars are most likely dead or worst. It also gives reasons to why the Dark Angels could be boarding the Space Hulk maybe they have realized that the evidence has reappeared and wish to destroy the Space Hulk to fully get rid of the evidence.Its also noticeable in the trailer at  that the Deathwing are talking about the vessel being a Dark Angels vessel from the time of the Horus Heresy.

7782105,0,t1_d3qnld3,...Because large blocks of static troops wheeling about in formation isnt at all what K is about. Even on a large scale K is about units comprised of individual actors not necessarily acting in perfect tandem. The Total War engine has no way to accommodate a unit of space marines with one missile launcher one flamethrower and a melee sergeant using those things appropriately or correctly while also laying down boltgun fire. Also the Total War engine really maxes out its gunfire potential at about the flintlock age and is relatively  dimensional neither of which are attributes that would translate well to a multilevel ruined cityscape full of automatic weaponry in the st millennium,Warhammer,d3qre50,16,t5_2qqd4

7893563,0,t3_4ndhph,I dont remember when my first battle was or what it entailed but Ill tell you about my first tournament. This was back when I was ish which was somewhere in rd edition. This tournament was an unofficial  point elimination played on a x board if I remember correctly. At that time I had very little money for models and even less sense about what I needed to round out my force. My entire collection at this point consisted of about  guardsmen  command and a basilisk so thats what I took.I lasted for two rounds Round one was me against Eldar i dont remember what exactly he brought. I got a lucky pie plate right off the bat and then just opened up with lasguns for two turns from behind cover. Somehow I ended up pretty much tabling him. He was understandably salty about being beaten by a  year old kid with a preposterous list.Round two was me against th company. I not knowing any better sent all of my guardsmen into cc with his space wolves turn two. This went about as well as you might expect. I got ground into mincemeat for a couple turns before being eliminated.I had fun but didnt really like the tournament thing. What kept me coming back was the community at the store there was a core group of guys that not only put up with  year old me but made me feel welcome.,Warhammer,d43b6i7,6,t5_2qqd4

Now that I have a few extra bucks and a little extra time to devote to such a hobby I decided to go back into it.I decided to try a new army Chaos Space Marines and was curious about some questions about fluff.While I know they are mostly followers of Chaos Undivided is it entirely outside the realm of possibilities that some Chaos Lords or other units of Alpha Legion take marks of the other daemons to suit my needs strategically in a match?Additionally I am really interested in using a Khorne Berzerker unit to supplement my forces but would this really be outside the fluff of Alpha Legion? Would I be able to paint them in Alpha Legion colours or could I use an excuse to paint them as World Eaters and use them as part of the same warband Alpha Legion is in using them as shock troops.Having been so long some of the rules have changed some have stayed consistent but here is one question If I wanted to split a Chaos Space Marine squad into two units to satisfy the two troop requirement for deployment do I need two aspiring champions?

Its not a great sculpt to be honest there are a few places where its a bit misshaped and the detail isnt so great e.g. the inner side of his head that is tucked in between the jump pack and the collar of his armour and underneath the back of his right arm. That could be a fault of the moulding though its hard to tell with the old metals.Hes a model from a different generation of GW products when one or twopiece metals posed in what I always think of as a crucifixion stance which was a practical consideration due to the way metal models are made were fairly standard.

8775525,0,t1_d729tgz,Whoo! Thats a mouthful haha while you make some very solid arguments I do want to tackle a few points specificallygt Youre running off an assumption of numbersThis is true but only in the most literal interpretation of the word assumption. We have several dozen maps of the tyranid threat as it advances with showcases of the area of each sector of the galaxy where there is either A direct contact with several hive fleets or B direct evidence of the Shadow in the Warp which for all intents and purposes is the same thing  it means there are numerous hive fleets present blocking the signal of the astronomican with their psychic shadow. So while we dont know the exact number of tyranids a fools errand I would argue  like knowing the exact number of grains of sand on earth we know that they are a massive body of organisms  and that on the surface lest the shadow in the warp is somehow just a projection of strength rather than an actual show of strength very unlikely they are more numerous than any other race that inhabits the galaxy currently. gt It is a misconception that the Imperium does not develop new technologyThis I agree with  and I actually dont think the antiintellectualism of the imperium has much of an effect since I believe the most innovative areas of the IoM are also the ones that are directly responsible for fighting the Tyranid threat  the Ordo Xenos. They have for all intents and purposes supreme power to deny even the direct orders of the high lords of terra  meaning the commission of new weapons commandeering of anyall imperial troops etc. is very much in the realm of possibility. But that doesnt mean we can count on them developing a super antityranid weapon for the sake of this argument since theres no evidence to support that  its just not impossible in a theoretical sense.gt So who knows maybe Abaddon will remember how to wage a war before they show up assuming we ever get any advancement. Ha!This is a total aside  but he IS waging his th black crusade! get hyped! The storyline is moving forward and has been for a couple years with the various campaigns GW has released and next month releases a CSM supplement called Traitors Hate which brings new formations and rules to Black Legion and Crimson Slaughter armies specifically to represent Abaddons th crusade  years in the making. gt Tyranid cannot possibly keep up with a routing Imperial fleetThey actually have specialized hive ships call Narwhals that harness gravitational energy in the universe to create pathways similar to warp tunnels that allow the hive fleets to move at fasterthanlight speeds. Granted if the Imperial Fleets jumped into the warp the hive wouldnt necessarily know where theyre going although it could be argued the use of the astronomicon would leave a trail for them to follow like bees to honey  but they can keep up if they know where to go. gt Regarding your own hubris please do be respectfulSarcasm isnt necessarily disrespectful were having fun here! The hubris of the imperium is well established in the lore Im not insulting you personally in any way shape or form so lets not be overly sensitive. Me crying out about the hubris of the imperium is the equivalent of someone typing xenos filth in response to my own posts on this matter  and its certainly not a personal attack.gt Yes I agree that the notion that it is implied that a much much larger threat is out there but quantifying that in a useful way is again something that GW has yet to do Again see my first response GW has established time and time again that the threat represented by the Tyranids is much more massive than any other threat  and not just in the Tyranid codex. Yes technically we dont know the exact number of tyranids but that doesnt mean that we cant assess the size of the threat they represent. We see this reiterated constantly in books ranging from codexes to novels to white dwarf articles such as Codex Blood Angels th Edition Codex Eldar th Edition Codex Imperial Guard th Edition Codex Orks th Edition Codex Space Marines th Edition Codex Space Wolves th Edition Codex Tau Empire th Edition Codex Tyranids th Edition Codex Tyranids th Edition Codex Tyranids th Edition Deathwatch Achilus Assault RPG Deathwatch Core Rulebook RPG Deathwatch Mark of the Xenos RPG Deathwatch Know No Fear RPG Deathwatch The Jericho Reach RPG Iyanden A Codex Eldar Supplement Supplement Warhammer  Planetstrike Supplement Warhammer  Rulebook th Edition Warhammer  Rulebook th Edition Warhammer  Rulebook th Edition White Dwarf  UK Liber Apocalyptica Trygons pg.  White Dwarf  UK The UltraMarines pp.   Lone Wolves Graphic Novel by Dan Abnett and Karl Richardson Planetkill Anthology Edited by Nick Kyme and Lindsey Priestley Priest of Mars Novel by Graham McNeill Legends of the Space Marines Anthology Orphans of the Kraken by Richard Williams The Last Ditch Novel by Sandy Mitchell The Greater Good Novel by Sandy Mitchell Warriors of Ultramar Novel by Graham McNeillJust to name a few!gt Finally spanning your perspective beyond the Tyranid codex is essentialAgreed see source list above. Ive been playing this game since  collecting tyranids since  and have played at one point or another every single faction in the game. I have amassed an enormous collection of k literature codexes rulebooks and supplements  I am not speaking strictly from the point of view of a Tyranid fanboy but as a player of the game and several armies that is well versed in the lore of the universe my favorite of which at this point in time is Dark Eldar actually.gt A better angle would be that they are not all arriving from the same direction implying that theyre coming from multiple different places beyond the Milky WayThis is one of the points I actually wanted to make in my last post and did not for the sake of keeping my comment relatively short. I believe this to be the single biggest indicator of the size of the tyranid threat  that the hive fleets are coming into the milky way from several directions at once indicates that they are either A coming from separate nearby galaxies or B outflanking an entire galaxy that is  lightyears across. Both scenarios I think you would agree signal an enemy more numerous than any other in the game while again ceding the point that technically we cant know the exact number of organisms. gtWhile there is almost certainly some credence to the fact that theres more than Behemoth Leviathan etc.This is canon while Behemoth nd edition Kaken rd edition and Leviathan th edition are indeed the focal points of each codex and the  largest tendrils of the hive fleets to reach the galactic plane there are at least a dozen more named fleets that have made contact with the IoM  including Hive Fleet Moloch Jormungandr Gorgon Hydra Apophis Harbinger Medusa Perseus Scylla Charybdis Dagon Grendel Locust etc. gt Is downvoting opposing opinions a practice here?Unfortunately people tend to downvote opinions that they view as false based on the available fluff but if its any consolation Im happy to provide an upvote to help balance out the equation PHEW thats a lot of text haha sorry for the wall! And thank you for engaging in this discussion with me  its rare that you find someone with the ability to have a logical conversation about the merits of something like this with the ability to bring evidence and facts to both sides without devolving to name calling etc. on Reddit. While I firmly believe that the tyranids are in no uncertain terms the biggest threat to the galaxy and the IoM I wont deny that the IoMs ability to innovate new weapons andor focus its attention wholly on the tyranid threat would certainly make things more interesting. While the evidence over the last  years of lore and fluff suggests heavy handedly that the tyranid threat is numerous to the point of incomprehensibility theres no denying the staunch military tactics of the IoM when singularly focused on one enemy. It wouldnt be easy for the tyranids to win but I believe they would win none the less. Theyve got time the IoM does not. ,Warhammer,d72lwfh,7,t5_2qqd4

Ofc a real space marine is more flexible than the models and more importantly does not have the base. But even without those things were still talking less space than what is actually available. Lets do it like this. The width of that central area is lorewise  meters. The land raider is . meters long. Removing the front hatch section and the space between the tracks that isnt used is enough m left. Another  is taken by the engine. So thats a xm area or sqm.  of which are taken by the two seats another  for the lascannon mounts another for the bolter mount. Were down to sqm. Even if we assumed that there is really nothing else there in that central area were still short of area for space marines in full power armor due to their bulk.  normal sized humans in sqm easy.  fully suited power armored space marines fully equipped with heavy weaponry and all...

I would put the wash onto the palette and take a smaller amount onto the brush to use on the model when painting on the wash remember where it pools will be the darkest area so you want that where the sun will not hit having random splotches in the middle of the plates can give character but you definitely have too much on there. You would usually highlight with your base colour but because your plates are a washed gold i would go with the colour of the wash mixed with a little bit of a metallic.There are great resources on youtube for beginner painters like Warhammer TVDefinitely check them out they give great tutorials to make a lovely table quality army.,Warhammer,dcumvsf,3,t5_2qqd4

Way too much snow on the base and the base trim would look much better black to contrast the model.

Like Astartes fighting Astartes? Like the Rout being called to sanction another Legion? That? Russ answers. He laughs but it is a sad sound. Hjolda no. Thats not unprecedented.The novel Outcast Dead also has a quote about the Wolves being executioners.

You could make a diorama of Saint Celestine descending upon and smiting the chaos marines.Alternatively most Eldar hate chaos as well with a special level of fear hatred for Slaanesh. An eldar hero be it an avatar a phoenix  lord or just an Autarch Farseer blasting some Slaaneshi terminators would look cool and would be a slight deviation from the pretty typical Imperium vs. Chaos scenario.edit also Im not to familiar with their lore but it is my understanding that the Necrons also especially hate chaos might be something to look into there.,Warhammer,dft9xly,2,t5_2qqd4

So for your orange if you wash it with Nuln Oil that will darken it significantly and then you could edge highlight with the same orange again to create contrast. Citadel does make an orange edge paint that is a lighter shade but thats a really niche purchase.If you have any white you could also mix a little bit of white and orange to create a lighter shade then highlight with that.

11505957,0,t3_646gzf,I was wondering a few things. How will you deal with invisibility? Just theow everything at the deny which I suppose is doable with this list?. How will you deal with flyers like stormtalons? Most dont really have enough firepower to hurt your marines but they can do some decent damage against your hellbrutes.. How will you deal with ordnance tyrant builds?. How will you deal with a gravbomb dropping down and obliterating your biker squad? Even your fnp bonus wont save you there. If you lose your rhinos as well youll be almost guaranteed to lose any maelstrom mission. Edit just did the math and grav isnt as completely lethal to the bikers as I thought.Just some general thoughts might well be some obvious answers that Im overlooking.I think the list is a cool idea though I kinda feel like death guard are by far the strongest in a competitive sense and using the NL warlord traits is nice. Can the character hellbrute LOS?,Warhammer,dg078ww,1,t5_2qqd4
11509718,0,t3_647nyr,You could go in lots of directions with it really depending on the planet its people and the god.A Khorne worshipping society would likely be fascist with a heavy emphasis on individual freedoms and personal strength holding up its greatest citizens as both an example and a challenge to its population. If its going to be a half way stable society youre going to have to have a permanent war economy making ends meet by pillaging other nations. By contrast a Tzeench worshipping society may well look a lot like a modern first world nation to be frank. Excessively complicated often to the detriment of those within lead by intelligent but pathologically dishonest people etc. The main difference being it would likely be an oligarchy of philosopher kings where excessive funding is poured into research and exploration. I would think theyd be relatively unlikely to have much by way of a working class preferring to make their considerable national and individual wealth from intellectual property and merchant enterprise. I cant imagine a great deal of sympathy would be given to those who cant keep up with the pace and complexity of it all.A society in worship of nurgle would presumably be a major source of inertia and stagnation for the economies and cultures around it. Maybe a state that pays lip service to the ideals of communism and produces some kind of luxury good that causes significant environmental damage ruled by leaders that stockpile resources rather than investing them. Due to widespread corruption leaders tend to launder much of their taxpayers money or invest it in nonproductive enterprises. Its a dystopia and you starve in the streets walking past propaganda posters telling you the party loves you. Hell... more and more people are setting aside their reservations and joining the party everyday... and youre so cold out here... maybe wouldnt be so bad.A country run by Slaanesh worshippers would likely be a bit different from the others. Id expect an emphasis on individual rights and comforts with the population seeing it as worthwhile to tax for excessive public works supporting all forms of frivolity. Cultural achievements and exports would drive their economy aside from the famous and lucrative red light districts. Loud and crazy club scene. Probably run by a Medicitype character after all culture is king and the merchants are the ones selling you all that stuff you love so much. Just be careful you or what you have dont become the object of desire for anyone remotely powerful because all the socialist policies in the world wont keep them from what they want. ,Warhammer,dg0mmdc,10,t5_2qqd4

11534828,0,t3_64g6rc,I liked watching videos from these guys before I started. And after I started.That one was one of my favorites. You spend a lot more time actually playing and making tactical decisions rather than sorting through rules. I taught a guy how to play in  minutes and he was contributing tactically by the end of that game.Games are much faster. Most rules are usually binary i.e. they are either passfail or roll to hitmiss savefail save. etc... There isnt any measuring the base and you can only turn  degrees or a unit is  in cover debatable. There are a few that come up but way way less so than K. Again you spend more time playing than determining rules.The battleplans laid in the generas handbook must have if you want to be competitive and you will. are pretty straight forward and not confusing. They are interesting in my opinion and provide lots of opportunity for tactics and army building balance to take advantage of all of them.Examples Three Places of Power Requires you to take objectives with heroes. So you probably want expensive tanky heroes or the ability to snipe your enemy off theirs and protect yours.Blood and Glory Objectives dont really matter until the last turn where points are scored. Favors thinking ahead  turns and using your fast movement units to spread to  corners and take them all. Think going flatout with JetBikes.Escalation Objectives are far apart and you are forced to deploy on the corners of the table.  Monstersartillery deploy really far away. This heavily affects some armies but could also protect artillery from enemy cavalry.Border War Every turn matters a lot. You need to plan for who will have each objective and how you can swing the math in your favor or how you can lose it! Army wise You are rewarded for capturing your opponents far objective so what units do you have that can get there fast enough and hit hard enough to take it? Will you lose yours? How will you defend it?etc.. theres more.I recommend finding  armies you like aesthetically then download the Age of Sigmar app and read their rules. Can view individually on GW store but its annoying. It doesnt hurt to pick a newer rather than older army.Examples of Newer ArmiesKharadron Overlords not out yetKhorne BloodBoundTzeentchStormcastBonesplitterzBeastclaw RaidersSylvanethNewer armies get better rules and models.

11601688,0,t1_dga6gno,There is definitely still a tournament scene and overall it tends to be better balanced than WHFB was.There is a chance you could see elves and dwarfs and empire and lizardmen all in the same army  but you do still have army construction restrictions in place and you get really good army wide bonuses for sticking to one faction vs mixing and matching. Most people bring just  faction to battle for this reason.You can mix and match units from your grand faction  so Armies of Order can bring empire dwarfs elves lizardmen stormcast eternals and sylvaneth Armies of Chaos are all the daemons and warriors of chaos models and flavors Beastmen and also Skaven now since they are technically created from chaos and the great horned rat has nearly achieved chaos god status in the lore of AoS Armies of Destruction are orcs and ogres. But as I said you get better army rules and bonuses for sticking to one faction  so I play sylvaneth for example which is all the tree men and dryads and other tree people from the wood elf range because I get better relics and spells and movement bonuses in forests for not bringing other units from other factions.Tomb Kings no longer exist the Armies of Death are basically them and vampire counts combined.  ,Warhammer,dgb26nd,2,t5_2qqd4

11719498,0,t1_dgoeo1d,Yes that is correct. Weapons have the number of shots after the type for example Heavy  or Assault  etc. These indicate for individual shots that all hit wound and are saved separately. But if the weapon has a rule that says something like does  wounds instead of one it is treated as a single wound all the way until you fail your saves when it does the aforementioned  wounds instead. Of course this doesnt matter if your model only has  wound to begin with. Hopefully this helps.,Warhammer,dgofmf9,1,t5_2qqd4

11742488,0,t1_dgr0vt9,It appears the vehicle damage chart is gone and instead every vehicle has its own damage charge on its profile.  So for a totally made up example a dreadnaught with a heavy bolter and powerfist may be  to hit with guns and shooting and move  inches a turn.  However once it suffers  wounds it might go to  to hit and move  inches then when it has suffered  wounds it might need a  to hit and shoot  less shot and only move  inches a turn.Kind of represents the vehicles being crippled over time taking lots of damage.  As for explosions I would assume some vehicles may have rules about blowing up when they die and some weapons now will cause multiple wounds.  So for example an auto cannon may cause  wounds for every wound you take while a lascannon may cause  or even  just throwing around the ideas I got from their Q and A session.  So your tank dying quickly will probably still happen if you take a few hits from actual anti tank weapons.The real change is a shift from the rather random explodes results on the damage table and being totally immune to small arms to now you have a TON of health no random explosions and everything can chip away at you but real heavy weapons are needed to punch through your toughness armor save and boat load of health with multi wound damage.,Warhammer,dgr1hez,5,t5_2qqd4
