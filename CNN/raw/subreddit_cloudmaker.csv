4390164,0,t1_cskhl0b,SnowWolf W is not all that great as it is more on par with the IPV not the LI in terms of power at even the claimed  watts.Source? Well that would be me as I own both and lean on my IPV more for high wattage vapes and the Snowwolf W more for temperature control. Any mod that can do both well will destroy all mods currently on the market. The Ares OS chip is still an unknown so I cant say that it can beat the DNA at this point.,cloudmaker,cskia6f,1,t5_37c97

4442254,0,t1_csqh4yy,Shit yeh I can do all sorts of ninja work with d renderings now. So you can see hoe heat will dissipate through the mod etc. So long as I have the material propertiesmaterial lists I can run real time analyses and compare it to FEA generated animated solutions showing temp variation heat flux etc. The kicker is Im graduating again on August th which means I lose the student lab access then so if there is anything I can do to prep ahead of time lemme know. Once I graduate Ill be bouncing back and forth between Richmond Va and the southern part of the state to use the lab as a guest.,cloudmaker,csqmq96,1,t5_37c97

5644864,1,t1_cwwskph,Its still tomorrow.  They still have roughly  hours to keep to what they said yesterday.  What purpose does coming here and bitching first thing in the morning serve?I get that people are upset about slower information than they would prefer.  I really do.  My point is what are you solving by bitching about it?  Does anyone really think theyre going to accomplish something here?  Itll be done when its done.,cloudmaker,cwwsszo,3,t5_37c97

5894334,0,t1_cxs5zks,They my bank said it was just to long ago anyways and asked why I waited until now.   I explained what I could and he just had a look of why would you order from a place like this.  This is a small town so it must look ridiculous to most people to do these preorders.     ,cloudmaker,cxsa4zt,1,t5_37c97
5979159,0,t1_cy32gvq,Thanks for the update. Maybe it will be a whiteout New Year. Hopefully they have a contingency plan incase the lipos dont pass inspection for some reason. Especially considering my unit is a SX so lipos have nothing to do with it except being in the same shipment.,cloudmaker,cy3ed2d,1,t5_37c97

6425814,0,t1_czj44pv,Yeah but none of that is really anything above and beyond. Fasttech replaced a faulty mod that I bought Cthulu sent me a whole new RDA without me having to send back the defective one the shop near me you can swap it out with the same device in stock and they RMA it to the manufacturer.I mean good on them that their RMA is up to par with other vendors but I dont think mediocrity should be praised as almost all vendors will do the same.,cloudmaker,czjyst8,2,t5_37c97

6677306,0,t3_471y0g,Update About  hours in and so far the only real problem Ive run into is the fire button getting stuck. It hasnt actually happened to me but to my device. I handed it to the guy at my local shop and when he pulled it away from his face it kept firing but stopped after about a second. The second time it happened the other guy at my shop hit it and it never stopped firing he had to unscrew my Atty. I attempted to recreate the situation and I pressed the button in every direction but the auto fire never happened. Im not too worried about it but Im definitely going to keep an eye on that.,cloudmaker,d09zph9,1,t5_37c97
