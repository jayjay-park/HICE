It also has pretty beefy cv controls and programming. As a fellow Reason user I would assume this is what he does. Though he could also be layering multiple samples of analogue gear.     A good tip for layering that I use is to work from the low end up. Build a nice thick subbass with little to no low mids just a sub. Then build a second bass with some meaty lowmids and highpass all the sub stuff out around Hz as a guide but trust your ears not the numbers. From there listen to it and decide what it needs and whether any midrange stuff should be part of the same sound or a separate instrument. Just make sure you cut out the lower stuff as you build your sound up through the frequency range if two instruments are playing the same range it gets muddy.,bassmusicproduction,cfjgekk,3,t5_2zbyp
