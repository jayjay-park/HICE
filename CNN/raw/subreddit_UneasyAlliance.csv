6609263,0,t1_d02d8zd,It really goes a lot into making an enjoyable stream we all were really spoiled with the amount of care production value and amazing personalities all of the GT staff have. Other podcasts really are just people talking about random things sometimes they dont even follow a schedule theme or list of subjects. Kyle is the guy in charge of all that in GT almost always the host and almost always keeping it funny and grounded. Brandon Jones also does an amazing job at that.Its kinda corny at times but I now appreciate more when Kyle interrupts someone wait who is Omar? Gotta explain who Omar is and everyone is like You know Omar Yeah my roommate but Kyle is thinking on the production. Then he goes checking everyones thoughts on a subject quick words or hype check hes a really good host.Some podcasts are basically people in a phone call. So did you watch this new thing? yeh...was ok. I liked it.. They just WING IT which is a feat in itself to wing it and be interesting. edit but most other times winging it is terribly boring.,UneasyAlliance,d02ycib,6,t5_3cfll
