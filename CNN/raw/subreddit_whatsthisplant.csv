330940,0,t1_cff2mqx,ampampamp Monotropa uniflora sfw gtgtMonotropa uniflora also known as the ghost plant Indian pipe or corpse plant is a herbaceous perennial plant which was formerly classified in the family Monotropaceae however it has now been included within the Ericaceae It is native to temperate regions of Asia North America and northern South America but with large gaps between areas. It is generally scarce or rare in occurrence.gtUnlike most plants it is white and does not contain chlorophyll Instead of generating energy from sunlight it is parasitic more specifically a mycoheterotroph Its hosts are certain fungi that are mycorrhizal with trees meaning it ultimately gets its energy from photosynthetic trees. Since it is not dependent on sunlight to grow it can grow in very dark environments as in the understory of dense forest. It is often associated with beech trees. The complex relationship that allows this plant to grow also makes propagation difficult.gtThe plant is sometimes completely white but commonly has black flecks and a pale pink coloration. Rare variants may have a deep red color.gtgtImage iInteresting Monotropa | Graptopetalum paraguayense | List of Heaths Wintergreens and Monotropes of Montana uchthonical can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcffmt oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecffmt.

The things that make my decision the Myrica family is the leaf structure the habit of the plant in general and also the bark qualities.  These are also known to grow in bogs.  They prefer an acidic type soil and thrive in bog conditions because bogs are a very highly acidic area.  Not all of the Myrica plants have a scent to them as well.

The stems are smooth hairless or slightly hairy. The leaves are small lanceolate .cm long and up to cm broad with a slightly wavy margin. The flowers are small produced in umbels with a basal pair of bright yellowgreen petallike bracts Clusters of the bracts appear in late spring while the actual flowers do not develop until early summer.

The seed capsules open explosively dispersing seed up to m from the parent plant and may be carried further by water and wildlife. Leafy Spurge also spreads vegetatively from the root system which is complex reported to reach m into the ground and m across and may have numerous buds. gtThere are two subspecies and a hybrid subspecies  gtgt Euphorbia esula subsp. esula.

1576491,0,t3_2calx3,I have one. They bloom in spring  but you can force winter on it so it blooms more and looks better. Yours isnt getting enough light which is why it isnt as full. Normally  like all succulents water it thoroughly only when the soil  is completely dry  but dont let it sit in water. Give it lots of sunlight until it blooms. After blooming  you need to cut it back to a stem length about the width of your hand  take it out of the sun  and not water it for three or four weeks. Then put it back in the sun  water and fertilize  and then start over again once it blooms. Make sure to deadhead and cut out any dead branches as you go.

Its out of control along the roadsides here in New York State.  Its really difficult to eradicate a big patch especially if you dont want to drown it in herbicides.   Dont use herbicides.  Lots of weeds are already resistant to herbicides like Round Up.  Contact your local environmental authority or agricultural college to ask how to remove it safely.  Itll likely be an ongoing project.  Best of luck!,whatsthisplant,cub57oa,4,t5_2si8i

They wont fruit crabapples until late summerearly autumn.gtAt  to  inches in diameter crabapples look like miniature versions of regular apples. However a crabapple has a sour pithy taste. Despite their unpleasant sharpness crabapples generally arent dangerous. gtCrabapples might give you a sore stomach if you eat a few but they wont cause poisoning. Like regular apples their seeds do contain toxins. However you would have to eat them in huge doses to experience any serious problems.gtCrabapples are essentially the same species as apple trees. The seeds of both of these trees contain a form of cyanide called cyanogenic glycosides. Cyanide is a toxic potentially fatal poison. However the average American eats around . pounds of fresh apples every year and reports no toxic effects. gtDespite the presence of cyanide in the seeds most people dont eat the core. Even when apple seeds are ingested they usually pass through the gut without being broken down. You would have to eat lots of crabapple seeds and grind or chew them up for the cyanide to take effect.,whatsthisplant,curvnxu,0,t5_2si8i

Easily transplanted. We just dig up the small ones stick them in a pot andor transplant them wherever. If yours is large just dog a decent sized rootball when you move it. My moms created a whole hedge of it just moving them around the yard and she takes no real care  Now she sent some home with me  miles in a bucket inside a plastic bag.
