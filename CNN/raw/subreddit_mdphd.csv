40136,0,t1_ceisv0n,Undergrad institutions are ranked by medical school admissions committees to allow for proper weighting of GPAs. For instance it is a lot more difficult to get a . at Harvard than at the UAkron so GPAs have to be adjusted accordingly. As far as the MCAT goes I didnt find it to be that nasty. The USMLEs were far worse. I read Examkrackers and that was more than sufficient. ,mdphd,cej00w1,2,t5_2shjn
245003,0,t3_1wuqor,How good do you think you are?  And what are your goals?  Do you want to see patients?  Do you want to make money?  Can you not live without research? I think we need more information before we tell you whats rational for you.,mdphd,cf65are,5,t5_2shjn
4290206,0,t3_3a4d3w,Depends on the lab environment.  If you have a lot of reading and writing to do toward the end of your thesis is fine. Otherwise Id say early in grad conceive shortly after step  or late med. just dont be way pregnant during interviews too pregnant to travel plus theres always the chance the PD of your interview program wont like you raising an infant as an intern. Also beware of morning sickness. I know a few that had babies during mid rd year med. They got slack in surgery because they were huge. It worked out fine less OR time!,mdphd,cs987l9,1,t5_2shjn
9189124,0,t3_5606l8,Hey! Yes I went to the PSU MDPhD program now a legit MSTP!. I had a great experience there. I guess any qualms I had about my experience would be about the trials of medical school and graduate school in general rather than this particular program. I think it was great then and its improved even more over the last couple of years. More integration of scienceresearch and medicine. There are ample opportunities for research at the College of Medicine in Hershey but they also are very supportive of completing research at the PSU main campus in State College. The stipend is modest probably around what  daolso posted below. Its more than enough to live on in Hershey which has a very low cost of living. One could live on campus or there are lots of apartment options around. A car is pretty much a necessity. Excellent and large tertiary care medical center. Well respected name. I dont think you could go wrong. Recent grads have matched at Stanford Duke Harvard Brown UCSF UCLA Yale Northwestern to name several. IM Gen Durg Psych ENT Rad Onc ObGyn Path PMampR are some I can think of. I completed research in the Orthopedics department. We sent mice on the space shuttle pretty awesome. Graduated in . Matched by  in Rad Onc. If you have any specific questions let me know!,mdphd,d8gsenu,3,t5_2shjn
