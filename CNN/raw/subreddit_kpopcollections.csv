10994184,0,t1_dee53dy,Yeah eventually I want to replace the shallow shelves with deeper ones but I am very attached to adjustable shelves and these are cheap and take up very little room so until I have money and space they have to do. The CD rack is great. I wish I could tell you where it came from but it was a gift from my sister and already bought and assembled when I got it so I dont even know brand. ,kpopcollections,dee5mwl,2,t5_3im31
