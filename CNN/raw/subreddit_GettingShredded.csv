3205739,0,t3_2wsds4,Hello everyone! Im a  year old male who started lifting about a month ago. Since I just started Im still lifting up rather small numbers but slow and steady wins the race  Ive lost about  pounds but I seem to be stuck at  pounds. Im trying to lose more fat whilst also gaining muscle. The muscle gaining is definitely happening but I cant really tell if Im losing fat. Hopefully I can see results in the next month. ,GettingShredded,cou9vnk,1,t5_372io

3236168,0,t1_coxeg0m,For big lifts you should aim for  reps and either  or  sets depending on how much weight you can lift since youll want to train the strength of those mainly. Endurance work and hypertrophy lends itself more towards the  rep range with accessories. When I sneak in curls high school power weights class lifting program sucks and has zero straight bicep work I start with a x of heavy weight and then move onto x with light weight as my biceps feel drained and weak late in a wrestling match so in the off season I do a mix of strength and endurance work this really helps me personally and I also incorporate chinups as they are a fantastic bicep workout. ,GettingShredded,coxfov6,2,t5_372io

3287624,0,t1_cp2ys8t,gt Post workout sweet potato or rice is not going to impact negatively on your gains and is anecdotally more likely to impact them positively.Exactly anecdotallygt You do not need to consume any carbohydrates after your training sessions. When ample protein is ingested carbs do not have any additive effect on protein balance. You dont have to avoid carbs but adding sugar to your shakes is well just like adding sugar to any other meal.gt Origin of the postworkout carb myth gt Supplement companies want you to believe you need carbs because carbs are extremely cheap to manufacture. For example basically all weight gainer products are just sugar sold at a ridiculous price.gt  Many people read the carbonly research without realizing that protein makes the carbs redundant.gt  The literature advocating carbs for endurance athletes can easily be misinterpreted by people only reading the abstracts.gt  Many myths perpetuate themselves with everyone spreading the word simply because everyone else is also spreading the word.gt  Many professional bodybuilders inject insulin postworkout. This requires the consumption of a large amount of carbs to avoid going hypoglycemic. Without exogenous insulin and steroids this is more likely to turn into fat than muscle.SourceMenno Henselmans  Bayesian Bodybuiling.com,GettingShredded,cp30kaf,1,t5_372io

3476883,0,t3_302lok,Settling the carb controversy is ambitious.  Hope youve got  years and five trillion dollars.I have a dog in this fight I sell keto products.  But I do that because I believe in keto as a protocol so Ive spent a fair amount of time studying the science.Why does low carb help when cuttingFirst low carb reduces hunger signaling.  Part of this is the reduction in the insulin driven blood sugar roller coaster another is changes in leptin and ghrelin.  On net low carb lets you maintain a larger defecit per unit of willpowerSecond insulin partially controls fat flux accumulation and distribution of fat by cells.  So the theory goes lower insulin means fat cells switch to distribution mode.  I have yet to see any good evidence that these changes matter on the scale of your question.  In theory it should have an effect but I havent seen any data to back up the theory.  I have seen some evidence that fat distribution mode makes it harder to gain fat pounds store fat when youre eating at a surplus.  But thats not really your question. So I guess Id return the question and ask what do you really care about  equal calories or equal willpower?  ,GettingShredded,cpol973,16,t5_372io

6292028,0,t3_41rb0o,You can see quick results or you can maintain sports performance. Ultimately cutting quickly can have a number of negative effects in addition to fatigue such as opening the door for a maladaptive relationship with food binges etc. Assuming you dont have any deadline for a physique change Id keep the cut slow and Id definitely recommend avoiding MFP as a guideline for your daily calories. A much better bet is eating like you normally do logging it for a couple of weeks and logging your weight across that same timespan. Find out what maintenance is based on that and use that as your starting point. Now its generally going to be best to find a really good coach to monitor this sort of progress and guide your macro goals but you can definitely get away with a more moderate cut  say  reduction in total calories to see positive changes without seeing sports performance suffer.,GettingShredded,cz4tzr7,2,t5_372io
