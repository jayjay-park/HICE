154430,0,t3_1vuj2p,Having melted many pairs of shoes I now refuse to put my shoes anywhere near the fire for drying. Instead Ive been using another trick that works very well.  Take a couple of rocks that are just big enough to fit in your shoes and heat those over the fire.  Then carefully take them out let them cool for a few min so they wont melt your shoessocks and then stuff them into your socks which are probably also wet and then put that into the shoes. For best results but a fresh set of hot rocks in a few hours later.The rocks will act like radiators and keep releasing heat into the shoes and socks which will cause the water to evaporate much quicker. Even when my shoes are soaked they will be bone dry by morning using this method and my shoes do not get damaged in the process.,camping,cew0rlu,20,t5_2qk80
158944,0,t3_1vwqfq,Some old threads I commented in which might be of useFor longterm camping the best thing I can recommend to put down on the floor of your tent is foamcore insulation like this  It insulates you from the cold of the ground and in the event water does get underin your tent it floats.  ,camping,cewjbvj,1,t5_2qk80
160344,0,t3_1vvi8u,Ive slept in my VW Vanagon in pretty cold weather.Insulating yourself from below is at least as important if not more important than from above. My van seats folds out into a bed but I put down an additional IKEA mattress They come in varying sizesthickness. Ive got a thicker one so it doesnt really roll up but it does fold in half. If there are  people you might consider a double sleeping bag so you can keep each other warm. You probably want a  degree or better bag for temps that low. I usually just use a comforter or two. Swing by the local army surplus store and grab a few heavy wool military surplus blankets. Layer them on top as needed. You cant beat wool for keeping warm and you can always slip them into a duvet cover if you hate the feel them.If youre looking to add storage Ive seen people build low platforms out of plywood and xs in their truck beds so they can have storage under the bed. I have one of those trailer hitch mounted racks for hauling firewood when I go camping. Its surprisingly sturdy and its not even a particularly nice one. Eating a nice high fatcarb meal before bed always helps too.Good luck!,camping,cewp2rn,2,t5_2qk80

In particular there is backpacking along the North Country Trail and in the Hickory Creek Wilderness.A little bit further east in the PA Wilds section of Pennsylvania  hours with plenty of backpacking on trails like the Loyalsock trail Old Loggers Path Black Forest Trail Susquehannock Trail System Donut Hole Trail etc.  There is also a fair amount of car camping in the area.  This nice part about Northern PA backpacking and camping is that it is significantly quieter than other wild areas on the east coast and generally gets less use than areas like the Adirondacks or Shenandoah National Park.West Virginias Monongahela National Forest is also about . hours away and has a lot of backpacking and some car camping as well.

I recommend the trail towards Mt. Rose.  You can set up a camp that overlooks Lake Tahoe see the lights at night.  One caution though  dont hike at night there are some severe dropoffs.However Desolation has tons of beautiful lakes but the hike is more difficult uphill to get there.  You can park at the trail entrance just past Fallen Leaf Lake for easy access.  Actually there is a small lake at low level about  miles past that parking lot...

If I had to give some feedback here ya go The formatting of the page is a bit wonky. It can be really tough to read when you dont have paragraphs separated from a nonwhite background. The green background throughout makes everything kind of run together.  SUPER cool logo. I wish there was a way to incorporate the name of the website rather than just the .org. Personally I would have paid for the .com.  Theres a LOT of text. Not a bad thing but with the formatting and lack of other visuals youre running into some walls of text. Try adding bigger photos along the way. Also make sure that you edit your code on the embedded Youtube videos to resize them to fit your column. Make sure to maintain aspect ratio though!.  Product Links  I pulled your source and I see that these are simply links to Amazon products. If youre ever wanting to make any ad revenue money off of this I would suggest familiarizing yourself with Google Adwords Adsense Analytics etc. In closing I think youre off to a great start. Theres a lot of great information here but I think you would retain a lot of users if it was simply formatted differently. If you need any help with Wordpress UXUI Ads or anything else PM me.

1290312,0,t3_28uy72,No experience with mountainsmith tents but kelty tents are generally fine for the money.I dont like tents like the Salida where theres only one door and both people are sleeping parallel to it. Youll be crawling over your wife every time you need to get in or out.  The Grand Mesa has a better door and the Morrison has a door for each of you.  Other than that youll just need to choose between more space in the Morrison or lighter weight with the Grand Mesa.  I assume the strength and performance will be pretty similar with both.Definitely wait for sales unless you need a tent right now.,camping,cieryqq,3,t5_2qk80

1493178,0,t1_cj10jxi,I believe the degradation is not a continual process.  It doesnt make sense for it to be.  The degradation happens each time you put it into or take it out of the stuff sack.  A tent just sitting in a stuff sack isnt going to get noticeably progressively worse in regards to its rain repellancy except over the course of  years.  If you use the tentsleeping bag a little each year then youll see deterioration from storage in and removal from stuff sacks.  But if it sits for a few years in a cooldry closet and not a hot stuffy attic it should be fine.  If you have a down sleeping bag though I would ALWAYS recommend storing it in a much larger bag for longterm.  Mine came in a bag that is almost  liters in size and Ill either keep it in that or I will hang it overfrom the clothes hanger bar in a closet.,camping,cj3g0ps,1,t5_2qk80

1540666,0,t1_cj9e0te,Hey man dont get me wrong to each his own! If I came to England I would totally try your basha system out! Just for my application I love the tent It weighs like  lbs and sets up fast and I mean fast. I have this tent. I like it because without the fly its just all netting. Great for summer nights. Keep an eye out though that tent was on sale for USD a little while ago! In Montana we have ticks chiggers ants mosquito the size of hawks crickets all sorts of mice etc. So even in the summer I like that protection. My main concerns are ticks and mosquito. You do not want a tick to burrow in you on a long backpacking trip specially since there is a risk of infection with ticks. For me its not really the bigger mammals that cause me to sleep in a tent since I hang my food far away from camp.A bivy like this might be up your ally. Cheap lightweight keeps the crawlers out fast set up. I like tents for gear storage.,camping,cj9eamj,3,t5_2qk80

1646971,0,t1_cjk266w,welp. i can confirm there are lines of people waiting at am for walkin sites at the Platte River campground which is where we just were for  days. We ended up in the backcountry campground which has a . mile hike to the actual sites. If youre down for that hike White Pine is  a night and sounds like its right up your alley. Youre about . miles from the beach where you can make your own fire and there are only  sites in the whole camp. There are also hiking trails leading to and starting away from the sites. Its straight primitive with only a pit toilet and a communal fire pit. Theres also a bear box to put all foodscented stuff in.Hope you get what youre looking for!,camping,cjmriyb,1,t5_2qk80

1745247,0,t1_cjz56ew,I said  per season mostly an example to show that even extreme turnover is still cheap. I usually get at least three seasons out of them and then I recycle them. I dont know of any other sleep system that fits two adults and a dog as comfortably as a huge air mattress that is as light weight easy to use and pack and only . When I camp on my own I use a pad and sleeping bag. When I camp with someone who wants more comfort my girlfriend I use the cheap air mattress.  Getting three seasons out of a  air mattress and then recycling it doesnt seem wasteful at all to me.  Buying super expensive gear from a fancy outfitter just to be cool seems wasteful to me especially since most of that stuff is made in Chinese factories too.,camping,cjz5e0p,3,t5_2qk80

I would stay an extra day at Zion  my group did not and we sorely regretted it. For driving to Zion from Bryce are you making a reservation for a campsite? We got there late afternoon in the day and all the firstcome firstserve campsites were taken. If you dont have a reservation I would make getting there early a priority.For the Grand Canyon is there any reason youre doing both the NorthSouth rim? I would probably pick one. We did the North Rim since it wouldve taken I think another  hours to get to the South Rim to save on time. The North rim is gorgeous as well and much less crowded. It also is much more forested though. Ive heard that some of the sights are better from the South Rim but overall youre at the Grand Canyon regardless. It looks like youll probably need a stop between the GC amp Sequoia. There are a lot of beautiful areas on that route especially ones that are not National Park or as popular maybe.

3684892,0,t3_32l16f,I have both the Fire Sense and a Smokey Joe not to mention a real charcoal grill on my patio. If I had to choose I prefer the Smokey Joe for how it cooks with a wider range of options a lid for example. It also builds a more even heating area of coals. However the Fire Sense is a lot easier to transport and clean whereas the Smokey Joe takes up quite a bit of space and drops ashes all over and isnt as easy to move around. The Fire Sense does okay for cooking things that require direct heat cooking  hot dogs burgers fish. Its very thin and flimsy feeling but folds up quite flat and makes an ideal car camping grill for my family. YMMV. I think I bought it for  at Target and thats about what its worth. So for a quick charcoal grilling option that is easy to take with you for day trips or short car camping? Yeah itll do the job. Nothing to write home about but it will cook your food adequately.

Potwisha does have the Kaweha river running by it but its a pretty swift running river most years and swim holes can be hard to find.Potwisha is a great springfallwinter campground. Summer and late hot spring? Skip it. Its also about an hour away from the big trees via a winding road which is probably what youre wanting to see.

Though I live in the PNW I spend most of the winter wearing two soft shells of various weight depending on the temps will pull out a hard shell when rain is steadyheavy. Though I like their casual clothing Id recommend staying away from Columbias outerwear. TNF too  their higherend stuff is great but I give all else a pass. For lowerend to midrange prices I feel youll get better bang for your buck from other brands. Take a look at the Patagonia Adze Hybrid jacket and the Outdoor Research Circuit jacket. I had a great Marmot a number of years back but Ive yet to find something in their current lineup that piqued much of an interest but look at Marmot too. Their Gravity jacket looks like it might be a decent one to wear on the cusp of fall amp winter as it seems a bit heavy. The Approach jacket might be the closest to the one of theirs I really liked.. rather lightweight stretchy a slight bit of insulation. ,camping,cstiwls,1,t5_2qk80

4604904,0,t3_3e129i,The season requirement makes the answer to your question  NO.          There are no tents that would withstand season i.e. winter conditions reliably for under .       However  there are plenty of season i.e. spring fall summer tents that are available. Most can handle some snow just fine. Depending on the type of weather you expect in the winter lots of season tents will do the job. The main feature to look for is a fly that goes all the way to the ground. Plus strong poles and peg out points. Most campers especially car campers dont require season tents. Your vehicle would likely be stuck in any situation where a season tent would be required.                 Or... maybe used is an option.

Granted its vintage departmentstore quality stuff but it looks like its going to be a bear to setup its not going to be very water proof and if it actually is waterproof then its not going to breathe so youll still wake up with a wet tent from the interior condensation.Unless you really dig the retro aspect of it Id look into at least buying a modern departmentstore tent.  Walmart sells a surprising number of tents for  or less.  Theyre not going to be amazing but at least theyll use modern materials and modern designs.  That means theyll be easier to keep water proof you have to take care of cotton canvas to keep it water proof.  Theyll breathe better so theyll be more comfortable overnight regardless of temp or weather and much nicer in hot weather.

5231154,0,t3_3mmoda,Lots of good advice here but Ill add some of mine. Advice gathered while camping from Boston gt San Diego over  month road trip. This is clearly advice for car camping and a lot of it is overkill but tried and tested keeps the girls happy.Shelter  Tent sizing is a sham. Single men should have their own tents. Couples no less than a  person each. Groups can share larger tents but a  person does not hold  people. Assemble the tent at home in the daylight BEFORE the trip. Nothing more frustrating than arriving at a site tired trying to figure out how the new tent goes up in the dark.Food  Backpacking meals are easy add boiling water to bag eat from bag with long handle spoon When car camping I bring dry food in a large plastic bin.CoolersColdest  Dry Ice at the bottom frozen gallon jugs on top meat and extra ice to fill the empty space.Cold  Frozen Gallon Jug Dairy Condiments Eggs Cooler  Beverages pre chill all beverages Beverage cooler will warm up first while cooking move ice from coldest to cold to cooler. The Dry ice will last  days and that cooler should have enough spare ice to keep everything else cold for that long.Gear  Try to keep your shit together. It can get challenging when camping with a group especially if theyre less prepared than you are. Having boxes bins bags whatever for all your shit will help you inventory it when it comes time to pick up camp. Milk Crates pull double duty stack as tables chairs nightstand load easily into truck or trunk.Our weather is pretty easy. Rain isnt a huge deal but be prepared. Tarps are cheap but make sure you have some way of keeping it up. There arent a lot of trees in the desert and a cactus isnt going to cut it. Tying between two vehicles can offer shade during the heat of the day.Seating  for the love of god bring chairs for everyone. They make them cheap enough but if you can afford it get a nice one for yourself. After the sun goes down sitting around the campfire gets uncomfortable real quick.Fire pit  All southern california wilderness areas REQUIRE your fire to be in a metal container. Doesnt have to be fancy or expensive but it has to contain the ashes. Bonus points if you bring something that has a lid so you can transport those ashes in the vehicle without getting ash everywhere. Bring a fire extinguisher or two.Trash  Youre going to generate more trash than you would expect. Bring a couple trash bags and post them around your site. At the kitchen near the toilet on your camp chair at the back of your car.Bring something that doesnt run on batteries to occupy yourself. Books Cards horse shoes frisbee crossword puzzles sudoku. If it gets too hot or too wet youre not going to be hiking and being stuck in the tent with a bunch of bored people sucks.One car or two? Whos got the jumper cables? How about a spare gas can  gallons is enough. Be in control of your own vehicle. Turn off any interior lights bring a spare key leave a window down.Bring more water. Think you have enough? You dont. Hand washing showering cooling off dishes fire dousing foot rinsing. Not to mention eating and drinking. Each car should be responsible for a  gallon jug in addition to personal drinking water. Thermos seriously boil water after dinner or on the fire before bed. Throw it in the thermos. Use it to speed up coffee in the morning.

Well first I would suggest you take it a little easier on the zippers no matter the tent if youre not careful the zippers will trap any fabric near them. Grabbing the body of the zipper rather than the zipper tab helps me keep the fabric out...sometimes. The zippers on a tent are just plain zippers not waterproofresistant like you may find on some gear. I would image you will have issues with water at least seeping through maybe dripping in if the rain is heavy enough. Wax may help but I doubt it seeing as any water running down your fly will collect at the zipper and come through. ,camping,d03t0k7,1,t5_2qk80

In a hammock a blue CCF mat will keep you warm in most temperatures that people would normally camp but when sleeping on the ground you need a better insulator because the ground is so much better at conductive heat loss.  CCF pads dont fare so well in terms of comfort when sleeping on anything other than flat smooth ground but they give good insulation for their price.  They also dont particularly pack down very small but theyre very light for their size and you wont have to worry about air leaks.  Theres a review of air pads here from  in which the Nemo Astro placed first overall.  The ThermaRest RidgeRest Deluxe is recommended by some of the users here but finding it in stock seems to be an issue.  This website gives a very quick synopsis of cheap sleeping pads and a short list of some of the better options.If youre going to look at foam mats Id recommend this one  Only the largest version of it weighs more than lb and they all have an Rvalue of . which will keep you plenty warm.

Im immediately wide awake and I hear snorting and sniffling outside the tent. I figure its probably a raccoon until the nose presses up against the wall of the tent and its too tall to be a raccoon.Oh good. So it could be a bear and if it is its a black bear that will spook if I start shouting. Unfortunately its like am and I dont want to wake the other campers and cause a big panic because that is not ideal. Im also concerned that it may not be a bear though I couldnt really tell you what else it might have been. Maybe a fisher. I dont know what theyre like but my guess is they are probably not as cowardly as a black bear.As this is running through my head whatever is out there is pushing to get in and my tent is being pressed out of true so much that it will start ripping soon. My only idea is to grab the flashlight and point it at the animal. It stops moving grunts sits still for a second and then wanders off.I didnt smell bear but I did hear it walk away.

The maps are printed on plastic same material as used in the National Geographic Maps are quite durable and area a good resource to have.Most National Forests allow dispersed camping outside of any developed campground or day use area and provided that the area isnt actively being logged.  However you cant just set up wherever the fuck you want.  Many National Forests do not allow dispersed camping within a certain distance of trails to keep groups from camping right smack in the middle of the trail or of water to protect water quality the riparian zone the boundary between land and water tends to be particularly susceptible to camping impacts.  If you camp at least  feet from either you should be in compliance with any regulations regarding this.  Some National Forests also prohibit dispersed camping in certain sensitive ecosystems.  For example you cant camp above tree line in the White Mountain National Forest.  It is also generally expected that you are following Leave No Trace if you are doing this.  If you arent camping at an already established site then it shouldnt be obvious that you camped there when you leave.  This includes dismantling your fire pit if you built one.  A mound fire is a good technique to learn if you plan to have fires while dispersed camping and want to have them safely.  ,camping,d36zo83,2,t5_2qk80

Usually park offices are pretty accommodating and will be more than willing to answer questions about which spots are the most secluded. ,camping,d39mwgr,3,t5_2qk80

Try to find out anything you can about their eating habits reproduction cycle etc. Learning about them may make it easier for you to view them as fellow animals. Also learn where the real danger is. Find out what lives in your area. Learn which ones if any are dangerous and what they look like.

They arent super bright but theyd give you enough light to see the tent door.Also your pillow case from home.  Bring the same pillow case you use at home with you  not one that has been freshly laundered however.  The smells from the pillow case will help trick the primitive side of your brain into thinking you still are at home. Smells like home must be home! and often helps.

They end up throwing away quite a bit of odd sizes that are left over after installation and should be more than happy to have you take it rather than have it filling their dumpster. Granted you probably wont find it cut to the size you want so you may have to use multiple pieces. A couple of layers of that stuff can be an excellent insulator. EDIT Too cold with just blankets? You could buy two space blankets and tape them together with packing tape into a sleeping bag to put around your blankets theyre somewhat noisy and dont take much abuse but they can really holdreflect your heat back onto you.

When i was working in Antarctica we had to pee in nalgene bottles women too and the warm bottles make excellent toe warmers. You get pretty good at peeing in your bag i felt bad for the women because they had to use those funnel things. Theres a couple other tips i would add as well. Like packing your extra clothes in your sleeping bag around your feet your sides and against your back if youre a side sleeper. I would sleep with my boots at the bottom of my sleeping bad so they wouldnt freeze overnight. My favorite thing was to make some antarctic coco twice the recommended coco ratio and add a half a stick of butter. All that fat burning kept you warm all night. The food rations always had tons of coco for some reason we had cases of the stuff we would make some backcountry fudge with it too mix it with some butter milk powder and water simmer over a whisperlite and let cool in the pan.

10104591,0,t1_dbogarh,Coolers are the biggest source of hassle in all my camping trips so in addition to what has been said Ill add some stuff I havent seen so farTip  Frontload all your wet foods to the beginning of the trip so icemanagement isnt as importantTip  If you are in the mountains and the river is cold use the river for your drinksTip  Add rock salt to your ice.  It lowers the temperature of the ice in your cooler so it lasts much longer.  The only drawback is you cant use the ice for drinks.  The other drawback is the ice gets kind of sharp and can tear through thin plastic.Tip  Dont bring full bottles of condiments that require refrigeration.  Go to a deli and ask for ketchup packs mustard packs etc.  They dont need to be refrigerated.Tip  They now make single serve tetrapak milk that is shelf stable without refrigeration.  Use that instead of refrigerated milk.Tip  Minimize the airspace in the cooler.  You want everything in close contact with the ice.There are some pretty good youtube videos about this stuff including dry ice management.  I suggest watching them.,camping,dbon1uy,9,t5_2qk80

11394114,0,t1_dfng1bb,Aside from the standard joke about running faster than your mates its probably just as likely youll be attacked as part of a group as solo. But I havent checked the stats. Plenty of attacks of couples.The odds of getting attacked are way small in most places. Even in camp. And especially in a boonie camp like the one in the picture. There are bears around the Montrose area more up towards the mountains but odds are they are looking for a juicy dumpster somewhere if they wanna peoplefood meal.And besides most bears in Montrose are VERY friendly ,camping,dfni9c5,3,t5_2qk80

11445976,0,t1_dftcu1m,You could look at the Kawasaki Mule. Now its nowhere near as badass as a rzr but its about half the price and still pretty nice. We use them a lot where I work for spraying fields controlled burns and general labor. They have taken quite the beating one caught on fire but overall still run and are great for off reading. ,camping,dfte3hy,1,t5_2qk80

11573688,0,t1_dg7v7x5,Eh personal preference I guess.First ever camping trip was a summer in Michigan and I was fine with just a puffy sleeping bag.  It wasnt cold and ground is firm obviously but not unbearable.Ive honestly never really looked for foam pads before.  All Ive used in terms of padding was a lightweight rollup one for hiking but it was like .  If they can get decent ones for  then more power to them.Do agree with the recommendation for two smaller tents.  Thatll probably be a budget call on their end I imagine.,camping,dg7vthg,1,t5_2qk80

11683256,0,t1_dgk8ckw,Typical preteen. Maybe something changed when you got there? Maybe she became scared at the threshold of getting in the boat and fishing because suddenly she realized stuff like the air is coolerwarmer or she imagined touching an actual fish or worm! Maybe she is insecure about her ability to fish and not look like a fool. Maybe she is insecure about swimming if the boat tips. This all may sound strange but I am trying to dig back through my memory from when I was . I would totally think boating sounded fun at home but then getting to the dock would cause me to overthink it and I would decide to rather sit on shore. I didnt like the way the wind would mess up my hair. Now I know to wear my hair so it wont get as messed up or am secure enough in myself to just work the messy hair and not care. I didnt like getting sunburned now I am responsible enough to bring sunscreen and a hat I really look forward to wearing to make sure I more comfortable.
