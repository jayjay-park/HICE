7085521,0,t3_4cmcpa,The same thread comes up about every other week I recommend you look at some of the replies to those.  First thing first every item has its pros and cons. Calling rageblade weak on irelia is rather similar to saying who skips ROA on singed or why rush lich bane on ekko not that I know much about ekko but Im pretty sure the analogy works there. Doing so locks you into a playstyle but enables you to perform very well. As far as performing on irelia rageblade is certainly a strong item. In lane stacks can be considered very reliable and leads your opponent to have two choices either show in lane at the risk of dying or let your tower be taken. Showing in lane undertower also risks the irelia solo dive which as long as she keeps her stacks up which is fairly simple is very threatening. This choice you force your opponents to make is the reason you see nearly every high elo NA player take rageblade sure there are some dedicated streamers and users her avoid rageblade but thats probably because they dont want to be locked to lanes So in terms of strength rageblade is almost undeniably strong for lane irelia. As a top laner your goal without rageblade would be fairly simple. Farm to mid game use your spikes to get advantages use advantages to win game or become a stun bot late game and hope your carries will take care of it. With rageblade rush your game plan changes to an extreme extent. You first dominate your lane hopefully snowballing kills if not you at least get global gold from turrets. After you take outerinner turret you get more room to ganksplit other lanes rageblade is considered weak for ganks but v youre ramp time shouldnt be a concern anyway and you take as many towers as you can reducing enemy global pressure with TP as necassary. You dont teamfight you split pressure until the base breaks or you hit late game stun bot mode. At that point the main disadvantage of Rageblade is the horrible ramp time the main advantage is high income from consistent splitting means you have tons of gold and can sell rageblade for BorKGA in the extreme late game. ,IreliaMains,d1jie8h,3,t5_34n29

8366862,0,t3_4u4czb,I always start Long Sword the sustain assuming you are basing between lvl is well beyond what dorans gives due to having  potions and you dont need to auto to get it. The only situation which you would want to consider Dorans is if you are afraid from getting ed really quickly. I dont really use cloth or corrupting pot either at this point none of her lane matchups areso unfavourable that you should need to go defensive and I dont think the mana or DoT of corrupting pot are worth the investment either since you get so much extra damage through the fact that you auto so much and your AAQ burst.Against Renekton you dont want to take unnecessary hits from his empowered abilities and in general you want to avoid taking hits from him unless you have to. Usually you are waiting for him to waste a CD.I often go Sheen and Stinger first to get to  CDR ASAP since I feel I can abuse the lower CDs and the sheen burst better I do quite often get a Dorans in between typically a g base will be DoransDagger to help amplify the Q burst and to give some survivability I would miss out on from not going with Phage.,IreliaMains,d5neq8r,1,t5_34n29

8568859,0,t1_d6coemj,Set ups only help so much and can depend on pkaystyle so take what i say with a grain of salt. If you have the IP getting a third rune page is super helpful. My recommended pages are AS and resists per level and one for early high physical dmg champs like renekton or tryndamere flat seals with AS quints is fine can also do flat seals and flat armor quints or scaling seals and flat armor quints Theoretically flat armor is ideal as its harder to itemize armor early as irelia and you have to deal with minion damage but if you can hold out till  scaling is technically better. As such having an extra early armor page for the more difficult match ups gives you more room to work with for items against bullies while keeping the optimal set up for other matchups. ,IreliaMains,d6cos4u,1,t5_34n29
8576613,0,t3_4x9g2x,Level  and level  are the safest times to fight him. You need to pay attention to his CDs and his fury.

8608935,0,t3_4xqj6j,Range gt melee and irelia cant deal with mega gnars high ccbase damage  tank unless shes ahead. Hyper procs have low counter play so you expend a lot of health to cs anyway.Ult nerf obviously helps gnar lourlo never bought sheen before stinger which is  a mistake in my opinion since mini gnar is both ranged with low base stats and has disengage. Lourlo also went for the more splitpush oriented BoRK every game. NA standard into gnar is randuins which imo is weak anyway. NA gnar takes frozen malletgtBC which is pretty aggressive into irelia and also not optimal. Korean standard for gnar into irelia is randuins omen to deal with the allins but smart korean gnars have been taking steraks which reduces the kill potential of the sheen procs from irelia ult. There isnt really a standard irelia into gnar build for koreans they generally vary the item with their role and what they need which is certainly appropriate. ,IreliaMains,d6hpo31,3,t5_34n29

If he wants to do well it simply comes down to understanding her weaknesses and working around it. I could argue that Zix is as bad or worse than her he can barely clear the jungle until he gets items and he is equally if not more snowball reliant and his tools in ganks are arguably worse than Irelias early on. Yet both can be equally dangerous later on in the game.Regardless my point is Id rather support OP in what he enjoys and what he wants to play rather than corner him into following x or y meta.,IreliaMains,d6k83i5,0,t5_34n29

I dont build it more often than not on my main but when Im smurfing in low diamond its something I buy in  of my games it is such a strong item to force plays and picks that its almost mandatory when youre ahead early in my opinion.

9661989,0,t1_da3y7i0,I was incorrect. What I meant to say was that since I dont really hear much talk of Irelia except foraboutfrom Irelia Carries U he is probably the largest if not one of the main reasons it is still reinforced today.I was thinking back to his state of Irelia video a year and a half ago where he talks about how season  people were rushing warmogs and weird stuff like that because Trinity got nerfed and was too expensive etc etc but yet he persisted trying most everything and still landing on Trinity and how him getting challenger playing mostly irelia later on was a big deal.ICU has advocated for full or nearfull ad builds before containing hydra cleaver youmuus bork zephyr and last whisper or even unconventional starts like double dorans into rushing frozen heart against renekton which even influenced Wickd for a game apparently but Ive never seen him deviate from this statement always triforce.hes also said I hate delaying items referring to trinity forceI was saying partially jokingly that his adherence to the Trinity Force and him being the mainstaple Irelia guru further enforces the TrinitygtTank build path. I wasnt sure how incorrect or correct I was sorry. Its true hes said and reinforced multiple times these past  years that basically TrinitygtTank is all you need with the exception of Rageblade change.on a slightly different topic this sentiment of his was lolz but its because its also an inside joke between a friend and me so I relate to this as wellyou can win lane with her if you play really well . . . its just why should i torture myself to play amazing to achieve the same result i can by playing subpar with something else,IreliaMains,da41jbs,-1,t5_34n29

10422811,0,t3_5p1gk9,Id like for her playstyle to stay exactly the same. diver splitpusher and duelist that can choose between going tanky or getting more damage depending on what the game needs.Q Definetly keep this the way it is. this is the spell that defines irelia in my opinion and allows for a lot of outplay potential.WIts fine if they change this spell but i think that she should have some ability that scales with AS.EReally like this spell but it does cause a lot of balance problems. Id be fine if they removed it but replaced it with an inconsistent stun just not a skillshot plsRThey can change this completely if it comes down to me. This spell feels underwhelming most of the time and the only innate synergy it has is with sheen procs. not sure what could replace it thoughPassiveher current passive promotes plitpushing as they want you to be in vv scenarios. sadly there are a lot of champions that splitpush better despite that. Even when you get in a scenario where it should work it doesnt feel like a strong ability that passive might as well just give a bit of stats which doesnt feel fun. passives like vayneekkofioradarius allows your opponents to play differently than any other champion when trying to kill you. Right now you try to deal with irelia just the same as any splitpusher.

11799839,0,t1_dgxjc7f,Okay so you lose  when selling it which is basically a kill or  cs. Also I think you meant to say that when you auto him its going to force minion aggro onto you not him. Thats why you harass him like that when the lane is frozen or reset and when he goes in for a castermelee minion just auto once and dont continue the trade and run away. And if he tries to counter trade you hell have to tank your minion wave if you run back after autoing him while he takes a minion.  gtGaren can out trade you if he plays smartAlso this is depending on the player and not solely on champ vs champ which isnt relevant in this discussion. And that last part about not standing in the minion wave Like a dolt Wow another ad hominem!! Is correct but what if you have to go in and kill an enemy caster minion? Youre going to do aoe damage to his entire enemy wave just to take cs. Think of it as trying to freeze with Tiamat just with Tiamats passive doing a bit more damage than Bamis Cinder.
