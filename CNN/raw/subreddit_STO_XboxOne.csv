9241690,0,t3_53ztr5,I changed to the purple beam weapons after the orange standard type were having no effect. Ive started realising that if the other ships kill you too quick or wont die Im using the wrong weapons.Anyone know why I cant train my bridge officers in new skills? Are there more options when you get a level  ship? Currently on .,STO_XboxOne,d8ng9ay,1,t5_3etqb
