807039,0,t1_cgvzwni,If I was going to buy anything right now it would either be another  for my main system or a few AMD s or xs for  a dedicated folding rig newer GPUs are just going to cost more anyways and since a lot of people are parting out their bitcoin rigs there are tons of cheap AMD s and xs available on ebay and OCN.,Folding,cgw0j9m,2,t5_2s800

Pausing and then Folding often can get it unstuck.Do you happen to use Microsofts Remote DeskTop?  Connecting using it will kill the active GPU WU.,Folding,clzrvci,1,t5_2s800
