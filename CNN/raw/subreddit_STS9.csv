7728598,0,t3_4hz1a7,The Rabble from the NYE Run at the Fillmore in Denver the other year. Also they played like an awesome  minute long Rent with Sweet Dreams in it.STSs RRX set had a really good Shock Doctrine and HDHF two songs Im usually not too into. That second night at Red Rocks last year was prob my fav Tribe show Ive seen and been to .,STS9,d3koqoe,1,t5_2rwk9
8478840,0,t3_4vsir9,I was super excited to press the play button and was immediately like wtf when those vocals popped right out at me but the song definitely grew on me as it went on. Very discoy. The song will surely slide into live sets pretty nicely as a balance to the trancierdarkerprettier stuff that is the main course. I think its interesting that both Lotus and STS seem to be going in the funkdisco direction with a lot more vocals and happiness. This new  sound is not my favorite from either band but I can get down with it and respect the exploration. Super happy New Dawn New Day is on there. They opened with it at my nd show Sonic Bloom  and it was the perfect blastoff into my favorite set by them once again Im a fan of the darker amp trippier side of tribe so that was an ideal set. Totem is also sweet.I bet Common Descent is gonna be a sweet track ,STS9,d61ebs9,6,t5_2rwk9

10384203,0,t1_dcl1nuv,On AdExplorata Oil amp Water has two main sections that represent the Oil and the Water but the only section thats been played live for the first five years was the Oil section Water was nowhere to be found at all. That changed on this most recent fall tour where they played the Water section for the first time ever right off the end of Oil amp Water as it is on the album track and in in later shows they started to play the Water part either without the Oil part or before it so they started referring to the Water section as a standalone in the setlists. Presumably this will be a thing that happens periodically now as they keep exploring that section in different places and different ways. ,STS9,dcl43qz,4,t5_2rwk9

11674304,0,t3_66jzev,Haha you really had a bad time? Minus the sloppy start night one the rest of it was well executed and the track placement couldnt have been better. Night two definitely had too many covers and a bunk first encore but Id still give it an .Bottom line its red rocks. I personally could never have a bad time there but my least favorite show Ive seen was  great cycle spectacles on the rocks. Still had a good time.,STS9,dgjarct,2,t5_2rwk9
