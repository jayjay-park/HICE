705593,0,t1_cgkfg8t,Yes thank you. I do know the dangers of breeding double merle deafnessblindness. This is just what my mom is requesting and one reason is she doesnt want to be reminded of our old dog black tri but still wants one of the same breed.,AustralianShepherd,cgkh9dy,0,t5_2suwx

1489268,0,t3_2b86oa,I didnt get my girl until she was  years old so no puppy advice. Remember a tired dog is a good dog this will be more important several months down the line!. My girl is almost  and a half she is a different dog the weeks she gets enough exercise and mental stimulation and the weeks she doesnt. Neighborhood walk and backyard fetch are every day activities as well as eating out of an interactive toy or performing tricks for her kibble no free meals we dont do bowls obviously not something for little pups. But at least once a week she has to actually do something lake day decent off leash hike play date with canine friends who have a similar play style other herding breed dogs are the best. This isnt easy with my work schedule right now but these outings are a must for her mental and emotional well being and mine!. Have fun with your pup!,AustralianShepherd,cj2ydgz,2,t5_2suwx
1975256,0,t1_ckqkr4i,Im glad to hear this about it being normal. I used to have a Border Collie but she did not like my Aussie. The only time they would really interact with each other was when we were at the dog park and they would herd the other dogs. ,AustralianShepherd,ckr7v41,1,t5_2suwx

2555459,0,t1_cms42ji,Yeah. We had a little problem with communication. The rancher said it would be  with the ticket so I declined because i cant see the puppies in person first and made an offer to the local lady for  out of pocket. Later i find out the rancher can have a friend deliver the boy out for  which Id be really happy with.I dont like lying to people after I make an offer so now I have to wait and see if the local breeder accepts or declines my offer. Regardless I should have a puppy next week.,AustralianShepherd,cms4we2,1,t5_2suwx
2955016,0,t1_co3qkc8,Ive raised several puppies and I am a vet student. If they could only hold it for an hour were you having to get up hourly throughout the night? A lot of it has to do with training too..i.e. what you let them do is what theyll get used to. So if they are going out every half hour as a preventative measure to avoid accidents they wont condition their minds to control those urinary sphincters for longer than about half an hour. Eventually that will lengthen but puppies can learn much quicker than we credit them for usually. Not to say your method is wrong whatsoever just offering another point of view. ,AustralianShepherd,co3zzv0,1,t5_2suwx
3171009,0,t1_coqkxnz,If she has more males than just the tri onsite and any of them are male merles its completely possible that a merle may have also mated with dam at a later time in her heat cycle its not unheard of for puppies in one litter to have different fathers. This could also just be a case of an extreme pattern white or piebald which often have the same defects as double merles.Im not trying to imply that the breeder you got her from is malicious just likely inexperienced and uneducated especially considering they let your pup go home earlier than typically recommended.,AustralianShepherd,coqo97v,3,t5_2suwx

3983581,0,t1_cracpod,Yes! Thats a perfect example! There are rescue groups that take on either a pregnant mom or a mom who just had a litter and then adopt out those pups. Purebred aussie pups might be less common that adults but they do happen. Just trying to think of a couple other links to help you for rescue groups This is the club for your area I believe They should be able to direct you to a reputable rescue group. Carolina hearts is a rescue group I follow on FB. They seem to often have puppies and super cute ones. It might also be good to use petfinder to search rescue groups in your area contact them and let them know what youre looking for even if they dont currently have any aussie puppies. ,AustralianShepherd,crad3jz,3,t5_2suwx
4047334,0,t1_crhlnj1,Thank you!  We love her tail too very fluffy! She is such a gentle and kind dog all she wants to do is cuddle all day but does have her hyper moments! ,AustralianShepherd,crhml7n,1,t5_2suwx
4216204,0,t3_396vad,I have been wanting an Aussie for a while and I am now in a perfect position to adopt so I have been looking around on Petfinder and local. There are  up for adoption this friday but they seem to be mixed. This isnt a problem for me but I was just curious as I would like to know what ti will look like when it grows up and its behavior etc.Let me know ! thanks,AustralianShepherd,cs0txb7,2,t5_2suwx
4536153,0,t1_ct1y3kk,We had to shave my aussie this spring got into something very nasty.  His coat hasnt grown back yet and we need to use sunscreen on him when he goes out for more than a little bit.,AustralianShepherd,ct2ews7,1,t5_2suwx

7143610,0,t3_4daz7t,Her face and color pattern looks more Akita and less Aussie. Shes possibly an Akita mix. Dont do the DNA panel I work in veterinary medicine and word on the street is that they do not have a big enough data pool to come up with an accurate answer. We had a full blooded golden come up as a dalmatian mix.,AustralianShepherd,d1q5ign,3,t5_2suwx

7790158,0,t1_d3rkaeu,Providing enough mental and physical stimulation is great but after doing so they need to know that they dont need it constantly. When Jasper was a pup I thought hed chill once I gave him enough but I never could meet that limit and he would pester me nonstop and I think even get overtired. Different lines mature at different rates so you may see some improvement around then and you should expect to see a bigger difference around two. I mean theyre still Aussies but usually their offswitch starts working around then.,AustralianShepherd,d3ro59r,2,t5_2suwx

8506635,0,t3_4w87kg,I have no idea the answer to this but my mini does the exact same thing. If he has a chewchie he has to have a paw or two on me or lay across my legs or force me to hold the chewchie. If we are wandering around the house he will definitely herd me and he isnt really a snuggle bug unless if he has a chewchie then he has to be touching me and make sure i wont steal his chewchie.,AustralianShepherd,d64vus6,3,t5_2suwx

10213570,0,t3_5m852p,Yes I bought him for  from a lady on Craigslist.  His hearing and vision seems great though.  Should I be worried?  ,AustralianShepherd,dc1rl4m,1,t5_2suwx
10490868,0,t3_5q4rn3,i grew up calling it flea biting and it just stuck.  i am aware of others who refer to it as such. consider it a term of endearment your dog is cleaning you. my Bernese Mountain dog does this frequently as well as my  aussies. my dogs will do it as yours does when i first get back home then sometimes it is completely random like when i am sitting on the couch. ,AustralianShepherd,dcx90op,1,t5_2suwx
10493184,0,t1_dcwqmbl,I am so in love with your dogs name.Just curious did you get it from the Overwatch character?,AustralianShepherd,dcxigkz,1,t5_2suwx
10623429,0,t3_5rbx7y,First shes gorgeous!Second what is this sleep you speak of? Is it similar to coffee? I love coffee.Third these dogs were bred to protect whats theirs. I think thats all it is honestly. Suspicion of strangers isnt inherently bad acting negatively as a result of the suspicion is. I think she just wasnt socialized well as a pup. No matter I think she will be fine if you keep it up! Good luck ,AustralianShepherd,ddbq53a,1,t5_2suwx
10629613,0,t3_5s4779,Weve done well on Fromm. Theres a lot of really good options. Your breeder should be able to discuss with you what their dogs have done well on and suggest what to try. If youre going to make your own food its important to work with a nutritionist to make sure its balanced. Its not as simple as just mixing some meat and veggies. ,AustralianShepherd,ddcd3rt,1,t5_2suwx
10769956,0,t1_ddqt8tt,Sorry my comment comes of kinda harsh I mainly meant for it to be geared toward the two people I tagged. Aussies are best for frisbee ,AustralianShepherd,ddquapr,2,t5_2suwx

11002553,0,t1_def26q4,Shes great at fetch so she gets her tennis ball thrown every evening until she starts slowly bringing it back. She interacts with other dogs once or twice a week the dog parks been closed for winter but shell get to go on weekends when it opens soon yay!. She does play with my sisters chihuahua every week.I might be wrong but she seems to be less energetic than other aussies Ive read about she seems physically satisfied.. Its when she settles down after that she wants to get into things. Whatever she finds she brings in bed to tearchew up. ,AustralianShepherd,def3vil,2,t5_2suwx
