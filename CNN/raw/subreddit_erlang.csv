7019409,0,t1_d1bydra,Oh  no  its the way I described it then. If the session wants to make a request for the player and then update its records based on the response  then it needs to call some function in the API of the player server.  That function then calls gen servercall for the player server since the player is handling the request. The session server will just wait for the response from the API function  it doesnt know anything about callcastinfo.  Since you want to record some info based on the players response  Id recommend using call in the interior of your API function.   While FSMs can be a bit complicated games can be well suited to them since there are a finite number of states and a limited number of actios that move you from one state to the next. ,erlang,d1c0053,1,t5_2qh9n

10615029,0,t1_ddalph1,From the comments it seems that it isnt really very reliable to use wx in production which kinda defeats the purpose of writing it in Erlang unfortunately.Thanks for the help anyway.,erlang,ddauyxp,1,t5_2qh9n
11722625,0,t1_dgojj9p,Holy sh thats... sad? Frustrating? Theres not much benefit for using SSLTLS if nothings verified. I work as a pentester and that was something I didnt expect from Erlang and its community. An interesting contrast is Python where one has to disable certificate validation explicitly and even then it raises a warning every time a socket if opened...,erlang,dgosfw9,2,t5_2qh9n
