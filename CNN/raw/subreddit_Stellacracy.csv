It saves a lot of time measuring out tricolors basically.,Stellacracy,dasehjk,2,t5_3hlff

10026823,0,t1_dbeilf1,Well if this case proceeds we go to the vote of all  the  justices and President myself and Ymir. The real question we need to decide OOC is during what term that happens and Id argue that since the action took place during the first term thats the court that rules so we use the old set and dont need to worry about the special elections and the new Chief Representative assuming next term it is not also Ymir.,Stellacracy,dbeito5,2,t5_3hlff
10034955,0,t3_5jafuy,I think there can be emergency situations where resettlement is both necessary and viablesuch as evacuations but I dislike an openended policy whereby the powers of state can enact ressettlement whenever they please. Presumably this use is forbidden by the constitution though. So I guess while I dislike its openended nature I cant see where this is strictly illegal though perhaps our Justices will feel differently. If anything this situation is just a further illustration that government did not work as needed to ensure a more balanced policy and the side that failed here was clearly not the president. ,Stellacracy,dbfkxli,1,t5_3hlff

10071714,0,t1_dbkd5ww,Were only two people.  Two votes does not equal four.  Thats your answer.  A toddler could see it.  The average votes of the entire assembly was around  each its hard to get things passed when there were over  bills and so few actual votes.  Many bills died at  votesOnce again the SEP is their own entity.  Votes for popular assembly dont have a  and  slot.  People vote for one party.  Coalitions therefore dont really matter in the assembly as you understand with your previous partner,Stellacracy,dbkd7rh,1,t5_3hlff
