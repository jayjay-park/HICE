4424666,1,t3_3bptcb,I am here to defend the Cube and Graser on this one. I was there when the decision was made to kick MinecraftMeh from The Cube UHC and I whole heartedly supported the decision for these reasons. A. We had attempted to contact him several times in regards to the UHC season being planned and he would never respond to group messages or make ANY attempt to try to get to know people in the group.B. He had not uploaded on his channel at all since the previous season of UHC and before that his video uploads were few and far between. For all we knew he was another Huahwi who stopped uploading videos and never responded to messages.C. Graser did not... and I repeat... DID NOT make MinecraftMeh quit YouTube. This angers me that people want to peg the problems that MM was having with YouTube on Graser. If MM wanted to continue doing YouTube he would have continued uploading content to his channel or made an attempt to reach out to people letting them know what was going on.Sorry for the heated post but getting really sick of people trying to throw all this shade at the Cube people when they dont even know what happens behind the scenes most of the time and instead look to make other people look like villains when they arent.,TheCube,csof7e3,-3,t5_2y8ea
4429992,0,t3_3bqdvg,Yes but I think it will mainly stay Minecraft. If you have a look at their channels their is barely any CSGO videos. Just  case openings so yes and no. It will become a gaming group but keep MC as the main focus. As of now atleast,TheCube,csp3973,1,t5_2y8ea

Spoiler John Snow dies so the fan base got pissed and asked him to come back. There was a lot of hate for that but Game of thrones didnt sit there and cry about it saying stop the hate plsss. Take Bee for example. She switched side and it caused a lot of hate. Yet she complained. My reasoning if the cube is going to be like a TV series then there will be everything that goes with it including hate.,TheCube,d3vqigq,1,t5_2y8ea

8089140,0,t1_d4p3drt,Well its true that their friends swear a lot which naturally  it would probably make people around them swear more. But I dont see whats bad about this Straub and bee always censor their curse words so obviously they really dont want the fans to hear it I know they can hear the beep but its better than the word. in their videos. And you didnt give me any proof of them swearing more as they moved in I havent noticed anything. I think what youre saying is that they swear more in videos. Also if you consider damn hell and pisspissed as bad words well Straub said that he doesnt consider their bad words I dont know if its an Aussie thing or thats just what he thinks I dont know if bee is the same but you cant really count those word as curse words when they say it.Also I know I havent been around as long as other people but I have been around since the beginning of of season  but I watch pretty much every single one of Straubs videos so it gets hard to remember which one is which. I dont watch too many of bees videos though.Also what made you think that I havent been around long lol assuming gets you no where.Yes I know that they were being dumb in stores and stuff but to me it was amusing because I knew they werent doing anything against the law well idk about Aussie laws so I cant really say too much there.  and if you dont like that type of stuff please dont watch it we dont need anyone hating on any onenot saying youre hating but it gives off a negative feeling in the community when I see posts like this..Just gonna clear up some things quickly.I do follow both bee and Straub on snapchat so I know whatever theyre doing. But even before they moved in together I remeber one post on bees snap it was a videoIm pretty sure it was a video of Straub hanging on one of those things where you can park your kart that you usually find at like Walmart well he was doing some things that you would call dumb before they moved in together.Also if you havent noticed theyre setting up a lot of stuff for a streaming office or something like that so thats taking up time for them which also means theyre going to be streaming more so they cant make videos while theyre streaming.I get that youre upset that theyre doing these things in videos and on snapchat but youre making it seem like theyre supposed to be these pure superheroes that theyre obviously not. But the thing is YouTube is a lot different than a normal job if they take a month off it should be fine because its YouTube and not some other job.And you didnt say anything about how I said that he wouldnt be making videos as well in June and it would be better in July not sure if you didnt see it or not but there it is again.,TheCube,d4pakli,1,t5_2y8ea
