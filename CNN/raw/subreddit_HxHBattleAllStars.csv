As ofcourse they show that Kurapika can beat any Phantom Troupe member simply because of the heavy condition placed upen his ability. Gonsan showed the power of the ultimate conditions I would say.

This is super helpful since shes a tank and tanks have high stun rates and the attack range lets her attack and stun everything on screen if they werent killed. Her support ability multiplies her attackers dmg by . and increases defense by . The support also has another ability that i cant understand but i think only works for tank attackers. As an attacker shes fantastic especially with the first and third abilities that prevent stuns and the like.

10235337,0,t1_dc37emx,I dont know much about the tanker Chrollo heard he is very good. The fighter Chrollo is on the other hand also good. His ability gives him a counter and if you have his SP ability he can do his ability from the start which is very handy for missions with  map like the fighter Hisoka one.,HxHBattleAllStars,dc48dxi,1,t5_3977i

11282236,0,t1_dfatj0g,Nah I had already completed the non restricted one when it was around last time. Did the restricted one this morning when the update went live and did not use  cost characters or less to do it. ,HxHBattleAllStars,dfatpap,1,t5_3977i
11287445,0,t3_613hum,do some rare  stars have abilities?else use wizard netero supported by tanker kurapika put fighter youpi in the last slot then put w menchibuhara in the middle slot,HxHBattleAllStars,dfbez19,1,t5_3977i
11291773,0,t1_dfbfiht,One of the  best wizards in the game and probably the best team buffer. Great pull,HxHBattleAllStars,dfbwmum,1,t5_3977i
11301683,0,t3_61ammk,There are  ways to unlock character abilities. First is like you said you pull the same character and you feed it to your old one. You can also feed a higher star but same character to your lower star one that will get you an ability too. Feeding low star characters to high star ones will maybe get you an ability its not guaranteed. Second is flames. You need a same or greater star flame than the character you want to unlock the ability for. They are pretty rare so i advise u use them in god cards check the sidebar there is a ranking of the cards .  ,HxHBattleAllStars,dfd120v,1,t5_3977i
