6151767,0,t1_cyorphn,First of all IMO the sooner we get used to quickly retiring technology and especially standards the better. This will allow for fast adoption of fixes or even entirely new protocols in place of widely deployed flawed ones.Enforcing such a policy will lead to better practices throughout the whole stacksorry and especially in coding and architecture decisions security and update policies in crypto libraries web servers browsers operating systemsAndroidiOS specifically and better practices during system administration.Ultimately my hope is to not have such bugs staying around in bugtrackers for years and still having to disable RC by hand in my Firefox but instead have code base thats easy to modify and extend and an environment that is quick to embrace changes.Second when I read through the thread you linked I got the impression that FB and CF do not really want to assist in going in the direction I described above but instead want to concentrate on retaining these several percent of users that would lose access to their services.I think that just creating a loophole for them is the wrong decision and the easy way out. Instead FB and CF and possibly reddit should provide anonymised statistics for analysis by the CABF and work together to find a way to keep everybody updated. This will ultimately benefit ALL their users and will help with creating the environment I described above.Bottom line quick retirement of dated standards gt requirement for a more flexible environment gt better practices throughout the stack gt better security for everybody on the Internet.,bugs,cyow4en,3,t5_2h84o

Meaning if you wanted to rig every one of them its extremely hard.You can buy out local elections which happens frighteningly often but that doesnt effect the lives of people in different states.
