Ignoring triggers of courseRiding playing and keeping the right combination of guards against your opponents deck is about  of playing. You can be playing Gold Paladin vs Kagero and if you dont superior call youre generally screwed depending on the specific build you have vs your opponents build. Im saying midtier generic starter decks here. of the game is trigger launching. No control over this unless youre Oracle Thinktank.Last  Is anticipation of your opponents next move before they do it.

1315287,0,t3_2944au,So im just gonna answer your questions in the way you asked them since it will be the easiest way.STAPLESOkay so with vanguard there are no staples apart from null guards. Null guards are clan specific and they usually vary in cost anywhere from . Most of the time people will run .RARER ATTACKERSSo with vanguard theres  types of attackers. Vanguard and Rearguards. In most situations the vanguards are the more expensive part of the deck for instance Nouvelle recently came out and can be anywhere from   . Rear guards usually are cheaper however occasionally they can get pricey due to being from an older set. On average you could get by with single rares or rrs in most situations. So anywhere from Free.Youtubers?None that I know of sorry I might be starting one up for my vanguard team since weve nearly topped a few major tournaments. DEFENSIVE DECKS?Okay so arguably the most defensive deck is Chaos Breaker at the moment. It pretty much shuts down the opponents field so they cant attack with much. Next set set  Dauntless Reverse comes up. I think that this is arguably the most defensive deck for a long time. Before you buy anything people might suggest getting a trial deck. For learning the game I recommend getting the Dimensional Police or Link Joker one since that is arguably one of the better ones for a one off. If you have any questions just ask me im pretty friendly and have no life since im on holidays so i should be able to get back to you within a few hours.,cardfightvanguard,cihl4qq,1,t5_2tcbx

Some clans have starter decks like Gold Paladins and Narukami and some dont like Pale Moon. Once you decide on what clan decide on your price range. Do you want to play competitively in tournaments or not? With those figured out look around the internet for decks of that range or main cards you can afford to build around and if theres a trial deck that has a lot of what you need you can get those most people will generally get  or  trial decks and throw in perfect guards and then update with singles as it goes on,cardfightvanguard,ciycu8i,1,t5_2tcbx

1671628,0,t1_cjpuxsy,Whoops that was my bad.  I missed the last  triggers for deck.This Genesis deck should be fine to start you off with the clan.  Its cheap but focuses on the important part of the clan that you need to get used to.  Once you get more used to the game youll be able to switch out to more powerful decks like Regalia of Omniscience Minerva if you feel like it.Considering youre somewhat new to the game I would largely suggest asking your friends about the different clans and if possible borrowing their decks and trying as many of them out as you can.  Learning about each one will let you see if any click or feel like theyre the right fit for you.  While money may not be an option its generally not a good thing to throw money at something just to find out you dont like how it plays or feels and deconstruct it and sell it to make a bit of your money back to throw at something else.If youd like I can also give you a few suggestions based on the concepts you like in decks and you can go from there.  While its not necessary finding out what clans you like best from the get go is worth saving the money.  I myself built practically every clan at some point in time only to deconstruct most of them hundreds of dollars wasted because I threw money at them because I thought they were interesting.Another option is Cardfight Area a program that you can play vanguard on using your computer.  While I dont personally use it to actually play against others it has a deck builder and an option to play test on there.  That way it lets you see what cards there are of each clan and then you can test your deck out though without an actual opponent.,cardfightvanguard,cjpvcnb,1,t5_2tcbx

2365167,0,t3_2mgmk7,. You can say its terribly sacky for someone to get lucky with a double critical trigger or something and win from  damage but then you can go over to the yugioh table and theyd call sack for pulling Exodia in  turns. All card games have the luck problem and its just as much a factor of skillfully minimizing it in Vanguard as it is elsewhere. For example most people place guard generally expecting a trigger to be checked when being attacked by a grade  vanguard with Twin Drive.. Front row rearguards can be boosted by the backrow rearguards assuming the guy at the back actually has the ability Boost and can then throw their attack at anything in the front row. You can even whiff it on purpose against something you know it cant kill if you feel that somehow presents strategic value very much relevant to Aqua Force who gain effects based on how many battles have occurred. However you cant attack the back.. Im relatively new as well but from what Ive seen its one of the more balanced games. At least the clans themselves are. Power creep is a thing still and obsolete cards do exist but often each clan gets creeped at relatively the same rate so if you like a particular playstyle you can generally not have to worry about it becoming completely obsolete. Some clans just have better mechanical focus obviously but the power discrepancy isnt great enough that you can overwhelm skill with sheer power.. Bermuda Triangle is a clan thats apparently a mermaid idol agency. Moe moe everywhere. Theres also Shadow Paladin Witches coming soon and I guess some of the goddesses in Genesis Regalia can be pretty hot. IMO for pure cute anime girl factor though Bermuda Triangle has such a high concentration of cute that I can actually believe ships sinking from it . . . man that joke was bad..The wiki generally covers all the cards for effects and stats at the very least if not lore and such. Though you cant really thumbnail that thing. I wish someone would make an actual database program gtlt. I think there are cards out there that are just restricted period theres even a card with CONT This card cannot be put in a deck after February  . as its effect which is kind of hilarious. Though with how rulings work its generally not reliable to have two clans making up half a deck each for example. You might end up with a full field of one clan by accident and having your triggers be useless. Theres also the Lord ability that cripples the card that has it when you play mixed as you cant attack at all with an unmatched clan in play on your field. AFAIK most if not all  power grade  units have it and those are generally the competitive cards compared to  power grade s. You can mix anything you want for the most part really but do so at your own risk. Except that Royal Paladin and Shadow Paladin thing which Towan probably explained better. I believe Bushi had to make that ruling for the sake of Majesty Lord Blaster..  from my experience. Really varies.,cardfightvanguard,cm41l8n,1,t5_2tcbx

You usually end up making very little choices when building such as trigger lineup and maybe a choice between  different grade  and  lineups. It does allow for better cards because they can restrict abilities to requiring cards from the same archetype but at times it just feels like an easy way for the creators to not have to worry about balancing newer cards with older ones. Some archetypes seem great taking decks in completely different directions almost like entirely different clans like the Dimensional Police or Nova Grappler Archetype options..Whereas others seem like with a little more thought they could have been balanced for use with older cards such as Silver Thorn or Ancient Dragons. ,cardfightvanguard,cmhrcxf,1,t5_2tcbx

2583064,0,t1_cmvqaxd,Its works but imo its kind of boring and depending on the situation a little rude.  In a tournament where you want to win its a win so you do what you have to legally but in less serious tournaments and in casual play youre basically removing the mechanic and fun out of the deck for the opponent and its kind of messed up.You basically turn the game vanilla and force your opponent to do nothing unless they have a back up limit break unit.  Sure you are able to do whatever you want and youre not guaranteed a win if they know what youre doing and rush back but its almost like taking fun out of it for some people.I just think its a little messed up to intentionally take the fun out of a persons deck when playing casually and for fun.

2903927,0,t1_cny6hje,Why The Great is so well... Great is that its so cheap that it doesnt matter if its not an attack on the vanguard.  Either they dont call out front row At least other than decks that can kill them off after using those front row themselves and you always have to guard less or youre getting  extra drive checks to look for triggers for what is basically CB and the ability to cycle out cards you dont want from your hand to get potentially better ones.  Hes CB which is a cheap CB cost to restand by all means and on top of this he doesnt even discard .  He discards  which is a neutral.  And thats only if he doesnt hit a draw trigger.This isnt even factoring in that youre killing off your opponents front row which means on top of guarding a potentially deadlier vanguard thanks to his  extra chances to hit a critical or power himself up his opponent also has that much harder a time replenishing their field without as much hand and as much field as he had last turn.Basically hes doing what a good control deck should be doing.  Not killing them off in one go like you would Sing Saver or PBA but paying almost nothing to hit your opponents field while still attacking vanguard with no real disadvantages to using his skill overall and only benefits.  On top of all of this unlike Sing Saver and PBA who focus on a big burst turn late game he can start hitting their field as early as one damage should he get enough Gojos off or gets the  cards in drop by some means.,cardfightvanguard,cny6krz,1,t5_2tcbx

Honestly its cheaper than the non crossride in my opinion.When I play against them I see it happen at least once or twice per game.

3310887,0,t3_2y2air,Boosting only applies power if the unit in front is ATTACKING and you rest the booster not DEFENDING unless specified which as of now there arent any that doAny front row rearguard or vanguard can attack any front row rearguard or vanguard.  There are few exceptions to this rule.  A few off the top off my head are Dragonic Kaiser Vermillion Big Bang Knucle DragonBuster redirecting an attack to a back row by rubidium or  Battle Siren Sutashia.Any card that is an applicable target can be attacked more than once however each battle is conducted separately and you cannot combine two cards attacks into one battle phase Besides a legioned vanguard or using Dragonic Kaiser Vermillion or Big Bang Knuckle DragonBuster. In the legioned vanguards case you are adding the legion mates power to the vanguard somewhat like a booster and not attacking twice separately.  In the case of Vermillion and the Big Bang Knuckles they are attacking multiple targets at the same time during a single battle phase where you treat each card attacked as separate attacks during the same battle phase.Cards like Kaiser Vermillion and Big Bang Knuckle cards listed above can attack more than one card at once by using their skills.  If this is done all cards targeted ARE ATTACKED AT THE SAME TIME.  Meaning during the guard step you must guard each card separately.  So perfect guarding the vanguard does not mean all  atttacks are nullified only the vanguard is safe.  The same goes for regular shield guarding as well. Additionally UNITS BEING ATTACKED IN THE FRONT ROW CANNOT BE INTERCEPTED TO GUARD ANOTHER CARD.  This means you cannot intercept a grade  to defend your vanguard If they are both being attacked.An attack redirector like Rubidium in this situation redirects ALL ATTACKS during that specific attack declaration that it is played.  Meaning if Kaiser Vermillion were to attack your whole front row you may redirect all  attacks to a single appropriate unit A card with reverse in its name in the front or back row meaning you only have to guard one card.  Technically it will be attacked  times but for the same power each time so its like you were only guarding once as they all happen simultaneously.  Additionally if you have two grade s in front row that were being attacked and redirect the attack to a card in back row your front row is able to intercept now and you can use them to intercept and defend the new target.  Though in most cases you intended it to take the hit and not guard it anyway if you redirected the attack,cardfightvanguard,cp5o31y,2,t5_2tcbx

3542031,0,t1_cpvq3xf,I think the intended G assist is the fairest way otherwise you can practically run a crazy amount of some level which some decks really like to do and does not run the risk of getting grade stuck for doing it giving them an unintended obvious edge and if the chance that theres not a single grade in this example in the top  cards would be assuming you have drawn  cards and rode as well as went first which would during complete normal circumstaces with no effects which changes the deck leave you with a deck of  cards starting hand  draws  trigger check  starter and assuming you are playing a rather standard of  grade s the probability of finding at least one grade  in the top  cards is approximately  which is favourable odds especially compared to mere  of missing the ride trigger next draw while still going minus.  I think your playgroup should stick with the normal G Assist.  If you do guarantee a search for it it will be abused A LOT especially since they get to search any grade  in most cases.,cardfightvanguard,cpw0ijb,1,t5_2tcbx

3592513,0,t3_31i2pb,First up unless youre either. buying Extra Boosters which typically only provide support for a single clan. Playing multiple clans or. Splitting the cost with other peopleSingles are way cheaper than booster boxes. You may like opening packs but I think youll probably find yourself disappointed by the value at the end of it.Second buying booster boxes will probably leave you without the ability to create a legal deck. You need to have  trigger units and a recent ruling states that your entire deck must be of the same clan. That wont be happening with a booster box probably not even two. But theyre easy enough to get singles for they just tend to be a bit pricier for commons. You certainly wont be able to build a good deck however.Thirdly BT is a little bit outdated. Vanguard G is the new hotness with new mechanics and whatnot. Building a deck out of BT will probably leave you behind the curve and youll unlikely find many cards will be that helpful moving forwards. You probably wont get the best value out of it.There is however an easy solution. Royal Paladins have a new trial deck  GTD  and two of those will give you  of every card in it providing you with a reasonably solid deck right out of the gate. Further to that theyve got a small amount of support in GBT and will be getting even more support in the upcoming GBT  although I would still not recommend buying booster boxes for them as they are not primary support in each case receiving less cards than other clans in the set.Gold Paladins will be receiving support in GBT although its still a while away so we dont know the full contents of the set yet. They also dont have a trial deck so it wont be as easy to build a deck out of that set.Link Joker are also receiving support in GBT but will also be getting a trial deck  GTD  in the future. Again we dont know the full contents as its a future release but it will almost certainly be roughly similar in structure to the the current GTDs meaning buying two will sort you out fine.My recommendation? Stick with Vanguard G cards and sets for now buying older single as and when you can find a use for them. Booster Sets are rarely worth the money for most players. Seeing as you want to play Royal Paladins I would suggest sticking with them for now  buy a couple of GTD play a few games see how you like the game the clan and the deck before you invest yourself more heavily into it. Get to really know the one clan first before you start investing in other clans  and by the time youll probably be ready to do so Link Jokers TD will be just around the corner.May not be as fun this way but youre less likely to get burned by buyers remorse.,cardfightvanguard,cq1rv3b,5,t5_2tcbx

I know full well about shipping costs as I often buy imported things with markups for shipping or have to pay the shipping myself.  The aforementioned websites are good guidelines for price values of cards.  They are in no means the indefinite price of a card because there can be many other factors involved.  A card could be selling online for  but Id charge a friend  or some stranger in person .  The opposite can be said if someone is desperately looking for something and buys my  dollar card I am using for  because they want it now.

4255924,0,t3_39puux,At the beginning of your turn after you stand and draw and after the ride step if both you and your opponent is at grade  or higher you can discard cards with grades equal to  or more.  grade s  grade s  grade   grade s and  grade  etc.  By doing so you choose one of the face down units in your GZone Basically your extra deck and place it on top of your vanguard.Both units underneath become the heart and you choose one of the hearts and the stride unit gains both the printed power of the unit plus its name So Harmonics Messiah would be    so  from Top Idol Riviere Power Bonuses from ride chain doesnt apply only printed power and would also be treated as Harmonics Messiah and Top Idol Riviere  These units have triple drive which means they get  drive checks.  A few Stride units have skills that give them  drive check meaning they only drive check twice Keep in mind that a stride is not a ride so striding on top of a breakride gives no breakride skills to the stride unit.  There are however newer units that specify giving skills upon being strode over. Ex See Alter Ego MessiahAt the end of the turn before you do anything you place the stride unit back to the Generation Zone face up.  Then you start resolving skills.  Any units that were heart go back to being vanguard and any cards that were in legion go back to being in legion.For the purposes of cards with Generation Break any face up stride units in the Generation Zone plus any Stride units on Vanguard circle count towards the number of units required for Generation Break.  For instance Generation Break  means you have to simply stride once and even though theres no face up cards in generation zone your current stride unit on Vanguard Circle counts and any of those skills will be active.For Generation Break two it also will be active with only one face up card in G zone as long as you also have a Stride unit on Vanguard Circle as well.Some cards need to have a certain number of face up G units to activate skills.  In this case if it specifies At least one face up GUnit in your Gzone you need a face up unit in your GZone.  This is different from Generation Break and does not count your GUnit on VG circle.As for if its worth it to come back into Vangaurd thats really dependent on the person and the reasons why you left in the first place.,cardfightvanguard,cs5cz1g,1,t5_2tcbx

They have so much power pressure with those cards that the extra crit and  this gives is almost negligible.The only reason I would see someone running this is as a situation where they know the opponent cant guard and they want to eat their resources trying to stack crits on this and push for a one hit win.

5945182,0,t3_3ws4ap,The thing that makes Yugioh and MTG more relevant in America is simply the structure of tournaments.  I understand that they want to make it accessible but a free tournament with zero prize support makes wanting to go to big tournaments rather lackluster. They either need to start a fee and give out prize support OR they need to simply give out something worthwhile for attending their events. Where Im located the distributor for Bushi is inconsistent and half of the time we either dont get new products or we get them super late. I love this game but I have no desire to try and compete if I know Im not going to get anything out of it. ,cardfightvanguard,cxyxz2p,1,t5_2tcbx
5946658,0,t3_3wtqpr,I cant say I have much experience with the deck since the pure maiden of support hasnt come out yet but Im definitely gonna look into it once it hits but from the look of things I would probably prefer using Cherry Sisters. Remember that Waterpot isnt GB restricted so she has some earlygame synergy with the cherry sisters counterblasts and soulblasts. Plus Ive always liked VR skills. That being said I dont think you would have anything that actually benefits off cloned names besides Jingle Flower in stride so your Maiden of Flower Screens are kind of useless if you dont run Lost Memory aside filling your deck with nontriggers and having the Maiden of name. I suggest Hollyhock Knight. He hits k from just two units on board with the same name.  Remember only two of your cards even list Maiden of as a requirement and the Grade  is just on call whereas the stride only touches front row. Your backrow can be anything you want. If you decide to go the Lost Memory route he would turn it into an k row on Legion sitting turns and still be kclonesdrawsunflips on stride. So thats actually a really good argument for Lost Memory.Maiden of Delphinium is also a really really good card and I would say you should absolutely run it over Phystalis. Mostly for things like Lost Memory and Hollyhock knight. Even if you end up running cherry sisters Delphinium is still better than checking the top  cards of your deck then only hitting triggers or worse a perfect guard. That being said you could easily run Perfect Guard Gs in this. Youre not gonna call Perfect Guards from hand nor are you gonna have them in front row for attacking.I probably wouldnt run x Dream Ahsha over x Jingle Flower but thats just me. Overall the rest looks like a solid list though. ,cardfightvanguard,cxz4xw9,1,t5_2tcbx

6315631,0,t3_423rny, I would change the starter to either Innocent Magician or Smiling Presenter. Nightmare Doll decks main issue is getting the pieces together to pull off the combos and I think the consistency those two provide are better than the k Dreaming Bicorn gives. And which draws are you running? I would run  of Silver Thorn Marionette Natasha because shes a workeroid and theyre essential to pull off Beatrix and just go  crits and  draws with  of the crits being Nightmare Doll Mirabel again because Workeroid. I would also cut Nightmare Doll Juliet completely and also maybe cut down Masquerade Bunny to  to make room for  run  to  Purple Trapezists. As for your grade s I would run the k Silver Thorns because Workeroid for Beatrix. Possible problems I see are not enough Workeroid targets for Beatrix and getting needed units out of the soul. I played against my friends proxy Nightmare Dolls quite a bit and I found that swinging my Vanguard at Alice forces my opponent to either commit a lot of guard for a rearguard or not guard for it and lose a significant piece necessary for the combo. I also try to limit how much damage I give my opponent each turn and pick off rearguards to limit his counterblast resources to reduce his one turn kill potential. One game I missed my grade  ride and had crit sacked the Nightmare Dolls deck to . The turn where my opponent rode to Catherine he finished me while I was still on grade  because he was able to pull off  attacks so early into the game. Maybe obvious but keep in mind that Alices effect works on rearguards too so if your opponent damage checks a trigger and gives power to vanguard you have Alice hit one of the rearguards and call out Ginny who gives Alice k and a better chance to hit the vanguard for future attacks.,cardfightvanguard,cz7imx9,1,t5_2tcbx

As for triggers while that stand trigger is really good you often wont have a unit to stand if you drive check it. Running critical triggers improves consistency in the deck which is why most people run as many as they can. Youre more likely to see a variant of this deck running the draw trigger that goes into the soul to give a unit k than the stands. This helps fuel the soul blast costs for cards like aurageyser and vortimer.Of course youre welcome to and I encourage it test out the stand triggers yourself if you think theyll be better than straight criticals.,cardfightvanguard,d1tz9y9,1,t5_2tcbx

Now Im going to preface this by saying that if you can get its effect to work its very very potent and often a game winner. However because its a GB which has to hit its unwieldy and an unreliable finisher. Machining make better use of it since Destroyer can eat through resources earlier to ease both of its issues but Destroyer will always be preferable if you can use and multiple uses of Destroyer means that having Stun Beetle work is often overkill.G Guardians might help with the GB problem but it also exasperates the on hit problem. Now I wouldnt say the card is garbage but its not very effective at performing as a finisher in most cases.

7338699,0,t1_d2c9x8b,Sorry my mistake. I shouldnt have used the words bulk support because that doesnt accurately describe the level of support I was intending. Let me say what I was thinking in a clearer way. Trial Decks provide a middle ground of support with respect to gameplay that helps to bridge the massive gap between total beginner and hardcore veteran. It also serves to bridge the gap between levels of support for lack of a better word. There are cards that Bushiroad feels are more complicated than theyd like beginners to deal with so those cards cant go into the Start Decks. Legend Decks have a very specific support pattern being filled with reimagined versions of older units to capitalize on the nostalgia hype of their veteran players so the TD cards cant be placed into those either since TDs are used as a way to introduce brand new concepts to the game. Because of the number of cards that are put into a TD by Bushiroad there are too many cards to go into a main set without bloating it with filler which was a problem during the English Legion era when they shoved the Brawler TD and the Movie Booster into BT ver. E and BT ver. E but too few to be placed in an Extra Booster or a Technical Booster because both of those have specific numbers of cards that are placed in them and the number of cards in a TD cant match it. The only ways to move TD support into an EB or TcB would be if Bushiroad released support for certain clans less often which is what they currently do with Bermuda Triangle or if they made sets full of reprints just to fill up the space. Both of those lead to discontentment from the players. If they wait too long to release support the clan in question becomes outclassed by other clans players feel less motivated to play the clan and the game as a whole loses variety. As an example and an aside I know plenty of Bermuda Triangle players but they only touch those decks right when the support rolls around. The rest of the year theyre off playing other decks which are supported more often. If they release reprint filled sets the secondary market becomes a fruitless endeavor for players and the high supply reduces prices of the cards leading players to buy singles and fewer and fewer booster packs losing money for Bushiroad. If they release sets filled with bad cards and a few good ones then players dont feel that theyll ever get enough of a return on their money for buying packs to be worth it and theyll turn to the secondary market to buy singles which have been inflated horribly in price due to the lack of supply.Your response doesnt take into account the amount of support that each product provides to the clans contained within them. We cant just shoehorn the cards usually in TDs into the other sets unless Bushiroad changes their release model quite a bit but they have no reason to do so since its working like clockwork at the moment. The Start Decks only serve to lower the barrier to entry without disrupting the rest of the model in the slightest while TDs are smack dab in the middle of their release model and are an integral part at this point.,cardfightvanguard,d2ccymx,1,t5_2tcbx

Helped because st Stride Miracle Ace is bananas since you can have the combo pieces in hand pretty easily but its hurt because GGuardians stop some of their intermediary plays preMiracle Ace for  card like Cobalt column unless you hit multiple triggers on the Triple Drive.    Bloody Ogle and Jessica may be hurt more than helped by GGuards because their endgame isnt as explosive than Nova well more so Jessica than Bloody so they will need to adjust their game to account for the existence of a clutch GGuardian saving them. For example  cards left in hand using the GGuard and intercept to drop a k swing then PGing the final attack to survive.

7589452,0,t3_4j9nan,Its not popular but I blame a lot of that on being a clan which doesnt have obvious advantage. Rather each piece adds to an overall picture and you need to know where each piece fits in the puzzle in order to maximize your output. Doing so insures that the clan is both aggressive offensively while producing massive amounts of advantage as well.

7589563,0,t1_d34qert,Actually Id say that the biggest issues with Megacolony are. They lack a proper finisher. Struggle Dipper is the closest thing we have but its not consistent. Stun Beetle is great if he can hit but he usually wont and GGuardians make it even harder for him to do so on the flipside Gguardians do give him earlier activation which can also make him better.. The clan struggles greatly against opponents which refuse to call rearguards or empty their field in some way. Aside from the lack of targets to paralyze as only Machining can consistently paralyze the Vanguard some newer effects are based on the number of units. If they could force the opponent to call like Chaos Universe or have ways to further punish the opponent for not having rearguards it would easily fix the problem.,cardfightvanguard,d34w9p8,2,t5_2tcbx

8964417,0,t1_d7pcyr7,Im saying I feel XGallop is better than Rebellion.You have to compare what X clan gets to another to determine how good a card can be.For Example. Take Nigthrose stride New Gold Paladin Stride and Lambros. Basically these strides all do the same thing. They get extra attacks with rear guards. Nightrose calls units from the drop on attack to get more attacks. New Gold stride calls units from the top of the deck for more attacks and Lambros restands rear guards for more attacks.Looking at these  cards that virtually do the same thing it is very apparent that Labmros is the strongest here. This is because unlike the other two he gives the extra rear guard swings k power each. The second best out of the  is The Gold stride as it allows atleast  extra attacks but does not offer any power bonuses. Nighrose is the worst as she call  units but they have to be in different rows meaning you are only getting  more attacks and she does not give any power bonuses. Say what you want about balanced to fit each clan but looking at these  regardless of what clan they are in Lambros is by far the strongest. Thats the point I am making here. While Rebellion isnt bad by any means I feel X Gallop is a better card. If you took XGallop and put it in Chronofang it would still be better to meassuming you can hit k which is still possible even in Chronofang. XGallop is a straight up plus  and allows your front row rear guards to gain k power. What makes the power good is it doesnt rely solely on your vanguard. Rebellion in simplistic terms is a Perfect Guard to block the biggest part of the turn while just using  Perfect Guard on XGallop isnt going to save you from the bulk of the turn.That is the point I am trying to make. ,cardfightvanguard,d7pdz8s,1,t5_2tcbx

9317627,0,t1_d8x2jgu,Ok I will try to explain this So when you call violinist  things happen violinist and pir. You have the choice to resolve either one first so I would recommend resolving violinist first. After resolving violinist note that calling selim does not trigger pir as he is only g in deck and is still a G when he hits the field.  So for this example we only get  proc of pir and violinist gets retired if you call selim over him. In this scenario w still have pir to resolve so now you can give selim the pir buff making it a kk and pir is kk.For your Yes pir will proc off violinist but if something is resolving at the same time you pick which to resolve in order until there is nothing left to resolve. Since pir is worded that this unit and another unit in the same column you do not need to give the power to violinist if you call over and can give it to the new unit.,cardfightvanguard,d8x2sng,3,t5_2tcbx

I wished it was a simple SB.Regarding the oracle enabler I made a stride for fun that was like when strode you can take  cards from soul and add them to your hand and if at the end of turn you have  or more cards in your hand you choose a card from your hand and put it into your soul. This way you dont have dead draws doesnt burn your deck that much and enables oracle giving you a slight comeback mechanic.The problem being is the new susanoo that burns your soul.,cardfightvanguard,db5o6to,1,t5_2tcbx
9961619,0,t1_db5xwqv,Nikitas just takes a while to get used to but he unlocks a lot more plays that we didnt have access to before which is nice  I especially love making a column of Adelaide Dolphin on the left and Nikitas Mitros on the right. Attack Nikitas switch with Dolphin. Then Dolphin bottom of deck and draw then VG Superior Call Thavas stack triggers on Adelaide then attack with Thavas if you still can if not thrn Adelaide twice bounce Thavas to hand. Meaning they can only kill Adelaide if they cant target your backrow and then you have moderate set up for your next turn plus guaranteed stride. ,cardfightvanguard,db60wmr,1,t5_2tcbx

10043849,0,t3_5jk5ev,Counter Blast and Soul are the main resources you have in the game.  Think of it like costs ready to be paid.  Most units uses either Soul or Counter Blasts to activate their skills.  But in advance plays you not only have to manage your own Counter Blasts you also have to be wary of your opponents.  Because only you can deal damage to them and for every damage dealt they get a Counter Blast.  To Counter Blast is to flip a faceup damage to facedown.  Some cards can do Counter Charges which is to flip a facedown damage back faceup. Giving you more resources obviously.  Soul is the cards beneath your Vanguard this is also a resource.  You replenish them by riding or Soul Charging Put a card from the top of your deck into the soul which some units can do.  Again some units Take cards from your soul to the drop zone Soul Blast to activate their skills so you have to be wary of both yours and your opponents if you or your opponents use those kind of units.,cardfightvanguard,dbgqmi6,4,t5_2tcbx

Attacking their rears could actually cause them to lower their pressure since they can only get  free Nightrunner per turn. If you cleared their board theyd either call their hand to keep up pressure like old G stall decks or just kind of shrivel and die. And at that point they wouldnt be much better than the usual old Royal Rush except you can ride to G sometimes as a finisher.

However I have noticed no one saying you could run  heals as well so theres some food for thought.  No heals means opening up the GZone to the max  which you can run all strides too giving various options.  A double break ride deck would work as there are barely any counterblast for either one but remember the rearguards need power to back up the kind of restand for Mond. BR from Mond to Voll gives you a advantage to gain countercharge from the rearguard. If your pulling this kind of move I do suggest getting Final Wrench for the fact you have to do GB anyways. ,cardfightvanguard,dcizq0f,1,t5_2tcbx

10604940,0,t3_5rrn0k,Here are my current testing so far after playing this deck extensively for a day on release. Some findings are similar to what you have thought.disclaimer everything is from the standpoint of a victor deck with game plan to go into champ at least  restand. A lot of opinion is very skewed towards uniol as he changes the way you go about your stride sequence. Bustard suddenly becomes good on victor v and victoplasma first stride gambles become legit with uniol.Earnest He is deceptively good. Hes a draw effect that is not gb and often I would call him early to get a draw by resting the starter as its usually in a rear column. He is mildly threatening so often he doesnt get attack usually a k column with starter. A lot of people dont realize is that he doesnt have to be in the same column as rested unit! Hes good to trigger puncher butagil malyaki or Victor V prebattle phase to get very high stages of power especially in multiples andor with petite. He also helps unior get the extra k as some games even with V as vvg it can be a struggle to have  soul if you used crit triggers or kabutron. I currently run  split of earnestbutagilhankabarail.Furious puncher hes our only real rush g worth playing atm malyaki doesnt have the keyword and kuma is much to be desired which allows you to stand a hankabarail column using V and force another k shields. You can also use this yo boost hank and foce out k shields by using hank to stand puncher and then using other stand effects to stand hank to force another  shields. His nd effect is very niche but if you are planning to go for the petitechamp final gambit youd wanna run  of these.  Currently testing  split of this and malyaki and is fine so far.claydoll chariot this one is a very niche use atm but is a good  of in victor or blaus especially if you going for the double victoplasmauniol play for nd stride champ. Again same as earnest he helps uniol get k extra shields and is really helpful if you want to double victoplasma first stride but opponent only gave you  CB. I ran  but I currently trying out .Defending goddess this is actually not as bad as it seems after testing. Very often you want an avg of k for  pass and its not very hard to get k more from top  if you build for it crits or at max  draws or  winning break. He also works well with uniol and chariot to all in and push well while still keeping a good hand. I have currently running  of and have been satisfied with how this often saves you hand for your bigger plays. I am ok with the milling as often I dont expect to live past rd stride anyway so decking out isnt an issue.,cardfightvanguard,dd9thfc,3,t5_2tcbx

If you do choose up to one of your units named Blaster Blade on RC Stand it return this unit to your deck and shuffle your deck.  It does not apply to any unit that is not named Blaster Blade due to the wording. The words Your unit named search for a unit with the exact same name. If you wanted it to work with Spirit it would have to say Your rearguard with Blaster Blade in its card name A battle only ends when your opponent succesfully guards if a vanguard is attacking thats after all Drive Checked triggers are applied or after he takes damage.

10903650,0,t3_5vsznn,Ace is more or less only for a finisher or setting up for Nouvelle on your next turn. Personally I would use Legend whenever me striding into something wont actually produce any results AND they have rear guard for me to hit. For example if the opponent only has  rear guard and I know he has a PG in hand Ill Legend to get the RG and then bait that PG while giving any to all triggers to my own RGs. In addition Ace will only give you   drive checks in comparison to Legends . Now as far as the reason you stated about why you like Ace over Legend do keep in mind the total cost of playing one over the other. Legend only requires GB  CB and ANY Grade  flame dragon with the caveat that you swing at RG first for the restand this will get you  drive checks in total if done properly. Ace is more costly as first you pitch for stride be it stride fodder or a Grade which is super important in an DO deck then you pay the cost of CB and persona flip which isnt too bad until you see that Ace loses a drive then requires you to specifically discard an Overlord and another card for only k and restand. So if Ace didnt have the cost of striding him then Ace and Legend could be somewhat equal. In conclusion Legend if youre trying to get an easy restand plus  checks. Ace if youre specifically trying to push for game or trying to deplete their hand,cardfightvanguard,de4mtyw,1,t5_2tcbx

10941802,1,t3_5wai1f,Lets seeI hate it when people cant read their freaking cards and think they can do all the stupid shit they do. And while it is normal to make a mistake every now and then I am ESPECIALLY less tolerant if its more mainstreambraindead clans like Gears Link Joker the Paladin clans the Dragon clans because it sometimes speaks to me that said person is simply a bandwagoner who built the deck just because it wins and shit.Everyone and their grandmother always asking for a restander a guard restricter a extra drive checker or a crit though I am more lenient on this or a mix of those EVERY SINGLE TIME theres a new boss unit and expect it to come with what their clan already does on top of that as if they think those alone will make their decks meta. Because forget having good deck synergy people just want a single card to singlehandedly get them to victory. If you think your clans needs those things to be meta and not go play some degenerate crap like Gears Kagero or Narukami instead! And yes I blame those clans for enforcing such a mindset in the first place especially Overlord. Fuck that card!People who compare cards from different clans that have similar skills but without considering the clans playstyle itself. There was this idiot on the wiki who compared Dragut to the likes of Wailing Thavas or Sinner Scharhot just because they retired things and stated that Thavas and Scharhot were better because they could guard restrict.

10942889,0,t3_5wai1f,My biggest pet peeve is when people get rewarded for making bad plays. Example I guard your Vanguard for a  to pass you have two standing rearguard columns your first drive check is a crit. Instead of putting the effects on one of the rearguards to increase pressure which is inherently the better play as getting  triggers in a row is highly unlikely you put all effects on your Vanguard instead. Your second check is another crit you put everything on your Vanguard again even though two triggers in a row is above the norm as is and the odds of that third check being a trigger are very low and you still have another rearguard you could apply the effects to. But no the third check is still a trigger and because you inherently made the decision to go with the riskier and less optimal play you still get rewarded for it.  Also on the subject of this people who act smug when they get rewarded for their bad plays and win because of it.,cardfightvanguard,de8ojwu,8,t5_2tcbx

11153823,0,t1_dew85az,I wouldnt say that Bushiroad just has no clue on what quality meta support is. I think that they know what theyre doing. Theres no way that you can look at Esras for example and say that Amatsuhikone is just as good. Especially considering the fact that Esras doesnt cost CB and Amatsuhikone does while Luard has an amazing counter charge engine and OTT does not. Actually lets continue with this comparison. Esras and Hikone are both drop zone effects both GB and both require the keyword to work. Esras needs Ritual  Hikone needs Oracle lets ignore the fact that R is so much easier and more consistent than Oracle. Esras retires one of your rearguards which is great because it means that you can activate all of your abilities that triggers when retired though not Abyssal Owl. This contributes to the engine of retirereturn to decksuperior call that Luard is known for. Hikone binds a random card from your hand facedown. This is another  for  like Esras at this point except that OTT has NOTHING that interacts with their bind zone or their graveyard for that matter so this doesnt contribute at all to OTTs engine. Finally Esras is an ACT ability which means that you have to be at R during your main phase which is not altogether that hard but I can see why you wouldnt want to retire a useful boost for a PG in hand during your main phase. In comparison Hikone is an AUTO that only activates at the end of your turn when you would most likely have Oracle anyway. Thats  point for Hikone. The last part of these cards is their additional cost. Esras needs to return another copy of himself to the deck which prevents you abusing this every single turn but isnt altogether that hard to trigger especially in late game. Hikone counter blasts in a clan that doesnt counter charge apart from the PGG Cone Magus only consistent in Magus Battle Sister Lemonade competes with Susanoo and Precious Ophidian for soul Battle Sister Muffin only useable in Battle Sisters and Ikutsuhikone  time use only. That means that its competing for CB with Takemikazuchi Kamususanoo Wakahirume and any Grade s or s that you may choose to use that use CB Amenooshiho Kuroikazuchi Akagi Kumanokusubi etc. So the more you use this card to go   the less you can use your abilities that allow you to go  thereby achieving Oracle. In comparison the more you use Esras doesnt mean that you use your main abilities less. Esras has no limit and Hikone is limited by our  damage. This cannot be an accident on Bushroads part. They definitely meant for Esras and all of LuardRitual to be better than Hikone and all of SusanooOracle. Its the same as Luards first ability being Ritual  but not a GB like Susanoos first ability which is Oracle and GB. Bushiroad knows that they could easily make OTT better by just modifying their effects and costs slightly by updating their costs to be similar as those of similar cards by different clans. It is therefore clear that Bushiroads treatment of OTT is deliberate and not an accident.,cardfightvanguard,dew9vmd,1,t5_2tcbx

For Gold Paladins its the Grade  Alfred with the Ultimate Break and for Royal Paladins its the Holy Squire Dragon Stride that only works with an Alfred Heart. Other than that decks with vanguards that pack extra crits or multiple attacks can have a certain measure of success if you manage their counterblasts right. Ive beaten Chaos Breaker with both Perditions and Blademaster so I guess Kagero is an ok Counter to them havent tried my Overlords yet but I imagine they could do it too.

Eventually they have to take it if they want Limit Break and then I just drive check one critical trigger and kill them. For Perditions its a matter of playing the slow game and getting them to  damage one turn at a time. Then I Breakride Vortex Dragonewt over Dauntless Drive Dragon call rearguards to any open circles I have use Dragonewts skill to force a damage on them and put them at  then attack with everything Ive got. The double BreakrideLegion attack is usually enough since it sits at  base before Triggers and I can use Inspire Yell Dragon or Lizard Soldier Veira to power it up even more. ,cardfightvanguard,dg389oy,1,t5_2tcbx
11537749,0,t1_dg3s9j5,Bladewings are a lot better. Plenty of oomph without the glass cannonyness. Big number multiattacking with Assassins constantly recycling deck full of triggers the ability to deck your opponent out by just grinding it out not that that works very well in a timed tournament and plenty of Gilles to go around.,cardfightvanguard,dg3t141,1,t5_2tcbx

11606531,0,t1_dgblfs4,Based on the episode it only lets you repeat your main phase and proceed to a second battle phase. Meaning cards you timeleap wont come back in time pun intended for the seconf battle leaving you with a whole field at rest except for the Vanguard.That means after you pulled off your MelemHistory shenanigans and you attack with Beyond st time you will usually be left with either A rested Delayed and another G A rested History and nothing else maybe a Lishma for the second attack ?You need to have everything in hand after the first attack to be able to pull off a couple more attacks. Except you have to bind  cards from your deck so maybe youre out of Melem ? Out of History ? Out of G to timeleap into.There are some situations where youd like to be able to call a Melem from your hand midbattle to unlock the situation and thats when Beyond is useful.Right now without knowing the full effect Beyond Order requires you to have a really good hand to follow up on your first battle phase or to be in very specifics situation where your turn would be mediocre with Nextage. ,cardfightvanguard,dgblz09,10,t5_2tcbx

Also the rescue number is optional so you could rescue  or  or none at all. It is a free k to frontrow. Like what is the problem with that...,cardfightvanguard,dgekpu7,6,t5_2tcbx

11642115,0,t1_dgfjwto,The guardian thing is fine for  regular and  persona flip... but just because the strides are GB and its expected to end games doesnt mean it will. There are different probabilities out there. Also can you guarantee you can G guard twice before your third stride? I was talking about overextending with the fact that you may G guard to hit GB earlier when it wasnt necessary to G guard and they can be saved for a later and more optimal time.,cardfightvanguard,dgfnbb6,1,t5_2tcbx

11740187,0,t1_dgqr1w9,What if you dont want to play Battle Sisters? I know I dont. I can do just as well with the generic grade s and the grade s that I actually want to play instead of forcing myself to play a subclan Im not interested in. Ive not only played OTT from the TD until now I run the blog on OTT. I know the clan inside and out more than just having read every card at least once. The Battle Sisters are great for those who want to play Battle Sisters but they arent the beall endall of the clan. The fact of the matter is that you dont need the searchability Battle Sisters have which is minimal anyways to play effectively. Besides if you can accomplish the exact same if not better pressure by playing Witch grade s and Battle Sister grade s why wouldnt you? You give yourself the option of using both MiMi and Miroir which are undoubtably the best offensive OTT strides right now and the engine work wonderfully together anyways. No one plays GaGa so the grade  lineup is completely free to be filled up with quality Battle Sister units that already exist. Also Gelato sucks so she is not worth running pure BaS for. Muffin can be live in any OTT deck because any OTT deck can play Miroir. Hybrid decks like SusanooBattle Sisters offers you the flexibility to play differently depending on the matchup. You get the offensive power of the Battle Sisters with the combined draw power of Susanoo and Miroir together. If you want to play pure BaS all power to you but if you dont there are other valid options too which can Miroir just as effectively.Edit PARAGRAPHS,cardfightvanguard,dgqs3d3,2,t5_2tcbx
