107766,0,t1_ceqobc3, doesnt matter if the player is  good  anyone can spend a fortune looking for the perfect base.  The fact is the higher trophy level you go the more active the players. The more active the players mean less collector loot AND less storage loot because people are upgrading their own buildings.  I guess its really a design flaw  but realistically we all know arming for gold is done at silver and farming for DE is done at gold. I had the same problem farming DE in gold  I could barely find bases to break even simply because the player base is more active there ,ClashOfClans,ceqp8ro,1,t5_2usfk

274617,0,t1_cf97aoc,There is no logic in this really  if you have resources that I want I will take it regardless if your th is exposed or not.

Those   archers die and I use the rest of my army on your base cause now Id rather  percent you instead of wasting my troops on your th.  And I already know where your Tesla are. Ex  Im farming and dont care about trophies.  Ill probably not even attack your town hall. The people who spam troops to win the th are the ones that want to snipe you. If you trap your th and it makes you feel good  do it.  Just know that the people who fail sniping you are the ones that wanted to give you a shield  and later on when someone with a full army comes by and takes your entire base just remember you could have had a shield. You need need to choose if you really want a shield.  If you do then dont trap your th  if you dont care about a shield then by all means trap it. Protip  if you find a base with a trapped th  kill the heroes and the cc troops if you can.  Take the loss dont give them a shield.  That way when someone with a bigger stronger army comes by he can wreck the guys base without worrying about them and justice will be served. ,ClashOfClans,cf985vn,4,t5_2usfk

So youre basically trying to tell me that a business should not upgrade anything because it might cost more? Even though it makes their product much more enjoyable for the customer? Update your servers and in turn the players will come back and be more active rather than quitting at th because of the constant lack of updating or appeal of the game.A game is fun at first until it becomes mundane which is happening quickly as I keep playing and noticing that little updates could make it much more enjoyable.,ClashOfClans,cfvjboh,1,t5_2usfk

DE becomes so much more easily acquired as you get closer to TH. As for THs below  rushing isnt a huge deal for them.

535907,0,t3_209pa2,Id just work on upgrading your defenses. If I were in your shoes Id probably concentrate on my splash damage mortars wizard towers air defenses and archer towers. I farm around  cups and I see about  in  who are inactive. Normally I can pull around k combined with  archers or so level .Others have said this as well but Id work those traps around your TH into your base too. Use them to your advantage. Air Mines can be used to cover areas where your Air Defenses dont cover especially. People who come along to snipe your TH will end up costing you a lot of gold that can be used for upgrades when you rearm all those traps.Lastly a quick farming tip Look for inactive builders and full collectors. Full collectors will give easy loot. You can tell if theyre full by looking at the bin next to a gold mine or inside an elixir collector if it has a pile or looks full it is and you can get a good amount for cheap.Sorry for the longer post.

673633,0,t3_21v3z0,I would say in my opinion that revenging is very helpful when pushing trophies... since im not pushing trophies right now i rarely revenge. However if you do decide to revenge the trophy amount that you get is much higher than it would be for a regular attack. For instance when I raid somebody regularly i believe the max trophies i can get is  but when i revenge someone the max trophies i can gain is around the  range i think may be even more. Once again though this is an opinion and you should do whatever works best for you.   Hope this helps! ,ClashOfClans,cgguboc,2,t5_2usfk

The highest strength war bases are at the top of the war map. Trophies have no influence on the order of bases.the two highest level players in our clan are way down in the list.  Both have level  walls while the people on top have level  walls...  This really doesnt make any sense at all.  Defenses walls and troops are all much higher level.  The only common thing I can see is when we queued for war the people who got put up top had their THs protected.  Also not sure if anyone else has seen this but only the top  on our map can receive troops.  Everyone below them shows  and cant accept.

826234,0,t1_cgy5yde,Ah gotcha. Yup Ive been sitting around waiting on upgrades for almost three weeks at TH seven now. I rushed from TH six to seven finished out sevens walls a few weeks ago and now Im pretty bored. The only things not finished are barracks and rage and heal spell level four and obviously dark upgrades that stuff is hard for me to get at. I might gem for minions level three when I get th  done. I really like minions alot. I love those little suckers. When work wasnt busy I was able to basically raid and build walls at will. Now its like meh whats the point of raiding I have more gold than I can use if I raid more than three times a day. I kind of like it this way better and by I I mean my wife. She was getting jealous of my game. I had seasons in my clan where Id have about  donates and receipts of troops if that tells you anything about my activity during the first couple of months of playing the game but you take it to a whole nother level. Thats pretty awesome man. Ive gotten into a nice groove of  raids for resources a day and a couple for war here and there and it doesnt really interfere with other stuff I started doing. I got back to playing tennis and that ends up eating up  hours a day including drive time and getting dressed. Its probably better for me but the increasing levels arent as tangible in tennis so its harder to keep motivated. ,ClashOfClans,cgy707n,2,t5_2usfk

1030726,0,t1_chlfvdx,No not that much. Most of the TH  in Master  are more upgraded than some premmie TH  you can find so theyre not even that easier to get.I think bloons are much better than hogs for surgical strike because you sometimes find bases with an uneven air defense coverage like all the AT on the bottom and can easily get  on the other side. I remember winning an attack in Master  against someone from The Hunknown like  balloons and  minions.And without freeze speels its kinda hard to go to the center and hit these lvl  disco infernos. If I only had one advice it would be just practice before pushing. Go in Master  or so and go for maxed out bases using the surgical strike strategy. So youll start to guess how many bloons youll need to take down an AT or a specific compartment without the pressure of winning every raid.,ClashOfClans,chlg643,2,t5_2usfk

So firstly focus on levelling out all buildings to their max level at th also as someone said already keep that lab going. Also whenever you have spare gold do a couple of walls it will help a ton in the long run. Once everything is levelled to th max focus on upgrading splash  this is always a good general policy to follow in future th upgrades. Another thing put your th outside if you are farming at your trophy range it stops people going all out and taking your resources so often and gives you a nice shield ,ClashOfClans,ci11bhg,2,t5_2usfk

1204293,0,t1_ci4zbsn,Thanks man. I got to give credit to Strikeninja first of all. I think some might know his ultimate guide for DE farming at th . All others can find it hereI can highly recommend his strategy. I started with the serious DE hunting about  weeks ago. At this stage my walls were about  done to purple everything else except collectors were maxed did collectors last. Id say there are  basic rules to follow out of ninjas strategy.First You need to have maxed defenses I do mean everything! Yeah absolutly you got a treasure to protect  DE is rare and all the th and s will attack you and try to steal it.Second Dont make yourself a target. For that you have to do two things. Keep your other resources low and dont attack th when you expect him to be an agressive player who will revenge you. Of course you never know who will take revenge but I mostly attacked obvious  inactive ths. TH revenging isnt that dangerous. The loot cut is too big for them. Once at about k DE a TH  starred me and got about  DE or something. So that is no issue. For keeping your resources low i would recommend the walls for gold burning. The elixir...well if there arent any buildings left you cant keep it that low. It will lower with the army and spells but as you raid you get it accidentally. I just didnt protect my storages well and let a attacker take it. It wasnt my priority...so k gone? Who cares.Only DE cares!Third The attacking. Attack only for DE. I was at    trophys and didnt care for anything else than the DE. A collector raid with k each but no or not reachable DE? NEXT! I know that hurts but it would violate rule  to get more gold and elixir . My lower bound was  DE for an attack but ofc i did the one or another attack for . There were good attacks with    and there were complete fails with zero a lost army and frustration . Compostion was  wallbreaker  barbs rest archers. Best attacks were with the barb king when the lazy fucker isnt sleeping combined with a rage spell and a healing spell. You get deep with this army unless a huge fire ball hits all your archers so a core rush to the DE storage with  rings of walls around it max lvl  walls is possible with a nice placed rage spell.The best average base to attack was a th with an exposed th DE reachable and  Id say. Also dont understimate the collectors. Lvl  hold good amounts.Trophys also dont care. You cant buy anything from trophys. If you get to low go back to townhall sniping. this is why i say the th exposed th is the best raid. DE is the duty trophys are nice to have and there you get bothOh and I didnt much lightning DE storages. Had always only one lighting spell with me one of each spell was best for me. So only if there was an exposed townhall and i sniped it for the trophys and if there was a storage with  I did it but Id say that was about  DE overall.,ClashOfClans,ci53nci,5,t5_2usfk

OCDness aside your defense will be significantly weak either way so if youre worried about trophies dont be  you cant do anything anyway. Again though this is nothing a few raids wont solve.

1524010,1,t1_cj79wv6,gt So you dislike the hog nerf but defend it by saying a base could be designed to defend against it yet you make the same argument about dragons but complain that you shouldnt have to design the base to defend against it?You dislike that no other strategy is popular but wont build ur base to defend against it....I dont dislike the hog nerf I rather appreciate it since hogs arent overpowered anymore. Infact hogs were never nerfed the bombs got an overhaul. Regarding base designs what do you suggest that goes into an anti dragon base? Let me explain a spread out base where dragons are busy taking out ancillary buildings while AD placed deep inside the core shoots at them. But at TH destroying  ancillary buildings will give you an easy  star. That way you are susceptible to TH s and s and s to own you easily. My point  placing  giant bombs now  is easier than dedicating the entire design to stop dragons. gt  To me clan wars are a special event where cost of units should not be the determining factor. If you are a farming clan that is not willing to spend its resources on high end units.... Why war? I save up just for war.Agreed wars are special even for our farming clan. Cost of units is no bar agreed. But if mass dragons is the answer to all problems involved in a war do you not see that the game is skewed altogether? Essentially a maxed TH  base should give a tough fight to maxed dragons at its level and it is not doing so. Regarding why war? Diverse clan diverse needs common frustration.gt IMO dragons should be rebalanced weaker but lower space or faster or we not just nerfed so they remain viable but not just auto win. Problem is the AI in this game is terrible limiting strategy.Yes please THIS. ,ClashOfClans,cj7b852,-2,t5_2usfk
1526905,0,t1_cj7nwpu,To answer your question about the game being hard. I would be safe in saying that you are probably still TH ? Probably never been above  trophy MAYBE ?The game is hard when every base you come across starts having two cross bows then it becomes actually challenging when they have two crossbows and two flame towers. If you dont quit trophy pushing all together at this point and actually try to push forward through the difficult bases you are FORCED to learn the intricacies or basic attack mechanics imho or you will simply fail and be frustrated and either QUIT or go back to farming which is what you probably enjoyed before getting losses on every attackThen it becomes damn right difficult when they have two cross bows two flame towers king and queen both level  and all max defenses and walls level .The game experience improves as you improve as someone probably lower level maybe low level king you probably havent had the experience of fighting a base worth its weight in gold gems.It is night and day The game doesnt really even start until you break Master and get hammered by high level opponents. Putting your base to the test and besting some of the best players in the world.Just today my base beat all max troops and level  queen level  king feeels good man.,ClashOfClans,cj7oau6,-6,t5_2usfk

1591973,0,t3_2ci975,Short answer in your situation No. I would get the Archer Towers a little closer first but if you farm regularly for decent stretches e.g. no offlines and can manage to spend your resources which it appears may be the case you probably wont even feel the impact of not having the capped.Long AnswerThe people who are suggesting you max every single thing under the sun are delusional. In fact I would explicitly recommend NOT maxing collectors immediately unless you rarely ever farm. Collectors make excellent fallback upgrades to keep builders busy when you hit periods where you cant farm enough to keep up with upgrade costs but dont want a builder sitting idle.That being said you will regret upgrading TH if you have not done the followingMax or close to max all key defenses Mortar WT AD. The point defenses Cannons archers teslas are less important until TH.Max Army Camps Spell Factory.Max or close to max your farming troops and anything you use in clan wars.As long as you dont go straight to TH and as long as your farming troops Barbs Archers Minions and maybe Giants are within a reasonable range of your current town hall level you will never really suffer a ton from upgrading early. Just try to keep your defenses within a reasonable range otherwise it may become difficult to hold on to resources if you dont spend them rapidly.,ClashOfClans,cjfu7je,3,t5_2usfk

1676226,0,t3_2dk2ha,Stupid question.  Depends on situation.  are you farming? wartrophy hunting? whats your army composition.  They all have their uses.  In generallightning  useful to remove cc troops at lower th levels.  useful to kill AD for mass dragons in war.  useful to kill mortar at lower levels for barching.  useful to farm de as th rage  useful in most situations.  Really helps to bring troops into core.  Not recommended for farming cause it costs a lot and takes long time to create.  If you dont care about resourcesbuild time almost all army compositions could benefit from at least a single rage spell except if youre doing mass hogs where heal spell is more useful.heal  use with mass hog attack in war.  use when farming with giants to keep giants alive.,ClashOfClans,cjqg895,1,t5_2usfk

1680179,0,t1_cjqwva2,OPs suggestion would encourage placing your traps around an exposed TH to trick snipers into attacking your base often times netting you some easy trophies. Normally this would set you back some gold but with OPs change the price would be drastically reduced encouraging TH trapping. My suggestion further encourages TH trapping as it would potentially recover even more of the lost trap costs.As for why thats a good thing TH sniping in my opinion dumbs down the game by removing the need for skill to be competitive. As a defending farmer I just place my TH outside and enjoy nearly free shields all day and night never fearing any great loss of my resources. As an attacking farmer I can mindlessly press Next until I find an exposed TH for some easy trophies. This sort of behavior allows terrible base designs to survive in high trophy counts and allows for very low TH bases to farm up into very high leagues. Reducing this behavior would put a greater emphasis on a well designed defense as well as strategic attacks increasing the actual skill needed to make it to and survive in higher leagues.,ClashOfClans,cjqy6mi,-4,t5_2usfk

1817179,0,t1_ck850l7,Well the attack you posted you used a fantastic mix of drags and loons I think you made the right call going so balloon heavy against more compact TH s you would want to be more drag heavy to counter the infernos because like you said they fry those loons right up basically you tank with a drag or more drop rages and let the loons get to the air defenses unless of course they are centralized in which case I do not recommend a dragon based army.Ideally the AQ and cc troops will pull your drags to the town hall to grab the two star the loons really dont last that long with multi target infernos. Ideally you only have to deal with two air defenses which the loons hopefully take out early on.If ITs are single target you can often two star it with loonion leave the drags behind.,ClashOfClans,ck85j82,2,t5_2usfk

But unlike golems which are great at taking damage when other troops are pummeling the defenses lava hounds can get isolated quickly. The timing has be perfect to use them. You have to get them to the ADs soon enough so that the ADs attack them first but not too soon that they are not quickly backed up by balloons. Doesnt seem worth the risk. Plus they take up too much space cost too much dont do enough damage and well they look inbred. I wont be using them any time soon.,ClashOfClans,ckmwzdy,-5,t5_2usfk

1959428,0,t1_ckp9ts5,Your gemmed barracks strategy in general works for simple farming as well. I use a variant of the Barch th using  giants  barbs  archers. I roll with  rage  heals for emergencies. I will gem all  barracks whenever I have a couple hours to myself. Each barracks goes  respectively. I cook  giant and just roll. People have mentioned this is a waste of gems and you should only boost  barracks but I disagree. If I can blast attacks off and get back to only  archers in the barracks I queue up the remainder get my archers off and go. This keeps you playing continuously and if you are at a correct trophy range the loot is just unreal. at TH with no positive loot modifiers I get .m each resource in  hours. While playing off and on and doing this every couple days it keeps the flow of farming stressfree. I dont have any issue keeping  builders busy as theyre all spaced apart properly. give it a shot if you havent already. ,ClashOfClans,ckpbadc,6,t5_2usfk

If the fight is close and enemy is also active try conserving all of your attacks. Doing this will lull the enemy and let them think they have won when they have around  stars leading.

Ive been a farming base forever and get really good results from it. Ive never felt like my walls were hurting me especially since Im upgrading all my defenses and traps quickly.I should max out my th building upgrades in the next  weeks but I still have  weeks to go to max my lab upgrades. We all know that th bases cant raid th for decent loot since  levels below only get  loot so I figure Ill be grinding for walls for awhile at the top of th while I upgrade my heroes and troops in the lab. And once that bores me Ill upgrade to th and keep going.Make no mistake the top end of the game is just grinding for walls. There are literally billions of goldelixer in walls to be done. Sure you can upgrade your way through level  walls m upgrade from lvl  to  sounds big but compared to the next upgrade of m or m after that its nuthin before you get to be a decent th but going much past that seems like a waste of speedy upgrading of other buildingsupgrades.That is unless you have a lot of extra loot lying around from raiding. For me Ive found it pretty challenging to keep four builders going upgrades in spells and the lab AND fully raiding in every war to have a bunch of lot on the side to kick k here and there for one wall piece upgrade.Wanna upgrade something that takes forever get started on teslas.

2087942,0,t3_2ismuo,Im just a few weeks ahead of you early TH.  I was able to max TH without spending money.  It takes longer but is possible.  Heres what worked for me Regular barching or BAMing in the  trophy range.   Try to set aside  hours or so for attacks without going offline.  Gem  barracks from gems earned not paid for then crank out the barch troops for  hours with constant raids.  In a two hour period you can easily steal  million gold and elixir.  And since youre online you cant get raided.  Only save one resource at a time and put that storage in the core of your base.  Spend the other two and leave their storage a littler further out. Put your base out to be sniped if you arent doing it already.  Some people will still hit you. but probably  out of  times you get the free shield. Dont break your shield if you only have time for one attack.  Leave it up unless you can set aside enough time for at least several attacks in a row. When you win war loot dont take it out until youre ready to spend it.  Loot in the clan castle gets stolen at a lower percentage. Keep a few gems to finish off stuff that is close.  For example if you need to save K DE for something and you have K and need to go offline gem the last K,ClashOfClans,cl5827s,5,t5_2usfk

2175219,0,t1_clg6yh2,I disagree and here is why. Most people who raid me I am a relatively new th recently maxed out th do not use barch they use some combination of something like  giants  wallbreakers  spells a healer or two gobs barbs and heroes. This composition is not going to be particularly hurt by an additional mortar because the healers spells giants and heroes which they normally use until their health is down provide more than enough adequate cover for the BAG troops. This composition still sucks. Why? Because unless you gem the barracks or the spell factory at most youre going to be getting k of gold and elixir per hour and thats being generous. But thats not that bad you say? Well keep in mind at this rate of  raids per hour in order to prevent loss of loot you need to stay constantly online. Part of the appeal of BAM is you can sit there and in a one hour play session knock out  pretty good raids with the majority of dead time spent looking for bases. And now they just nerfed BAM the skeleton trap nerfs too but at least its an across the board nerf of offense and is far more creative then you know what guys? Lets make bases more symmetrical!. Great.Bottom line with upgrades for th costing upwards of  moderate defensive improvements are going to just make it even harder to upgrade. It is going to take either more or longer clash sessions to get the same amount of loot either through an increased amount of search as if we dont do it long enough for BAMfriendly bases or longer wait times for an appropriate army while at the same time your own bases storages are going to be raided with regularity for a large amount of loot.Someone else said it here first I feel like Supercell is trying to force us to gem. Thats their right but it is ruining the game for those who would rather not. ,ClashOfClans,clgbn03,1,t5_2usfk

I understand that your mortar placement does cover the whole base but your mortars are left vulnerable and should be considered a key building when constructing a base. WHY THE LEVEL  ELIXIR STORAGE? WHY? I would change your wall layout so that they include more buildings in a set number of walls so all of the storage and CC fit inside.If you are trying to protect DE smart people would attack from the side and get your DE. So change that. When i say better use of traps dont put them all in one place. They are easy to trigger that way. Also i would try to implement funneling w spring traps INSIDE the walls.

2318756,0,t3_2ltzbh,Whats your goal in raids? Are you content with just sticking with collector raids? Because if thats the case you probably wont have a need for giants. Even if I roll all archers  lvl s I can usually get every collectormine. Even if its a base thats protecting them very well or those retarded big square bases your BK and AQ will help a lot. I roll with two lighting and two rages spells as well. I dont like to use them but if a big raid depends on it ill rage to a storage or lightning strike a mortar. If youre going for storages itd be a good idea to bring along maybe    giants a few wall breakers some wizards and some archers. Those along with your BK and AQ especially if they both have their ability will penetrate pretty far into a base. Idk why youd need to go to storages though. Im prefectly fine with collector raids they make me about  mil of each in a month. ,ClashOfClans,clyb9fn,1,t5_2usfk

2428761,0,t1_cmbrtpu,Your base is narrow... So seabedss is correct. TH  pretty much mass dragon on every attack. You made it easy by making it narrow. Archers will pick off all outside buildings and dragons will just wreck into center,ClashOfClans,cmbwh8l,2,t5_2usfk
2431453,0,t1_cmc8b3w,Ah I could see that then. My clan had lvl  hogs which couldnt be killed by the single giant bomb a person had if it came to it.I think it also depends on how you use the CC. A solo dragon is generally a pretty terrible thing to lead a raid with because it will simply get stuck on a nonessential building and focused down. But it would be pretty good for a clean up crew. However  hogs could potentially clean up  of the defences allowing for easy wiz clean up. ,ClashOfClans,cmc8get,1,t5_2usfk

2475114,0,t1_cmhjbv7,Army  golem  pekkas WB  wizards  hogs reserve  troop space for luring and for archers to pick off buildings.  if unneeded get more hogs or wiz  depends on the base! hogs in CCSpells  x heal x rageStrategyBasically your mini GoWiPe composition golem pekkas wiz WB and king is going to be used to punch in towards the TH and try to take it out  along with the core.  While your mini GoWiPe composition is punching into the core a bunch of defenses will be focused on the high HP golem pekkas and king.  Therefore you send in your hogs to take out defenses preferably point defenses and even more preferentially teslas.  Single target defenses and especially teslas are the most threatening to your high HP units so you want to take those out ASAP.I generally use my rage to get the mini GoWiPe units into the core I try to send WBs in with the rage in order to speedem up so theyre less likely to die before hitting walls and the two heals are saved for the hogs.Also try to aim for bases where you can see a decent path for your hogs where they wont hit too many GBs.  If youre iffy on the hogs working correctly then you might want to consider a different strategy!The reason this works is because the GoWiPe army by itself struggles in finishing a  star because it has to break through so many walls once destroying the core and TH.  And for a hog attack they have to kill every single defense before taking out any side buildingsthe TH.  Therefore combining the two seemed logical to me since they kinda cover each others weaknesses GoWiPe secures the core and TH wizardsarchers can be used to take out outside buildings and hogs help take out the defenses behind walls that the GoWiPe army struggles to get to.,ClashOfClans,cmhmv2j,6,t5_2usfk

2514818,0,t1_cmmpb0j,With the  gem week boosts you can do the following if your collectors and drills are not maxed.  The  gem boost boosts your collectorsdrills for a week.  And the deal lasts for a week so you can boost at any time during the deal and it lasts a week even if you did it the last minute the deal ends.  Say your mines are at level .  You boost them right when the deal starts.  After  days this deal is going to end so with like an hour left in the boost theyve been boosted for  days  hours you upgrade your mines then cancel the upgrade.  This cancels the boost.  Now you can boost them again for  days for  gem even though the deal is going to end in an hour.  So you are essentially getting a  day  gem boost.  Mines and collectors are fairly cheap to upgrade so the loot you lose by canceling is not a big deal.  You can do it on drills too but they are expensive so it is up to you.  If your minescollectorsdrills are maxed you can not upgrade then cancel therefore you cannot do this trick.  Get it now retard?,ClashOfClans,cmmtpfq,-3,t5_2usfk

With mass drags youd want to come from the north west and funnel them by taking out buildings to north and to west right into the middle and into the air defenses. With gowipe Id probably come from the north. I think  golems could tank all of the north east and north west point defenses .

These graphstables show which units are most efficient to use for banking resources.  For example level  dragons and level  witches have the highest costtohousing space values and are therefore the best for this purpose.The max amount of resources that can be banked   elixir  level  dragons  level  wallbreakers  level  archers   dark elixir  level  witches  level  hogsIn practical terms most people should be banking elixir in this order  dragon gt wallbreaker gt archer.  Dark elixir in this order  witch gt golem gt hog rider gt minion.Note that once your storages are above the maximum amount of elixir or dark elixir to be stolen banking resources in this way wont help at all.ElixirTH Level|Storage Amount to Reach Cap | ||||||Dark ElixirTH Level|Storage Amount to Reach Cap | |||,ClashOfClans,cnbh8aa,30,t5_2usfk

2768730,0,t1_cniagt6,Thats a slightly different version of the gohog attack that I normally use.Step  is to lure cc and neutralize double giant bomb threat using either few balloons or hogs.  Requires some understanding of how the hogs will path.The majority of my army is still hogs and I only bring  golem.  The idea is to use golem on the side closest to aq and follow behind with witches wizards and heroes.  This is your kill group.  The hogs are deployed behind and fairly safe since most things will be targeting the golem AQ is your biggest threat.  Also if youre lucky you can use your golem to set off any g.bombs on that side before hogs go in.  The beauty of this attack is that the hogs will clear all the stuff attacking your kill group and making a safe path into the core.  Once through the hogs with heal should be able to easily clear out rest of defenses by the time your kill group gets into core.  At this point you should still have some hogs left and some heroeswizwitch left to do cleanup.  Even if you lose all your hogs before cleanup most likely your kill group is still mostly alive and strong enough to finish off everything.  And even if they arent usually you can at least salvage the  star with this attack compared to straight up hog attack where sometimes you get that dreaded   star.,ClashOfClans,cnisltm,1,t5_2usfk

2932099,0,t3_2tqd71,My goal was to cut down on the number of THs failing to star other THs in wars due to common mistakes I observed.  Selecting the easiest strategy to use against the base they are attacking goes a long way towards determining whether inexperienced THs achieve  stars or whether one of our THsTHs has to waste an attack to clean up that same target.  This flowchart was part of a larger guide I put together to help them gain experience and eventually master all these TH strategies e.g. I included guides on how to funnel drags or deploy GoWiPe troops but for now in wars I want them to make choices that have the lowest risk of failure.  The overall intent of the flowchart is to direct people towards mass drags unless the base design makes HoLo mass hogs or GoWiPe incredibly foolproof so much so that not even the newest TH could mess it up.  Note that this flowchart assumes very inexperienced attackers.  It is full of generalizations and will not apply perfectly to every potential TH war base.  These are the most common mistakes I observed that the flowchart helps to address. Using a strategy they havent mastered outside of war.  I cant tell you how many times I witnessed a ridiculously bad GoWiPe only to hear the excuse That was my first attempt at GoWiPe.  . Mass hogging a base with an obvious double giant bomb location with no attempt to either send a single scout hog in to trigger the bombs or avoid those locations.  Honestly I dont trust inexperienced attackers to successfully scout or avoid the locations anyways so Id rather they mass hog a different base until they get more experience under their belt.. Problems arising from the enemys CC troops.  Sometimes inexperienced THs forget to lure but I have more commonly observed that they successfully lure and then fail to kill.  Countless times I have watched people lure the CC troops to a corner but then drop wizards painfully slowly one at a time with nothing to tank for them.  Obviously the wizards die one by one and every enemy CC troop lives.  If they are really that inexperienced at luring Id rather they just mass drag or GoWiPe since those strategies handle CC troops easier.. GoWiPeing a base with a million small compartments.  THs dont have access to jump spells or archer queens...yet they also dont have much army camp space leftover after training golems and pekkas.  Inexperienced THs commonly GoWiPe with most of their remaining army camp space occupied by wizards which causes them to skimp on wallbreakers often I see  or fewer.  If an inexperienced TH is going to GoWiPe under such awful conditions I would rather it be against a base that is incredibly easy to GoWiPe.P.S. I can easily make tweaks so if you want something changed before sharing this with your clanfriends just let me know.  Im happy to make the changes you want and send you the new version.,ClashOfClans,co1e3q7,45,t5_2usfk

2952922,0,t3_2tzjjr,Do you have to hog the base? It looks pretty easy with dragonsloonsCC loons.Id use x lightning on the AD north of the TH leaving only the two ADs on the south side. Place a few of your dragons at the south corner so they start attacking their way up on both sides of the base. As theyre killing their way up drop a few more dragons on the army camps there on either side of that south end of the base before your other dragons reach them this will cause them to funnel inward toward the heart of the enemy base rather than continue around the outside.Drop any remaining dragons on the south corner of the base so they move inward and not up the sides. At this point dragons should be under fire from both southern ADs so drop your CC with hopefully level  balloons near one AD and drop your other  balloons near the other AD. If your dragons come under AD fire sooner drop your  groups of balloons on either side of the walls on the south end so they help with defenses but still move separately toward the ADs.Bam dragons free to sweep the base ,ClashOfClans,co3retg,3,t5_2usfk
2953636,0,t3_2tzt0k,dragloon seems kinda sketchy to me especially without rage for the slow loons.  why dont you just hog it?  lure and kill the cc troops then stream your hogs on the SE side of that NE cannon.  theyll stay in a pack almost perfectly as they go from defense to defense in a clockwise fashion.,ClashOfClans,co3ucan,5,t5_2usfk

2973257,0,t3_2u8fo8,I started Clashing last January near the middle of the month. Id downloaded the game over the holidays played it for a minute then forgot about it I think I dled it looking for something to do while waiting for lives in Candy Crush lol.            Anyway for whatever reason started messing with it the last week of January and took a pic then of my base. I was so proud. And such a damn noob. Note the spawn square right smack next to my town hall.           Anyway somewhere along the line this became my primary game.  I dont know if Im ahead of or behind pace probably behind.     Never been in a clan.             Never built a DE troop notice my heroes are slightly under for TH.     Havent gemmed for anything except minecollector boosts the  gem for  day promo and a week shield once.           Im going to max TH and get my heroes as high as possible before TH so hopefully it wont be another year doing that.            And a HUGE shoutout to this sub for helping me improve my playing. I learned most of what I now know between here and the wiki. For example my base is a modified Massacore courtesy of uacurazine.

This tactic actually helps pull your troops deeper into the core if its done right. I do not have any examples off hand but I have watched several videos and done it myself this way and it really does work. On the other hand if you are doing a balloon attack hogs or even sometimes a GoWiWi attack you can use  hogs to trigger them then like others have stated   use a mix of barbsarcherswizards to deal with them after pulling them to a corner preferably out of reach from any defenses.edit spelling,ClashOfClans,co9hv12,1,t5_2usfk

3226274,0,t3_2x2oo4,im a mid th and i have been earning DE pretty much as fast as I can spend it.  I already have my BK level  and my Hogs are level .  The first thing i did was upgrade my DE drills and storage.  upgrading the storage makes the storage have higher HP so zapping isnt as effective.  it also doesnt look as full when it is holding k DE making less people zap dont know whether to zap my drills or my storagewhen im raiding i barch  of the time.  i bring  lightnings with me and if i see a full storage with more than k DE available i zap it.  i dont care about revenge attacks they happen so infrequently it isnt worth worrying about.  i stay in Gold III and if i see full DE drill while Im barching i drop a few extra troops on that side to try get to it.  i pretty frequently get  DE using this method.  then at night i build up a Dragon army to revenge with in the morning.  i visit all the bases i can in my defense list and try to find a TH or a TH that is upgrading an AD with more than DE available.  also having dragons available to attack with might make some people think twice about zapping you for  DE.,ClashOfClans,coweoq1,0,t5_2usfk

3232534,0,t1_cowxobg,seems like the south amp your DE is definitely more protected like that!I think that improvement will help deter Southern attacks. Before people could see there was a straight shot to DE amp TH amp no traps waiting in between. Now theyll at least think twice and if they do attack there will be slowed down before hitting your DE and hopefully your other defenses can save the day.One other thought  your DE is pretty close to the mortars no? The mortars cant protect inside the red ring  tiles only between the red amp white rings. Also if you dont keep all of your resources in one spot people will be less inclined to attack. So switching your mortars with the EastWest gold amp elixir storages would allow mortars to protect DE and also split up the Gold amp Elixir storages making it harder to get fully raided? But then youve got goldelixir right next to the DE if someone wants to rage up in there not sure which would be better...,ClashOfClans,cox23b7,2,t5_2usfk

Things like a dragon in the cc when you planned to drop a bloon on the cc troops or an unplanned tesla or when you planned for your bloons to take out an archer tower while luring the cc and somehow the archer tower lives etc.Its awesome when an attack goes exactly according to plan but if it doesnt make sure to watch the replay a bunch of times and find out what went wrong or what you could have planned for more etc. To me making bases and planning out  star attack strategies are the most fun part of the game.

3353447,0,t3_2ykthn,Its possible but you gotta be tight on your deployment. And you will need max hogs level  are... okay in the CCThings to note on the dragon attack They target whatever they see so they dont care about going around the base so long as the next building is closest They get hung up on storagesThe best way to handle point  is to never deploy dragons in one spot always do a line or a V shape depending on if youre attacking a side or a cornet.  Always deploy outside gt in e.g. use both fingers to do the edge then meeting in the middle. And dont deploy them all at once give the edge dragons a second to clear out the trash building.  This allows the dragons to funnel into the middle of the base with maybe  dragons going around the outsidePoint  means that looking at the base the east side is the best spot to attack.  the dragons will be moving inwards towards the base so theyre less likely to attack the storage and attack the AD itself.So now on the attack tips  The Xbow looks like its out of range of the CCAD.  Its most likely trappedteslad.  Use  lvl  balloons to take it out first.  Drop  trigger all the traps.  Then use the last  balloons to take out the xbow.  If its not trapped then save  the  loons to help lure to east corner or help the dragons.   Lure CC kill CC this depends on what they tend to use for their CC e.g. if its all archers use a lightning spell. If its wizards lure all wizards use a barb to distract then drop BK use BK rage right after while the wizards are reloading and try to lure to east corner   Drop a barb on top of the Lab near NW AD to test for bombtraps.  Use this spot to drop your CC.    Use a single barb on the corners to take out the corner buildings on the edge of the map  use CC of max hogs to take out NW AD based on the layout this should cause them to path SW.  If they manage to take out the SW AD even better! Theyll be chased around by the BK but they should get the job done.  Drop your dragons on the east corner in a V formation.  Dont forget to deploy outsidein and give your outside dragons a chance to pop buildings just wait like a second or  before deploying the inside dragons.   When they get in range of the AD drop rage spells between the dragon and AD save your last spell or  for the last remaining AD.  Use your loonsBK if you have em only use loons once the AD is distractedYou didnt mention troops space so im going to assume  based on your troop levels and that youre a th Loons  space drags  space barbs  spacex Rage  or x Rage x Lightning If youre a th add more dragonsloons and add an extra rage spell,ClashOfClans,cpain53,1,t5_2usfk
3354560,0,t1_cpaml6n,But if you really want a war advantage you dont want to max defenses early anyway. To get favorable matchups your offense and walls should come first. Build the new air d quickly you need to be able to increase the difficulty on dragon attacks. But max wizard towers and mortars really only help keep resources safe they dont do much to help in war.I think its overkill to engineer your th war base even max bases can be taken out with either hogs or dragloon.

It doesnt mean anything if the TH with mostly TH defenses has a TH at level . He has TH defenses. This is what determines his war weight.

I was trying to say that you never use your first attack in war and then instantly drop in to use your second attack. So you would be waiting before attacking and preventing you from Gaming the system by having an instantly healing BK.

Could you comment on the fact that while each AD is barely in range of the other AD that a dragon would still be able to shoot an AD without being hit by the others?. This doesnt apply to The Nerd or what youve presented but what do you think of the layout where the AD are all against the TH but against the faces not the corners.  In terms of cored AD I think this is superior to having the AD on the corners as it usually means the TH or another beefy building like the CC will be between ADs and distract dragons and its also harder to draw a line to funnel against them.Thanks!,ClashOfClans,cpvxmub,2,t5_2usfk

Im upgrading to TH at the moment and am also trying to smash out my fence. At this stage k is a settle for me. Im raiding for k unless Ive spent so long looking that my next army is ready  then Ill drop it to k.Composition is barch variation.  wallbreakers because theyre invaluable. Im not wasting troops on wall nor do I use the WBs each time so I can spare those  spots. Then  minions because ultimately my army will train faster and I can loot again quicker. Then be patient and look for mines. Who cares what you spend searching honestly your loot should be enough to outweigh that.But anyway looting with what you are will get good practice with some troops more used in war. So theres pros and cons everywhere. Im just suggesting the simple loot is well overlooked by many. Happy looting!,ClashOfClans,cq2obgz,1,t5_2usfk

As the opposite to this I dont agree simply by putting my TH on the outside of my base that I will give you free trophies my strategy isnt to get a free shield when I trap never was.My strategy is for the sniper to either use too many troops getting the TH that they cant get any other resources.

3728176,0,t1_cqh7jmg,Same situation here. Im upgrading both heros and I never have both for war. If I have a BK ill hog if I have an AQ ill do some laloon variant if I have neither Ill penta. For the most part the air attacks wont run out of time since there are numerous pups for cleanup however hogging with just a BK is a whole another story.If I only have my BK Ill tweak my hog army a little to favor the clean up. Ill drop  hogs and throw in another wizard and  loons. Usually Ill use the extra wiz for cleanup and keep the loons until the end of the raid. The loons are useful if theres a lone cannon by itself that the hogs may need to run too or if you only have a couple hogs left with some defenses remaining. Otherwise Ill just drop a loon on a storage behind a wall that wizards or skellies would otherwise have to break through to get to and that hogs wouldnt attack for awhile. Yes loons are really slow but theyre useful for high HP storages behind walls away from hogs and for cleaning up buildings close together. Dropping  hog for  loons isnt going to dramatically change the result of your raid but the loons can definitely help for cleanup if the rest of the raid goes well. ,ClashOfClans,cqh8jg3,1,t5_2usfk

3811926,0,t1_cqqi04w,I think the key opportunity cost is builder time rather than resources lost through not upgrading. There are legitimate arguments that if you are going to fully max out TH and  the bottleneck is going to be lab time rather than builder time. From that perspective it certainly makes sense to get collectorsmines done soon as you will be doing them at that TH level anyways.There is however a mental satisfaction knowing youre doing real upgrades as opposed to collectors etc. For me at least.,ClashOfClans,cqqsglr,2,t5_2usfk
3813904,0,t3_343w7b,Continued from original Post.ConclusionLaloon looks OP in a lot attacks but you can take some good measures to defend against it which I tried to describe above. In my opinion the best way to stop it is by having a reasonably spread out base that gives the attacker less benefit from his rages and by having well placed ADWTs that are difficult to path to. Your goal is to kill the loons as fast a possible.  Heres my old base that Ive shown in the pictures and gifs above with a defense log from the past couple weeks. I left out the shitty attacks but I can post videos of the good defenses if people really want to see them. Overall I think the base illustrates a good example of pathing good WT placement and how to stagger outside defenses well but it could be better. The xbow is pointed down to help defend a golaloon from the west and even with the xbow down its defend quadpenta laloon exceptionally well. I used a witch  wiz minions and barch in my CC. It was designed several months ago to specifically defend against golaloon laloon and hogs and its held up pretty well. If youre looking more resources I would definitely check out Akiyumes website one his many SC Threads and  Godiis YT channel as I gained most of my knowledge from there. ,ClashOfClans,cqr0l24,19,t5_2usfk

Then clear out the left side of the base a little bit with your Barbarian King so the dragons dont deroute and deploy  Dragons from the left side the idea being to destroy that Air Defense as soon as possible.EDIT Make sure to get rid of the Clan Castle troops so they dont take out your hogs.

Use gaming forums to recruit as well so you know youre getting more dedicated players. The next step is patience. I run a clan on my alt and over the last year its gone from fully active  players to completely inactive for months and back to a group  totally different players now. Just wait it out and people will begin to join if you make yourself known. Make sure to have clear rules and look professional in your description otherwise serious players will be turned off. Its helpful too sometimes to go into global and say that youre looking for active players level X or higher sometimes you get some good ones. ,ClashOfClans,cr3avx1,2,t5_2usfk

3950328,0,t1_cr6i6mh,None of this has to do with level  clan. He was asking if you get refunded off of the event price of hogs or if you get refunded based on the normal price of hogs. I simply laid out how he could go about checking it. To address how I originally thought you could make money I thought the refund price was gt  for clan level  and so in my original comment I speculated you may be able to profit DE if you trained hogs at half price but got refunded based on the original price which would be more than you spent. Obviously that doesnt make sensework now that Ive checked that clan level  only refunds  but it was like  AM and honestly who gives a shit? It was speculation.

Also both attacks are viable but the reasons I default to hogs are. Ive been hogging longer and am more comfortable with them. I feel like theres a small element of chance regarding what the lava pups do which you dont have with hogs.

4098551,0,t3_37kixn,I think it comes down to your rank on the war map. If youre the top player and use an anti base thats gives up a relatively easy star then most people will just take the star and focus on starring the lower bases since theyre generally going to be easier. The lower the base is on the war map the more anti it should be because after everything gets ed theyll start from the bottom and work their way up. I totally agree with you on the gowipe scrubs. Its frustrating when you put hours into designing your base only see it get fucking gowiped from the TH side for the millionth time or war farmed for . Regardless even though it sucks watching them gowipe it even if they star theyll never get the star anyway so you should still be able to beat them in war if your clan can star.  Going back to what I said before I think the only exception should be your top bases. If the enemy can send in their  to star your  then their  can streamroll someone else lower on the map so their guys dont have to dick around trying to star the top TH s. Everyone was shocked in the TRL vs CH war because Moskri starred the  as the . Its about strategy since they most likely werent going to star that base anyway might as well let the weakest player who can star star it so the top guys can clean up. ,ClashOfClans,crngkqh,3,t5_2usfk

4177146,0,t1_crwe049,I think minions are kind of in a gray area. Most of the time you wont really use massive amount of them in a single attack lavaloonion notwithstanding but they are super useful troops for utility killing witches or loons in an enemy cc creating funnels or picking off buildings only covered by ground defense for that crucial percentage when attacking THs.The main issue is even if you dont use them all that often if you dont max them at TH it will be some time before you can actually use them at TH. This is because your primary focus as a new TH should be maxing hogs loons witches golems hounds and heal spells all of which takes some time. I would say the war troops you absolutely have to have before going to TH are giants wbs loons wizards hogs golems and spells. The troops right under these in importance are probably minions pekkas and dragons.The rest of the troops are still important but often very situational. The only troops you dont really need leveled at all in wars are goblins and even then sometimes a single goblin can be useful for cc kill teams triggering spring traps or cleanup.,ClashOfClans,crweeiu,6,t5_2usfk

4271051,0,t3_39veo4,Im a TH so I can only really discuss TH strategy in depth.The main difference between the  types of attacks are between the Pekka and the Witch. The key to understanding when to use what troop is understanding the strength and weaknesses of each.This is why it is so base dependent. In fact one part of the base might be ideally suited for witches the other for pekkas.WitchWitches have an infinte pool of troops they can go on summoning skeles for the entire  minutes. This is helpful since it provides fodder for defences and heroes to attack whilst your other troops are merrily doing damage. This can be incredibly useful in the right circumstances.Best to use when there are large open spaces e.g. moat type bases where witches can walk behind the golem and skeles summoning units and not getting hit. It takes a bit of practiceexperience to be able to ID these bases correctly.Bad to use in very tightly packed bases with tons of traps esp GBs and splash raining down on them. Predictingcontrolling pathing is much more difficult in bases which have more compartments. Also beware of splash damage. Witches have low HP and a few WT or mortar hits will take them down.PekkaA pekka is like a barb king without the ability. Very tanky and huge DPS. Once you have the jump spell the pekka when raged is great for cutting though very dense bases where a ton of damage will be raining down and therefore inappropriate for witches. Their massive attack tends to be their weakness the attack is incredibly inefficient does WAY more damage per swipe than is usually needed and slow. Thats why skeles in enemy base can be frustrating. By absorbing  hits from the PEKKA used on the skeles the enemy base has just saved itself enormous damage and wasted a lot of your time.Best to use when you have jump in bases where defences are tightly compacted and therefore witches are not ideal.Some bases have a mix of the two features. So you can use your discretion where to deploy the pekka where to deploy the witches. Roughly speaking  witches   pekka in terms of troop space.Ive had experience attacking some THs with infernos.Most of the time with multi infernos you want to go pekkasgiant. multi infernos typically shred hogs witches etc. the only exception is when you can get a cricial mass of skeles built up before reaching the infernos if they are in a specific corner of the base. Otherwise witchesmulti infernos are not a good idea.With single infernos you want to avoid taking high HP units so would try to avoid taking pekkas. Hope that helps.,ClashOfClans,cs72c74,5,t5_2usfk

In the third image i attempted to distort the image in order to make the walls appear to be on a correctly scaled grid.  After the distortions the red lines are no longer perpendicular.  However new perpendicular lines would yield a result closer to what you would expect to see if the unitss AI followed the building grid.If the AI is based on the same grid that the buildings and walls are on then the it may be more correct to distort the images before applying the known method.  However if the AI instead uses a different grid that is sort of overlayed on top of the angled base then the known method would work correctly but appear incorrect in cases like this.  It would make since to use an different grid for unit AI and movement because things might appear to be slightly off to the player if the building grid was used AI while the map was distorted.  Note that while the map is square it the distance across it horizontally is much greater than the distance vertically.  If all the unit movements were based on the building grid then units would appear to move across the map quicker when going horizontally than vertically.  Ranged units would shoot further horizontally than vertically ect.  But who knows that might be true and I may be full of BS,ClashOfClans,cs8ix7y,2,t5_2usfk

4344022,0,t3_3ar483,Youre asking too many different questions as if theyre the same thing. You need to separate the concepts of cheating and cheesy and whether it should be fixed is another question again.Its not cheating because its not breaking any rules doesnt take advantage of any bugs and doesnt even involve any action outside the game. That should be the end of that question. Also if its not cheating they dont deserve punishment.On the other hand its quite obviously cheesy minmaxing at least the part where presumably they cancel the build to do it again so they can and will be the subject of scorn. But I always say blame the game not the players. Playing optimally is what people should be trying to do its people who set their own arbitrary house rules and vigorously insist on others following them that have a problem in my opinion.Should it be fixed though Id say definitely. This game has an inbuilt though basically unavoidable design flaw in that its three separate subgames war basebuildingresource gathering and trophy pushing which particularly in the case of war and basebuilding often interact awkwardly. Whats best for one is not always best for the other. This is one particularly extreme example of that sacrificing significantly in the basebuilding subgame for the sake of the war subgame.In any case this is easy to fix with almost no cost. The fact that you get level  buildings in war before theyre built is already inconsistent with how upgrades are handled. Im quite sure this was not a design choice at all but rather the path of least coding. I suspect having buildings not exist in the war base at all will require nontrivial refactoring.,ClashOfClans,csfawbk,4,t5_2usfk

4375743,1,t1_csiv4vv,Well... I run with  healers ish archers and about  minions with my strat.MOST attacks are  healers  archers  minions and no spells. Queen is always full health at end cos of the healers. Its very rare I use a rage to heal queen quicker or lightning for full CCs but it does happen. The times I can hit with  healers its less than  minute for my army to be ready boosted.The guy in your video nexted a huge amount of time then used  spells. That doesnt sound any way better to me at all. He also nexted past some easy k grabs which I would have taken quickly with  healers and moved to the next base. Sure he nexted to find a better example but still.. Whats the point of a quick train army when you spend a lot of that time nexting? The way I see it is... I get k DE for k ish of troops within  mins of training.

I assume theres another x giant bombs beside the mortar at the top potentially one in the center but doubtful.I was thinking about coming in with a coldblooded GoHo roughly  wizards level  golem x level  witches in cc and a few wallbreakers to take out the queen and that small area there beside of her. I was going to bring something like  level  hogs and hopefully go from those bottom wiz towers. Drop a heal immediately for the GBs there and hopefully they follow the ring around.

He even got invited to the big annual event organized by Valve.For Hearthstone you can always find a patch analysis describing hidden content.In both case and also in the CoC case it builds a tremendous hype around the game.

Building Buff  It will be very interesting to see how the increased HP of buildings will counteract them though.  With the slow drops even a second or two changes things big time.Those aside probably best to plan to take out a AS during your CB or Shattered  with two of them in the base odds are one will be somewhat close.  I definitely dont think this kills air...just makes it more interesting and strategic.  On the right base I think it will be come more powerful than before.The biggest thing I am concerned about is how the building HP buff will affect loons destroying things.  Well see!

4451499,0,t3_3c0sj5,An anchor is just a spot where you can lure CC troops out of the range of defenses using a single troop usually an archer. If your base has no viable anchors the attacker is forced to waste a handful of barbs to lure the CC troops out of the range of defenses. When youre using highquality attacks on highquality bases forcing them to burn extra troop space is huge. This is why at TH most people realize having builder huts in corners is not a good idea.Compartments are just sections created by your walls. Few compartments make your base easy to GoWixx and lots of compartments make your base easier to hog.,ClashOfClans,csrsoiv,1,t5_2usfk

There are only  double bomb spots in the core and none of them are set up where you would trip both at the same time. My guess is that both double bomb sets are next to the cc. Its a really bad base to be honest. With how the queen is sitting you dont even need to bring a jump. The wall breakers to get in on the cannon only have to worry about the mortar at  oclock.  heals on this should be easy.

4549817,0,t1_ct43dm6,I dont think your account needs to be salvaged youve just accelerated your TH ahead of your troop and likely building upgrades.  It takes the same amount of time to upgrade everything to max no matter when you do it it just really hurts both your war matchmaking and your farming due to loot penalty when the TH gets ahead of everything else.  Luckily you have lv  barch which is plenty effective for farming.For war Id unlock witches which I am guessing you are currently doing and try to get proficient at Gowiwi attacks.  Its a solid star strategy which is probably going to trump anything else in the short term.  Get your queen to level  asap so you can use her ability.  Unlock the jump spell and upgrade the other supporting spells rage amp heal.  Max the witches after the spells are maxed.  Get your clan castle maxed for TH  troop space and request high level golems from clanmates to support your attacks.  At that point you can continue to support the attack by upgrading golems or you can start to work on hogs or laloon.  Do NOT upgrade to TH.  Plan to be at TH a year from now unless you gem.  Seriously.  TH is awesome btw so this is a good thing!  Just dont get the idea in your mind that if you dont upgrade in a few months youre not making progress.  It slows WAY down after TH.

4565603,0,t1_ct63oqi,Yes archers still get hit by mortar shots. Stop pretending like they dont. Storage is made much easier with upgraded barch. Barbs can take extra hitsdeal more damage. Lvl  in particular survives an extra hit from gold cannons Archer survive an extra level of mortar shot and deal more damage.Collector raids let you get away with dropping less troops and getting to the next raid faster with better barch.Upgrading barch is one of the best things you can do at a new th to improve farming.  Unless all you do is collector raids then its still better but not as big of an upgrade.Im not being cohesive with my posts sorry. Initially yeah i was talking about the ability to have archer heal through mortar shots which is helpful in some situations. Th mortars are there kn low thsyeah whats your point. Then i moved on to talking about spell less barch where just taking one extra shot is a game changer.I cant even barch? Whatever man.

Maybe a giant for the lure but thats not necessary.Lure cc with a couple hogs or a giant or something bring it up top because thats the side the queen is on with an archer on the dark spell factory. When it gets close drop  barbs  witches a wiz and then your queen. When cc is obviously under control drop golem aimed towards top right archer tower but more up by the dark spell factory. Then  wiz on each side to funnel your wall breakers try to break very top walls right where the builder hut is and then king. The whole goal of this part of the raid is to effectively kill the cc and queen and then help clean up. Once the queen is dead then two finger drop all your hogs on the top two archer towers. Use heal spells when theres a giant bomb or hogs drop below half health.Edit Heres a video of me hogging this same exact base.

4725596,0,t1_ctq6vua,What proof do you have of this?  Honestly I have my suspicions based on a few sources I have heard from online.  If you made me give my opinion I would say I believe they mod largely based on their complete disregard of their Elder who was blatantly caught botting then was promoted to Coleader.All that being said I havent seen any strong evidence of modding yet and a person botting does not mean he is modding.  Id love to hear about some good evidence though to confirm my suspicions if you have it.Also as a coleader of one of the clans that has been heavily involved with creating the RWCS I can assure you we are extremely dedicated to ensuring every RWCS clan is  fair play.  That is important to all of us and that extends to both botting and modding.  That also means not going with the Dont Ask Dont Tell strategy like many top war clans do but instead actively seeking out anyone who may be cheating and investigating it.  Omicron has in the past booted two people we strongly believed were botting and not because it was brought to our attention by a video but because we constantly check for red flags among our membership.  I expect every clan in the RWCS to take this same approach to both botting and modding.,ClashOfClans,ctq79e5,5,t5_2usfk

4737451,0,t3_3fsz7d,To elaborate a bit  GoWiPe and GoWiWi are fine building blocks for other attacks but by themselves are more of a strategy of getting pretty consistent  stars. Having used GoWiPe myself for a while you can  star with it it just requires something else. Its a type of attack that you should get  stars most of the time even if the attack starts screwing up whereas some other methods if something goes wrong you may be lucky to get  star but they will get  star more oftenFor example most guide I read advised drop all your wizards behind golems to create funnel and then if you are lucky with pathingenough tankingDPS survives the core you may be able to  star. I was able to have a bit more success hold back a few wizards to help after core was dead but for bases with a lot of point defenses outside of core this doesnt really work wellAnother example  people use GoHoWiWiGoHoWipe and a GoLoWiWiGoLoWipe as a decent  star strategy at TH where you either use a smaller GoWiPe to take something particular outslike AQ and DGB spots then hog or if all ADs are in the core take that out the use Loons to help take out the backside or use Loons up front to take care of some estranged defenses.Mass Hogs for TH or various other methods are more sure ways of getting  star but they are harder to use and some build off of GoWiPe and assume you have experience. ,ClashOfClans,ctrp6gn,3,t5_2usfk

4746129,0,t3_3fwbss,I hate to say it but your clans understanding of the war meta in clash isnt very good. The only defenses that matter for competitive war bases are air defense teslas and wizard towers mortars and xbows are the biggest offenders because they weigh so much without providing proportional benefit to your defensive capabilities. The rest of them can be left at TH levels and still accomplish the same task of defending  star attacks.As a TH your main focus should be heroes. Leave your defenses alone while your heroes get higher. Because youll farm for DE gold and elixir will come as a byproduct. Throw all the gold and elixir into walls except when you need to upgrade a troop.This is my upgrade path and it is working well for meUpgrade all your new defenses to TH levels. Keep xbows at level  strictly as a hp shield. Wait until heroes are about . Focus on walls in the mean time.Then slowly get your air defenses teslas and wizard towers. Then wait.After your heroes get to  you can upgrade more maybe xbow lvl . But be careful dont upgrade too quickly. Follow this progression until you max.At TH patience pays off. Most the new recruits we get that struggle are those with max defenses and  heroes. They cant hold their weight and it shows.I have  heroes both currently upgrading to   legos  lavas level  xbows upgraded air defense teslas and wizard towers and the rest are at TH levels. I dont get  starred.,ClashOfClans,ctssly4,2,t5_2usfk

4748044,0,t3_3fxpp8,I had a terrible time for a while actually and I am finally starting to  using similar laloon strats shown by One Hive.  I think the one thing to keep in mind is that videos shown on One Hive have high level heroes so they have more room for error.  I have my heroes at  now and I am starting to even notice a difference already.  But like it was said below part of it is timing.  You just need to get the tempo down.  I have some  laloon video on my youtube channel I can send to you if you like.  Another thing to keep in mind is base selection.  I selected a bad base last war and after having a streak of  s I only got a  star.  I feel like at this level reading the base and making sure your attack fits is a big part.Here is the link.

If they are high hp troops dragon bring a kill squad. Distract it by sending a barb or even a giant first and then surround w archwizI would bring  hogs and deploy them in groups of ten directly at the Wiz Tows. You should test the area in front of the top and bottom one with one hog first to see if there are giant bombs. I think they might be teslas but test anyway.Watch the hogs pathing and heal if they hit a ginat bomb or get low.If you didnt use the poison spell becuase there was a dragon in CC then use it on skeleton traps once they start chasing your hogs. If you dont have the poison and didnt have to use your kill squad drop some of them on the opposite side that the hogs will end up so they can clean the remaining buildings. Drop the rest by the king with your king tanking.Bring an additional  hogs max if you can get them and drop them once your main squad gets going. Drop them away from the main squad to clean any defenses that may be hitting your main squad from a distance. heals  poison  hogs   cc hogs  total.  giants  wiz  archers.GL OP,ClashOfClans,cttljuk,4,t5_2usfk

4835776,0,t3_3h37qf,One way is use mass witches. The skeletons tank for them but dont target defences like golems do so the resource ring is rendered useless. If you search up mass witch attacks on youtube you can see exactly how to do it but for the most part I believe you just drop like  witches or something including your clan castle together and then use something like  jump  freeze  rage or  jump  freeze  rage. Another way is mass max level drags if the base has weak air defence positioning.  rages and  freeze should be good for that. Basically troops that dont target defences beats the defenceless buffer ring. Its still doable with gowipe but I think its harder than something like mass wtiches as long as you dont get unlucky and drop them all on a giant bomb placed outside the base. If you want to do gowipe though then  separate golemwiz squads to really do a wide funnel then  golem with your main killsquad down the middle should work as well.,ClashOfClans,cu436gb,1,t5_2usfk

4915319,0,t3_3i6uzm,What do you mean problems?  You should be targeting abandoned bases or bases that have a significant amount of resources in the collectors.  Generally avoid bases with a lot of loot in storages.  Attacking strategy depends on the base.  Some bases have collectors that arent guarded by defenses.  You can use a single archer to take down those collectors.  Some have all collectors in a group.  For these I drop alternating lines of barbs and archers.  Others have collectors spread out.  Ill drop  barbs and  archers on each collector in this case.  It all depends on the base layout.  Just dont assume you an attack different bases in the same way.  ,ClashOfClans,cue43j7,1,t5_2usfk

4957466,0,t3_3irong,Heres the deal at th you really dont have a chance to fully protect that dark juice from a determined enemy.  Even if you have a good to maxed out base you will face th s with full jugs of elixir to burn through.  So you wont get through the dark elixir game without being robbed a bunch.  What to do then? If you havent done so already move your town hall outside in a corner for snipers.  Surround it with decorations to prove it isnt trapped.  Its usually lower ths that tend to have a troll setup.  Dont waste an opportunity for a free shield no matter how tempted you might be to troll dudes and dudettes. Build the storage.  Then spend as much dark as you can with as much speed as possible to keep the total count low and your attackers less tempted.  In fact keep ur resource total low as much as you can to keep snipers your main attackers.  Upgrade the storage as high as you can too.  More hp on the storage means it will take more hits for an attacker to drain it.  That crucial couple of extra seconds will save you hundreds if not thousands at a time later on.  If you have to save up for a hero or a lab project make sure the lab or a builder will be free when you get the funds so you can spend them ASAP. Upgrade your clan castle and place it by the storage.  Keep a dragon in there especially when you are saving for an expensive purchase.  Why? Poison spells.  It has enough dps and hp to keep an attacker on their toes and will stay alive while its poisoned. Upgrade your guns walls and  traps.  Make sure you have at least  layers of walls with guns peppered in between the attacker and your dark elixir. Start attacking with a dark elixir profit in mind.  This part is key.  The rest of the resources will come.  Once you have a mindset to dive after the prize you will learn how to protect your own a lot better and your ground game will get a needed boost for wars to come when you get to th . Good luck!

5198137,0,t3_3m70ly,witches are only used when there is no splash damage in the vicinity.  Wizard towers and mortars wreck witches.  If your kill squad needs to go through wizard towers or there will be mortars raining down fire and brimstone from a ways off a second golem is the better choice.  so basically  a second golem is the superior choice.  A pair of witches need to stay alive for about a minute to provide near the tanking power of a golem  and that is without splash killing multiple skellies at once.  Everytime that happens she needs to survive even longer to provide the same amount of HP. ,ClashOfClans,cvckhiz,4,t5_2usfk

5246862,0,t3_3mv2x3,Just replied to someone about this type of base a few minutes ago. Golems  of your own  max in CC Wizards Witches Wall BreakersKingQueen Heal Rage JumpPut down your  golems starting at the  oclock position with wizards and  witches evenly spaced  witch in the middle and the other  at the corner on the builder hut and the other corner. The golems will go to the ad mortar and archer tower. Save about  wizards and place when necessary maybe to help the side that only has  golem. The wizards may open up the first section of wall to get to the cc that gets pulled. Kill CC and use both heal spells one on each side when the golems get a little past the wizard towers or if one side needs it earlier due to cc killing a golem faster.Wait until your sides are down about half way and around the  drop your CC golem where you originally started from in the center. At  the teslas will pop up and your golem will star to head to the middle of the base. If the wizards opened up the wall great you can save your wall breakers for the back end if not wait for your golem to start beating on the wall and draw the xbows if they arent busy with the other golems on the side and drop the wall breakers to open up the wall. Drop king and queen delay the queen a bit since she is faster and the remaining  witches. Jump spell for them all to head into the core and other compartments. Rage when appropriate use hero spells when needed and get  stars.Beat this base multiple times and even a reverse layout with this strategy.,ClashOfClans,cvifp52,1,t5_2usfk

5305770,0,t3_3nly1b,Im not necessarily a permaTH... I just have a long way left to go Ive maxed structures but still have a long way to go on wallsheroes.  However I definitely enjoy TH because every time I look at a base regardless of the outcome I know there is a chance at a  star if I play it right.What would get me to move up would be either boredom once I max TH i.e. being for a few months and wanting a challenge OR excitement about TH which would require them giving TH some new shiny toys.New Toys that would make me jump to TH. New Hero Wizard Prince Nobel Giant whatever that is only available at TH and balances gameplay at that level and makes it so THs can even further destroy THs forcing a move up.. This is my favorite idea  A new troop Fire Demon? that actually draws energy from the inferno towers flames.  If hit by a single target inferno it rages up and goes fing berserk.  But to not make it OP maybe it is not super strong... so you need to clear a path for it.. Another  levels of heroes.  Imagine a L BK and L AQ going after an inferno?  Or imagine how bad life as a TH would be when a L AQ superqueens you.Im not sure that making heal work against infernos would make me jump because then I would just stay a TH and use heals and hogs potentially.What certainly WOULD NOT make me move up would be the introduction of TH.  Because that would mean either rushing through TH to get to some new magical land of unicorns and rainbows or it would mean a long loveless slog.,ClashOfClans,cvpvgjo,9,t5_2usfk

Start by luring the cc with  hog and using a poison spell on the troops. The drag or hound wont be taken out but at least the loons will be and the hound or drag will take damage. Once the poison runs out break into the north corner and then place a jump spell on the NW side NE side and north mortar. Place  golems at each jump spell and spread wiz accordingly to create a funnel. Then place your heroes behind the northern most golems. Rage th spell everything to the north once it gets over the first jump.Basically the high amount of golems should tank enough for your heroes to get into the core and snipe the Town Hall.,ClashOfClans,cvxn95o,2,t5_2usfk

5379609,0,t3_3opjhh,Send in a group of  hogs from the bottom which will take out the archer tower and cannon and then head to the air defair sweep. This will trigger a potential double bomb spot between the air defsweep. This will give you a cc lure and a clear of  of  potential double giant bomb spots. Pull cc to top with arch. Drop barb. Drop  wiz. Continuing dropping barb to distract cc while  wiz take out dragon and loon in cc. Now drop golem and a few wiz to create a funnel at the top. Drop a few wall breakers in sets of  to break walls also taking in to account timing with the mortars. Once the walls are open and the funnel is created drop your cc which will have a max pekka and your heroes. This will get the tanks into the two other areas on the top of the base that could have double giant bombs. Once they are in those areas drop a rage. This will make sure they continue on and bust through more walls. Once the bomb spots are cleared or you see there are teslas there instead. Send in hogs and clean up remaining def with  heals. Save poison for skeleton traps. Clean up surrounding buildings with wizarchbarbor gob that you save till the end.edit. This is not a set in stone plan obviously. you will need to be ready in case teslas pop up in places you didnt expect them to be especially on the bottom when you send in the small group of hogs to scout the double bomb spot teslas could pop in those two open spots next to the cannon and archer tower. If thats the case still send your golem and kill squad from the top since there are two potential double giant bomb spots in the top portion of the base. Be ready to make a decision if you find neither of the two upper spot have double giant bombs. This means you need to send your big group of hogs surigically meaning in small groups for each defense so if there is a double bomb there it wont wipe out a mass group of hogs instead it will only take out a couple. Pre heal giant bomb spots if you find there are no doubles.,ClashOfClans,cvzb0cb,1,t5_2usfk

Since theres only  mini strikes wed need  to HIT I dont think its possible to take all three even if all strikes hitwhich would be tough unless the bases were actually touching.In any case im gonna search for a base like it and give it a try.

Raged loons are monsters for killing ADs and defenses in general but you gotta get them to go where you want.  This requires a little more forethought on how to get your dragons to clear away defenses so that you can send you loons straight to the core.  Remember rage is for the loons.

They dont want to ban people based on assumptions so theyre not going to ban someone for attacking a top player and only dropping one troop. In my opinion definitive proof would be a replay from the modding teams perspective showing all of the teslastrapsetc before they start attacking.

I usually walk away down k elixer that I dont need and up like k gold and k DE.Its a nice strategy if your playing casually and just make a single raid every couple hours.typical strategy is to funnel your dragons to one AD lightning down the next one in line and assume the third AD will kill your dragons after you have ran off with most of the loot modify the attack based on AD placement as needed.Also you usually want to skip past TH and TH unless they are pretty new TH or maybe if they are upgrading an AD and their Xbows are pointed at the ground.If your confident in your dragloon attack and can count on your clan to supply a CC full of loons you can do RageRageHeal and go for a  star attack but those fail occasionally if your loons get distracted at the wrong time at which point you will likely walk away with nothing so I usually just go for the safer dragons and lightnings,ClashOfClans,cweykhr,5,t5_2usfk

5512834,1,t1_cwga9r4, I dont consider myself one of the most elite attackers out there and I  star very consistently with low level royals. Not only elite clans have skull walls youll pull in something similar to your own base in war generally so yes if youre rushed you will see less skull and lego walls but if you arent you should see them a decent amount. You have two attacks at the very least you should be trying for  with your second attack. Scout with gowipe for  then try a  but usually its just gowipe after gowipe.. I prefer the war buddy system pairs of  or  around the same weight in war to clean for you and you for them. Ive never been d by a gowipe as a th. so I cant imagine it ever s many full blown s that have competent base design. The only reason you dont get an opportunity to clean is because of lack of planning before war starts the war buddy system is a solid one to have. Scouting bases for traps should be second nature by the time you are th.I personally have never used gowipe in war but I understand it has its uses attacking up a th level but war should come down to who can better execute a multi layered attack not if your wiz funneled correctly or not. Thats just my  cents. I dont mean to come off jerky I just wish for once Id see someone attack my base with something that wasnt gowipe..

5625847,0,t3_3s5odj,There was . weight post that is front page today. It didnt have walls. As someone who just did . I found that taking everything to level  max had less impact than when I put the  teslas up to level . Also the xbows arent as heavy as everyone said they were. The spreadsheet did note that the xbow weight was equal per xbow level so xbow had  the weight of xbow despite it doing  the damage  vs  dps. There is an invisibile line that you will cross that will flip you from matching THs and rushed THs to early THs. Early TH to me is xbows skulls heros . IMHO all these early THs can be  stared with GoHo Max hogs AQ and jump. So when you jump you need to do your first  builders  AQ and upgrade  k DE roughly CC Spell factory Lab DSFactory. First lab upgrade would be jump since you will need it to kill queens and it is cheap enough to not push your Elixir upgrades back too far. All DE goes to AQ to level  then you get your hogs and then again to queen to . Elixir goes to all your  camps then  Dark Barracks then mix in maxing  drills and getting  DB to level  and  to level . Then pump all exlir into your lab and try to grind out as many of those upgrades before your queen is level . Id roughly do Loon Heal Rage Dragon Healer Giant Lightning Barch.  When the elixir upgrades in the lab is done you will probably just dump elixir into legos.What I did with gold is probably not how I would recommend it again. I did traps AD and all  teslas . When teslas hit  I started pulling early THs. I then did xbows AT and Wiz. Based on the chart I saw today I would modify to AD Tesla. Then xbows. Then at and finally wiz. Somewhere around xbow your AQ jump and hog is all ready. At this point TH. is over if you ask me and you are an early TH. When all your traps are maxed Defenses are TH max and elixir upgrades are done or mostly done then is when I would and am now pumping up walls with both gold and elxir. Whem my skulls are done done and leggos about  the way I will start slowly filling in max th defenses ideally heros are  then. My personal plan is Golem soon AQ is almost  and golem when heros are . Then I will figure to get my LH haste and max valks. I was told witches really have a heavy weight I will wait for that. Thats probably my late TH. ,ClashOfClans,cwufui9,3,t5_2usfk

5634055,0,t1_cwv5dbp,You can put the TH in a corner undefended to get sniped giving you a relatively low cost  hour shield.  Lots of people snipe their way to  or to  trophies for the achievements.You are doing a good job already of not accumulating lots of both gold and elixir.  Upgrading your walls will help to use up gold and will make you less appealing to attackers using giants.  You can get up to level  walls at TH which seems like a lot of gold at first but its really not in the long run.You can protect your storages better by putting them in different compartments.  At TH I used an internet base called Junliangs Pokeball.  I understand that there are other popular TH farming bases now but what they have in common is putting each storage in a different compartment and then having the storages covered by wiz towers to kill goblins.  Your base is a variant of a vault design where all the goodies are in the core that means that once an attacking force penetrates to the core they get it all.I see that your base has a lot of X junctions.  It would be more effective to replace them with T junctions so that breaking one doesnt open up a whole bunch of compartments.  Giants naturally are attracted to junctions.  Also when you upgrade your walls prioritize junctions.  You dont have to upgrade all of your walls evenly on whatever base design you settle on I would first make the junctions be purples and then fill in the spaces in between with pinks and leave the golds for the outer wall.  Also make sure that T junctions are not right next to each other to minimize the number of compartments that wallbreakers can open.  Google for junliangs pokeball and see how the walls are laid out.,ClashOfClans,cwvghw4,1,t5_2usfk

A Th  base with TH  level defences plus Xbows and Infernos is harder for a TH  to take than most high level TH s are... individual defences are getting seriously overpowered and you dont get the effective counters spells until you reach the same level. ,ClashOfClans,cwz1jrk,4,t5_2usfk

5754069,0,t3_3txt4e,A few thoughts to think about...SuperQueening is going to wreak havoc on some users if they stick to the  troop capacity regardless of stars attained.  For balance theyll either need to return traps hitting healers or make an exception to  star attacks or maybe .  For reference a TH defending could have an Archer Queen and  healers and be using less than  of troops.  Even the most modest TH defending assume only  army camp cc both heroes would have an AQ amp  healers qualify as less than  of troops.  According to this post about what counts  Granted AD amp wall layout matters here.Trap rearm costs are going to sky rocket and will become less reliable for defenses.  Im guessing Village Guard is going to come into play here but its currently an unknown.Lastly one point that is going to get overlooked a lot but will cause much more pain that people really know...  this is going to greatly exaggerate the current time bug  Anybody who has pushed for the unbreakable achievement intentionally keeping storage amp collector levels low while keeping your townhall guarded has likely found that their collectors produce much less than they should because of the highly increased number of players skipping by your base because it takes so long for you to gain a shield because nobody would want to attack you for what you have to offer.  This will exaggerate once again as sniping goes away and more bases see more passing eyeballs each of which slows down your village production and even your builder construction completion time.,ClashOfClans,cxaci7q,3,t5_2usfk

Someone will attack you soon after your shield is up and assuming you lose all the de you still get a nice hr shield which you can attack  times from and get back your res whenever. Example of worst case scenario. Everyone you have no shield you get attacked and lost k de. This gets you a  he shield. You attack  times with mass drags or gibarch or  loonion and get k de. Net k every single time you get attacked with the possibility for more. Now though you can attack when you have time for just  raid and can afford time wise to train super time consuming army comps for farming.

I think people will actually like the new update someone calculated that attacking is actually going to be more efficient in the new update with the new shield system. active players will get a  ish increase in the amount of loot they can earn in a day.,ClashOfClans,cxdaz8c,0,t5_2usfk

Progressive loot could even be a great deal if it was based on stars not destruction. loot bonus for  star keep current loot bonus for  star. Double loot bonus for  star.

If you follow game play and max your heroes to lvl  at th like you are supposed to then you have lvl  heroes as you enter th  and you have pretty great impacts on attacks with those.I think its just rare that someone goes to th  when theyre supposed to and once you go there and realize you want to go back you cant.

5944198,0,t1_cxyo7hq,They may be at a point where theyre catering to the bigger spenders right now. Thats usually how these games play out its just Clash got a huge reputation for being a good and free game. Now that they have the vast audience and exposure they could just be trying to minimize those that dont provide any incentive and maximize the ones that do.Reminds me of something similar that McDonalds did this year. That they closed more buildings than they opened because now theyve already expanded to a point that they cover more areas than they dont. So if the one down the street doesnt make as much as the one a couple miles away from it then they just close the smaller one. Even if it is doing fine.TLDR  Could be maximizing resources not necessarily trying to make it better for everyone.,ClashOfClans,cxytbp7,10,t5_2usfk

5948490,0,t3_3wsefx,This update is really making me reconsider this game. Im a mid TH who boosts both collectors and boost barracks for about  hours a night. I actively spend money on this game and dont feel like Im making progress. Its not even the changes to the sheild that bothers me those I can live with. Its that I  order to secure real loot I have to go balls out and attack with all my spells. At TH its almost never profitable and the bases that do have the resources to make it worthwhile are very hard to clear.I really think they need to revert back league bonuses to how they were before. I used to be able to just target the TH and what ever resources I could snag on the way their and use the league bonus to recoup most of my army cost. Now its possible for me to get  star and  elixir storages and still end up behind because I only got  of the base. They either need to go back giving you full bonuses for  star....or massively increase the bonus.,ClashOfClans,cxzdljk,1,t5_2usfk

5978965,0,t1_cy3d58m,Thanks for your calculation but I have to say that it is a whole lot different for early TH.Matchmaking only offers Mid THs  Max THs so I need a quite expensive army and spells to get the storages. Normally I use GiWiBarch with at least two spells which is costing me at least k Elixir. Opponents offer up to k Elixir but its not possible for me to get all  storages and the TH usually I get k sometimes k.Since I am a absolutely fresh TH my defense sucks and I get raided by Max THss easily for k. Theres no way for me to save up mil Elixir for my lab upgrades.I really like the concept of the new update TH sniping is boring and they were right in removing it but there needs to be a new source of loot to compensate for the missing free shields.

The loot is better on full attacks and sniping THs in the  trophy range is just fucking ridiculous right now. Seriously if I can spend  minutes TH sniping I easy get K of DE WITH JUST MY QUEEN.

5996632,0,t3_3xlnld,If it was truly not the intent for people to be able to farm and casually play the game by leaving town halls outside then supercell got lucky. The ability to play this game casually is the only reason Ive been playing for  years. Im sure if you could look at the data youd find an overwhelming majority of players never raid. The problem with this update is that its forcing all the casual players to actively raid to be able to get expensive upgrades. Whereas before you could play this game however much you wanted and still progress and improve your base. so for people like me that just like to get on collect loot from collectors and maybe make a war attack or two this update has significantly damaged the value of the game. Obviously players like me arent exactly SCs favorite customers due to lack of gem purchases but I believe this anticasual update will create a huge drop in the player base in the next couple months damaging the game as a whole.,ClashOfClans,cy5ottj,12,t5_2usfk

They also made it so long build armies and spells are your best option for successful raids those take time but people can cancel out that time with gems which they buy from SuperCell benefiting them.

I guess if I was going for stars I would have easily used the minimum of  troops to give them shields. My strategy is to leave my collectors and mines with  hours of loot built up in them to entice lowerlevel attackers to go for just collectors.

6031553,0,t3_3y3hxw,It mostly has to do with the size of upgrades at the later TH levels. The amount of loot that is net profit after an attack doesnt change much after a certain point. At TH  one of my accounts is at the low end of that. Lots of resources are coming in and I am able to spend it in good time.The problem comes with the upgrading at higher TH levels. As a low end TH I need million elixer for almost anything on that side of my lab. People are finding that they loose as much elixer as they have gained once they have a certain amount in storages. They then have to attack far more often in order to maintain their loot and the more they have saved the more they loose.I find that holding on to more than m of either makes me loose m day. And since I need more than that for almost everything except walls it makes for frustrating timesThere was a xpost placed here yesterday that talked about the kind of matches generated by the new sheild system and how that is affecting peoples nexting and perception of the availability of lootedit here is the link,ClashOfClans,cya95lx,2,t5_2usfk

If you still find yourself running out of time at that point my suggestion is to just be more confident with your plan. Its easy to waste a few seconds between dropping your golems and wizards and then to waste more time before sending in the hogs after the kill squad does what it needs to do.

6059086,0,t3_3yj3ed,GoWiPe and its variants are pretty simple and virtually any base can be two starred with it. Upgrade your golems if you can. GoHo and its variants is a little more complex but can three star some pretty tough bases.Straight up hogs and surgical hogs can also three star mid to high THs. Deployment is pretty easy the challenge is that you absolutely must take out their cc and if you can the Queen with minimal troops. Lavaloon is still alive and pretty powerful. Youll want to upgrade your balloons though theres a massive difference between  and . Again taking out the cc and Queen is critical. Air sweepers have nerfed lavaloon a little but I still think its one of the strongest attacks out there. Deployment isnt too hard but timing is pretty important relative to the other attacks. Honestly none of these attacks are super complicated. I like you dont really have the time to plan out pathing and create intricate attack plans. Once you recognize which attacks work on which bases you can formulate an attack in  minutes train your army and go.Edit Just saw you dont have witches or lava hounds yet.

If they make it easier for us to hold resources that also makes it more difficult for us to take resources from others. They need to make changes that increase the profit margins on attacks increased bonus reduced troop costs etc.I can understand lesser THs having problems but as a max defense TH I dont have issues holding onto my loot I have issues actually acquiring the loot.

6136845,0,t1_cyn3l50,This is indeed true. I cant deny a dgb can be strong. Having a dgb spot means that they have to figure out a way to avoid it or to trigger it with a somewhat little amount of hogs. But I feel like theres always gonna be a way to play around it. It could be going there with a kill squad with a goho variant  it could be sending a couple suicide hogs etc. Even if its literally in the center of the base between the th the cc and two teslas you can probably find a way to put only five hogs there. However I dont deny that it is very hard to do and most attackers will fail. Its kind of a win hard or fail hard situation If they can deal with the dgb efficiently they win if they cant they lose. Do you have any good example of a base like this?However if instead you have three singles its much harder to play around. They would need to avoid all those spots which is much harder. Of course they are not that big of a deal since a single heal spell will deal with it. Where you can get an edge is that if they use a heal spell on each of those spots they wont have a heal for that cluster of defenses with a wiz tower for example.Now I cant tell for sure which one is best This is why were discussing it here Im just trying to show that not having a dgb can definitely be strong too and should be at the very least considered.For gowipe I have my three teslas between my th and cc in my core and that seems to be working ok. They usually get a very high percentage two star but a couple wars back I got three starred by someone who brought something like  pekkas  lvl   lvl  in cc IIRC.

6208747,0,t1_cyvcecg,I definitely also wouldnt see the value in the game if I wasnt more actively involved in gathering resources partly because living off collectors would take too long to progress. However I think it still had the competitive nature and ability for people to steal loot raiding one another without ostracizing those who progressed from collecting loot. For some people they simply liked collecting their resources and building a base for most early players farming and developing their base is the most common playstyle from my observation so the worry I have is that this will keep people from getting involved in the game. I was way more passive to begin the game so if people cant start and enjoy the game now the game will slowly fade away as the player base decreases.,ClashOfClans,cyvd8u0,2,t5_2usfk

They look at it as if they make it harder to farm and make loot youll have more pressure to attack more frequently to make up the money youve been missing out.

You lose less on defenses as noobs will attack and fail on your base and there are so many collector raids and to be honest maxxed THs that you can demolish. If I want a lot of resources fast I just milkgobarch  barracks gobs  barracks archers  barracks barbs  barracks mixed. Cook lightning spells to kill mortars or occasionally wizards that get in your way. I tried the GiBarch strategy after the update with shitty results. Id get  storages for k. bleh.

Modding Clans are also a community which shoots for being a full on modding clan and welcome fights with other modding clans they openly admit they use a mod and see who can pull off the win since everyone has the same advantage. Why do people always have to act like oh I knew it Onehive or WHS had another member caught for cheating so they are not a real fair play clan. Their is absolutely no way for these guys to know for sure someone is cheating unless something like this happens. I man look at the reactions of their own clan members like WTF they basically grilled her and was like well that sucks see ya. Either way Fair Play will always have someone come along and try to throw dirt in the idea of Fair play war community its just trolls trying to break up good war clans and jealous aholes acting like there is no such thing.,ClashOfClans,cz2mmv2,2,t5_2usfk
6277783,0,t3_41jdg3,I have experienced this situation and tested it in a few different ways.       I had a town hall  went to town hall  and built infernos. Instantly paired up with town hall s and only having town hall  troops it was tough.  I had another town hall  and decided to go .. It was great in war but progress was extremely slow in normal attacking. You lose   for attacking town hall s and matchmaking seems to pair you up with ths more often. In war you will still be paired up with rushed town hall s and sometimes max th defenses with infernos. That puts you in the two star game and that is definitely not what I was looking for.   I had yet another town hall   heroes. I decided to go balls to the wall and go immediately to town hall . In war I am still paired inbetween highest  and lowest  I am currently AQ heroes and sometimes I am crushing town hall  bases. In war this account has been extremely fun. BUT in normal matchmaking it is horrendous I get smashed by real town hall s and for some reason I only get matched up with town hall s. Long story short I gemmed a lot of the progress once I got to  but I am having a blast in war.   Depending on what you wanna do to your game there is a lot of things you can do. If your still interested in farming go to ten get to  with max freeze then get to town hall  and start working on your troopsgrand warden. If your only interested in warring skip  and go straight to . The grand warden makes three starring s much easier and balanced,ClashOfClans,cz37oo4,1,t5_2usfk

I do not enjoy the update because there is very little that benefits me. As a TH player the game was not playable after the update until they fixed the loot issue last week. However the loot is not any better now than it was preupdate in early December. Perhaps my biggest problem with the update is Supercell lying to us by them stating that this is how the game was supposed to be played. It only took them a little over  bloody years to figure out how they wanted the game to be played. One word bullshit.Before the update I would always boost barracks and heroes.

6305707,0,t3_41zh5i,Ill write this as if your target is DE. Gold and elixir are a happy by product for me.  loons  minions.  Rage haste and  poison as needed. Cc is whatever. I dont always use it. Minionsdrag are a good choice. Heroes currently BK  AQ  but I find I dont need them for loonian which is a big win for the th hero grind. You can use them for an outside AD kill AQ snipe BK tank for AQCC snipe if you have them or percentage for a star.Ive used this from Gold  to masters . Throw in a hound or  in champs. Bases vary. Ths are obvious as are weak ths. Max ths can be done too but theres plenty of easier targets out there. It depends on the DE layout. Offset DE is usually a winner not covered by more than  AD. Xbows down is a plus but up is fine as long as loons can take them. Xbows tear up minions. Deploy from side closest to DE rage or haste depending on layout. Occasionally Ill hit rich collector bases. Deploy like gibarch loons to tank for minions. Comfortably half a base for mid ths. Usually can clear  storages DE storage and Th if all goes well.  for a range  usually for ths less for ths.Loot again varies depending on bases and with new update too. Around .k DE is pretty standard .k with new update if TH is not taken. Add in full drills and that goes up to k less common. Elixir and Gold vary as theyre not my primary target. That said k of each is usually the range I end up with. In short I love loonian. Its a longer cook time around an hour but less margin of error. I find it not to be as hero dependent as gibarch other main comp. Walls and wall breakers placementjump is a non issue. Its much easier and a solid way for loot. ,ClashOfClans,cz6dz5s,5,t5_2usfk

6317873,0,t3_4254ob,On my TH defenseless I built both Teslas Giants bombs spring traps and bombs and have a war weight of about K and considering a max TH is k thats basically nothing. Traps count very little towards War Weight however they do count more if you dont have any other defenses as defense weight is also based on your total base weight i.e. one defense on a defenseless weighs more than it would on a regularly developed base.   It should be possible to build walls too and probably stay below k but I havent been having problems getting shields so I havent needed to yet.  Im down in Silver  and the skill of attackers tends to be less down lower so they tend to drop all their troops no matter what.   Ive got a few more labs to max out and BK  amp  to do then I will be going to TH.  Thats where Im a bit more concerned about not being able to get a shield but will see how it goes.

Personally I think it is B.S. it doesnt count AND B.S. it doesnt show who donated what. It was a lot of work figuring out what ding dong donated L to L goblins each war that had to be deleted. Even if it was just their war number displayed...also doesnt matter about req and leaves since spectators can not donate. So if a new guy was brought in was in war and filled CCs with L giants for the stats he would be kicked and not able to do that again for  hours since he cant join a war until our war is over.

6401704,0,t1_czgmn7l,You gotta learn and become proficient at three star strategies before you can learn to war with one hero down. Its definitely become easier to do so as I myself had a five star war and a six star war the last two wars I was in with my queen down and I wasnt shooting low either this last war I three starred the opponent number one with queenie sleeping. So its definitely possible to not only war with one hero now but to war well. Now that Ive said that here are my disclaimers.  You wont have any luck warring well without heroes if six star wars arent the norm for you yet. Obviously cant three with one if you cant three with two  You will need to be proficient at a variety of three star attacks and good at analyzing bases because you will be limited in your choices because youre choosing to fight with an arm behind you back. My best luck has been with Deez Nuts and govaho. What your time frame to being effective at warring with one hero might be I do not know but Im personally just beginning my attempts at it and finding marvolous success but again thats because Ive been warring with a variety of townhall nine strats for six months now my heroes are each above level  I know the slide show says  are the turning point and they really are but you can substitute  heroes and an ass load of experience for  with moderate experience and get consistant outcomes. My attempts thus far have been on bases that have had obvious weaknesses although I did clear one base in cleanup this last war that had been giving others in my clan trouble with just the king. So far they havent been the strongest bases but youll usually be able to find bases that you can clear if you know what youre doing and the clan isnt relying on you to clear the hardest base. Tldr Warring with one hero is definitely possible and should be done as shown by my anecdotes. You can even three star with it if youre good at analyzing bases for weaknesses. Dont expect to be the mvp but you can be useful for more than just scouting once you develop skills. ,ClashOfClans,czhb52k,1,t5_2usfk

One of them tried going a week after hitting TH without infernos and he quit and built the fuckers... Its not that you dont have an advantage but infernos are basically the main defensive upgrade of TH and really skew the game to benefit defense and not offense. Thats why the only TH that is not required to  star constantly is TH because if the base is smart its really complicated. I suggest building your L infernos  You may not upgrade them right away because it adds weight but do build the L infernos.

After theyre done im going to get the new AD and try to get that and the tesla up to max TH level.Then I need to do the lab upgrades  army camps  dark barracks etc  key point being im spending a lot of exlier and also dark elixer on getting queen up. Im not spending any gold except on getting the AD and Teslas up to max Th level. Therefore im going to have a lot of gold to spend on getting all my walls plus new walls up to at least skulls. Pretty much im not going to level up new defenses or the current ones to TH level until im at all skull walls. As for farming just barch around silver   gold  for collector bases.

6585879,0,t3_45ua7u,First choose an attack that you are confident with. In my case I choose govaho. I scroll through the bases near my level and look for one that shows a weakness to queen walk govaho or whatever strategy you chose. With this strategy I want to negate the three key threats double giant bombs the clan castle and the enemy queen.You must make sure that it is worth it to use a queen walk. Can you also kill the enemy aq with the queen walk? Negate any dgb spots? Even just getting lots of point defences is beneficial. Then figure out how you can lure the cc to your queen where you ragepoisonuse the ability whatevers needed. You must pull the cc to your queen instead of the valks if you dont know what is in there.So now that Ive done that I look to see where the best spot is to send my killsquad. normally consisting of golem my bk and  valks. With this you want to remove the rest of the three key threats. Once thats all done its time for the hogs. I normally have one heal left but sometimes Im left with two or even none.Look for places where you can send in  hogs on each defence while your valks are yanking for them. This allows you to heal on more important spots such as teslasbombs.Its a long process when written on paper but with practice it can come naturally to you. All you need to do is choose a base that is weak to to your favourite attack and break down the steps to your attack.Hope this helps DEdit I also just noticed that you pointed out your queen walks arent always going as expected. It is very important that you funnel her the right way with giantswizardsminions whatever. Even if it costs  troops space to do its better than having your queen go the wrong way. ,ClashOfClans,d00j830,1,t5_2usfk

Its true that the free shield and bonus system was nice I did take advantage of it but I understand the change I however dont understand what took them so long to change it. The thing is that right now with dead bases back and the star bonus its easier to find loot and keeping it having like  millions of G and E and k DE safe even if you go over the cap the amount stolen is still low is huge for those situations in which you need to save a lot of resources and your shield runs out before troops are ready. Im overflowing with resources atm its true that Im pushing to champions for the gems and the bonus are crazy there but Im sitting with nearly  millions gold that I need to dump on walls sometimes because I cant keep up with building times I didnt think I could say this before as a TH but I could have  builders busy doing defenses and have full storages if I wanted to and by tweaking my army a little bit I could either get a crazy amount of elixir or a crazy amount of dark.

Their weight may still impact enough to push them out of average th level because of the new structures they build and are upgrading.One issue seems to be the spectrum where you miss vital th and th players and skip to th and below.

Golems  are a huge part of all your th attacks not sure why you did healer before them since superqueen and queen walks arent effective until your queen is a lot higher anyway. FInish your drills finish your golems  finish all elixir upgrades.  Go ahead and take your AD and Teslas to max for th.  Lots of differing opinions on walls these days.  They are a great way to keep loot low and thus protect DE they also add more weight than they are worth.  Its not a lot but really walls dont matter too much past th with hogs and loons being staples of all attacks plus the EQ.If you go the route of continuing to drop walls i suggest starting lavas before finishing legos.  Theres a lot of times I wish I could ditch  million before bed but I cant because lavas are  million.

6701003,0,t1_d0cduon,Whats the difference between total damage and max damage? If you mean max DPS then I understand that. My point still stands though. Let me try to explain it with an exampleLets say you have one spell that starts at  DPS and ramps up linearly to  DPS over s and then stops increases  DPS every second. Total damage would be .      . Now lets say stacking two of these spells will cause the DPS to ramp up twice as fast increases  DPS every second and then the damage stays at  DPS until it reaches the same total damage. The total duration of the second spell would have to be less than the single spell.. After doing some math I figure the stacked spells would only last .s total to reach  total damage.

Leave a couple x spaces near the center of your base and set up your defenses so that the hogs will path through these spaces. Kablooey. No more hogs.That being said if you only leave two x spaces the attacker will know and deply accordingly. If you moved your Tesla towers inside your base you could have have two more x spaces. This makes your attacker have to guess which spaces will be double giant bombs DGB and while will be paired Teslas.If you want to be an even bigger jerk you could leave open spaces that have nothing in them.

6835913,0,t1_d0r4ldi,Ill comment on war since thats what defending against  stars is about for defending your loot someone else can comment in greater detail. For war at th youll face dragons damn near  of the time even after the rd air defense AD update.Defending against dragons is difficult at th but the rd AD helped a lot.  Your AD are low level so right off the bat youre an easy target for dragons.  Those need to be your first priority to upgrade on defense. Your AD are also very exposed they are all in the outer layer of the base meaning they will be attacked very quickly and have less time to beat down the health of the dragons and they have a LOT of health. So move the Air Defense in towards the center of the base but not TOO close to each other. Next protecting Air Defense  Cannons and Mortars do not target air troops so they can be used to protect your air defense from ground troops.  Your best defenses against dragons are archer towers teslas and then finally wizard towers. Use them around your AD to keep the damage going on the drags longer. Also as im sure youre aware you dont lose real loot in war so your storages dont need to be protected.  They are very useful though still since they have a lot of health compared to other buildings.  Dragons take longer to destroy them meaning an air defense on the other side of that storage has longer to kill that dragon.  Position your storages on the outside of your air defenses to slow down the dragons and give your AD more time to kill them. Giant bombs and springs are best used against defensive targeting ground troops like giants and later on and more importantly hogs.  Those troops go from defense to defense so place those traps directly between defenses so the giants walk directly over the top of them. This is called pathing if you want to research more about it. Hopefully that helps.   If you meant as a farming base... spread your storages out more same goes for your minespumps.  Right now all your loot is in the south of the base so even if someone can only destroy  of your base that  includes all your loot. ,ClashOfClans,d0r5ibp,4,t5_2usfk

7107876,0,t1_d1m0asc,Helloi use  wb giants barbarians and  archers hogsminions and  heal spells as army composition. you can use poison spell to kill cc troops and lure with giant or wb. coming to the strategy i spam all the giants in one side and open up the walls with wb and send a line of hogs behind them. the giants act as meat shields. i heal hogs or giants with heal spells. then i funnel with archers so that my barch enters the core and storages. it takes mins to train the whole army. you dont need to wait for all heal spells to brew even  heal spell per raid is enoughyou can just keep adding heal spells in spell factory. and another bonus with this strategy is if u find a dead base you can take out the collectors with  barb and arch. trophy range to good luck,ClashOfClans,d1m1y98,3,t5_2usfk

I only agree to the extent that I feel their current problem is primarily that they die winding up to make attacks just like the old Valks did.I think if their attack speed was cleaned up ever so slightly somewhere between where it currently is and where Valks currently are they could find a whole lot more usage.Regarding their upgrades the extra  hp for the massive  dark to upgrade them twice is quite the joke. They get bigger upgrades in damage at  dps per level but that just allows them to get that structure  shot closer to dying before they get picked off currently.,ClashOfClans,d22ilin,17,t5_2usfk

We war x a week so I did spend some gems on hero upgrade time reduction here and there to get them back for war in the last  months or so because you cant really war as a TH without both heroes at least not effectively but farmed all the  million DE needed.  I went to TH with BK  and AQ  as I needed to jump to help the clan out at the top in wars sooner than later.  So I had a lot of catch up to do on hero levels at TH and I have spent just about a year at TH as a TH. with no infernos just dropped my third xbow and am currently also upgrading my other two to xbows to Lvl .

7497823,0,t3_4i0rf5,Im in the same boat TH with ish trophies and averaging  minute searches in clouds to find a single base. Just last week it was almost always less then  minute. Dropped down from legends last month after not being able to play the game tired of  hour wait times to find a single base to attack. The drop itself was miserable as well since I couldnt even find a base to attack so had to break shield constantly and hemorrhage loottrophies I had worked so hard to earn. With all that being said though I do plan on staying low Titan I for farming since my average raids are still grossing . million resources and the  hour village guard is nice. My guess is that more frequent attacks by all players are contributing to this. I doubt bans had much of an effect on the player base at this level. Also I have been seeing more THs amp THs lately my guess is that search criteria was loosened since they anticipated this happening. Lastly your army keeps on cooking as soon as you leave for the clouds doesnt matter if you are nexting or not. Edit  Grossing not netting that many resources ,ClashOfClans,d2ugpas,1,t5_2usfk

7589450,0,t3_4j6ru5,Giwibarch works with level  giants and the right combination. Ive found that the standard comp works against th defenses which are too weak to beat th giants easily but any midhigh ths are a stretch. However nodifying it so youre not just throwing troops at a base makes it into a successful raiding technique. If you can get your giants up to level  any time soon I would reccomend a healer comp instead of relying on heal spells Ive been having a lot of luck with this as they seem to last a lot longer. My standard troops are  giants  healers  wiz  wbs  hogs  archers  barbs  quakes and  heals. In raids quake and funnel the giants in backed with wiz and your heroes then drop the healers in a way that they wont immediately get killed by ADs. Augment the giants with sideend hogs and sprinkled archers and barbs and use heal spells when necessary. This will usually allow the giants and wiz to clear the core and yields  on bases with skull walls meaning you can also get a lot of the collectors as your troops sweep the base.As for trophy range as a nearingmax th Ive found a bit of a sweet spot around  trophies in Master . This lets you float high enough to keep the loot bonus and nondelayed star bonus for M but still pick dead bases from Crystal . My raids usually yield kkk and take ish minutes to train. ,ClashOfClans,d34vt1r,1,t5_2usfk

7603556,0,t1_d36glgb,Its a game everyone finds a different way to play and enjoy it. I agree by far most people play COC to progress unlock new troops and heros get bigger and stronger.

For the OP that stopped as soon as he hit TH and for many of my clan members thats also been the case.As a free player  it will never stop. Short of maxing out your TH and chilling out and doing wars or raids or whatever you like to do in game. And if you go to TH and get through valkshogsgowipe then you following your line of thinking need to go to TH then TH then TH. Years and years of hamster wheeling  I can understand why many people make the move to TH and then quit.,ClashOfClans,d36hgxm,1,t5_2usfk

Theres never an actual structured plan but at that point I needed a lot of DE and XBows to protect it. gt Id like some of those mini dragons and those dark witches in my life.

Before upgrading the barracks? Either one really. I would personally get the lab going first and then barracks but the times gonna add up to be the same.

7933460,0,t1_d47bq7p,Why freeze? Everyones research focus will be different but a high level freeze spell makes a huge difference when attacking enemy THs during war. We frequently only face two THs in our  man wars but in the current war we are facing  enemy s all with infernos. For me as  on our team that makes it likely I will need to hit one of these bases with Infernos. Against the majority of popular TH bases I run two freeze spells and the extra time on freeze is makes a huge difference between my valks getting roasted while they try and clear a really tough core or smashing through it and busting out the other side. I only have level  freeze currently level  is  days away but I expect that when I have max freeze I will be able to freeze a multi target inferno before my valks get into its range and they will kill it before it comes back online. ,ClashOfClans,d47sngi,1,t5_2usfk

8024898,0,t3_4p249k,While the intention is good I dont think its a good idea. Assuming your idea of gifting is paying money to gift someone else gems it can be abused but not in the way you think.For example say a new and upcoming clan is trying to recruit. They could use the gem gifting as an incentive to lure players in only to actually pay up or not follow through with their promise. Conversely a player looking for gems could actively look for clans offering this incentive could just join the clan purely for the reward and then leave. It also allows for the majority of the immature clash community to just spam plz gift gemsBetter off with keeping the method a bit more discreet and going out to the store and buying an iTunes or Google Play card and messaging them the code through a messaging app.,ClashOfClans,d4i2nzj,1,t5_2usfk

8036297,0,t3_4pa77v,Yes I like your plan.  If you can afford to do the queen to  right away then great but I never could and there is plenty of stuff to spend builders on.  I like doing the new traps and storages right away and upgrading them when I get a builder and dont have enough resources for one of the more important upgrades.Something that not many people have done yet but that I have started advocating is never placing the new wiz tower.  You dont really need  of them to have good TH defenses and omitting it gives you a small but permanent war weight advantage.With the reduced weight of xbows I think that if you plan to ever drop them I would do them after you drop and max the new tesla and new airdef.  I say to do tesla first because it is hidden and airdef early because it helps you shut down TH air for good and xbows before the archer tower or whatever because they take so darn long that you just want to get them over with.That said probably the most common mistake that people make at TH is maxing all of their defenses when they have midteen heroes and then get discouraged and bored when there is nothing left to do for the next  months but the wallhero grind.  Maybe fewer months if youre a better farmer than me.  Probably the best way to avoid this is to be disciplined enough to upgrade both heroes at once for as long as you can.  When I started farming with giwiz boost sessions in masters and getting kk per raid with bonus it didnt really take me that long to get k DE especially once the drills were upgraded.  It also helps that there are a bunch of extra elixir upgrades to do now barracks and DSF which will consume builders for a longer time.,ClashOfClans,d4jcsi2,2,t5_2usfk

8058504,0,t1_d4lrwzo,Just about any TH can be  or  starred with barch so if you come across one hit it.  A big part of barch is how you use it tho.  When I was barching Id run  jumps and the rest lightning.  Save the lightning if you end up short of  or if the town hall is really low on health.  Next you just want to evaluate if you should hit the base hard from one side or surround the base.  Most boxy bases with everything inside get wrecked if you hit from one side.  Hell Ive two starred boxy max THs in war with all barbarians even in CC just for fun hitting from one side.  Sometimes one freeze is good if you find yourself diving the core fairly often but infernos arent usually too big of an issue for barch especially single target.,ClashOfClans,d4luon1,1,t5_2usfk
8058681,0,t3_4pk0m6,Most of the ths have recently latched onto mass bowler if yours are maxxed you shouldnt have much trouble getting a decent attack in even with your low heroes. There are loads of strategy videos out there a quick online search for something like th mass bowler should yield what you want. Unfortunately your heroes are far too low for most of the other attack strategies to be effective so I would say  stars is out of the question besides with a little luck. You can still get a fairly easy  star with a valk attack though and Id recommend checking out Powerbangs video on the vaby drag strategy.,ClashOfClans,d4lvef3,3,t5_2usfk

8256029,0,t1_d59afab,I started with a very very similar clan dynamic to yours. The key is convincing the smart dedicated players that they should be the ones using more engineered bases even if its just thx. to make up for the people they know and work with and that they dont want to bench but who may have prioritized defense too early for their attack power. A strong th. can make up for a max defense th with  heroes. A strong th. can make up for a full th with  heroes. In general a few thx.s can more than make up for a few maxed defenselow offense accounts and give you a balanced lineup despite the mistakes that a few members made with their build path. Its really just about making sure that at the very least the smart players in your clan understand how matchmaking really works and how to manipulate it over time even if on aggregate its just to cancel out what less thoughtful members did with their accounts.Ultimately though very very few clans are going to be able to be full of completely engineered accounts and in my experience the best way to avoid the most engineered clans is simply to war with accounts that took a few years to build ths and ths with a few ths thrown in too. The biggest problems Ive seen with facing engineered lineups occur when a clans number one is still a th. It takes less than a year for a dedicated player to max defense for th. Honestly it takes about  months if you just keep builders busy the whole time. That is not much time at all to create an engineered account exactly how you like it. I have a  month old th. with  heroes and with the prevalence of goblin knife my heroes could probably be even higher. I could easily see a more devoted player having  heroes in six months perhaps with the help of some gems but I dont think its an absurd premise or anything I dont even use goblin knife and people in my clan that use it rake in like k de a day. Playing at a war weight that allows many of those accounts to be in war against you can put you at huge risk of a brutal matchup.By contrast somebody with a full th account presumably having maxed th defense first at the very least is most likely extremely attached to their account and wants to use it and it probably took them over two years to build it to the way that it is. The best way not to get screwed by engineering is to fight wars at a war weight that doesnt provide much opportunity for recently engineered accounts. A max offense engineered th either took years of dedication or would cost thousands of dollars in gems which is why you pretty much never see them and if you do its only one or two per clan. And even when you do see them a few th.s on your side do a pretty damn good job at making up for them so at worst you neutralize the clans that use them and force a clan thats used to winning based on power advantage to instead have to win based on skill.In my experience throwing a few th.s into a lineup that is otherwise full of mature accounts allows us to be matched against clans that have equally mature accounts. Theres only so engineered an account can be if it needs to be matched with a max th and realistically theres only so much impact a defenseless account can have in a war against us unless it is incredibly powerful like  heroes powerful. Were still going to three star all your ths and half your ths so a defenseless account that three stars a th is only marginally useful against us while I could see it being devastating if your whole lineup is ths.I guess that was a long way of agreeing and at the same time disagreeing with your premise. Our war win streak is  right now but it really does seem like were at the point that even really tough matchups are just coinflips its not like were running into clans that we just cant beat and the tougher matchups come maybe once or twice out of every ten wars. Even a small amount of engineering can go an incredibly long way if all the good players in your clan are on the same page.,ClashOfClans,d59k6iq,2,t5_2usfk

8347457,0,t3_4tujzs,I am a TH. and I have to have a DGB and a TGB triple giant bomb to ensure that I dont get tripled by these.  Its pretty effective since I have yet to be tripled since I put them in three weeks ago though I was only tripled once before that.In my opinion the problem is that base design is just slower to catch up to the new attack strategies.  For example when hogs first came out they were absurdly powerful.  The only defense against them was to build a hog ring to make them circle the base while under xbow fire and miss the TH.  Now there are circle bases that make bowlers and valks tricky.  There are other bases that make miners tricky.  They arent perfect but before doing too many tweaks Id like to give the defense meta time to catch up.,ClashOfClans,d5kzh6m,3,t5_2usfk

My TH mass miner attacks typically use  miners and then some funneling troops but this video makes me want to reduce the funneling troops and increase the miners.

Out of inertia I have been taking a jump and a freeze but more heal like in the video might work better.Any suggestions for a CC when miner donations are not available?  If nothing else I can have my alt feed hogs to help with the back end I suppose but it doesnt take long for that to get expensive.  I like giants because they are cheap and tanky and simple to fill by one person but they are not so good at proceeding down the side of a base.Giant healer and  wiz could be interesting for a funnel one side CC comp.,ClashOfClans,d5rhcgt,1,t5_2usfk

8537009,0,t1_d68ltq9,I must admit your first idea is really good. Early ths had this built into the cc size and the next strongest th troop in mind th cant hold cc drags th cant hold cc pekkas or golems th cant hold hounds but this system breaks down at th with bowlers and miners. One thing to consider is this means no cc hogs for th and lower and they will have to rely on cc loons for real firepower. Your second and third points are reasonable and theres not much to say about them. I dont want to see pekkas being too strong though because a large number of skillless noobs still gowipe and they should not be able to  star with it vs a th.I have to disagree with your fourth point though. A baby drag that isnt enraged is already like half of a normal dragon and if it is by itself it does close to a full dragons damage. I think baby drags are pretty well balanced. Lower size would be way too good.,ClashOfClans,d68oybk,2,t5_2usfk

Like I said in another comment if you are attacking  TH levels down its just not fun.  But I dont have a problem with an opponent using an engineered base to  star our THs.  If anything it gives our THs an interesting challenge to try to  star a nonstandard base right back.,ClashOfClans,d6c9fyo,2,t5_2usfk

8667030,0,t3_4ybp5p,What do you want to do? Fight the world and war as . on a serious war clan wishing well on SC fixing the MM? If so max out th. If not keep reading.I went to th with lvl  heroes and  lv walls when my lab was more or less done. It was the best decision I made because Im a farmer and I plan to max after I stop playing catch up I will max th except walls on the end of january If I keep on scedule and SC doesnt break anything on the next couple updates.That said Ive been focusing on the lab  my strategy involves never having an idle lab and since Im a farmer I focus heavily on defense I have lvl  infernos and my freeze spell is lvl neglected valks going to lvl .... Keep in mind that th lab takes almost  year. I have  builder for walls  builders for defenses and  builders set aside for heroes  a couple days I dont have heroes but  builders are set aside for catching up. I will max the builder upgrades before I finish the lab upgrades even with a couple idle builders nowadays. That is how long the lab takes.The bare minimum for a th would be lvl  walls and  heroes but if you dont farm boosted i.e. you could regret that.On lab you need flavor of the month war troops you plan to use pink elixir spell dark spells you donate lvl  goblins lvl  giants and other farming troops you use. Everything else has its uses watch out for eq spell you will want it either lvl  for wall breaking or decent but the reality is if you dont war you can farm on th with lvl goblins lvl  jump max rage and nearmax wall breakers source Ive upgraded my infernos to  dragon to max and Im on schedule regarding DE using just thatIf you like to stay on higher leagues every bit of defense helps. If you want to stay on lower leagues and drop infernos early lvl  walls are enough to make some attackers skip you. If you plan to go . and stay on a higher league GL... As . you can have lvl walls and people will  star you if you have loot because you dont have infernos no matter where you hide.Some lvl  walls around the innermost layer of the base are very helpful but they dont worth staying at th imo. Just get rid of all the elixir upgrades on th early and drop elixir on walls.I stay at crystal  or under it depends where the trophy droppers put me. Nowadays I farm between  cups. Infernos   lvl walls did the trick very well. Im a few months in the Th and my DE storage was destroyed only a couple times but sometimes it isnt hit for months even showing a k dark offer because I have lvl walls to drop one resource aka elixir which paired with infernos makes people skip.If you plan to max walls on th I dont I plan to get all of them to lvl I will let the lvl walls for when I catch up with everyone else getting well over  lvl  walls  or all of them  at th would be a very good idea.Even if Im not a maxer Ill go to th with lvl heroes and the useful lab done shields purchase with gem while the th lab is upgrading  k de for  if they dont nerf them  max bowlers at day . After that I plan to attack using DE heavy comps  that is why Ill max heroes and the majority of dark spells I dont use at th.Tl Dr Having a clear idea of what you plan to do will answer your question not what we are doing.

However in the case of exceptionally poor attacks that do less than  destruction or for Chiefs who neglect to bring their Town Halls inside and get sniped an automatic minute Village Guard period will activate to give shieldless defenders a chance time to rearm traps reload their defenses and request defending troops.

8862996,0,t3_51mxmk,IMO  healers is way overkill for TH. You might be able to to get away with that at TH still a TH so I wouldnt know.My personal goto strategy depending on the base is a miniqueen walk cc bowlers and then hogs. healers  wizards  golem  hogs CC max bowlers  jump  rage  heal  poison. Start the queen walk with the intention of taking out  defenses walking towards the enemy queen without having the enemy queen engage yours. Once she starts getting close to the walla cluster of trash buildings drop the CC. Drop the golem kind of away from the CC to draw extra fire  wizards in behind to clear other trash then wb in to open up layer . Now drop the king and use the jump to get into a large compartment or a good cluster of small compartments. Once the king is at half health use his ability should be taking out enemy queen at this point. Poison the CC and rage on the queenbowlers when necessary. If the Queens ability is needed use it but it shouldnt be necessary at this point if done correctly. When a majority of the defenses in the core are firing on your kill squad start your hogs. I typically send in about  at the first group wait a bit  on the next defense over preheal over the next several defenses then send in the final . The last heal should be able to cover just about all of the remaining defenses if you didnt lose a ton of hogs to double giants bombs. Drop that last wizard after your first group of hogs to start clean up early and you should be good to go.,ClashOfClans,d7d7h94,15,t5_2usfk

9144860,0,t3_55jn1x,The current meta for highend TH triples is BoNer attacks. The problem is its difficult to get inside with a  troop kill squad and get an Inferno on these anti setups. And if your KS dies off with an intact core of  infernos some xbows and Teslas youre gonna have a hard time getting  miners through it no matter how many spells you have. So I see  options You can beef up the kill squad on your BoNer moving towards something like  golems  bowlers and some funnel troops which leaves like  total miners and a heal for the backend. Perhaps shift it even further KSheavy if youd like.Another option is to go old school with a valk heavy army. Sometimes a QW can set up a heavy valk army well other times it isnt necessary. Have a plan for the CC and then look for spots where max hogs or loons can come in on the backside. Something like  hogs can make a big difference for valks trying to push through the backend  layers of walls. ,ClashOfClans,d8b6d1l,5,t5_2usfk

9196445,0,t1_d8hoebk,In each barrack I do  giants  wall breakers and the rest gobs. I alternate using  heal and two jump with  heal a rage and a jump. Both spell sets do well. I actually made my funnel using my gobs taking out collectors that may distract the gobs from going into the base. Get giants into the first main compartments with wall breakers drop the jump to get to the core  finger drop gobs and use the heals to keep them alive. I had a lot of failures but most were because of a random giant bomb or failing to get enough collectors to funnel. My buddy just kinda spams everything and hopes for the best while I put a little more thought into it. Goblin knife is an amazing strategy but it can and will fail if you dont put a tiny bit of thought into it.

But you will surely triple him easily or perhaps even a guy higher on the ladder.A lot of THX. plans call for some upgrades e.g. the air defenses GBs and teslas at TH. just so an attacker basically has to be a level above you to get the triple.Case in point  I am a TH. with almost maxed heroes.  I can triple ANY TH fairly easily.

9514200,0,t3_5b4sw8,What level is your AQ?  If you have a strong AQ  then Queenwalk into a GiBagish attack with  healers works great.  I just went TH a week ago and heres a comp that Ive been using all the time that allows me to hit storages or collectors depending on whats available  Healers I initially drop  and drop the th if an air mine takes one out  AQ Lvl   BK Lvl    Giants Lvl    Archers Lvl    Barbs Lvl    Gobs Lvl    Wiz Lvl    WBs Lvl    Minions Lvl  CC Giants work wellSpells are at least  Heal  Rage  Jump and then mix and match whatever you want for the rest. It was too frustrating to find good bases to hit up in Masters and Ive dropped to what I think is the absolute sweet spot in Crystal   Gold .  If storage raiding Start by walking your Queen away from XBows and ADs as much as possible then set an edge with the Giants trim the edge with wiz and archers or minions if theyre more efficient wallbreak in.  Then drop a jump that leads to the core and follow behind the giants with BK all the barbs and then gobs.  If you rage heal and Iron Fist that parade and they go right to the core they will smash most cores even if theres an inferno or two in there and youll get most resources too.  If collector raiding Drop a giant or two near each collectors and follow up with some combination of gobs archers minions AQ or whatever is most efficient for the situation.  If theres a nice straight line of external full collectors you can also just Queenwalk right down the line and get them all.  Id advise not to drop your heroes for the first couple of weeks while you get on your feet.  Im sure Id be failing a lot more if I didnt have both each raid. ,ClashOfClans,d9lttf0,1,t5_2usfk

Maybe there were enough of them to push you over some threshold.What is your clan makeup like?  Being  would increase your chances of matching a full  because lots of clans war with a single  on top.  Does your clan have any high offense engineered accounts offense more than one level higher than their war map placement would suggest?  Are there other . in your clan who are also matching s simultaneously?My . has been in  wars now and has matched a . or a  every time.  My super . with k war weight and THish offense usually draws a full  with infernos which is a fair match because sometimes I fail to  them and sometimes they fail to  me.In our current war that just started we slightly panicked at the war map but now feel relieved our rushed  two early . and reducedoffense  are facing up against  . with both sides having some engineered bases lower down with inconsequential offense defenseless TH dont win wars and our side has a hero level advantage.  So if our top attackers dont make mistakes we can get a perfect score against them and for them to do the same to us theyll have to  star an inferno base.

There isnt one strategy that will work on all bases and some bases are especially weak to certain things or have ways you can exploit them. The skill is in being able to determine a bases weakness and executing an attack that exploits that weakness. Ultimately there are  ways you can go about this. One is you can pick a base and stare at it considering each possible way to attack it until you determine which way you think will work the best. Alternatively you could choose an attack you want to use and then look for a base that is weak to that attack type. I think the first way is best at growing your overall skill as a player but the second way might be best for arranged wars where your main goal is to guarantee you bring  stars home for your team and improving yourself isnt the main concern in the short term. ,ClashOfClans,dautnyj,5,t5_2usfk

9958703,0,t3_5i57ni,What has not been explained to OP yet is how to know your defensive war weight.OP if you look at the gold total of all the storages and TH on WAR DAY you will get the war weight number. You can also get this by playing a replay of a war attack it will be the gold available in the replay. Or you can get it by letting someone scout your base in an FC and adding up the gold in the storages and TH.This is only your defensive war weight. It does determine the order of the bases on the war map. However it is not the full story of how clans are matched. Your total war weight includes your offense including heroes spells and troops. That is your total contribution to the clan war weight. In addition many are commenting that SC is using performance metrics such as average destruction and average stars gained by the clan to handicap the matchmaking process. I know that is more than what you asked but I did not want anyone to have the misconception that war matchmaking was based solely on defense.,ClashOfClans,db5n7v2,3,t5_2usfk

The coolest thing about this game IMO is that everyone can play it how they want there really is no right and wrong way.That being said I wouldnt advise gemming troops as it isnt a very efficient way to spend gems. Raid for the loot start and upgrade then while that troop is upgrading save loot for the next upgrade. At TH hogs are a major part of a lot of war army compositions so thats what I would work on first. ,ClashOfClans,dbd8b48,1,t5_2usfk

We war pretty much nonstop.  Our win percentage is around .We enjoy teaching learning and trying out new strategies.  Being active in chat is not required although most of us are.  Being an adult is not required but do bring some maturity.  We bust each others chops just dont be an asshole.  While we have simple but serious war protocols we dont take very much else seriously.  Cussing is encouraged.  As war is our focus we require you to be in the first war you are eligible for when you join.  Upgrading heroes spell factories or having personal circumstances are the only good reasons for missing war.  We expect you to follow our war plan see below use both attacks and to make your best possible attack.  No skimping on war armies!  War donations should be maxed troops.  We encourage people to accept anything when not in war or practicing to allow our lower members a chance to donate and to not tax those who can give max troops.War Plan First attack is your mirror unless altered by Moo or a co before war starts. Second attack is against someone in your town hall range you can three star who has been already attacked but not three starred.  Do not hit someone elses mirror before  hours has passed.  If everyone is three starred practice against a difficult base. Any base that hasnt been hit in the first  hours is fair game so you might lose your mirror if you dont get your attack in.Come check us out!  We hope you enjoy our clan but if you dont I hope you find one you like somewhere else.  Clash on!When requesting mention reddit.

10255036,0,t1_dc68fhw,gtIndeed and you can reread those comments again if you like.  So is my form of engineering cancerous? Im not sure what you are agreeing to. Are you saying your form if engineering is the . route? If not weve been through this. Hard engineering is cancerous. A lack of skillknowledge to utilize engineering effectively may generate competitive wars but that does not justify hard engineering. Its like saying Im giving you a fair shoteven though I start with a better gunbecause I dont know how to use this gun correctly.gtNote that I am specifically not including . in thatYou openly admitted earlier that you think .s are engineered and from previous comments it seems like you considered your opponents engineered because they have . bases.gtIf you field a nodef account in your war even just one then you dont get to complain about engineered clans because you are one.  Im not sure why you keep bringing this up. Isnt this irrelevant to the discussion atm?gtI dont know who the majority of engineered clans face.  All I can provide is my data point and since the October update we almost always match another clan with engineered bases.If you say a clan is engineered just because it has . bases which you seemed to be doing in earlier comments then we are talking about two different things. In that case most people on this sub seem to disagree with you. Most people agree that real engineered clans still have an advantage. Im not sure why your clan would be an exception because we know the algorithm isnt perfect yet. Again if what you said is true then there would be little point to engineered clans post october update. But the mere fact that they still exist opposes what you said about  matches for engineered clans being fair and competitive.gtBy truly engineered are you excluding clans like mine that have a k TH with full offense but rushed heroes a TH with reduced offense that weighs like a TH multiple nodef or seminodef and multiple bases with offense well above their defense?Maybe your clan isnt optimally engineered but based on what you said now yes I would say your clan fits the engineered stereotype that this thread is talking about. But let me say that your clans top bases only using air is a pretty extreme handicap. Because your clan handicapped itself your clan wars being competitive is not a good example of engineered clan war matchups being overall competitive.gtI think you dont understand that optimally engineered clans as you describe them are rareIf you read my other comments on this thread you would know that I openly stated that engineered clans are rare.gtIt sounds like for you to consider a base to be an optimal engineered base it has to have TH offense.  When you complain about engineering should I mentally insert with TH offense everywhere?I merely used th as an example. Please dont put words in my mouth. Based on this I dont think you understand the point I was trying to make.gtBuilding a clan that can have a  TH level defense advantage  to  is really hard. A war doesnt just rely on number one. Its the top few bases that matter. If you think I was talking about just number one we clearly are not on the same page and you clearly missed the point if my example. Sorry I probably sound very aggressive and demeaning at this point but I dobt mean to disrespect you. Im trying to be blunt to avoid writing whole essays.gtThats a definite advantage but its not an unwinnable war and I dont think its cancerous.Why seek a definite clear advantage at all? And there are times when wars can be unwinnable. They are rare but the fact that engineered clans make this a possibility also makes them cancerous.Edit I think the best way for us to be on the same page is if I join your clan and inspect your war matchup for ten min. That way theres no reason for me to doubt what you are saying,ClashOfClans,dc6gq8m,1,t5_2usfk

DE once per month on the other hand is a drop in the bucket.  Between those extremes is each persons personal dividing line.  If you build a golem in response to every request how soon will the next request come?  Before or after your personal dividing line?  How about once other people notice that someone is filling golem requests?Like war pushing trophies is different.  I expect clans that support trophy pushers to donate high end troops regularly just as I expect clans that attempt to win wars to donate high end troops for war attacks.It sounds like we are in complete agreement.

10663394,0,t1_ddfpxoh,The standard way that we the hardcore community who knew what we were doing all used to build bases back in the day before clan wars was to max everything at each TH level and then drop all of the new defenses on day  farming like mad at TH in order to have the gold to do both infernos.  Its what farmers who dont war pretty much do now and its also what people who are not aware of war weight do without knowing of any reason not to.So Id say the standard way to build bases was to max everything at each level defense first.  And yes doing that will result in getting crushed in clan wars.  Before clan wars the game was basically a base building game with raiding thrown in to acquire resources faster.  Now there is a competitive aspect within the reach of more than just the people who have the time to sit in the clouds trophy pushing.Some say that . is the new standard and thats fair.  I consider . to be a very mild form of engineering because its taking war weight into account when deciding if and when to build things.,ClashOfClans,ddfuj2b,1,t5_2usfk

No ones arguing that.As someone who is a scientist who studies crows I am telling you specifically in science no one calls ravens crows. If you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either. Theyre not the same thing.If youre saying crow family youre referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens.So your reasoning for calling a raven a crow is because random people call the black ones crows? Lets get grackles and blackbirds in there then too.Also calling someone a human or an ape? Its not one or the other thats not how taxonomy works. Theyre both. A raven is a raven and a member of the crow family. But thats not what you said. You said a raven is a crow which is not true unless youre okay with calling all members of the crow family crows which means youd call blue jays ravens and other birds crows too.

10826570,0,t3_5utai4,Farming at TH means you cant attack THs and you only get  of what you used to get at TH from other THs.  But you can still goblin knife at TH against infernos and there are plenty of dead bases in Crystal for elixirgold.  So I tend think farmings not really the issue.You main gains in war are  more troop space including the CC and max valks along with bowlers outside the CC.  If you dont upgrade defense too much youll continue to be matched with max THs though the matchmaking will tend to find engineered clans more often in my experience.TH is mostly a  star game at the moment attacking other THs that is.  TH is a lot of fun with laloon but its not as powerful at TH without the warden and level  loons.  If you want big bang heroes you have  more levels at TH available.  May as well finish em in my opinion.  While you can get  of the DE from other THs.,ClashOfClans,ddwon8b,1,t5_2usfk

I didnt say either way was right or wrong its a simple fact that some people wont war without both heroes and some will war while missing one or both. If its right or wrong to do is only determined by your clans attitude and rules. We have a war roster that allows the higher s to just clean up s and early s if they dont have both heroes. As long as our top guys and most of the higher s have both heroes we do fine with a couple guys missing a hero or two.

You need to drop your loons surgically so with  going to each defense on the side youre attacking and save a few loons for the nd side of the attack also deployed surgically.  With  minutes left in your attack you had already deployed every single loon and they were all clumped up on one defense... this is an incredibly inefficient situation to be in and its the reason you got a .Also its clear that you dont understand the mechanics or purpose of a queen walkchange at all.  You said I dont usually use  healers which means... youre usually doing some kind of weird hybrid queenbkhealer kill squad... I guess?   It was also clear from your early AQ ability and general commentary about the amount of damage shed be taking that you hadnt done this much or at least didnt understand how to handle it.  For reference  she would have been golden with a single race against a level aq and  point defense  no BK support or ability needed.   Start queen walking on every farming raid andor watching war attacks that start with a queen walk until you get a handle on it.  Queen walks are super powerful but theyre also  troop space in healers.  Thats almost TWO golems work of camp space.  If you dont know how to use it smartly its totally not worth the troop space.Lastly your Laloon army comp is way off  hounds and  loons is biased way too far toward hounds.

11291375,0,t3_60mnea,I use  giants  wbs a few archers and rest gobs. Use  heal  rage  jump. CC giants.Why so many wbs? For those full collector bases that have them spread around a base behind  layer of walls. Or getting them full drills not in the path of your primary knife attack path. Why so many giants? st to tank for wbs to open st layer of walls. You dont need to use a single archer to funnel gobs just use gobs to set funnel. Now  important role of giants is to push toward DE and tank but biggest benefit is setting off gb spots b gobs get there. Be patient with gobs or  of them will die in  sec. The raid itself is short. Spend extra time at the beginning reading the base and predicting goblin pathing and best place for jump. I use archers to pick off collectors outside of defense range.

11585734,0,t1_dg8iq91,you cant screw with an engineered base. i have always upgraded walls heroes and lab first when going to a new th lvl. then when thats done i do all my defenses. with max troops and  builders it doesnt take all that long to max the defenses and move on to the next th. a base with max troops and heroes and no defenses could catch itself up easily in mnths. the difference is that with the lab you can only do one troop at a time and that takes forever the heroes take  days to upgrade most of thier upgrade tree which takes forever but with  builders you can do defenses pretty quick. it took me  days to upgrade my th ads to lvl days to farm enough gold and  days upgrade time thats one every . days and thats for max level and i still had a builder left. so the engineerd guys would be down for a few months then come back with big defenses to go with their offenses,ClashOfClans,dg990iz,0,t5_2usfk

11708218,0,t3_6705zq,I like the idea of a minimum set war weight per TH lvl. So TH will guarantee to match THs THs with THs and so on. For those arguing that this will spend the end of .s let me share my experience as a .. I have never been matched to TH since upping to TH. This maybe because I maxed TH and got my queen to  pretty quick. But being a . meant that I pulled in err lets say not so good TH s...You know the guys who max their defenses asap and have teen heroes. They usually struggle to  a maxed  and I get a chance to accustom myself with th attacks I find an actual war raid is different from friendly challenges but others may disagree. So how will this change if there is a minimum set war weight per TH level? IMO it may only affect the extreme .s  maxed lab and not too much either.
