2030,0,t1_ceeo14c,You get no flashy pass bonus. It just a regular pass. If it was thrown good and is considered a good pass youll revive good pass if it was awful and lead to it going out of bound bad pass and turnover. There isnt any benefit of throwing a flashy pass. You dont get extra for it. The play just might look nicer with it. ,NBA2k,ceeo407,2,t5_2s84e

105621,0,t1_ceqdid2,I use the shot stick to shoot.  Usually if its an open lane I drive to the basket holding RT and either hold the stick towards the basket for a normal dunk or hold away from the basket to do a more entertaining dunk.  I have  dunk maybe ..I cant check at the moment and Sprite Posterizer as well.  Could it be a distance issue maybe?  Im relatively new but I start holding the shot stick at about FT line distance and its almost always a dunk unless Im being super contested.  If not that could it be the direction you are pressing the stick?  Most of my dunks come driving straight from the top of the key as opposed like the corners.,NBA2k,ceqgfmc,1,t5_2s84e

126180,0,t3_1viqmy,I went a more boring way and started MyCareer as a defensive center specializing in only blocks and offdef rebounds. This way I was locked to a position and can study everyone around me. Hold your left trigger L? to turn on all over defense aka defensive lock on and make sure to be between your defender and the basket. Be patient and dont jump for every shot but work in your timing so jump at the same time to contest the shot. Blocks are just icing. On offense try using screens O? to let your teammates get around their defender and then get in the post opposite of where they will shoot. Just imagine that every shot they make will miss and bounce in the direction they shot it. This will get you rebounds. Use Square instead of the shot stick because you will be doing layups  of the time early on. Use Triangle to jump for the ball. After you get that game down put points into short range shots layups and shooting in traffic. The teammates  pass you the ball and then you can rush in and get a two in the paint. with a leaning shot you will likely draw a foul and get you free throws.k is the first basketball game Ive gotten into since NBA Jam SNES. In a month  I used this to understand the fundamentals of my position know where I could stand as a teammatechemistry and contribute without being a hog. Its harder to understand if you play as an entire team at first now I can play any position and have fun not so sure about online yet Edit turn on Cpu play calling. It will give you an idea of where you need to be and know the names of the plays the offdef will be running ,NBA2k,cesstbh,3,t5_2s84e

I notice it with other  foot Centers I play against as well I normally out rebound them with players like Jerry West and Steph Curry.

Have different cutscenes in MyCareer for how you played in a particular game I dont want to hit a gamewinner and be told I choked or shoot  free throws and be told I need to practice my FT shooting. Seconding that the Park be completely removed or at least make it an option next to instant blacktop matchmaking.  The ability to create our own faces as well as have the template faces. Some people dont care about their player looking completely realistic and would rather make their own face but keep the templates for those who want to use them.  More modes. K has barely anything to do offline aside from MyCareer quick game and Blacktop. Im not a fan of MyGM so Im not left with too much to do offline on this game this game is in desperate need of more modes.  Increase VC payout  Lower prices. There should be more of a reward for actually being good at the game not to those who have money. People who might not want to play MyCareer which is the highest paying mode would be grinding their ass off to make VC for one MyTeam pack.

And then you can probably get a GPU and power supply that can give you pfps consistently. Your sports game library will shrink considerably. Pretty much only FIFA and k. If youre gonna game on a PC youll be able to use a controller a lot but not always. So a gaming keyboard or at least mouse become a necessity. I have a gaming rig an Xbox One a  and a ps. Im grabbing the PS when I see some Christmas deals. Xbox One for sports games Xbox live is better other than the free games the controller is better suited for them the audio on Xbox live is no joke probably x better than on PS. Graphics are better on PS slightly PS is definitely more portable too if you move your console often. Id get the Madden  bundle from Xbox.,NBA2k,cjsxebg,2,t5_2s84e

2302485,0,t1_clwai4y, Ive heard about some people just buying contracts cheap from the game. But since I have been saving mine in the AH and adding to my Collection when I need them I havent had to buy them yet so I dont know for sure. If youre making MT by selling them on AH then buying them from the game more power to you! I barely touch the last  positions on my bench. So for the challenges when you need  from a certain team I usually have them sitting in those slots. I have one backup for each starter and my PFs and Cs can usually play both positions. So right now I have Drummond and Ibaka starting with Blake Griffin and Embiid off the bench each capable of playing either big man spot. Ive had good luck with injuries so far so I havent really touched the th th and th spots of my roster too much.I think the biggest thing is how you play. I dont use my bigs too much except for rebounds so they dont use up as much energy shooting the ball. But if you run some of your offense through them especially someone like Dirk then it wouldnt hurt to stay deep. I run a lot with my PGs so I make sure I have at least  PGs on my team with Lance Stephenson and Tim Hardaway Jr able to point if needed.,NBA2k,clway85,1,t5_2s84e

Of course I get called for offensive interference. Its also annoying when the computer is celebrating after they make a basket or they have fallen down and are getting back up.

2941186,0,t3_2tu9dq,Offense post play  Its all about the fake.  You want to post up the guy find some open space then fake a shot and drive.  Or fake a drive and shoot.  As soon as he bites If he jumps or moves to the side you do the other thing.  But the other key to being a good post player is knowing when to bail.  If I try a couple fakes and he doesnt bite Ill kick it out to one of the guards.  Dont be that guy in the post that says Im taking it to the hoop no matter what!Defensive post play  Always keep between your man and the hoop.  It takes some feel but you will learn to do so.  Quick tip if he moves right dont move right with him move right and back.  You do give a little ground but it makes it almost impossible for him to get past you.  Move slightly into him and LT to body up.  And then its the opposite of what I said in the offensive post play.  Now your job is to not bite on the fake.  Remember you dont have to block his shot... Just being there will make his shot low percentage.  Usually the only time Ill go for the block is if hes posted up in the key and he does one or two fakes in the key and gets near the  second violation.  When he does that I know he either has to shoot or kick it out so if I go for the block I either get it or he kicks it out and I dont give up an easy basket.Other than that its just practice.,NBA2k,co2fc74,3,t5_2s84e

I really dont wanna get rid of any of these players lol! But I should upgrade someone I guess maybe Ill make my bench longer. But what big purchase is totally worth it? frobe? Magic? I guess my weakest position is Payton at PG but dude I swear he plays like MJ. Then if I bump him to bench I guess Id just cell cp who I also like.

Also not one line but i love it how when i do a boring two handed dunk on a fast break they go berserk and be suprised that i did something that difficult in a game. Next play KD does a windmill baseline reverse dunk and they completely disregard it and keep talking about how Ibaka has improved his shooting.Steve Kerr sometimes says i think its after dunks I dont know what the score is but..... Dude its literally your job to know. Youre calling the game. EditX is having a great game. He has  points and one assist. He is really in control of this gameTalking about weather the Thunder is KD or WBs team.

3565408,0,t1_cpyn4wl,Copying and pasting from my other responsegt The real beauty of the method though is that if when you common bench youre still in the same tier as you are when youre at full strength then youll get weaker opponents but still have the same rewards. For example when Im at full strength I face other players who carry lineups that are pretty much full of stars and legendary pros. However when I common bench I get matched with players who might have one star and the rest are epic pros and maybe even a single legendary.gt It works like this because not all players in the same tier are eligible to be matched with each other. This is because of how large the tier bar is for seasons. Theres a massive disparity in the quality of decks that barely make it into a tier and decks that pretty much fill up the bar of a tier and are one good card away from the next tier up. It obviously wouldnt be fair to match up those two decks because one would win every time. So there are a bunch of invisible arbitrarily defined minitiers within each normal tier. So if you drag the quality of your team down by putting  commons on your bench where theyll never get used youll face opponents that you can absolutely destroy because theyll have  good cards and youll have  very good cards and since only  ever get played youll smash them. As long as you remember to play enough Quick Games to get the energy cards itll be fine.,NBA2k,cpyolk9,1,t5_2s84e

Coach called for a scrimmage because he said he was disappointed in us taking jump shots instead of driving in the paint. However I was top dog in the driver seat. Most of the points I scored were in the paint. My next point is after scrimmage coach threatened my spot in the lineup. How can he threaten the  player league.My final point is that Head Coach Doc Rivers complimented my rebounding efforts in the locker room after the game. Why is the assistant coach tripping.

With that being said everyone has their gripes with K so Ill cover the most common problems that I think everyone loaths Lack of playmakingspeed caps on players over . There should be no reason that a  small forward is faster than a  point guard.   More competent AI teammates in myCareer games. You shouldnt have to constantly score  PPG just to stay in the game.  A more refined Got Next system. I think its more interesting than traditional matchmaking but there should be an option to play against similar ranked opponents  Refining park affiliations. There should be a mode outside of The Stage where you can play with your friends who belong to another park. How about  the Rec at least?  Can we get some sock height in here?

It would seem that way if Singler is your best player. Or are you trying to play Domination and cant win?  You should be playing Domination as you learn how to play.  As you win youll get morebetter players.But if your problem is winning in the early games of Domination then the issue is fundamental skill at the game.  Nothing to do but play and concentrate on improving.  It helps to watch tutorials on YouTube covering basic game mechanics and to just practice stuff like offensive post moves and running plays to get shooters open.  Its very hard to hit contested shots and if youre expecting to just catch the ball and go up for a jump shot time it more or less correct and for the ball to go in...its not really that simple.,NBA2k,ctcvbbj,1,t5_2s84e

I get on average maybe just  of those a game. People in the nba dont sit there and reach every possesion which is the reason why they get callwd often.

AD was a insane athlete and a transcendent defender coming into the draft and it wasnt until MUCH later that he became a offensive threat. Curry and Harden were much better scorers coming into the draft. So what im saying is AD starts with the lowest rating but grows by far the fastest. Further more who cares if it is OP?

Curry is harder to guard because hes crafty and can shoot from half court..Easily would have helped them get over . Durant is not a better defender and either is curry.. and I think harden is way closer than westbrook to lebron. And the closest player consistently would be Davis.

Mygm is basically you playing GM controlling just your controlled team and you cant force trade or anything like that its more realistic. If you wanna make easy super teams I suggest Myleague because you can trade for anyone you want.

Im pretty sure the really good cards are only available through MyTeam and from the looks of it there will much more cards to collect than before and with more versions. Im thinking its just a way for MyCareer fans to earn decent cards for MyTeam so that they arent forced to use a terrible team by the time they decide to try something new by going into MyTeam late. Of course MyTeam players will still have better rosters but Career fans wont have some silver player as their best and then have to grind Dom to have a halfway decent team.,NBA2k,cv20sgz,2,t5_2s84e

Like in the last k you could pick different answers and get different responses that affect medias perception of you and team chemistry even so slightly. I thought this year would be an improvement on that where it gets developed further into different cutscenes.I guess I wouldnt have minded it as much if the story wasnt so lame.

It gets tedious if you play every game of course but if you never do it starts to feel kind of like youre just looking at numbers and spreadsheets rather than managing a team. I like to test out how players work on the team when you trade for them etc. Thats just imo though everyone prefers slightly different things. Definitely like to play mostall of the playoffs or at the very minimum elimination games. I think its also more fun to play with teams in relatively bad or at least middling positions than good ones at the beginning.

5331150,0,t1_cvt3pof,The real problem is those few popular YouTubers like Smoove and Jesser have a TON of income to drop on those packs because the views from those pack opening videos supplement what they spend. Its not realistic to just do a  million VC opening for  of players. That would cost  on literally virtual players for a game you already paid  for. And even if you do see those huge pack openings they get a few of the best cards the rest are all trash openings. Spending  to open up countless packs and you get less then  great players sometimes worse thats robbery. A normal player who decides to buy  in VC is going to open like  packs and get absoutely nothing and now they are out  and bitter at k. Its really a terrible model for the long run because people are eventually going to get sick of it and then all k has to rely on is their core game. And their core game has truly not updated in the last  years. Sure some mechanics and stats have changed but nothing groundbreaking for the series. k just needs to step up and do something drastic to make the average player WANT to play again. No one wants to open up a few packs and get rewarded with nothing. Why cant they just improve the overall game and add more to it to increase overall game sales and then reduce their microtransactions so we can actually earn those great cards besides just the AH or opening packs. I want more challenging ways and game modes to earn these cards. MyTeam is supposed to be about collecting players and making the best or most creative team. Not about throwing money at the screen and mindlessly opening packs or hunting on the AH for a snipe. All of my friends didnt even get k because k felt so greedy.

Meanwhile the Cavs guy starts making contested s with Lebron and I find myself down by  with  seconds left run inbounds play Walker runs out to get open I press RBB to pass to him but Batum ends up making a bounce pass instead causing a turnover I lose.

Kevin Love is my PF so when he sets the screen I have him fade for an open  which he seems to make at least  out of . Having so many players that stretch the floor makes for an easy  points in the paint as well so I feel like my offense can win games. I just wish I could get enough points to finish off the Western AllStars in Domination. I keep getting close but Anthony Davis is a pain in the ass and I normally dont get enough FTs to get that bonus.

I didnt mention that anywhere please dont twist my words youre just barking at the wrong tree. And I admit that irritates me too but I just wanted you to understand that its part of the game. And if that is the case try to make yourself useful if that situation does occur Eg. Prepare for offensive boards help set screens so its easier for them this happens in real life all the time as well.  I reckon you shouldnt look down on players who has low I.Q but help them so that their IQ becomes higher and this is what I would wanna teach you or be an example of. The best way to gain respect isnt telling people to respect you like youre doing it herebut to prove it by doing things that gains their respect. So when the time comes when you get the ball show them you can score or pass with less effort than them which is generally the case if they charge intraffic. I agree with the whole teamball idea and I do believe that rating doesnt determine everything but I thought that this game you got pretty lucky from your rating and your IQ isnt as high as you would think it is and its something thats ever improving.Like I said before. I reckon this game was a credit to both you and your team. So share the credits it take all cogs to work a machine effectively. And  assists shows that they played crappy defence or your teammates are great finishers and you know it as much as I do. A isnt hard to get in this game.. especially if youre the one with the ball.

Ronnie even put out a poll asking if the community wanted a code and  or something close to that said yes so it is a vocal minority who thinks that Ronnie isnt that great or that Lockercodes are bad.

Search and youll find someone here posted about how he likes it.I am intrigued but cant conceptualize how it would be anything but really awkward to have a touchpad even with haptic feedback instead of the Right Stick.  Even though I dont normally shoot with RS I do use it periodically usually when I cant use the Shoot button because I need to shoot quickly but Im in an icon selection menu i.e. Icon Passing.I imagine using a touchpad would be awkward.  But maybe not if one gets used to it.

6200254,0,t1_cyudxi1,Well theres  main ways you can get out of games early and still get VC. Play  minutes then foul out though it should be noted that you will of course be subbed out eventually and have to finish your last fouls later potentially after halftime. This is the worst in terms of VC due to how little you play and how much those  fouls are going to hurt your teammate grade but also the quickest and most reliable. Probably the most efficient too for that matter.. Play  minutes start fouling and hope that when you come back in the game that it is both after halftime and your team is up by a good margin in which case you can then just ask to sit out the rest of the game receiving normal VC. This is middle option in terms of VC since youll have fewer turnovers and hopefully therefore a higher teammate grade though its not as reliable since it requires your AI team to be up by blowout numbers without any input from you the player.. Play normal til the half then just ask out if youre up a large enough margin. This is the best in terms of raw VC earned but is the longest and will likely require you to carry the team and thats not necessarily the easiest thing if youre on HoF which you should be if youre just farming VC. And if you choose to do this but have to drop the difficulty to achieve it then it is less efficient than either of the first two.IMO the best option for pure VC farming is to situationally vary between  and . So play  minutes foul til you get benched then if you come in after the half and can ask out ask out. If you come back in and are down or not up by enough to ask out then just finish fouling yourself out.And of course you really need to be on HoF difficulty with  minute quarters if youre going to farm like this. Its a waste to go any lower. ,NBA2k,cyuei0u,0,t5_2s84e

A big reason Steph is so good at shooting is because he can just go freestyle and shit on you but K is to animation heavy and a moving  by Steph Curry is different to amoving  by Ray allen. Try pulling off this in k. Also IRL Steph doesnt care if a defender is close to him hell just shoot it yet in k he will fade like hes dirk if someone is anywhere near him.Same with Rondo hes my favorite player but hes good because of all the passing lanes he sees then the crazy passes and ball fakes he does yet k is so vanilla in that aspect.

6497780,0,t3_44mi0r,I wound up playing a different HOF challenge the all decade one going up against  Jordan. Finally found the secret. Get Murasen or a good post scorer that is strong enough to post up and make FTs. Back your defender to right under the rim give  fakes theyre going to jump. and then either take the foul or the easy finish. CPU took a  point rd quarter lead and made it  right before the fourth started. Every possession in the th i used that trick and won.In summary the key to winning against HOF CPU cheese is to use your own cheese... ROFL. I find it funny because I run plays get good looks and lose. Oh and one more item if you arent an amazing releaser do not even attempt s on HOF. Wide open close to the middle release on  shooters is a B at best a C on average.,NBA2k,czrf3cu,1,t5_2s84e

Best bonus is his rebounding though seems like he comes in and snags like  boards that I otherwise wouldnt get Some downsides  Lateral Quickness still good on D but makes it harder to stay in front of players and cold zones in the corner hell still make em but top of the circle are where hes hot. ,NBA2k,d03op31,4,t5_2s84e

7034146,0,t3_4bz0n5,In Domination your goal should be to get at least  MT each quarter. You get MT bonuses at the end for your foul shot percentage and three shot percentage min  shots so always try to get those in. If you complete a possession without an assist consider that possession a fail. Assists are an easy  MT. If you double that with a post move thats  MT altogether not including the  MT from a made shot or  MT with a dunk. Second chance points give you a very nice bonus of  MT. So ALWAYS make sure to get those points following an offensive rebound. Also getting the  MT from the rebound. Hope this helps. Im not home at the moment or I could probably have checked all the bonuses you receive at the end of the game but I guess you can do that now. Kick some rear!,NBA2k,d1doc85,4,t5_2s84e

7222699,0,t3_4edie8,I had the same problem with Curry. Until I just started releasing his shot early. You have to remember not everyone has the same shot releaseanimation KDs is really quick you should probably just practice shooting around him with him or use him in a gauntlet games for a bit so itll help you get his shot down. KD isnt slow on the game either but if you have a problem with his speed just put a gold shoe on him for  speed. Even if you cant shoot with him hes still able to drive it tremendously well so I dont understand how you cant use him.

No. wise in my experience and this is coming from someone whos in the st seed in RttP more people tend to run smallball rather than  bigs anyways which if thats the case Paul Georges height athleticism and outside scoring are  going to create a mismatch for their PF in one form or another. You could always buy a cheap  shoe boosting it to a  if youre worried about it. Because of height athleticism and really good defensive stats he tends to get in rhythmhot pretty quickly on defense too and when that happens his lowpost defense can bump another  to  points bringing it to a theoretical maximum of  without the shoes and  with the shoes.,NBA2k,d2eu0x1,1,t5_2s84e

7731596,0,t1_d3jum9w,I usually use driving behind the back moves or crossovers to get past my defenders. Ive had a good bit of success with the cross because of the Killer Crossover badge. But Ive noticed that you can get a lot of success with offball cuts. For instance at least one of my bigs usually posts pretty high around the FT line area. You can either use the giveandgo if the gray pass indicator circle is under the man that you want to pass to hold the pass button and let go when you want the ball back. The downsides to that method are that I think the CPU will only hold it for a few seconds and then hell pass the ball even if youre not open and that you dont have complete control of the giveandgo passer. The other thing that you can do is icon pass to a stationary player and cut in frontbehind him using his body to give you a bit is space between you and the defender. The downside to this though is although you can call for the ball you may not get it back. You can also use the pickandroll method depending on your quickness to explode after the screen is made. But on the dribble I like behind the back moves or crossovers. The spin move can be useful but if you spin into someone on accident for instance a help defender you will automatically lose the ball which is why I dont recommend it. You can keep greater control of the ball with behind the backs or crossovers. You can also try the SizeUp thing but I wouldnt recommend cheesing because CPU defenders in MyCareer are usually better than the ones you see in the Park and do a good job of not biting on a lot of those moves.

7857161,0,t3_4mxyof,Height is very important in this game especially for MyPlayers. Your player model is simply bigger. Your shots are less easily contested you rebound more easily you contestblock shots more easily you can pass over defenders too this Im not as sure of but I feel this is true also.Few people know this but speed is highly dependant on leg length so taller players cover more ground if they have the same Speed attribute. I learned this when I saw a hacker in MyPark with very short legs running at a very high pace but covering little ground with them. I guess that was the one time I was thankful for hackers on PC. Thats also why MyTeam players like TMac PG Durant or KAT feel insanely faster than their ratings would indicate.To balance this K instaured this year a system of caps so that generally taller characters are less skilledfast but stronger.,NBA2k,d3z7s4m,3,t5_2s84e

7913789,0,t3_4nohyc,You just started so havent really seen the insane skill level differences between players. Either through MyCareer or purchasing the VC in game currency you should start by upgrading your players attributes get some badges while learning how to play the basics of the game in MyCareer and have a little patience. You cant just pick the game up and expect to be Steph Curry. The game takes some getting used to. I had never played a K game and hadnt played a basketball game since NBA Live  on PS. I picked this game up in mid to late January and decided to start with a big man where your role is better defined. I played almost a full season of MyCareer before going to the park for the first time. Play good team basketball and not hero ball and you will be more likely to get into the flow of the game and find the ways to score that work better for you. Playing team ball will also get people with higher rep to to want to play with you.  You can learn a lot about how to play the game by playing with and against better completion too. Honestly I think starting off as a big man is really helpful. Its easy to understand what to do when your job is basically two to three things defense rebounding and the occasional dunk or layup. When you play like that and do the dirty work unselfishly allowing your teammates to be the ones scoring or otherwise getting the glory in the game people with more experience will want to run with you. Pass the ball a lot dont look for your own shot if its going to be contested at all.  The old saying of passing up a good shot for yourself in order to get a great shot for a teammate is  the path to success in this game imho. Im currently a Legend   wins from L and only occasionally play with anything that isnt my  outside center. I have zero problem finding a squad and have several Ls that I run with on a regular basis. I think the reason that theyre willing to run with me is because of the unselfish style of play that I usually play. The other thing that I have found really helpful is to ask my teammates what I did wrong or how I could improve after a game especially if we lose. If youre not a cocky asshole blaming everybody else for the loss people will often help you out with advice on how to improve. ,NBA2k,d45l2fg,4,t5_2s84e

7980266,0,t3_4oi0cn,gtAll of them probably have fairly easy fixes but for some reason still exist.No offense but when people say this they rarely know what theyre talking about. Im not a game developer but I am a software developer and things arent always as easy as they seem.Were talking about a AAA title which usually entails a complex codebase. Issues the end user thinks are easy fixes usually require much more work on the backend side than they realize. Its not like the developers can toggle a config setting to fix bugs. Its much more complicated because the engine is so indepth.gt The input lag in online play is absolutely intolerable.This is a much more compex issue. It could be one or more of the following IO lag TCPIP lag software latency issue server connectivity issue PP issue.But I dont play online so I havent experienced this. This issue is very common with multiplayer games. If there were an easy fix no games would have this problem. gt k servers are constantly downThere are several reasons why this may be true. No way to tell if its as easy is upgrading servers or changing the fundamentals of their platform.gt Hall of Fame AI isnt smarter... they just make stupidly difficult shots.AI is hard which is why there is an entire field dedicated to it. AI in general isnt smart in this day and age there is still a fundamental P vs NP problem to be solved. So as of now they can only give the illusion of real AI. Which is why the current option is to cheese shots.gt If you miss a free throw its an automatic  on  fast break for the other team.Could be your defensive strategy?gt Three seconds in the paint is called way too often Ive had it called on me two possessions in a row by the same player.Sounds like a defensive issue Ive only had it called once.gt You can draw a charge at half court but its nearly impossible when the other players driving into the paint.SO like a real NBA game? I think you can change this in the options.gt Back court violations are called if you move a millimeter backwards near the half court line.lol sounds like the refs in your games are super accurate. Not sure if this is an issue serious enough to warrant a patch.gt Players slowwalk back on defense after a made basket and the offense will get an easy semitransition layup. a. Players celebrate and pump the crowd up while their man blows past them for a layup.Okay I agree with you here this annoys me to all end. My character will be celebrating a shot doing a stupid dance while the team zooms by for an easy basket.gt Players will sometimes forget how to play basketball when attempting to inbound the ball after a made basket.For me its when my teamates stare at the ball when they should be trying to rebound it. But this issue was in K as well. Not sure how they can address it. gt If you want a pull up jumper after a dribble move a la Jamal Crawford its basically an automatic brick.What mode? How is your characer build.gt In HOF difficulty you cant get past defenders even if youre Kyrie Irving and you have Omer Asik on you.Same issue above with the AI getting harder but not smarter. I think its a fair compromise in regards to current AI possibilites and lack of computer power on consoles.gt Only half the screen is used during timeouts. Why not use the other half to tell me things like the score or time remaining or a box score or something useful besides the bottom half of a timeout huddle?This may be an easy fix. But it may be personal preference.gt HackaShaq isnt an option even though its the most talked about strategy in the NBA.I agree. This should be implemented.gt If you have Russell Westbrook you can go  shooting cuz hell just blow by everyone and dunk it every time.There have always been players like that in these games it is super annoying but I dont know why it happens. Could be an oversight I think they should be able to balance it out.gt Help defense on PnRs is anything but helpful.Could be a defensive strategy issue?gt People on MyTeam consistently have KD Lebron RWB and Kawhi while my best players are Grant Hill and Brandon Knight.I dont play MyTeam.gt That stupidly attractive girl on kTV obviously doesnt give a shit about k.This is an easy fix hire a new actordirectorwriter.gt I always make my MyPlayer bald because Spike Lees story is literally cancer.I like Spike Lee but he doesnt realize we play video games for the gameplay not the story. Especially in a NBA simulator. Short and simple cutscenes is all that is needed everything else is a time waster. I dont care about the generic story cliche characters I want to ball.gt It frustrates me that these are not difficult issues but k wont address them because we keep buying their games and microtransactions so they dont really care. Does anyone else agree or am I being unrealistic?I disagree I think most of these issues cant be easily fixed the developers arent wizards and there is a reason why there have been only a handful of basketball similators.

You should play a season of both and see what you prefer though. Some people prefer more hands on in MyGM and some people like me prefer it to be a little more hands off and be able to just run an organization without dealing with the players.In MyGM you have to deal with the players a lot more and team chemistry. You deal with finances in depth and the whole staff. On top of this you make sure youre winning profiting and planning for the future.In MyLeague you control the league. You can really do anything you want or restrict it like MyGM. What I like is not having to deal with the playersstafffinances to closely.

8207159,0,t3_4rquqa,You cant. Based on purely speculation heres why I think this is the case as well as why you shouldnt fret over it either.  From a purely business perspective they probably wont. By forcing people to play RttP K is essentially creating a correlation into also edging people to wanting the Rewards cards amp packs from each seed advancement. With this in mind I guarantee that K realizes that by creating the correlation I mentioned theyll inevitably get more money through VC purchases of people wanting to upgrade their team by buying VC to buy packs in hopes of getting the Reward cards. TLDR K probably has a team of psychologists who ultimately help them create a landscape that nets them as much free money as possible. Forcing people into RttP falls into this psychological landscape. To put it bluntly without being a dick if youre having a hard time winning just half of your games when the gamemode is at its absolute fairest point AKA when its impossible to have all diamond superteams even if someone could hypothetically use his unrestricted lineup without Ks qualifications through getting to seed hes going to find out real quick that those previous seed restrictions were merely preparation for the plethora of super teams hes probably going to lose to whose users also usually rely on cheesy tactics to score such as pumpfake spam  ft s with Curry and inboundturbocheese. Being able to use your unrestricted lineup against others isnt going to magically be more fun or make you better. Its a case of the grass is always greener on the other side. People dont realize the cons of the other side in that the average opponent you face has a great team and is incredibly frustrating to play due to relying on exploits to score simply because they havent made it to the other side themselves. Not only will K probably not make a MyTEAM quickmatch mode due to their financial perspective but its somewhat irrelevant anyways because  you just have to be average at best  winrate just ONE time to get to seed in RttP  the lineup restrictions actually take away from the aspect most people hate in this gamemode which is pay  win.,NBA2k,d53g6vm,1,t5_2s84e

8335454,0,t3_4tpvny,I play on HoF all season and would recommend it to anyone who plans on playing on HoF at any point but especially in the playoffs. Its substantially more frustrating because of the volcano of cheese that erupts every game but eventually you learn how to countercheese the AI. If youre playing on a lower difficulty all season and jump to HoF its a shock to the system. For example in every playoff series Ive had on HoF I get up . Suddenly in game  and sometimes  the AI is turns into the Cavaliers of this years Finals irl. Its inevitable. K is full of imbalances but on HoF theyre outlandish to the point that collision detection errors and your teams own ineptitude become the th man on the court for the opponent. Id advise lowering it to the difficulty youre comfortable with and then play on HoF next season to acclimate yourself to the cheesy deluge that only HoF can visit upon you like Gods wrath.  ,NBA2k,d5jhiu1,1,t5_2s84e

8404683,0,t3_4ur1sg,Whatever mode you play Ive passed this info on to a few people who used them as a baseline to learning the game. k basics On offense Move around with the left Joystick shoot with the Square button PS or X button XB and pass with the X button PS or A button XB. Ignore the LLT button for now as you dont need to worry about intense defense or post moves until you can do the basics of the game. The RRT button is the turbo button and can be helpful but also make you run right by your guy ignore that for now too. On defense Move with the left joystick just like offense. In the future to steal use the Square button and block using the triangle. Dont worry about trying to either of these things now though as they are timing based and if done incorrectly like I did when I started can leave you extremely out of position defensively. For now just focus on staying between the guy you are guarding and the basket with the occasional block attempt. The game is not an easy one to get used to and I just now ish games played am feeling like Ive got a decent handle on what Im supposed to do technique wise in order to succeed at the game. ,NBA2k,d5s4q5p,1,t5_2s84e

9081465,0,t1_d83chyg,I am skeptical for two reasons. I dont think they have ever done that before tweak the rates into three categories for example new TBT old TBT and base set. The second is I believe the TBT packs are still up so my guess as of this point is either that they leave those packs up forever and just do a new two teams every week or they switch the teams out on Thursday but leave the packs out for a full week to supply the market. Going  weeks at most is not that long to wait to then bring them pack in a Full Historic pack and each week the gap will get small to bringing teams back. Well see if they leave them in forever and just make a new TBT pack with  new teams and just have them all available would be an interesting market shaper.,NBA2k,d83g0k2,1,t5_2s84e

The only saving grace is my midrange shooting which is an easy shot when im left wide open. I still think this game needs some major work if it is to trump late k enjoyment and playability though.

I mean honestly just turn it back to the k system with same archtypes. Let people be two way players.. honestly you say that k requires more skill.. i think it just requires more cheese.. is what you really mean.. dont get me started on the pick and rolls this yearAND AGAIN.. i must emphasize I loved MyCareer this year. and all offline play is perfectly fine to me.. but online is super broke and you got like  guys who are ready to quit on this game.TLDR Fuck you K Fuck KD ,NBA2k,d86thnv,1,t5_2s84e

MMOs have been doing it for years playing the rock paper scissors character builds. Some improvements can be made but Id say its not bad for a first attempt. Parks are the same as last year but with new parks being added its a wash. I gotta say though I much preferred the parks from k. The play calling system is the only thing Im struggling with to be honest but that was the same the beginning of last year. Ill get used to it. MyCareer is far better this year hands down.

I preferred the iso moves and shit in  more and because Im a sharpshooter it appears to limit the amount of saucing I can do as playmaking cant be raised high enough for the elite moves.  is really fluid though and the passing is better. Its a game of animations so just learn which ones are the most favorable in any given situation. I actually like MyTeam more this year.

Then after the cutscene for example with Coach Falls about getting ready for the draft proceed to allow your player to add onto their linear style of play by picking a secondary archetype less effective but still adds onto your character. Allow these other archetypes to earn silver or gold badges and slightly add onto your attributes. That way going into the draft youre maybe a  overall with more than one play style. Also make the overall more accurately match up with your offensivedefensive rating. Its bugs me seeing my player as a  overall with an  offense and  defense.,NBA2k,da03px4,23,t5_2s84e

9714364,0,t3_5e8abt,Just finished historic dom last night. Played a couple games of MTO and I dont know if I can do it. I was getting crazy lag it legitimately felt like gtFPS at some points and that combined with opponents hitting deep contested threes with DeMar Derozan while I miss wide open threes with my new Tony Parker just pissed me off so much. In my second game Parker fouled out in the rd quarter and got  of those fouls while I wasnt even controlling him. The input lag also makes it impossible to do things as passes are made too late and turn into turnovers Why do my big men cut behind the defender after I press pass!!! but also affects my shooting and onball defense. As weird as it is I dont have these issues on blacktop  right now and I think Ill just stay there. Sorry for the rant,NBA2k,daai7wg,9,t5_2s84e

They literally make the game to be as close to real basketball as possible. We arent talking about NBA Jam here. So when people try to exploit the flaws in the game like the speed boosting that comes with zig zagging it upsets some people who would prefer to play sim basketball like the game intends. But hey if you prefer for people to zig zag for threes all the time thats fine by me.

9788708,0,t1_dajmxg4,Im somewhere between AllStar and Superstar. Basically AllStar wasnt quite enough of a challenge. I mean it was fine. I had fun but I would consistently win by double digits. Superstar is rage inducing at points where it feels like the game is doing literally everything it can to fuck you. Passes suddenly stop going to who you want them to go to. Wide open shots in the flow of the offense dont go down. On defense your teammates will perform absolutely horrendous or needless switches off a screen. Or the AI just starts draining threes one after another. Then after like  minutes everything goes to normal. I know basketball is a game of runs but there are less cheap ways of achieving that sort of immersion.So I made Custom Sliders in between AllStar and Superstar. Nerfing some things the AI tries to cheese while buffing their defensive consistency. Id have to take a look at it when I got home but it took me a good dozen or so games of constantly tweaking the sliders to get to a point where I was having consistent fun and competitive games. EDIT Should add I play full  minute quarters. Call plays pretty much every trip down the court that isnt a turnover or missed FGA by the computer. In which case I always push the rock and run a pick and roll while the defense is still getting set and scrambling. ,NBA2k,dajo66s,2,t5_2s84e

So athletic runs the break. Couldnt ask for more.Kiki is lights out. Him and Klay together is deadly. Klay is a good perimeter defender Kiki isnt. But no one has tried to abuse Kiki in the higher leagues. Its either  or post moves.Hardaway is super fast. He can sprint into a midrange jumper and hit it with ease. Never drive with him. He stays on the perimeter. I gave him defensive stopper so guys with magic couldnt just turbo him down in the paint as much. Can hit the three. I play him and Francis evenly. Hardaways duo with Mitch Richmond is AWESOME. Mitch has every hot zone. Never misses an open jumper.Hudson is a good defender and shooter.

Since you have k mt and have at least  cards you should look at running up to mashburn. You can get a bunch of  and the market is still crashed a bit and get alot of golds and silver players for . You get an extra k from the rewards before then so you would be spending about  per collection item to get there which is easily doable. That nets you a starting SF who is a stud which moves Durant down and fixes your problem there.That gets your a Ruby PF with walker so you can go Mikan instead with your domination reward.

If you havent drop Posterizer and Relentless on him.Kiki I basically didnt play at all for a while. But the more I play him the more I like him. Most people are going to use him for his three point shooting and that works well if you run plays for him.But what I really like him for is to post up and take fade and stepback shots as well as moving midrange in general. I think people dont really know how good he is midrange and sleep on that allowing you to take them unaware at least at first.,NBA2k,dc0kj3v,1,t5_2s84e
10203054,0,t1_dc0jtta, isnt even tall for a SF though. Most playmakers I see are . I still throw down on people but what it seems like is that Im not getting enough speed into the dunk to initiate a true contact instead of a regular dunk. Youre probably getting more contact dunks because with a lower height you can keep a better weightheight ratio giving you more strength? Regardless if thats true or not this just makes you slightly taller but slower than say a SgPg Slasher but their contact dunk can be just as high with better shootingball control and you lose the rebounding advantage a SF should have. Im not saying you have a bad build hell its probably way better than mine and at the end of the day its the skill of the player that ultimately decides if u get buckets or not ,NBA2k,dc0knd0,1,t5_2s84e

If you are doing something repetitive you might get an early lead but I will figure it out and stop it and if I cant more power to you thats basketball. Defensively I always start playing with the center so I can get a better idea of what your plan is going to be. If Im guarding the ball handler I cant really pay attention to what is going on on the rest of the court.

Basically you play with him for awhile and get a feel for him and then you grow to appreciate him more and more. His defense and athleticism are solid and better than you expect or even the atts would lead you to expect.

10318139,0,t3_5nqw6v,gt Most builds are either short like  or tall  or .A well played post player is nearly unstoppable.  Now what youre seeing is short ones that make use of their amazing speed using spins and fadeaways or tall ones focused more on backdowns and power moves.  Putting yourself in the middle will make you more of a jack of all trades master of none.  So youll have more options but you wont be as dominant with them.So I guess to answer your question... In the hands of a skilled post player the  or  would potentially be the most dangerous.  But since he wont have a strong go to move in the hands of a less skilled post player hes potentially worse.  So its up to you if you want a greater challenge but with potentially more rewards or you want something thats easier.,NBA2k,dcdm80o,5,t5_2s84e

On the other hand reaching can leave you vulnerable on a post spin as well. In fact If a post scorer has by some chance mastered post fade aways then reaching might even be detrimental. But If i am on my  LDD on MyPark and im against a tall Posting me up. I will attempt to steal because having HoF Pick Pocket makes it a solid play for me. But what Im really looking for here is the opponent to pass. Which is usually my favored result. The reason for this is because I feel in this situation its the most easiest for my teammates to get into passing lanes and intercept the ball.

Al may be more of a do it all guy but thats not really what you want from a center especially if youre wanting a defensive center like Dikembe. I love using big men Manute Bol for a couple reasons. Firstly his offensive stats are so bad they bring the teams overall way down useful for those challenges that require a certain ovr or for MTO to get matched with lower overall teams but also because just by being  he can just push other centers out of his way.

Putting Giannis at the  negates all the advantages you get from his length at the wing position. Giannis plays best with the ball in his hands. If you use him all game off ball you arent using him right. If all you want is his speed and midrange shooting you can grab a more legit stretch  with better paint defending skills.The only advantage I see to Giannis at the  is using is speed with ball advantage against a slow PF.Edit this is coming from someone who has been using the sapphire then ruby Giannis for months now.

Its pretty obvious when they do because the ball handler stays still for  seconds waiting for the set up. When this happens either switch to the defender on the ball handler and try to strip or watch for the player they are trying to get open and be ready to pick him up.

Ive gone to every single game most of last season and this season so I thought it would be fitting to recreate their arena and jerseys in MyTeam.

Maybe not even the people writing the code know exactly how gameplay is affected from all the stats.Anyways one of my favourite ones is the cock back block. My dude is monstrous when it comes to dunking yet a  player can effortlessly snap the ball WITH ONE HAND out of my dude who is trying to full power destroy the rim WITH BOTH HANDS.I would believe it if the guy blocking me from behind is hella strong but a short and clearly weaker player should have no chance.Its just broken game mechanics.

10800449,0,t1_ddtxw4d,Yeah you are starting off on a good note. Get all those ruby players while they are cheap and you will be set thru not only all of domination but most of historic domination as well. If you are pretty good you will be set. But those last few games can be killer. As for the rewards in regular domination they give you a choice. Go Marion or Francis. They are the clear best  and people still use them on higher levels of MTO. If you want to get a better center Yao isnt a bad choice. You will need someone better then Bogut in historic. You just need  really good players. past that just keep saving your mt. Dont buy packs ever.Be sure to do the weekly and moments challenges for extra mt.And the weekly challenges will net you some nice players. Once you get done with historic domination you should consider what you want to do. Either go and start working on your collection and going and getting some of those really good players. Or start finding guys you like. Historic diamonds are beastly now and the themed packs give you the dream team members and some of those are beastly. ,NBA2k,ddtzmpb,1,t5_2s84e

10933559,0,t3_5w51fb, That wideopen shooters cutting into the lane shit Directional passing in general is horrible.  Ill hold downleft then hit pass and the pass will go to a player on my right..  ??? When youre on the break you go to pass to your teammate on the wing but oh wait.. he just bumped into the ref.  Yes K.. we needed this in the game.  Worse than just the fact that it takes away your best passing option now your player picks his dribble up too ruining the break altogether.  Ditto on bumping into bench players or your receivers running out of bounds for no apparent reason.  This is realism actually this almost never happens in real life that we dont need Animations when your player catches a pass but fumbles the ball or whatever.  Yeah its real.. but its the kind of realism that only fucks up the player experience. Let the players dictate the way the game goes.  Not random animations that add nothing. Players with the ball run so slow.  Not real. Help defenders that lock on to players that are already being guarded perfectly fine leaving their men wide open and you cant break them off their new guy because the game has them in that Im guarding my man real hard! animation The same shit for players guarding cutters.  They always get hung up on players running through and choose to start guarding them as if their man wide open in the corner isnt a bigger issue Guys getting hung up while running.. you would think instead of having them run forever into another players back.. thered be some let me slide past you animation.. especially when they run into their own teammates that are obviously not trying to stop them.  If you dont know what Im talking about you know how the Center gets a free dunk at the start of every game?  Watch the opposing Center..  times out of  hes desperately running into his own teammate and cant get back How about when Icon PassingSwitching just chooses to not work? When you try to make a pass get caught up in an animation that takes  seconds completely changing the situation and the game decides to honor your decision to pass from  seconds ago EVERYTHING AROUND THE RIM IS JUST WRONG.  Players get aired on a pump fake but somehow get a block with it... nobody can finish a layup with anyone within  feet unless they have HOF badges flashing.. that one animation where you try to dunklayup and your guy gets obviously fouled the ball goes out of bounds and you lose possession...  Height matters way more than skill.  Obviously height is an advantage in real life too but the ratio here is just off. Players in prime position to grab offensive rebounds just lose them to defensive players for some reason.  OffensiveDefensive rebounds shouldnt even have separate ratings.  Offensive rebounding is harder in real life because offensive players get boxed out.  So an algorithm that combines rebounding rating with boxout rating should be all we need.  I shouldnt have to see offensive players just lose rebounds for no apparent reason Players not picking up their defensive assignments and just standing on the opposite side of the court while their man drains open threes... in transition its KIND OF understandable but after made baskets?  Come on. Same thing for how the Center just gets to run down the court for a free dunk sometimes after your center makes a shot. Somebody needs to pick up the guy running unopposed down the middle of the court Post basket celebration.  Again.. realism that adds nothing to the user experience.  Only detracts.  Whos the guy that like Wow! Sweet celebration animation! while his opponent gets a free dunk on the other end.Thats all I can think of right now.  I know theres more... Edit Oh! Blocking the ball.. my god. Theyve gotta do something about how easy it is to get blocks from behind. Its almost not even worth attempting to finish after you beat your man with how easy it is to get blocked. Edit The let me stand right under the rim and get dunked on transition defense also.  Never mind guarding shooters that pull up all the time.. never mind that any basketball coach from the age of  would have told guys to always pick up the ball AT LEAST at free throw line extended.. nope.  Were gonna stand directly under the rim so we can get dunked on or give up wide open transition s. Edit Last one and I cant believe I didnt think of this before...MOTHERFUCKING AUTOPUTBACKSThere is a specific command to do putbacks.  If I dont input this fucking command then I dont want a fucking putback.  Its really just that simple.  I cant count the amount of times Ive properly positioned myself for an offensive board then the game just decides that instead of securing the ball I want to put up some bullshit tap.  I didnt ask for it so dont give it to me.When Im playing Street Fighter.. at no point does Ryu just start throwing fireballs without me putting in the damn command for it.  Why the hell does the putback just happen when I dont want it and I never asked for it?,NBA2k,de7px5s,10,t5_2s84e

11021750,0,t1_degwqvt,The dude shot like  in February which is worse than his December and January average of course he doesnt shoot em much anyways. How is that a ? lmao. I wish K actually stuck to what Moments cards themeatically represent. Instead of straight increase they could decrease stats if the player did poorly in some specific category or we in that Moment. Of course they wouldnt do that since people dont want decreases.Though USA Robinson can splash s so its obvious K dont really give a shit.,NBA2k,deha9uf,4,t5_2s84e
11022666,0,t3_5x7gs2,Thanks as always for the work.A couple questions. How is the position limitation determined? Im thinking in MyTeamMyLeagueetc. terms here. If I have a Center I understand then his Def Stopper only fires on Centers and Power Forwards. But how is position determined? Is it determined by the players position of record? If so what about secondary positions? Or is it determined by the position they are playing in at the moment? I.e. if I put Ben Wallace in as my Point Guard will his Defensive Stopper only activate against Centers and PFs or will it activate against PGs and SGs?. Have you ever had any impressionconclusion about whether the badge affects a players Lateral Quickness or physical defensive behavior? Ive always wondered if the effect of the badge is purely about counteracting badges or if there is buffing of some relevant perimeter defense Ratings.,NBA2k,dehe0ka,1,t5_2s84e

I think that makes up for his defense. And dont forget his rebounding ability.Yao is still the tallest competent big man in the game and his height adds  to interior D and rebounding.

Im pretty satisfied with my team defensively but would like to upgrade my offense without sacrificing too much defense since my team is built off of their defensive capabilities. Any suggestions on good defensive ruby and sapphire cards?,NBA2k,dgrexw3,1,t5_2s84e

11780626,0,t3_68168g,Hes great only knock on him is his lack of a  ball and his soso height though  isnt that bad honestly. Defensively hes a beast his post game and mid range shot are excellent and his playmaking is amazing if you learn to ultilize it. Still worth a pick up in my opinion ,NBA2k,dgvde5g,2,t5_2s84e
11782439,0,t1_dgvjhez,Just a side note I dont just sit in the corner with my LDD I was just trying  to make a point. I have a  and a  and play them like a Slasher. I think Im pretty effective offensively with them but thats another story. My point is I built these two players because of a system that was in place. If I knew I couldnt shoot a corner threes  I would have upgraded my off the dribble with the  or maybe have maxed post scoring with my . I WILL NOT shoot a three if Im only hitting at a  clip so that puts a big hit as to how I play these guys and wasted attributes on them because they keep changing the game. I shoot  from pt in the park and I score the same amount of points when I use my LDD point forward sharpshooter or slasher. Its not going to effect me I will adapt and use a player for how the system is setup. Its just very bad IMOP to keep changing settings this far along in the game since it greatly effects players that people have created. Im going to score the same and shoot the same percentage regardless of the setting changes Ill just do it differently with different players. As to your question about shooting percentages its not that simple of an answer. It should depend on how good a player you are. If I have a  three and I know my release perfectly then I should be able to shoot at  a high percentage. This is a game of skill and just because I have more skill and can shoot at higher percentages with a  three as opposed to a player with a  three I shouldnt be penalized. All a lower three point rating should mean is that I have to be more accurate with my release than someone with a higher rating.,NBA2k,dgvksxe,1,t5_2s84e
