600411,0,t3_20zc2f,That information doesnt work. I read through every blog post I could find and tried and tried but never could get a nonbuggy reliable setup going. Very disappointing. The closest I came was using leafpad to copy the config data from the xrandr settings files into one of the tabs in the system settings GUI then disregard xrandr altogether. You can hand type these settings as well but it can be tricky with just a oneline prompt. The results are usable but my icons and background are wacky in a different way every time I reboot. Lubuntu is great but just not quite there yet.,Lubuntu,cg8iqjj,1,t5_2uc56

2480858,0,t3_2nzcgp,I tried again tonight when fewer wireless devices were running and I can watch video on my netbook.  The question remains  Why could the Linux Mint laptop stream video and the Lumbuntu netbook not?  MG ram vs  MB ram?,Lubuntu,cmidx9l,1,t5_2uc56
2697374,0,t1_cnan0ts,Hmmm. Are you operating from the live boot or an install? If a live boot is it a usb or a CD dvd?,Lubuntu,cnanz16,1,t5_2uc56
3504446,0,t3_30amwy,I used it to help people near me. Ive installed on my moms pc which is now hooked to her tv and she loves her vlc.Ive saved my father few euros by installing lubuntu on his old win laptop. He later gave it to his older brother when he was trying to get his shit together. Helped him to check up on things.Rescued old lenovo desktop from uni and gave it to girlfriends grandma to learn why everyones talking about this internet thing. Now she has her grandchild to help her and nowadays she can actually use internet like the rest of em seniors.Besides that I dont really use it myself. Debian is my thing. Lubuntu is just easier to hand out as a substitute to win xp.,Lubuntu,cprqclu,2,t5_2uc56
4041158,0,t1_crgux4i,I once tried to buy a GB stick of RAM which is hard to find for that particular machine and I was so excited when it arrived ... but then when I put it in it turned out to be corrupted and I had to return it.,Lubuntu,crgx855,1,t5_2uc56

8957276,0,t3_52xa85,Have you created a partition on your hard drive for Lubuntu? When installing are you definitely selecting the free space and partitioning this for your Linux partition? Or are you wanting to completely remove OSX.,Lubuntu,d7oj3to,1,t5_2uc56
