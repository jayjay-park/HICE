3056604,0,t3_2uypih,I personally have used a great deal of psychedelic drugs. I would like to say to you life is what you make it and say no to pharmaceuticals. Stay away from the synthetics. More natural the better. People have been using natural psychedelics for thousands of years. Remember you will always return. And please read about shamanism as well as transcendental mediation. Know that a healthy diet and mediation can take you to the same places. The psychedelic opening of the crown chakra can be too intense for the majority of people. Hence the shaman being one of a kind in his village. Please know that the chemical reactions within your mind can be very powerful and surreal. To journey inward we must be honest observant and above all... balls of steel. The psychedelic experience is not for the faint of heart due to the fact most are to afraid of drowning so they run back to shore once their feet get wet. Anyone who tells you that the river aint deep aint been to the river. Be safe the only thing that will ever fill any void within the self is as such  the self. To help others is to help the self. To realize the need to help others is the realize the purpose of self. I am me so I can understand that you are you. If you are in fact like me then you must feel similar to me. Save ourselves save each other. Save each other save ourselves. Safe travels Moonknight I hope you find your way back home.,straightedge,coetcag,1,t5_2qkzx
3336282,0,t3_2xxl37,In my experience nonedge people will always lie about doing drugs to their edge SO. Every single guy Ive dated I have asked to not smoke or drink or do drugs to be with me they all say okay then they do them when Im not looking. Every. Single. Guy.My husband is no exception to that. He has lied about smoking in the past and is misleading about when he drinks very little TBH but it still hurts me to know he lied. He doesnt do it now that I know of because I threatened to leave him if he lied again. Now he uses those electronic cigarettes which still upsets me but at least he isnt lying to me anymore about it.I dont put up with smoking because its a death sentence. I dont put up with drunkenness though I am okay with the occasional drink in my partner. I draw a line at illegal drugs including marijuana. I think its all about setting up what you are personally comfortable being around and dealing with in a partner. Then the partner needs to know that AND they need to be okay with it AND they need to not lie about it. If they arent willing to do that they arent the right partner for you.  ,straightedge,cp8k8f8,1,t5_2qkzx

And if I ever did why would I want to go back to abstaining? It just makes no sense to me.Not to mention to me straight edge is a life long commitment.

They are lionizing petty criminality and drug dealing and poor pathetic role models for the communities that need role models the most.
