72374,0,t1_cemmbr0,Ive always liked the half windsor knot. Elegantly symmetric in nature complicated in the simplest way. Glancing at myself in the mirror I cant help but admire my knot this morning. Every week day for fifteen years Ive been tying this knot and I still cant quite do it right half of the time. But this particular morning its a thing of beauty.With a smile on my face and a spring in my step I jogged down the stairs and waltzed into the kitchen. I filled up the  Dad mug that I got last fathers day with this mornings coffee and took a sip. Theres nothing better than black coffee in the morning.I headed into the foyer and while reaching for my keys sitting on the hall table I knocked over an old photograph. Wiping off layers of dust I revealed the image that I had been ignoring for the longest time. It was a picture of myself from my senior year at Boise State. Smiling I lightly shook my head and placed the picture where it had been sitting before.As my wife came walking down the stairs I grabbed my keys off the table with my right hand and tossed them into the air snatching them with my other hand as they fell. I gave my wife a kiss and said goodbye as I went out the door.,webcomics,cemo33c,1,t5_2qh2w

7672510,0,t3_4kdaw8,Actually a British Bill of Rights is at the heart of the matter.  Middle Europe has its cultural origins in Roman Law which was eventually rewritten by Napoleon Bonaparte to become Napoleonic Law and it has finally evolved into the Code Civil the French Civil Code.It its original concept it was the law of the nobility over the peasantry so guilt is assumed arguments are made to magistrates there is no objection permitted in court.  And any action which is not specifically legal in the law is unlawful an important point.British and American and some others law is based on Common Law large parts of which descend from the legal systems of the Germanic tribes.  It started with the notion that all warriors are equals before the law so has concepts like the assumption of innocence before guilt trial by jury a neutral judge and advocates to present the case and that which is not specifically illegal is inherently legal also an important point.In any event these legal origins permeate both cultures and it is why trying to put the UK with its Common Law background into the EU which is dominated by the French Civil Code is like trying to put a square peg into a round hole.  Its not happening.When the US was founded it was done entirely on the basis of Common Law.  The idea was that laws were made by men not in heaven so could be changed by men.  There was no nobility or peasantry so all citizens are at least technically equal.The only real value of government was to defend against foreign enemies and to neutrally enforce the social contract.  Thus the objective in laying down the ground rules for government was equally what government could do and what it was specifically prohibited from doing.  Thus the American constitution is a succinct and very carefully crafted citizen centric document.  And the supremacy of the citizenry is enforced in a Bill of Rights reiterating what government is forbidden from doing.But because the EU constitutional effort was based on the French Civil Code it is voluminous a phone book of every niggling petty law that might be enacted.  At the same time its listing of human rights is just embarrassing.  A muddled nebulous yet trendy waste pile of political correctness any part of which could be easily evaded by a pragmatic or oppressive government.In any event with the UK finally considering the Brexit the light has dawned that for too long the British have relied on unwritten politeness to protect their rights and only when a clear concise and well thought out Bill of Rights is created will they be truly free of the morass of the EU and again able to stand up on its hind legs as a nation.,webcomics,d3ebikb,2,t5_2qh2w

10593288,0,t1_dd8ke09,gtLol I hate democracy? Yeah totally dude.When one candidate wins  million more votes than another and loses thats a insult to the will of the people and undemocratic plain and simple.gtJust because youre unable to comprehend the electoral college doesnt mean its undemocratic. It means that youre uninformed.Nice ad hominem I actually graduated from a good high school unlike the ignorant fucks who support Trump so yea I do.gtThe Rust Belt is super important. If Hillary had won those states shed be president.No shit. They would still be getting votes and their voice heard. Its fucking stupid that because someone lives in bumfuck nowhere their vote has more weight than someone living in a city. Its undemocratic and frankly total bullshit. gtAlso where was the outrage about the electoral college when Obama won? Obama won the popular vote and the electoral college so how are those situations even remotely similar? I was pissed about Gore as well. Funny how in the last two presidential elections where a republican won they lost the popular vote but George W. Bush was such a great president who clearly had the will of the people in mind so were all good right? sgtBut the popular vote isnt an argument. It doesnt matter that one candidate won more votes than the other. Does that sound like a democratic society to you? Dont say but...but...republic because we both know that is bullshit.gtYou should have tried to get it abolished under Obama. But you didnt.Yea I naively thought that it was a system used to prevent dictators from rising to power. Clearly that didnt work.  My beliefs changed after being presented with contradicting evidence but this is the era of feels before reals so feelings are much more important than evidence. gtProbably because you werent looking for ways to subvert the way our government has handled presidential elections for over  centuries.Nice Appeal to Tradition as Well gtAnd I didnt vote for Trump. I dont need to vote for Trump to think that the system worked as its supposed to. Grow up. Whining about losing a video game would be childish and it would be appropriate to grow up. Raging against an election that was influenced by a hostile foreign power and undermines the very core of what this country founded upon is not only appropriate but my god damn right as an patriotic American. As long as Trump is in power the future of freedom and and a democratic society is at risk. I will NEVER stop  fighting against his regime. gtJust because the system didnt go your way doesnt mean its broken.When a system claims to be democratic and then goes against the will of the majority then the system is clearly very very fucking broken.  ,webcomics,dd8m6fh,1,t5_2qh2w

Your messages seem to imply that you do not live in the United States and as such I dont see why you are advocating for the US to take in more refugees. Its not our responsibility to take in refugees because of the actions of terrorist groups  in fact this would only hurt the wartorn country even more.
