5408655,0,t1_cw2pqot,If I remember correctly I Sacrificed a used movie ticket to appease the editing gods. Asked the neighbour to witness me while I spray painted my mouth and teeth silver.  Prayed to T Fink for his blessing  Pressed enter and waited for the blessed awesomeness of underage faneditors who care not for honor or talent but for the splendor and fame of the fanedit. lolz. Wrong.If I member correctly I got in years ago. I will warn you that there is some rule that is paramount. Something like dont bring it on yourself cause youll be on you own. Check it out for yourself. That rule alone says something. It is in reference to the hate that will rain upon you if you step out of line. Even once even if it was an honest mistake the hate will rain and rain until it makes you think your worthless when your not. Even if you stand your ground even if you prove what you typed. The hate will come upon you like being a black man at a kkk rally. Mark me words. I got in once years ago and tried to submit one of my first fanedits The Ghosts of Mars. The top down attitude the feeling I got was not very nice. Tried to ask a simple question got shot down rather rudely. I could tell my edit was not going to be viewed simply cause the resolution was not good enough. I just stopped going to the site because I felt like I was not worthy. No really. It happened. So after a few years and now I have like  film edits I thought hey I should try again. This time it went bad so fast my head spun. They got in my head and I was not happy cause I let myself go down to the level they operate at. One of the reasons I started to post here was that nobody in the site wanted to check out any of my edits until I proved that I had so many fanedits to share. So I thought well F u a holes. You want fanedits? Well here they are and I never looked back. I mean really over half of my edits have never been attempted before. This baffles me. I was warned about releasing my edits by another gentleman. He has some good film schooling. We got to conversing about fanediting and how it can be made into a moneymaking thing for the studios. He warned me that the community will not take to so many fanedits too soon. I should release then slowly.Well it was true. So true. Tried to submit a few movies but it was too late. The cat was out of the bag. I really did have over  fanedits and once that sunk in it seemed to bring on the hate bad. I could tell nobody was going to view my edits so as they can be put into the database. It was obvious they were starting to look for reasons to ban me. Very obvious.Got an email that they are swamped or something even though I only submitted one move to view. One damn movie. Bayblon A.D.Still waiting for a request for submisson but I got the hint. MacsVoltage may never be in the fanedit.org listings. Too many fanedits for them to handle. If you think about it the answer to fanediting is youtube. If the film companies think it out they can have a huge money making thing with the youtube. A fanediting site on youtube that costs to enter. Like a small subscription. Then when your in you can submit and view fanedits but only at the small resolution. The movie companies can decide what movies can be edited. If you want the better you pay a bit more. If you want a physical copy well that can be made for you by the studio but at a cost that is more than a store bought dvd and it would have like movie companie name here fanedit all over the cover so as it would not confuse the public if they see it for sale elsewhere. Plus they can get some coin for the ads. Lots of coinIf something like that started there would be no need to go anywhere else cause you could view your edit as soon as you join up pay the subscription and upload. If you think about it this will happen. I mean one movie company is already releasing movies for free on the you tube. So as they can collect on the ads. They then can plunder the site for talent. There is another Stanley Kubrick out there and we need to find him. I hope this will help you if ya do get in the site. I am sure there are tons of nicer people there but most are scared to type anything against the site for fear of what happened to me.Good thing I just put my energies elsewhere. Cheers! You dont understand this place isnt what we thought it was. I was wrong. We were so wrong. We must leave!  Elizabeth Shaw Prometheus,fanedits,cw30l7j,0,t5_2ub02

6125077,0,t1_cyljium,Im not familiar with anti cheese. Heavy Star Wars is fun but the gimmick wears off. As far as the other three major prequel edits go I prefer Lwrtr. HAL  doesnt cut enough Q cuts too much but Lwrtr is the best balance in my opinion.,fanedits,cyluvon,2,t5_2ub02
