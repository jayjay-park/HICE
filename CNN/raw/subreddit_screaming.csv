100320,0,t3_1v7r30,If you cant find anyone locally Ive heard good things about getting lessons via Skype. Ive seen screaming teachers online who offer them. ,screaming,cepuonl,2,t5_2vbk2
708203,0,t3_229i1e,I was going to make a similar post so Ill just comment here.Is there a beginner guide to what I need to start recording. Never recorded music in my life but want to start recording screams. I read that the type of mic you want depends on the type of vocals you will be doing. So what mic do you guys recommend for screaming maybe around .Also if anyone is kind enough what is a list of stuff i need? ,screaming,cgkry55,1,t5_2vbk2
1855138,0,t3_2ftvfx,Not a smoker so I cant really comment but when I drink I sometimes smoke and it affects my voice adversely. I dont recommend it.,screaming,ckcqmdl,0,t5_2vbk2
2579431,0,t1_cmv9i28,Definitely work the diaphragm it is essential. As I said I cant really explain in words what I do with my throat. It just feels a lot like head voice. Listening totrying to emulate this bands vocalist led me to start doing it. Pay attention to his highs. Im not sure if he and I have the same technique but they sound a lot alike. ,screaming,cmv9pjr,1,t5_2vbk2
2615890,0,t3_2pfde6,Im the singer of a now very quickly growing band. Ive been doing vocals for about  years and Ill be honest when I say that I dont feel I was any good until I started a band and started practicing with other guys a couple of times a week. It took me a while to get the techniques down and I kept thinking to myself man am I hurting myself? am I even doing this right? and honestly even today I still do so. I do it much less than I used to but the thought still crosses my mind. I find that I learn new things after ever rehearsal every gig and every recording.I hope itll work out for you too! ,screaming,cn019up,1,t5_2vbk2

4482212,0,t3_3ah83u,Yeah the highs and screams need more control which comes with practice and the normal versus are a little flat. Are you warming up before recording?,screaming,csvndsx,1,t5_2vbk2

5743114,0,t1_cx8hn85,Well I think that all of them has that samesimilar tone to them. Theyre all executed differently Obscuras vocalist does it with a pretty relaxed style while the vocalist of Vapenlicens goes on full overdrive I could be wrong but to me they all share some similarities with that crunch. Im little unsure about the term glottis. What does it mean? ,screaming,cx8zm2v,1,t5_2vbk2
5826587,0,t1_cxjbwu6,gtHow did you find your vocal coach?I went asking in all music schools I could find asking them if they were willing to teach someone to sing postHC songs. Most of them didnt answer me but a few did. I wont lie to you it takes time to find a good vocal coach.gtDoes your vocal coach cater specifically to metalscreaming?My first coach had a death metal band so I learned most of what I know about screaming from him. After a few years of classes with him I started looking for coaches with better knowledge on clean vocal.My current teacher doesnt know much about screaming but shes always open to help when she can. But when it comes to clean singing shes a monster.gtHow much does your vocal coach charge?US  per month. But I live in Brazil not US. gtWhat is a typical lesson like?The classes are always focused on the technique I need to sing a specific song. So we pick a song at the end of one class and at the next class we do a  min warmup and then do  min exercises for the techniques I need to sing the chosen song. At the end of class I sing the song twice and then we evaluate if I should pick an easier song if we should move on to a harder song or if we should stick with that song and practice it again next week.gtWhat kind of improvements have you noticed since taking lessons and how long have you been taking them?My first coach the one that teached me how to scream have helped me a lot on learning how to do all those techniques without hurting myself. I stayed with him for  years .My current coach teached me everything else I know about singing. Better breathing technique better high notes techniques I gained more than one octave of range taking classes with her better sense of interpretation etc.To sum it up I cant imagine someone becoming a good singer without classes.

6193521,0,t3_40es4k,You need to work on relaxation quite a bit. It can be challenging when youre trying to get all those lines in but its crucial. I can tell how your voice has a kind of onoff switch for your heavy distortion when you go into lower growls which leads me to believe you are forcing it to distort on those. Theres a lot of pressure on your voice in those more yellish  whiny not in an offensive way sections and if you just tone that back a bit when you go to add more distortion it would be better. Still good for such a short time though. Keep practicing. ,screaming,cytmz49,1,t5_2vbk2

7683009,0,t1_d3fhl1z,Just how his voice sounds behind them. He souds kinda awkward at some points theres such a small amount of distortion i can almost count how many times i hear his cartilages slapping together. Just not my types of screams,screaming,d3fiep1,1,t5_2vbk2

7778291,0,t1_d3px48u,Thanks for the feedback! Im actually using pretty much all the diaphragm I am able to. If I use any more Ill wind up tensing up my neck and forcing out the screams which is obviously bad,screaming,d3qbsyo,1,t5_2vbk2

9595822,0,t3_5cbg2s,Well for starters its really not smart to continue screaming if your voice is hoarse.  That shows a bad technique. Theres possibilities of vocal nodules and polyps as well as other issues. Id see an ENT if I were you.,screaming,d9vvq71,3,t5_2vbk2

10342662,0,t1_dc75p9i,i think he was generalising the term vocal fry within the idea of screaming. obviously its not actually the vocal fry by definition of what you posted but a colloquialism for screaming.,screaming,dcgee45,1,t5_2vbk2
