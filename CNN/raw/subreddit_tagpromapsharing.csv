2124523,0,t3_2jaexo,I feel like the map is made of several well thoughtout elements coupled with many other things there because there meeds to be something there.The well thoughtout elements are Boost to flag and spike you must do the boost right so as to not hit the spike which takes down the power of an otherwise OP boost the flag is just barely visible from the boost Bombs w buttons on sides hitting the button is usually a good boost forward though this may be OP Spike is one tile away diagonally from button see CFBA maybe notsowell thoughtout element is Base is protected by green gates without being invunerable. I havent played this map with gt other person so I havent seen the gates in action.Things I dont like    islands are just there because something needs to be.   Middle boostspup are there just because people like  powerups and more than two boosts,tagpromapsharing,cl9vgcc,1,t5_30v3s

2198189,0,t1_clj7avj,Thanks for the feedback.I think well just have to agree to disagree about the wasted space thing. I on the other hand really dont like when a map tries to squeeze something in to every square inch of the map. I dont believe that open space is necessarily wasted space especially when its in a fast boost tunnel. The middle bits are quite purposeful chokes bounces redirect etc and the team tiles are to prevent an FC from running a circle around that thing and if they were wider theyd make boost routes inconsistent. I could try out some alternate mid setups if the current one doesnt flow well or isnt intuitive its hard to tell whats intuitive when youre the one putting the boosts in place. However the map is already quite constrained and has little to no open space so I dont really feel cutting out space is necessary.,tagpromapsharing,clj8sum,1,t5_30v3s
2349953,0,t3_2m9agd,It doesnt seem too bad for a first attempt except for one thing  its massive.,tagpromapsharing,cm25yhh,1,t5_30v3s
2402083,0,t3_2mxty8,Honestly wouldnt change a thing! You should submit it to the map thread!!,tagpromapsharing,cm8lu0f,2,t5_30v3s
2469162,0,t3_2ntygx,I havent tried it with flipping but I dont see why it wouldnt work if you flipped it in paint or whatever and then uploaded it to  I often do this when I want to make the map longer so I open it in paint select half the map move it a few pixels and fill in the gaps with the colour for blank tiles.You dont need to edit the json this way just upload the original and change the linking in the map editorHere watch this The only problem with doing it this way is you need to redo all the  degree tiles as the coulours are still the same in paint! Should still be significantly quicker than doing it by hand,tagpromapsharing,cmgvymd,3,t5_30v3s

2660904,0,t3_2qdra6,I love cloud for its simplicity. I think its a solid map and with shine gone it has a shot in the the simple category. I dont really like the team boost placement in base and Im iffy on the bomb button.,tagpromapsharing,cn5wp2j,1,t5_30v3s
2670850,0,t3_2qk783,It seems to flow well however I feel like this map would result in caps almost exclusively off boostsbombs. I also think the bttom team boost can be used to take you basically into the goal which is IMO the most OP boost since its hard to see from base. The gate doesnt seem terribly helpful mainly because of the downward momentum you would have.,tagpromapsharing,cn77bnp,2,t5_30v3s
2832325,0,t3_2scy5a,I havent played it yet but the gates might be better off nearer the outer wall. Otherwise that jettison seems like it might go unused.,tagpromapsharing,cnq145q,1,t5_30v3s
3534194,0,t1_cpuv5hx,I see a shelter for snipes right at the bomb.  If someones coming bomb out of there.  If you do it at the right angle you can bounce off that little wall and even go down.  But Im not even sure Im gonna submit this it was mostly just to see.  SuperDuperStamp was up and down and MTC liked it just fine.,tagpromapsharing,cpv4e99,1,t5_30v3s
4212631,0,t1_cs0cmny,I feel like it there are no good grabbing mechanisms between the boost being on the wall and the bomb being so far away. The middle and corners feel pretty open.I think this map would play really great in competitive play and there would be crazy boosts cutting off the alley and into the button.,tagpromapsharing,cs0fc3q,2,t5_30v3s
