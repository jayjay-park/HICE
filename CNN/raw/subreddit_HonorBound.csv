1040720,0,t1_chkvqrb,Because   Mass Heal costs  mana and heals about  at my current level which means that casting once and youre pretty much done  Mass Regen costs  mana and heals  every turn for  turns total .Basically I cast Mass Regen murder all enemies but  and then skip with everyone. This allows me to fully heal my party with each battle and even on hard foes I skip for  turns cast Mass Regen again cast the occasional Minor HealExcept for bosses I can end every battle with my entire team fully healed which I couldnt do with Mass Heal,HonorBound,chml1ky,2,t5_30dph
