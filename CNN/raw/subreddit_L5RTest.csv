11677063,0,t1_dgjlwrr,There are still some issues. Like you said that image looks rough even though its actually a hires png of the logo. I forgot about the footer so Ill mess with that. Also it is currently over top of some of the buttons so I am going to have to make it a tad smaller.  You said they might send you some art assets? Im still not  sold on my banner I think I might try round  tomorrow or something so when you get those assets let me know. ,L5RTest,dgjm0yk,1,t5_3k2kg
