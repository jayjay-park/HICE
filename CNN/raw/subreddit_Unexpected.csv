That in itself is very disrespectful.I can read about rape experiences now actually being able to became part of my healing process but I still cant watch rape scenes in movies... but I dont preach that rapesex in movies is evil because thats the absolute wrong way of dealing with things.

Its common to find people who fast during Ramadan show up to mosque but then also regularly attend events and parties with alcohol socialize and get intimate with members of the opposite sex. Anyway I just wanted to say that your friend isnt some exceptional case. There are an entire country worth of young people who practice a much more modern and moderate version of this religion not unlike how todays Christianity is so much less strict and open minded than its ancient version. The religion itself isnt any less compatible with that than Christianity. The poblem instead has to do with the distribution of information and exposure to the world that counters the middle easts isolationism. ,Unexpected,cg9v0az,38,t5_2w67q

After it began to circulate on the Internet as a factual story and attained the status of urban legend Mills stated that he made it up as an illustrative anecdote  to show how different legal consequences can follow each twist in a homicide inquiry. gtThe story first appeared on the Internet in August   and has been widely circulated since on Web pages in chat rooms and even print publications.

Im the one with enough common sense to not take the risk and to have installed a screenprotector which does its job well  there is no luck in that nor bad luck as these things just happen.gtthat doesnt change the fact these new screens on many phones are incredible at resisting scratches.I agree. But theyre not invincible. Again grain of sand vs gorilla glass? Guess which one wins. Even if it takes a diamond  once the scratch is there you cant recover the screen. A screenprotector is easy cheap and easily replacable. gtBut high end phones these days will likely get tremendous scratches to the body and detailing of the phone long before a scratch on the screen happens.Possibly. There are also kids in Africa dying of hunger. But that doesnt mean we cant complain about our food here nor about the state of our screens regardless of the state of the phone body. The argumentation doesnt work that way. A screen is easy to protect and its a highprofile element to protect. A scratch on your screen is worse than a scratch on your body because it interferes with normal functioning while a body scratch is just unpleasant. ,Unexpected,chuwizx,1,t5_2w67q

2284904,0,t1_clu1mev,Well sure. But it seems like my highs are lower and my lows are higher than the next guys. I was depressed for a while in university and ended up dropping out so maybe feeling a constant low for a while burned away some emotional intensity that I once had or maybe my cerebral cortex found a way to control my limbic system. If I start feeling bad it goes away almost immediately my rational systems are like Hey why would you want to feel bad?

2308759,0,t1_clwv5lf,I have an actual phobia of those. I was always afraid of the pop as a kid and my parents told me the urban legend about the biscuit cans popping in the back of a ladys car.In college my roommates decided while we were all plastered that theyd help me get over my fear by exposure therapy. My ex grabbed a can from the back of our crisper and handed it to me. I was so scared that I cried. I finally peeled off the wrap after nearly an hour seriously but it didnt pop. My roommate handed me a knife and said to put it under the seam. That took a lot of talking up nearly half an hour more. I finally did... and it fucking exploded. Not like theyre supposed to but in a violent powerful blast. The metal end of the can popped into the handle of the knife forcing into my palm and wrist. I rightfully so lost my fucking shit. I didnt know what happened just that it was loud and I was bleeding profusely. My friends had to go get a neighbor to drive me to hospital for stitches. The can had long and I mean LOOOOONG expired since everyone was too afraid to open it near me and risk a panic attack. The buildup of yeast bubbles maybe? and the fact that theyd warmed up in my hands and on the oven for so long built up a lot of pressure and the alcohol thinned my blood.I went to culinary school to be a baker after that. I make my own fucking biscuits.,Unexpected,clx2upe,35,t5_2w67q

2499976,0,t1_cmkjezh,I recently heard a sermon about why god allows sufferingThere are two kinds of suffering the first is self inflicted mostly caused by selfishnessgreed sins. God has nothing to do with that one.The second is worldy suffering i.e earthquakes famine disease accidents etc. These sufferings are not prevented by god to give us a chance a chance to be more like him. God created us in his image to help others is our oppurtunity to become closer to him. He does not cause these evils but he will not stop them it is our duty to do something about it. If there were no suffering we would already be living in paradise. This is more or less the contents of the sermon though it was a while ago and my memory is not perfect. Also concering OP who created the tree in the first place? God know all that has happened and will happen he knew adam and eve would eat the fruit and he allowed it. He loves us and wants us to love him it can not be forced and thus he gives us the option to choose not him. He gave us free will for this exact reason. And this in addition is why he can never allow us to prove his existance. Sorry for the long post I have been thinking about these things for a while and just wanted to unburden my thoughts now that ive got a chance. ,Unexpected,cmkvuyg,1,t5_2w67q
2500108,0,t1_cmklu2v,Its actually the sound of the number  s  in Chinese that sounds similar to diedead s . The only difference is the intonation. I think in some dialects the intonation is actually the same as well this is just a guess on my behalf.Also you would never say I am  in the way youre thinking in Chinese. You would say  where  means meI  means four  means age and  to indicate change of state i.e. ageing from  years old to  years old. You could also say I am  years old nowthis year  or maybe just  years old  if you were comfortable being more informal with your grandma. It doesnt make sense semantically to say I am die  the only circumstance this would make sense is if your name was fourdie. If you wanted to say I am dead you would say  where  is a past tense marker.  on its own is actually used as a verb or adjective. If you wanted to say I am personification of death you would probably say something like  or maybe  lit. I am a Death God.,Unexpected,cmkwhb8,2,t5_2w67q

It was caused by people mostly not living in the city itself using the loss as an excuse to be the disgusting people they are. Actual fans were mourning the loss normally and without incident over a few tears beers and whatever else moves their lives forward.You can find the  Vancouver riot Police Review here As is typical in Vancouver many of those people who were engaged by the police as a result of theirintoxication or behaviour were not residents of Vancouver.    Statistics collected by those workingshowed that the vast majority of offenders were from neighbouring jurisdictions. One NCO wrote in hisdebrief report that of eight actionable negative contacts with the publiconly one of these contactslived in Vancouver the rest lived in Surrey Richmond and Burnaby.

It sounds a bit like a click and might be followed with a sigh and is meant to convey discontent or disapproval. Often the result of witnessing Sods Law. Sucking your teeth  also known by the expatriate Jamaican community in the UK as giving chups is sucking air through your teeth with your tongue slightly in the way to make a hissing sound. This is unequivocally meant to imply disapproval. It is often accomanied by the rounding of the lips to make a sound like Tseeouww or Tseeah. Its worth knowing that these two expressions are in essence the same. Its also interesting that the word chupa is Portugese for suck which is of course exactly what the person giving chups is doing. ,Unexpected,cr4ndyg,9,t5_2w67q

So he put an adult sized one on me and we went out.He was going slow but we hit a small wave which threw us both off the Jet Ski. The underarm supports for the life jacket went up to my neck and I was submerged entirely. I thought I was going to drown but my dad picked me up by the shirt and placed me back onto the jet ski he was a big dude and I was very young.Looking back I was in no real danger of drowning. My father was in complete control of the situation. However I am and always will be absolutely terrified of deep water.I was able to identify exactly what caused my fear.

5127192,0,t1_cv3jf18,The social aspect you talk about is a huge factor in a lot of pit attacks. People think theres no warning but just because they dont growl doesnt mean there wasnt a warning. Like you said pit bulls are naturally VERY protective breeds. They actually usually love people which is why they against popular belief make generally poor guard dogs. They sometimes have trouble mixing well with other dogs but its well documented that they are people pleasers and love praise and positive reinforcement from their owners they are constantly seeking approval. They are incredibly protective of their people especially young children. The screaming from the Grandma as well as the tone she uses at the beginning when telling the children they cant dump the water until she says so as well as her seemingly erratic waving around all probably set off some red flags in the Pits mind.Not saying that there isnt pit bulls that snap just as there are dogs of every breed who are unpredictable and biters but as others said the main difference is simply that the pitbull has such a strong bit and a shake instinct that WHEn they do attack the outcome will be worse than a chihuahua that attacks even though the intention may have been defensive and the chihuahuas may have been aggressive people will always cite the Pit attack as worse regardless of any instigation or poor ownership that is involved.Owner of a PitDalmation mix two of the most stubborn high energy breeds and my dog is such a lover so good with other people and kids. I started her in obedience school as soon as I adopted her at around  years old and weve never had a problem. Nurture really does play a HUGE role in dogs even more so than in people and I think people who want to just get a dog and never worry about working with it on obedience and training just shouldnt own ANY dogs let alone a strong athletic dog that could actually hurt someone.,Unexpected,cv40oy0,1,t5_2w67q

5138330,0,t1_cv5ch9c,I think I was around  when I had my first episode.  I was sitting at the kitchen table and started hearing a womwomwomwom sound all around me. The next thing I remember is sitting on the couch with a bunch of paramedics around me. They checked my blood sugar and it was . I still dont know if it was a seizure or I just passed out from low blood sugar or a combination of both. They gave me a shot of glucose and I snapped out of it immediately. I was checked for diabetes and dont have that so I just chalked it up to a freak thing. About a month later I crashed my car. I had like  seconds of warning where I just felt kind of a sense of impending doom? Thats the only way I can describe it. Some people have auras funny smells metallic taste like pennies in their mouth visual things like flashing lights or just a bad feeling like I had and others that will last long enough for them to get to a safe place. I never got much of a warning so I was constantly anxious that it would happen. I went through a period of pretty bad depression until we got it under control. I have somewhat of a family history of epilepsy. A distant cousin has it really badly and my aunt had the same type of seizures when she was my age but eventually grew out of them so Im hoping I will too. ,Unexpected,cv5d08s,1,t5_2w67q

Normally as you compress that mixture the compression heats the airfuel to a point where it will combust. In older diesel engines I guess they couldnt regulate the air fuel mixture accurately enough to ignite a cold engine. I dont know when exactly glow plugs went the way of the dodo but I think it was around the time of the advent of EFICommon rail injection. But Im just a relatively new driver so who knows. As an aside in the process of getting diesel to ignite outside a combustion chamber remember that you need fuel heat and air for a fire.

7545901,0,t1_d2zvk9n,I...actually think you are right and wrong on this and the area is most definitely gray. In the film the lower level guys are literally just trying to do their jobs. I can absolutely imagine there are some people out there who just love to play with numbers and finance is that. They form the backbone of the analysts that made the calls saw it happening early and simply passed that information to the upper levels. Then those upper levels also did their jobs and made decisions that would lose the company as little money as possible. Those upper levels were the same people who chose CDOs and mortgage backed securities when they first came out because they made a ton of money. No matter what industry to work in finance or otherwise the bottom line matters. When push came to shove Walmart chose cheap labor that was morally questionable. Same with the auto industry same with Nike whatever. I think that while the blame is shared it really needs to go onto the government regulation and possibly the rating agencies heads this time around. If this was so obvious as these films seem to portray then why didnt anyone step in earlier and put a stop to this risky behavior before it became so large as to tank our economy? Answer Because even the regulators were making too much to care enough to do something about it. ,Unexpected,d2zxkg9,12,t5_2w67q

I opened up several revolving credit accounts that I pay off monthly. My theory out of  small businesses fail in the first year. That means  out of  owners get to a point where they are desperate. They will do anything to save the thing theyve put their blood sweat and tears into. When someone offers an unsecured line of credit they dont even think twice or read the terms. With bankruptcy looming they make a payment or  then end up having to file anyways. These predatory companies then are listed as a creditor on the bankruptcy filing for k not the original k. They get a fraction of their k from the debtor. They end up with a lot more than they loaned out on average because they are only sending these to people with at least a little chance of some sort of payoff or assets.AgreeDisagree?TLDR Predatory lenders are fucked up. ,Unexpected,d53l4dn,13,t5_2w67q

They were disappointing because they both had some really good moments in them which they rushed through in order to get on with what they decided to go with as the main plot.Somewhat spoilersBvS Batman finally got that horror movie intro which he deserves being the terror of the night and whatever  good stuff. Wish there was more of that in that movie and less of Superman feels sad about stuff and additional superheroes shoved in last minute to make the plot only sort of work. Still an okay movie but it could have been so much better.Suicide Squad Introduced nonjoker Big Bad right away focused on a nonsensical plot. Really disappointing there. HOWEVER there were still some really good moments involving the backstories of the characters. Really nailed those I feel especially those involving Batman.

When my sisters get new chairs the old ones are kept for parts. Theyre fortunate enough that my father was a doctor and my mother is an expert at making the system work for them. My sisters disabilities are degenerative. Sometimes it doesnt matter if we have all the right parts to fix the chair. Severe scoliosis is a bitch and the only thing that can improve their modest quality of life is a new chair. Repaired refurbished doesnt matter. The chair has to fit the user to be most effective.

While you were in your insulated bubble over in rRedacted some of us other Democrats fed up with the propaganda started doing some digging. As it turns out Clinton was quite guilty of many of the things the left was demonizing Trump for Ill stick to foreign affairs. Remember Clinton getting cozy with Kissinger?  this is why Kissinger is her mentorgtDefinitions of Terrorism in U.S. Code  U.S.C.   defines international terrorism and domestic terrorism for purposes of Chapter B of the U.S. Code entitled Terrorism.gtInternational terrorism means activities with the following three characteristicsgtInvolve violent acts or acts dangerous to human life that violate federal or state lawAppear to be intended    i to intimidate or coerce a civilian population    ii to influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion or     iii to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction assassination or kidnapping andOccur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction of the U.S. or transcend national boundaries in terms of the means by which they are accomplished the persons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce or the locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asylum.      First the Email in Question  Note it was Published on gtAt the same time we should return to plans to provide the FSA or some group of moderate forces with equipment that will allow them to deal with a weakened ISIL and stepped up operations against the Syrian regime. This entire effort should be done with a low profile avoiding the massive traditional military operations that are at best temporary solutions. While this militaryparamilitary operation is moving forward we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of Qatar and Saudi Arabia which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to ISIL and other radical Sunni groups in the region.This is hard evidence that the US destabilized Africa in order to get Clinton elected. This is how Secretary Clinton empowered ISIS. Assange outlines how Clinton committed Treason not merely PaytoPlay Now pay attention because it is far more subtle and not nearly as inflammatory as American audiences would like. Dartmouth Films. Clinton knew that Saudi Arabia and Qatar were arming ISIS while Secretary of State and they still gave weapons to Saudi Arabia and Qatar though we knew them to fit the FBIs definition of Terrorism. This is giving aid and comfort to an enemy of the state by using the state department.Heritage.org sites the US Constitution defining TreasongtTreason against the United States shall consist only in levying War against them or in adhering to their Enemies giving them Aid and Comfort. No Person shall be convicted of Treason unless on the Testimony of two Witnesses to the same overt Act or on Confession in open Court.gtARTICLE III SECTION  CLAUSE  Before anyone criticizes to say its RussiaToday propaganda It was produced by Dartmouth Films a UK film company and sold to broadcasters outside of the UK RT being one of them. He talks about Wikileaks criticism of Russia anyways. Full transcript availableCNN reported that ISIS was armed with American Weapons in December  just a few months after The Guardian reportedgt a recently declassified secret US intelligence report written in August  which uncannily predicts  and effectively welcomes  the prospect of a Salafist principality in eastern Syria and an alQaidacontrolled Islamic state in Syria and Iraq. In stark contrast to western claims at the time the Defense Intelligence Agency document identifies alQaida in Iraq which became Isis and fellow Salafists as the major forces driving the insurgency in Syria  and states that western countries the Gulf states and Turkey were supporting the oppositions efforts to take control of eastern Syria.If you are a liberal ask yourself how you feel about IranContra and if you want to be the one defending it for the next  years The Gaurdian because this mass migration taking place in Europe is the biggest thing to happen there since WW NPRThis brings us to The Refugee Crisis BBC in Europe. This is projected to cost Germany alone well north of a Trillion dollars Express over the next  decades.

ISIS has claimed responsibility for attacks CBS on Belgium when they bombed the airport at Brussels NYT France at Charlie Hebdo and Bataclan theater NYT Australia Russia Lebanon and others that could potentially lay financial culpability on the US. This has had significant effect on international relationships too that threaten the longest peace in western Europe since Augustus Caeser.

By weakening the EU with Brexit ABC as a result of xenophobic fears Europe faces a crisisgtAt stake purely and simply Mr Valls added is the breakup of the union. We have to invent another Europe. BBCThe US created the Refugee Crisis in Europe and is why Turkey may leave NATO This is why Russia may invade the rest of Ukraine. This is why Trump wants to build a wallIn short Assange did not overhype the ramifications of US involvement in Syria.Its worth noting that nothing in the Assange video suggests Assange is safe in the Embassy. Watch it again and you may see the edit where you dont see Pilger ask the question about the FBI investigation and Assange only makes a statement about the purpose of the FBI. Also Pilger makes a statement about the last week of the campaign and Assange never addresses that statement. There is no establishing shot. Do you remember the Daily Show interviews and how they were cut? The only dates tied to the video are  referencing the Saudi Arabia funding Assanges internet being cutoff and the Moroccan King email released  Those dates are important because it is speculated that Assange was taken from the embassy on the thst of October.

Theyre more or less leeching off of the profits of the warehouse workers or whatever the bottom is considered the sales people and whomever else is involved. The laborers generate the income yet the system is so backwards that they generally make the least amount of money.So if we were focused on who creates the most value for other people the IT guy would have negative numbers. The system is entirely broken. And Im not saying there shouldnt be IT Im saying that this is why ownership of the company should be a collective of all the laborers and sales people. Everyone should have a voice and with the numbers in hand be able to vote for things like their own pay and benefits.

When that happens most people will automatically continue turning the wheel the direction they want to turn turning it much further than necessary. Then your wheels suddenly gain traction again once his left wheel hits asphalt again jerk the car way too hard in the direction you turned and once you start spinning like that its almost impossible to recover.The fact that his left wheel is right on the painted lines and how sudden the jerk to the right is make me think this is much more likely.

They were common practice in lifethreatening extremity bleeding during the Vietnam era then a bunch of people got concerned about limb ischemia and they got a really bad stigma to the point that most places werent using them in the field anymore. Then a bunch of experience came out of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan showing that they saved lives in incredible numbers and limb ischemia wasnt as big of a concern and now every cop and medic I know carries a CAT tourniquet or some other quick tourniquet on them at all times.For context when it comes to tourniquet time hand surgeons and orthopedic surgeons do elective surgeries all the time with tourniquets on for an hour plus and dont have problems with limb ischemia.,Unexpected,dell7ng,2,t5_2w67q

When I turned into the other lane to look I didnt shoulder check and it was the only mark I got against me. I asked the instructor who was really cool why I should bother when there shouldnt be a car behind me and they told me that the day I choose to check and there is a car or maybe even a biker or pedestrian Id be thankful I checked. Dont assume that everyone one the road is in your head and know what youre about to do. Even if youre signalling you should be careful.

You still should check your mirrors because its nice to not die but assuming everybody drives legally you dont have to.But in OPs video its a dirt road there is no intersection.

Were discussing this incident in this country. Negating the rest of that argument. Also yes ill concede I didnt convey my meaning very clearly if you look at the road the officer is turning into it seems more like a dirt roaddrive way. It doesnt look like an actual roadjunction therefore nothing to indicate a driver would be making a left turn as it isnt very clearly seen until upon it. So for the last time this over taking manoeuvre was both completely safe and legal to perform at the time of performing it in Poland where it was performed. As has already been decided by the court in the country in which this incident occurred. That may sound like im being condescending but understand im not. I realise in other countries and probably more particularly your own you would be completely right. I accept that. Unfortunately were not discussing those countries were discussing Poland and this incident thus making your comments wrong. Sorry thats just the way it is. Peace out ,Unexpected,dfu0ket,1,t5_2w67q

11626791,0,t1_dgdugy0,Its ok. Many motorcyclists are doing it for more than just a hobby. We accept the risk for a more environmentally friendly way of commuting to and from work with cheaper running costs and in many places in the world a much much shorter commute. I save  for every km I drive my bike on fuel costs alone. Thats before factoring in than an oil change is  the cost over the same distance tires cost about the same over all with replacement but other parts and services are much cheaper and easily done myself without the hr service cost of a mechanic. My car sits still in the summer time because its so sooo much cheaper to ride my bike everywhere. Problem is that a lot of people like you dont see it as anything more than a hobby. You dont see the guy driving everyday back and forth to work rain or shine you dont see the people who cant afford anything but a small  to get around on. Its just a toy to you but not to many of us.

11781353,0,t1_dgvfzmy,If their ancestors were heavily predated millions of years ago there could have been selective pressure for them to have as many offspring at once as possible and devote all of their resources and effort into making sure the eggs hatch. Something like  of the offspring actually survive to adulthood so theyre another species that uses the shotgun accuracy strategy for breeding  just have a fuck ton of them because a few will live to reproduce. But then as other evolutionary pressures shift and change there isnt really a downside to them dying after breeding. Or rather its not a negative selective pressure. Nature only cares about reproduction so their potential intelligence growth being heavily handicapped is irrelevant in the greater scheme.,Unexpected,dgvgd1b,1,t5_2w67q
