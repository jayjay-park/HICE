651233,0,t3_21e2ih,Heya  Im a fresh meat trainer and someone who struggled with crossovers for WEEKS. The most common problems I see in fresh meat class for crossovers  Lack of balance on the left foot.  Lack of trust in the right foot to catch you. A crossover is a bit of a controlled fall.  inability to bend the knees enough to get past kneepads during the motion  failure to push off with the left foot. Thats where the power comes from  FRONT TRUCKS TOO TIGHT. When I teach crossovers we start by learning to do single foot glides. These require a lot of core work balance and also the ability to know where to put your weight. Standing around the house in skates on one foot helps a ton. Slightly loosened front trucks also help a ton. They feel weird at first but trust me on this one. You want to be able to get deep into a crossoverlean on a turn without any wheels coming off the floor. Step  in crossovers the motion. We do a whole lap where we face the track standing on the outside line and step right foot over left foot. then left foot to the left into a normal position. On skates there are two different ways that new skaters keep the balance. Some put their hands near their core as if they have a big dinnerplate belt buckle to show off. Some do Jazz hands. Step  same as step  except facing the other way and stepping left BEHIND right. Step  combine the above. Single foot glide left Step over shift to a single foot glide on the right by pushing outward with the left foot You should show suicide seating the bottom of your left skate at the end of your push Good luck  weve all been in this exact place. ,rollerderby,cgeamxm,1,t5_2s1zv

1038393,0,t3_25zciw,Is this a house team or a competitive team? What is your leagues view on playing to win skater development have fun? Does everyone pay the same dues? Should not then everyone get the same amount of time playing? Is there a way to set up a rotation of players? Its difficult to stay motivated and give  if you feel as though you wont have a shot at being rostered anyway.  years is your season a year? Ours are. of not passing mins wokring hard and finally passing mins and still not getting rostered.... If I was in this position and my coach reached out to me the last thing I would want would be to be told to give . Thats what I was doing and it wasnt good enough. Taking her feelings into open discussion with league members sounds pretty daunting also and I would probably vent to a friend or two before I went to the board of directors. I dont know what was said so very possible Im misinterpreting your paragraph. I could be off base but she sounds super discouraged. You say you expect her to push herself in light of not being rostered? I wonder if that sentiment might just be the straw that broke the camels back. She finally passed mins and while I dont agree with a sense of entitlement that must have been a huge let down to be one of only  players not rostered after her hard work to pass. Maybe she doesnt feel as though shes got anyone in her corner which is why she spoke to outside sources about her frustrations. Honestly I can relate. Ive seen countless freshies rostered ahead of me while coaches either outright ignore me and tell me I was absent for practice I wasnt or alternately while coaches and players tell me how awesome I am and how I just have to stick with it. Ive had other teams approach me asking why I dont play since we all scrimmage together occasionally. Ive had my mins for almost  years and still havent been rostered. In fact Ive had coaches tell me they forgot about me when creating the roster before. Ive recently been made an alternate zebra after a season of reffing despite us having fewer than  refs. I still ref outside our county though. Everyone just says Relax and just play derby! but when youre putting the hard work in without getting the fun of playing and bonding with your team mates its very isolating and discouraging.,rollerderby,chmbj7c,7,t5_2s1zv

1516404,0,t3_2bkjx4,What we do is get a number and thats where we are in the lineup. We know who our lineup buddies are and we stick to that order. If someone gets thrown in a box the next numbers go out and then that person just gets back into the order as quickly as possible. It usually goes to hell halfway through the second half but I kinda like that because then I get to play with my other teammates too. It works pretty well because it cuts down on abusing the star players and the coaches are pretty good at mixing in players of different skill levels so there is a more consistent performance no matter which  players are hitting the floor. ,rollerderby,cj6cw5l,1,t5_2s1zv

1543919,0,t1_cj9rxjd,More popular sports have leagues and each team is assigned points for wins. This doesnt work for nonhouse teams. It could also work for WFTDA sanctioned play but not for the  majority of derby being played today. League play works for more popular sports like softball and hockey because there are multiple teams in the same league in the same city. It doesnt work for derby in circumstances where tiny teams have to travel hours to play. I agree that close games are far more exciting to watch!  ECDX Windy vs. Philly for example. I actually chose to not watch a very rare WFTDA sanctioned bout a few weeks ago because the teams werent closely ranked. ,rollerderby,cj9sye7,1,t5_2s1zv
1554215,0,t3_2bxec1,Maybe this will be an unpopular thing to say but sometimes I wonder if the world needs quite as many roller derby leagues so close together. I live in a state where leagues are popping up in every tiny town with three stop lights and a gas station. I myself belong to a league thats the second league a kind of redheaded stepchild if you will forgive the expression in a big city. I sometimes wonder if our city really needed two leagues. I think a lot of time other leagues sprout up because of personality conflicts that could be resolved. Some of the fledgling organizations then fail because of competition for resources duespaying members practice and bout space. Look at what happened to ROSI in Evansville ROSI was a fullfledged WFTDA team but only Demolition City the original league still operates. But then again look at a city like Denver which has sustained two really highquality teams for years. Chicagos doing pretty well too. Anyway Im not suggesting a particular course of action. I love the advice that BrigetteBane offers above. Those are all great options. Your team is worth fighting for if there is a group people who want to fight for it. But you also sound like you might just want a blessing and permission to transfer to the other league. I think thats okay too. With regards to the merger idea and some of your members balking at attendance requirements it reminded me of my own league. We started out as a more casual alternative to the more established league in town. But it quickly evolved from its rec league origins and now were WFTDA competitive have stringent attendance requirements and are only continuing in that direction. There were a few people who balked at this along the way and some who dropped out of roller derby  altogether. The majority of us have stayed on. I should say we also now have Derby Lite in our community which is a great option for those who wish to skate and be involved in derby culture without being competitive. Anyway my general hope is that people can find what they need from derby be it a high level of dedication and competitiveness to just fun and fitness. We are still in a growth period being a relatively new sport and I think the number of leagues will even out to what is sustainable in the long run. ,rollerderby,cjb3eq6,7,t5_2s1zv

5410653,0,t3_3p5fqv,The bag used here is a cheap Jansport bag with two internal sections and a front pouch that the skates would eventually go in.  The skates could easily fit partially in the pouch to begin with but not fully.  The front pouch is two inches deep and approximately eight by eleven inches in profile. The skates sit in the front pocket with the heel at the base and their wheels facing out.  The ankle of these Moxi skates are nested on top of each other.  The base of the boot is fairly secure with the bag cupping the base of the heel. They are held in place by a lace bythat secures the skates by the middle of the plate and wraps around the top truck to tie at the top of the bag. There are several ways that most steps of this back could be executed.  None of the supplies used are mandatory except for basic sewing tools and materials.  Different ways to complete each step will be included so dont fret if you dont have a sewing machine or grommet press laying around.  Step  Initial CutThe front pocket needs to be slit with one long cut on each side.  Find the middle of the top of the pouch and mark one inch out on each side this  section will remain uncut. The pouch is around  deep the cut should be in the middle or one inch from either seam.  The cut should be as even and straight as possible.   Start the cut with a pilot cut outside of the twoinch section originally marked.  After there is a small hole use scissors the make the rest of the cut.  End the cut on the side of the pouch before it extends to the base where the skate heel will rest.  Step  Prevent FrayingThe first cuts will probably have cut across a few seams and exposed two or more layers of fabric that make up the outside of the bag.  These edges will ravel fall apart and tear if they are left as is.  The cut needs to be sewed around on all sides either by hand or with a sewing machine.  The stitch does not have to be exactly on the edge.   Step  Reinforcing the CutThe bag now has two cuts and there is a quick stitch around the cut.  There are four ends of the cuts that will rip through if weight is put in the bag as is.  The bag can be reinforced with a sewing machine and a thick satin stitch or sewing a square of canvas over the end of the cut.           Sewing machine Select a satin stitch that is wide and tight.  Connect both ends of the cuts on top even extending slightly into the cuts. The edges will pull together when you sew out into the cut sew back into the bag afterwards.  Repeat this at the bottom ends of the cuts starting at least half an inch away from the cut end.            Hand sewing Find a piece of canvas or heavy fabric that is at least the size of the space between the top cuts.  Sew around the edge of the canvas with strong thread several times.  Give extra attention to the area closest to the cuts.  Repeat this at the bottom ends of the cuts with at least a x square or enough to cover the entire base.  Step  Securing the Skates Grommet clasp VelcroThe skates can now sit in the pouch but only loosely they need something to hold them in place.  Place the skates in the pouch and find where the middle of the plate is mark the location.  These marks will be where you stitch the clasps or Velcro.  This is also the location of the first grommets.  Place the final grommets at the top of the bag.   Step  The Back PatchThis was actually the most time consuming step.  Iron fabric adhesive onto the patch.  Cut the patch to your desired size with the paper still attached.  Set and hold the patch over the front pocket.  Set the scissors in the zipper track and cut.  Begin ironing the patch on starting at the edge next to the zipper.  Repeat this with the second half of the patch. This project can easily be completed in an afternoon with a sewing machine.  I have been asked what the size of the skates vs. the bag pocket is. The skates are a size six and the pocket is xx.  My skates are about  wide . from heel to toe and around  high from the plate to the top of the boot.  What the pocket can hold will expand greatly after the cuts are made.   Any size skate should fit but may need additional support.,rollerderby,cw39r6q,3,t5_2s1zv

6022318,0,t3_3xqlqo,There is a term that was coined by someone a while back called jamnesia  A condition in which a skater experiences partial or total memory loss of the previous jam. Its meant to be funny and silly but it is so accurate at times it hurts. When a jammer is on the track their key focus is to get through that pack and if her teammates are making that harder for her shes going to probably yell and she may not even recall doing it. She may not realize how aggressive she sounds or a variety of other things. I yell at people on my team and occasionally at the other team haha and dont remember half of what I say. They do it back. Its how we learn to play better and how we figure out where we need to be. Your job is to try everything you can to not take it personally and realize it is part of the game and how communication is done in the heat of the moment. Focus on following key tipspointersadvice and eventually you may be the one helping that rookie out by telling her where to be or putting her their yourself. If they are yelling at you to get back and then once off the track they get aggressive or negative directly at you then its a little different and should possibly be addressed to your bodleadershipcoaches or something because that is when it becomes personal. If they are just trying to explain themselves or talk to you no harm no foul. If they call you an idiot for not being in the right spot or bad mouth you etc... then its escalated and an issue. As for the conflict within the league  super standard and normal. All leagues experience this even RoseRatGotham etc My league has taken to having a sports psychologist give us training sessions every so often so we can learn to communicate with each other successfully on and off the track and help with conflict like this.  ,rollerderby,cy91rvm,1,t5_2s1zv

7105657,0,t1_d1ls4av,It sounds like maybe your league has experienced this before  a ref gets certified and leaves and carry some baggage. Its okay that happens. Especially in small leagues. Reffing can take you a lot of places mostly physically and there are many refs and skaters that do some traveling for derby fall in love with a city and move there! I think the important thing for them to understand that being a certified ref can help bring confidence that they are understanding the rules properly and give your officiating crew better access to people who can make clarifications when you get confusedunsure WFTDA Forums are a huge god send of information. Remind them that they should WANT to have good refs and being certified isnt what makes you good or any better than an uncertified ref but it does give you a standard you can set for yourself. As for payment Clinic is ONLY required for level  certification. I personally did attend a clinic but was never a level  ref. When I applied I was granted level  automatically. The clinic costs  if I recall and it is VERY VERY well worth the time and money. Im not sure Ive ever heard of a ref paying their own way if so it is rare because the attendance can be VERY helpful to skaters as well. Attending a clinic allows you to learn the rules from the people who basically write them. A great group leads clinics and everytime I attend I learn something. All that said you can get level  WITHOUT a clinic attendance. The test is HARD it took me  times to pass. I only know of one person who passed it on first shot. They do not frown on failures or number of times takenit is a hard test they know that.The biggest part of certification is evals. Does your team do written evals for you? They should even if youre NOT trying to cert. Written feedback is a great way to understand you strengths and weaknesses and reflect on them outside the craziness of the game. I recommend having them fill out evals for you and just you and working on your skills that way.You CAN receive evals from your own league though cert likes to see evals from other leagues so they might carry more weight. You need  evals for level  but I recommend more than that because it helps give cert more information. Most people do not get cert because of a bad eval they dont get cert because the evals didnt provide enough information. You want a mix of skater league rep and HR evals for cert. And while you CAN have them from your own league I recommend making sure you have a few others in the mix as well. This may mean traveling a little but it doesnt mean you have to ONLY do derby. Find some places you want to travel and email their refs explain you live in a small town with few opportunities to officiate other leagues and youll be in their town during X bout. Ask if they would allow you to join them. I drive an hour our of my city about every month to ref a league who doesnt have refs. That doesnt mean Im not constantly helping my own league. You mention you live in a small town? Where about? I might be able to point you in the direction of some good resources for your area.The most important thing to remember if certification is an award of excellence not a baseline. You can be a GREAT ref and not be certified. I know many. But it sounds like you might have an itch and without access to people who have experienced itbeen around it it can be harder to learn.,rollerderby,d1lst4y,2,t5_2s1zv

Keep your arms at your sides and try to sneak through walls instead of pounding through them.

Works pretty well so long as I dont lose my footing and more often than not it will create a seam because Im pushing with a knife and not a hammer if that makes sense.

They are very responsive but also feel stable and predictable. Theyre a touch more expensive than Falcons and Avengers and slightly heavier but with the Kingpin upgrade there isnt a lot of difference.For me with very small feet a higher kingpin angle would be too much so the  angle of the Venus was a good compromise. However I do believe theres a lot more to plates than just the KP angle. The mount for one thing will probably impact the feel of your set up more.

8510853,0,t1_d65dxrf,Thank you Thankfully what were going to work on is going to be grounded in things that most of us have done before. Ie paceline drills  weve done pacelines before so im doing some drills that branch off of pacelines. Were also going to do a pyramid as weve done a loose one before and weve all done laps this will be the wee endurance segment. And then were going to start lateral jumps. Weve already done plenty of jumping on the spot and while rolling forward so those who are uncomfortable moving on will still get some jumping practice  as will the one who hasnt done jumping  and those who are comfortable moving on to the other stuff can do so. Hrm. Oh dear. I hadnt quite thought of that though some of my drills are looking like theyd take longer than Id imagine anyway. But Ive got a wee idea of how to make my skatersteammates hate me if we have spare time ie hellThats the plan  We tend to do that when we have our regular coachesguests showing skills and describing drills so Im planning to use that too.Also a good point! I invested in a fox  pealess whistle and holy crap its louder than I expected and one of our drills will use that. Ill remember to demonstrate before the drill itself. I was worried about that tbh. There will be two times at least where I wont be able to do the skill were doing to start off with  the lateral hop though I plan to try it before we start it as a group and the duck walk as Im going to try the  sec lap with the group today and so far we only do toe stop runs to start at speed. But we will have a guest there tonight who has offered to help me out and she should be able to help display the skills. Thanks for letting me know I dont have to worry about it.

9577707,0,t3_5c2csq,I do agree with those whove said practice falling although there were times I simply got taken out by another skater and couldnt help falling straight down on my butt. I knew how to fall correctly but there are some who dont and can cause you to fall badly. ,rollerderby,d9tnbxp,2,t5_2s1zv
9614693,0,t1_d9y5clt,Thank you so much! I love this. And youre entirely right Im learning and starting to improve. Ive told my fianc multiple times Im convinced I had such a bad fall cause my wheels are really really hard and Ive been meaning to buy softer wheels but havent been able to exactly afford it. But I really love this sport its so much support that Ive never felt and it really is becoming a family to me. Id hate to see those feelings go away and just toss it aside. ,rollerderby,d9y7isa,2,t5_2s1zv

10043826,0,t3_5i6127,Get lower no lower than that. You feel like you are too low? You need to be a bit lower.   So that is kind of a joke but it really does help. But make sure you are getting your hips low not just bending more at the waist. Keep your back straight and more or less perpendicular to the floor with your head up.  Push out with your heels and bring your knees together. Keep your head up pick a point on the wall and stare at it. And make sure to engage your core to keep your upper body from flapping about. Based on some of the other comments your wheels might be a bit too soft to get a good plow you do need a little bit of slip. One thing you could try to get the feel of the slip you need is one foot plows extend one foot in front of you a little maybe  or  skate lengths keep most of your weight on the back foot and turn the front foot in to stop. If you are doing it right you should get some slipscreechjudder that will give you a bit of a feel for what you should be aiming at in a full plow.  ,rollerderby,dbgqimm,1,t5_2s1zv
10309474,0,t1_dccguai,Id totally accept other studies done on on other sports. Id just be interested in seeing one done on derby itself. Ive seen one break on a heavier inexperienced girl. The other breaks have been on smaller very experienced skaters who just fell wrong. Interesting how experiences differ. Im  lbs and have had a sprained knee once when I was a newer skater. Strength and muscle composition go a long way towards preventing injuries. Im strong always have been even when  at my least in shape. I think the injuries occurring are not neccessarily because of weight. My thought is that its because many overweight people are out of shape with very little muscle mass.Its an interesting topic.,rollerderby,dccmv0v,2,t5_2s1zv

10467820,0,t1_dcujevm,Everything was bought at Walmart.I used regular old acrylic paint as the base and paint pens for the flowers. Then I used glitter spray and like  coats of glitter sealer spray. I painted this back in June and no chips so far. The only thing I would do differently is wait longer for the base to completely dry or just freehand the flowers. It was a pain sometimes the paint wouldnt come out of the pens. The whole process took me about  hours.,rollerderby,dcumugp,1,t5_2s1zv
10609399,0,t1_dda1pp7,I totally know this too but for whatever reason havent done it. In the time Ive had these skates Ive ordered  sets of wheels  pairs of laces and new toe stops so theres really no excuse.,rollerderby,ddaa16e,1,t5_2s1zv

10840180,0,t3_5uxfje,What really blew my crossovers out of the water was taking a speed skating class where one of the drills was sticky skate sprinting. You have to get super low and start crossing over without lifting your foot. If you are able to spend a few rink sessions doing only sticky skates doing things like bringing your feet in line with each other switching which foot is in front without lifting up skating as long as possible on one foot will get you used to switching your weight around too.,rollerderby,ddy366p,3,t5_2s1zv
10847457,0,t1_ddv364k,Its completely different! It was almost like I was a newborn calf on ice. I got the Atom Pulse mm wheels with some Bont Race bearings so theyre pretty squishy and I think I need to break them in.  Cheers for your tips!! ,rollerderby,ddyu7qp,1,t5_2s1zv
10977089,0,t1_debijj4,Yeh Ive done that cold muscle stretch tweaking an injury groin muscles too before which is what prompted my research on stretching. So quick and easy to aggravate an injury and then ages for it to heal.I absolutely love street and skate park skating.

11424432,0,t1_dfqws0g,Oh man socks seem like such a personal preference thing. Some folks skate barefoot others like kneehigh socks that with crazy patterns. I like running socks that are thicker and offer a bit more support for my archesankles they also help make up for skates that are just a tad too big. And that really ends up being a trialanderror situation. As to your original question... I just wear whatever fullcoverage relatively light colored thing is closest to the top of the drawer. I think most are from Target or Aerie they have great for sales every so often!. ,rollerderby,dfqy4uu,1,t5_2s1zv
11538646,0,t3_64kwcy,Toe stops  lyfe. Give me an inch on that line and Im gone. Also rule awareness and tactics. Recently drew a cut when I noticed a jammer getting ready to hit off the start so I gave her my back before the whistle. Boom. Back block. Or if Im pushed out Ill sneak my hips in first as theyre turning to sprint back to avoid the cut and get away before they have a chance to swallow me.Im also really good at being punched in the face and not smudging my makeup.,rollerderby,dg3wotw,3,t5_2s1zv
11614154,0,t3_64c5jj,I was briefly involved with someone during my freshmeat who was very manipulative and ultimately dumped me and started going out with another girl in the bootcamp.  I was already anxious on skates and this experience made my anxiety spiral out of control.  I became quiet and withdrawn from the other skaters and her new girlfriend was one of the first rookies to be drafted. I starting avoiding some practices and it was just a bit of a mess...Anyways the best advice given to me was to take everything step by step.  You went to practice you took a step forward.  Everything you do is a mini step.  It helped me to avoid panicking about the situation and just recognizing the fact that I was slowly getting better.  It also helped when I began socializing with other skaters and focusing on how happy I was with them.  I think when you get involved with someone at the beginning of your derby experience you tend to associate them with the sport.  At least for me I had it in my head that her and I were going to practice together and it would be fun and awesome and then it hurt to watch that crumble and to have another girl get drafted and date the person I had feelings for.    I still occasionally feel uncomfortable around them but in the past few months Ive met so many cool people and bit by bit it has gotten a LOT better.  So my advice is to focus on yourself and take mini steps   It sounds cheesy as hell but it really worked for me!,rollerderby,dgch338,1,t5_2s1zv
