9188678,0,t3_560z2a,Very valid question. The intent is to actually replace the skill system with a more intuitive one. We have lots of awesome ideas for additional skills but before they get added the new system for how they are accessed needs to be scaffolded out completely.One of the big things that the feedback has shown is that the current random triggered events on hit arent that fun. This is mainly because they dont affect how you plat the game much at all. The remedy that we are going forward with is the system that the randomchance fire arrows have. Where instead of any random event being on hit they occur when the arrow is drawn from the quiver ie. for the chain lightning the arrow tip would be charged with electricity to show that if it hits a chain lightning effect would occur. This allows you to see the arrow changed and target an enemy accordingly.Additionally I have been working on an activation ability system so that the trigger on your bow hand controller would infuse power into the currently nocked arrow.Ultimately I am trying to design the systems to be really extensible so that if we think of a cool new ability then its not a ton of work to implement it. And thats why there havent been any new abilities recently. Still building up a much more robust abilityeffect system so that in the future we can have way more options.,quivrgame,d8gqdhv,9,t5_3f5a9

Everything you described in your summary sounds great.  The price point seems fair to me also.   I think the unique Diablo style items is a excellent idea....  love that great loot.   Only thing I would empathize is that in my opinion the teamwork multiplayer is what truely makes QuiVR shine.   Lets not forget this.    Tight interaction with other players is what makes the battle feel like a real accomplishment  and it fulfills that feeling of comradery.,quivrgame,d8ywzsz,1,t5_3f5a9
