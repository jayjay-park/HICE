My issue with the whole ordeal is that she barely makes arguments and people jump all over her videos like shes trying to tear apart gaming as a hobby.  Thats with barely any critique  literally just listing trends.Nearly everything I say nearly because there are some arguments out there about their content thrown at the videos are tone arguments.  Shes too dry.  She throws in humor the next episode  I didnt appreciate the snarky jokes.  Why is she talking about old games?

245489,0,t1_cf64tax,well in previous versions items such as weapons wands and jewelery didnt automatically identify you had to test them by wieldingwearingzapping which was risky and fun. You could end up having a crappy weapon stuck to your hand crippling your combat ability. If the weapon was blunt you also couldnt butcher corpses your main source of food anymore. Wands also had to be tested by zapping them at an enemy which could either paralyze them or turn them invisible. Again riskymore fun.You could either do all that or use a valuable scroll to safely identify the item.With the current system weapons automatically identify when you wield them and cursed blunt weapons dont prevent butchery and wands identify by zapping them at a wall. Its safe and therefore boring erasing an interesting aspect of the game.,SRSGaming,cf6745c,1,t5_2t5qh

If you accept that everyone behind a usernamecharacterinternetwhatever is a human then you have to realize that they will make mistakes.  Ive never been perfect.  Even though I know better now Ive said some shitty things but the second that you label someone as a shithead for life everyone has lost.  I couldnt name a turning point for myself but just as Zoe Quinn explained the idea of internet empathy just clicks for people.  Maybe it was a post on rgoldredditsays or maybe it was something that someone said to me in a game but it doesnt matter.  The point is saying something at whatever level you feel appropriate to the situation might just work.EDIT Watching the QampA section now and Zoe kinda makes this point.The main game I play these days is WoW which while its not a MOBA has a reputation of toxicity in its community.  Ive been a leader of raiding guilds for  years now and Ive never tolerated hate speech or personal attacks from anyone.  The not cool thing really does work but the game allows me to confront people in whispers or one on one where a maybe we could cool it with this? comment is very effective.  Often times Ive regretted not saying something sooner because its worked so well.I guess that what Im trying to say is that for every ten redditors that complains to you about freeze peach there might be one person who takes it to heart.

1150625,0,t3_278eeq,Ive got it on android I got it on the last android bundle. Ive put more hours into it than any other mobile games but i dont rate it highly. The concept is good but the execution is kind of poor. To give a few examples Theres a stealth element in that you can lower the noise of weapons but as far as I can tell theres no tactical advantage to be gained especially at higher difficulties when I feel youre leagues better off minmaxing for the highest DPS possible. The AI often knows exactly where you are even if you stay out of line of sight and make no noise.to test this I once put a unit outside a door and left it outside of the map. A shotgun ai beelined straight to the door and shot my unit in the face Theres a lot of customization in terms of skills gear weapons etc. which I like though the number of available weapons is made to appear  higher than it is  most of the guns you can buy are just vanilla guns with addons that you can easily build yourself anyway. Line of sight doesnt exist in the game like it does with other tactics games think XCOM Frozen synapse in dark mode if youve played those. Rather if you open a door into a room you instantly know the position of every person in the room and you will during the rest of the mission including walking into other rooms. If youre in an outdoor location you can see everyone.I play frozen synapse and Im fairly certain that its cheaper and deeper gameplay wise than BampC though I must admit that customizing your team is quite fun. Its still fun to play especially considering its on android.,SRSGaming,chz258q,2,t5_2t5qh

Plus all the LGBTQ themes lt Ive picked up the sequel Hate Plus in the Steam sale early since I wanted to get a start on it.Ive also been playing Papers Please since I got that in the Steam sale too. Its so stressful and emotionally demanding I cant play it for stretches at a time. Its a fascinating look at bureaucracy and the emotional and moral dilemmas it poses to you under the surface of the gameplay are I think very important. Clunky gameplay though but thats not really the point of it.Ive also devoted a little time to Bravely Default which Ive wanted to play for awhile but only just now got my hands on. I love my JRPGs!

I do agree there needs to be some quality control for Steam but the issue is Greenlight exists as it does to circumvent the normal publisher method of submitting games.

So for instance you can move fast to avoid being hit but you risk over heating and not being able to hit anything either.  Because of all that the rules take some getting used to but the new starter set comes with  heavy gauge cheat sheets that are amazing.  The starter box also comes with  or so minis to get you started and there are literally hundreds of different minis for the system if you grab the technical readouts on amazon.  Most games are going to run between  and  models per person and you can actually have very interesting games with just one or .

The elf god Corellon Larethian is often seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic for example and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellons image. You could also play a female character who presents herself as a man a man who feels trapped in a female body or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male.

Also the fun side effect of the explosives skill is throwing dynamite at groups of enemies especially after Ive set up fields of fire before attacking with the sniper and luring enemies into my kill zones.  Lionheart is sort of the melee sponge which worked for the rabbits so they had to attack him first while getting filled full of lead and electricity.  Im also enjoying all the strange secondary uses for skills like how surgeon can be used in the AG center for something besides treating a fallen teammate and hacking bypassed my having to look for a spare part.  But also elsewhere it got me some free turret allies.  In all this is every bit the game Ive been waiting for.Civ V SRS GMR update Ive been attacked by barbarians  times.  I dont know why they like me so much...Gauntlet I have to admit the new Gauntlet game is really fun for quick online coop fixes and they managed to get the feel of the original games back while making every class feel unique useful and fun.  I still love the Wizard though.Bravely Default Now that I have actual CRPGs back Im liking this game a lot less and its starting to remind me why I used to hate JRPGs.Blackwell Legacy After finishing The Shivah I decided to dive back into this.  Its not nearly as short and the puzzles are less immediately challenging and its got its own separate charm and a fun protagonistsidekick relationship.DQAt this point nothing really DEFINES a JRPG anymore.  What used to separate it from western RPGs was static characters and menu fighting for the most part.  Then the job system became popular and the fighting system changed at some point after I completely stopped playing them at all.  I guess this is one of those conversations I cant have without coming off extremely negative since anything exclusive to JRPGs is usually something I hate about games.  Static characters checklack of maneuverability in combat checklinear everything checkEven the job system is something that baffles me.  If jobs levelled independantly of characters and then the character had to be the same level as the job item then Id at least find that enjoyable.  But the idea that I can swap jobs between people and have to have that person start from the first level of that job that I bothered levelling up means a LOT more grinding just to get the same powers if I ever want to reconfigure my team which in the end makes the system worthless for experimenting.Though I guess in the end I would have to ask what is a JRPG anymore?

I look at that and think Fucking hell. Im not sure I can form any other coherent thought but it does mean that if I ever decide that making games is going to be a fulltime job for me itll be indie. Sure the hours will still suck but the reason for it will be different. Actually thats the hours are really what struck me and the seeming justification for itgt You dont get a game out like that with a bunch of people who dont have any passion about the quality of the product and dont want to spend that one extra night  Mike Capps EANo. You get a game out by giving people enough time to eat sleep and maintain their fucking mental and physical health you gigantic bellend!Sure you dont want people who slack in and slack out each and every day but try getting people who make their  hours fucking count! After . years of moving to actual software development Im still trying to break the habit I accumulated in QA of one more hour. I end up doing late nights because another hour or two kicking off some process saves me  in the morning but I feel that how I deal with things like waiting for things to buildinstall isnt that productive so I dont feel bad putting in the extra time. But the truth of it is the days when I can do h feel good about it and leave the office are the best times for me socially mentally and productively. Moreover if I can get a stretch of those days ha! I put out more predictable work. h crunch is a joke. It chews through people and it doesnt even seem to be for much in return except to point at a game and say I was a cog in the machine that made this.Everyone points to the folk that made it through multiple campaigns of that crap and say If they made it why cant others? and it seems that people in charge are more than happy to maintain that illusion. But I think those people have some unnaturally good constitutions and that for every one of those veterans that you see there are plenty who didnt make it through or those who simply didnt sign up for another tour.The article mentions how you can make lifelong friends there. I made lifelong friends in college when we were all holed up in a small lab with out laptops in final year. Wed get in for am at the latest then stick around til about  or am. I dont know about the others but I went home ate and slept until am when Id get up and do it all again. My sleep patterns still fucked from that. But I made friends. When youre in the same room as these people for h a day you get to know them. Theyre a second family.Once upon a time my friends and I went on a roadtrip to StratforduponAvon to see a play. We barely slept the night before and we got the ferry to Hollyhead and drove there. When we got to the theatre we camped outside for  hours to try to get tickets. While we were there we met other people. By the end after talking to these people I felt like I knew them for a year. Each hour felt like a month of knowing these people. When we finally turned up for the play after a few hours sleep we saw each other grabbed a drink and had barely anything to say to each other. We were all shattered from tiredness and the conversations that seemed so deep that morning were forgotten and we just made awkward conversation. But in that weird liminal space where the world was limited to the theatre courtyard and these were the only people left in my world for  hours they meant everything to me.Now if that feeling feels familiar take it and layer it over itself day after day week over week month over month and you have my final year university experience. Those forgotten conversations calcified into something stronger. I imagine the feelings of friendship from a QA campaign on a project feels a lot like that.Honestly because Ive never been in that industry Im probably judging it too harshly comparing various intense experiences of mine to that. But I also know some people who worked in a wellknown gamedev shop and that sort of flavoured my projections as well. But I dont particularly want to find out.,SRSGaming,cl2can2,6,t5_2t5qh

Can people who play violent videogames find violence to be a more acceptable action?  Can a video game about killing terrorists in the middle east reinforce preexisting beliefs about the people living in that area?Or thinking the other way Do scantily clad women in video games being used as background decoration or put in fridges cause people to go around committing sexual assault?  For the most part no but can it reinforce the idea that women dont have agency and that violence against them isnt a big deal?

The basis that this is how it once was is absolutely silly when throwing out a bunch of other arguably more important aspects of our history. Video games once again are not these mythical entities that happen into existence. A team of people worked on this game and they all had to have either said Hey this is a good addition to our game about werewolves and futuristic weaponry or not felt comfortable enough about their jobs to speak up against it.

By default he now has  longer range than most ranged characters and  longer vision range than ALL other characters. The trick to staying alive vs. guys like Illidan and Kerrigan is taking Double Barreled lets you store a second Q shot the talent that makes it slow movement speed by  and the talent that causes increased damage and stun on the first target hit. Between those you can kite most melee assassins to death and prevent some from ever touching you period.Combine these with Banshees and your self heal and you can solo most melee people v but dont expect to win a lot of v fights like a hard carry can in other games like this even if you are  levels higher than your enemies. There are very few situations where a hero can win v in this compared to other MOBAs and it usually comes down to a misplay on the part of the  carelessness due to overconfidence etc....,SRSGaming,covcpgr,1,t5_2t5qh

If the option to charge for mods was trialled on a new game I think youd see a lot less rageThe percentage though? Thats just indefensible. I can understand a cut of some kind but the sheer size of it is just taking the piss.

The men are the ones who can be taken seriously for their thoughts and actions though.Also the whole We want a minority character who you would not know is a minority if we didnt tell you also not only fails to represent actual lived stories of minorities but also tells us yet again that if we want acceptance we can only get it by fitting in with majority narratives especially the our lives look exactly like yours except this one thing.If youre gonna make the transness invisible and irrelevant to the game why stick us in the roles of questgiving side characters and not protagonists?

Also pressing the third attack button check your mapping I made it middle mouse makes him fire another pistol while using the rapier.  Also while your push attack while blocking isnt as great as the dwarf or the soldier its useful to get somethings attention then stab them in the face.  The downside is the pistols dont get headshot and are mostly for dealing with hordes.I feel like the Soldier is the more all around character nearly as strong as the dwarf able to upgrade to essentially a sniper rifle and has a good mix of melee weapons unlockable.That said I still ONLY play the bright wizard because I cant resist fire and being a danger to myself and everyone else. ,SRSGaming,cwgl04t,2,t5_2t5qh
5570363,0,t3_3raf98,I think Im just about done with Dark Souls . Overall while I dont think it was a good as the first game it certainly was worth the purchase. With one glaring exception I feel like the systems behind pvpcoop were at its best yet in the series. I loved the selection of weapons and armor and how varied and unique you could make builds. The DLC Ivory and Sunken especially were some of the best stretches of gameplay to come from the souls series yet. Some of the NPC invaderssummons were really interesting and challenging Mauldron and Thomas stand out despite both having frankly unfair healthdamage outputs. And one thing I absolutely absolutely loved was the magic. I mean yeah you could just as easily stand back and cheese things with dark orbsoul arrow like in DeS and DaS but there were a lot more ways to approach magic like getting in close with the greatsword spells and wrecking shit after a well timed dodge or stunning the enemy with those beam spam spells to line them up to eat a soul spear or using the fog spells to obscure your actions and leave the enemy guessing. Plus with all the weapons that also cast spells you can easily get up close and personal and keep someone guessing with your spellwork. Dark Souls  may be the closest any game has ever gotten for me to that battlemage experience and thats a huge plus in my book. That being said the game certainly has flaws.The bosses all seemed very easy with a few exceptions like the ruin sentinels and ser raime the hitbox hero although to their credit most of them werent as easy to cheese with ranged attacks as DSs the focus on having big impressive areas with gorgeous views as opposed to the closeknit nature of dark souls s world didnt sit well with me I loved how DS connected together up until about anor londo and even after that I loved the details like being able to see lost izalith from the tomb of the giants this in opposed DS where every other area has an enormous vista stretching for miles even if it doesnt make sense as to how it connects to the other areas. The actual story NPCs were fairly uninteresting. And as for my biggest minus for this game you probably already guessed it but Soul Memory. I hate hate hate hate hated soul memory. I hate that it punished me for dying or having a weapon break or experimenting by jacking up my online tier to be with people who have their obscenely strong builds planned from the start where they know exactly how many souls they need and refuse to gather a penny more. In fact for a system meant to discourage twinking intentionally fighting people who are lower levelare worse equipped than you it seems to enable exactly that in ways DS didnt. Its honestly one of the sole reasons Im avoiding doing anything else with the game I hate the fact that if I want to make a fun build thats not just overpowered in everything I need to strictly manage my soul intake or Ill end up fighting people whove leveled to the soft cap in every stat. The idea of having to stress about that if I want to make a new build just isnt fun to me. So Im not going to deal with it.Now that my Dark souls  rant is over time for one about the Discussion question! I feel like one of the quintessential aspects of horror is the ability to fight back. The game doesnt need to be an action packed thriller fighting doesnt even need to be necessarily effective. I just think that giving the player the ability to fight back gives the game designer more control over how helpless the player can feel which is a big part of horror. In games like amnesia the fact that you have to flee or hide every time you see an enemy is scary at first but it soon becomes annoying. In contrast games like silent hill where you can fight back only become more tense and scary to me because Im wondering if I can take an enemy if its worth it and once I become more comfortable with those the game has set itself perfectly to take away my weapons and make me feel more vulnerable then ever. I think playing with players expectations and confidence is the key to a good horror game.Which is why I personally never considered say the souls games to be very good as horror games. Yeah occasionally shit gets spooky and you see a new enemy and go what the FUCK is that but theyve never really mastered the whole powerfulpowerless thing. On that note I dont consider Until Dawn a horror game because there isnt really much game to it  its more like a slasherhorror flick made into a game. If that makes sense.I dont know if I could single out one favorite horror game but some of my favorites Rule of Rose Silent Hill  Haunting Grounds Alien IsolationWhew thats two rants no ones should ever have to read.

Dante himself was pretty fun but there wasnt enough wackiness or oneliners in the script. I thought the spectacle of the game was OK. There were some cool sections but a lot of it was floating platforms which all end up looking kinda similar. I liked most of the boss designs and there were a few good gross out moments in the game.

Its implementation could certainly vary on a casebycase basis but ultras in fighting games are usually tied to health so players are more mindful of when theyre using it. Otherwise the dominant strategy would be to activate them whenever the meter is filled up.However the case of Mario Kart is more revealing that you dont seem to like the concept of catchup mechanics as  per your own description  Blue Shells doesnt really reward the loosing player but are more about punishing. Which fits the theme of the other powerups.I understand your position as being on the receiving end can be infuriating but the intent in your each examples are to prevent the dominant party from steamrolling the loosing player while adding strategic depth in the process.,SRSGaming,d0aqnoh,1,t5_2t5qh

Its an expansion to Baldurs Gate Enhanced Edition a full story to work as a bridge between BG and BG and I didnt even know it existed  before I stumbled over this article.  This sounds really excitinggtIf there was something for the original Baldurs Gate that just doesnt mesh for modern day gamers like the sexism we tried to address that said writer Amber Scott. In the original theres a lot of jokes at womens expense. Or if not a lot theres a couple like Safana was just a sex object in BG  and Jaheira was the nagging wife and that was played for comedy. We were able to say No thats not really the kind of story we want to make. In Siege of Dragonspear Safana gets her own little storyline she got a way better personality upgrade. If people dont like that then too bad.gtI got to write a little tender romancey side quest for Khalid and Jaheira where you could learn a little bit about how their marriage works and how they really feel about each other.gtTheres also four new companions one of whom is gay one of whom is bisexual.

Now it may be the case that the driver is inexperienced or the track was wet but without context its hard to argue that the video doesnt imply something about the car maybe totally innocently.

8866979,0,t1_d7dno8g,I was talking about Errant Signals great video about Glitch Hikers in a thread on rgames something to the effect that trying to rigidly define games is reductive to the medium. He yoinked the comment opened his video with it and proceeded to disagree with me for about  minutes. I only found out cause some redditor sent me a link.As far as TB amp GG I honestly dont recall most of the specifics. By then Id done my own little investigations decided it was all bullshit and put my blinders on for the sake of my own mental wellbeing seriously something about GG hit me in just the wrong way and even though I wasnt involved with it made me all kinds of horribly anxious. As I recall though he tiptoed around declaring himself proGamerGate until some allegations of impropriety hit him and he couldnt stop fighting people on twitter at which point he tweeted a cartoonishly ridiculous I STAND WITH GAMERGATE picture and went all in. He bowed in and out repeatedly as circumstances required claiming that any harassment originating with GG was from bad actors etc. Pretty standard fare. ,SRSGaming,d7doq4a,6,t5_2t5qh

10404268,0,t1_dcnauet,gt nd now we just have grab bag party games...which is the category Id put half of the couch coop recommendations into. Theyre short and gimmickyfeeling gt The others are all typical d sidescrollers...I really dont know if thats fair to say. Like I said I think all of them belong in the categories I said. Imo Crawl has tons of depth to its gameplay especially for an early accessdeveloping title I have a couple dozen hours into and I dont find myself getting bored with it. Certainly if the types of games youre craving are things like Gauntlet and Mario Kart I dont think its fair to say that any of the games anyone has listed ITT come off as gimmicky. Theyre I think indisputably at least as deep as those games. gtThe good racing games consist entirely of Mario Kart The others dont even come close.Arcade fighters have always been around and those are still decent. Some of the newer ones not so much though...There has been a lot of praise for Skullgirls and BlazBlue but Ive found that theyre extremely simplistic and shallow games after more than an hour or two of gameplay Skullgirls especially.Maybe my friends just suck at video games but Skullgirls was only really fun for an hour. Each character only has a dozen moves its predictable and repetitive.I think this amounts to you just not having a ton of fun with certain genres. Thats pretty fair. I cant really do any fighting games they frustratebore me. I only mentioned them because I know theyre a party game favorite. gtDuck game is a competition  so is Crawl. Youre fighting against each other not with each other.Oh okay we just have different definitions then. I consider couch coop to mean you just require  system for  or more people not necessarily that youre working together. And I hope Im not coming off as controntational just trying to start a dialogue. ,SRSGaming,dcne2zg,1,t5_2t5qh

11227967,0,t1_df4n0yq,Why should a product be criticized or scrutinized? Critical theory is one of the most important and widespread avenues of left wing theory and has helped fight for equality. Criticism and scrutiny of corporate actions has led to increased worker rights. Many reasons but especially to help consumers and not give giant corporate entities the benefit of the doubt. Yes a game can never be perfect but AAA games lately just stink of laziness and a lack of any QA at all. I just dont understand why anyone who identifies as left of center would defend EA and their shitty worker and consumer practices. End corporate nerd fanboyism.
