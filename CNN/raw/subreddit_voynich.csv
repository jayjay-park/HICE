8556586,0,t1_d6b4yll,gtIn the first video the constellation bit is very interesting but the words hes using for constellations are all from  different languages. It doesnt work very well if constrained to just one of those.    I think this is unfair and his tactic completely valid.  English doesnt borrow exclusively from one language and neither does any other language.  It follows that the voynich language didnt either and if his Romany theory is correct it makes sense that theyd pick up loan words from a host of different languages as they went along from India.  I would also contend that many of these issues will be resolved as time goes along as research in general is still in a very early stage.,voynich,d6b5d1b,1,t5_2sq24
