4267626,0,t1_cs6nnvk,Considering Plattfish has been going around attempting to make diplomatic alliances everywhere even with Archon  I cannot join a board which is going around making false decisions of alliances behind other fraction members backs. Yes Trello is almost doing the same thing But the only thing we are doing there is keeping track on current situations systems and scouting systems for the next cycle and also keeping tabs of military operations other players are doing. We are not making huge decisions behind others backs. Once we at trello have agreed that X is best for X reasons we make a post about it on Reddit and wait to see others opinions about it and then act upon it if they also agree on such action. We do not just say We are doing this now and thats that like apparently your forum is enforcing clearly. So no. We do need trello in my book. ,EliteAntal,cs6ogy0,2,t5_38iee

4297244,0,t1_cs9r8di,The point I can concede though you dont seem to explicitly make it is that preparation and control are goals best met by traders and thus a system like Sokn whose only station is  LS from then entry point is not ideal for efficiencys sake. In addition whatever goods are for sale on Sokn or any other system might not blend well with whatever trade circuit youre trying to set up. So if youre suggesting that these planets are ideal for prepcontrol because they are good trading systems then I will concede that much. Im a hunter not a trader after all.However I think we have the manpower to spare to claim less efficient in terms of time systems that are rich in CC profit because that is what we lack.,EliteAntal,csa0tfr,2,t5_38iee

As you said though wed still need to make sure we had sufficient pilots of our own that had the rep to get there and take responsibility for both preparation and expansion and eventually fortification just in case.Im not sure I will be able to acquire the permit for that system and do other fortificationexpansion work promised for this week as my play time is a little limited.

5111689,0,t1_cv1n4zh,Yeah we had  good systems go into turmoil and we ended up losing all of them. It was pretty brutal.So quick recap A systems Upkeep is determined solely but its distance to HQ A systems Income is determined solely by its number and population of exploited systems including itself. Fortifying a system reduces its Upkeep to zero Undermining a system increases its Upkeep by its Income If a system is both Fortified and Undermined it is Cancelled and its Upkeep is normal. Under normal circumstances Income is much higher than Upkeep for all systems. If a power cant pay all its Upkeep systems go into Turmoil starting with the systems with the highest Upkeep You cant collect Income from a system in Turmoil but it still pays Upkeep and if undermined its Upkeep is still increased. If your power still cant afford all its upkeep at the end of a Turmoil cycle you lose all of the turmoil systems.So what does this mean for voluntarily losing systems? Say you want to lose the Bumshart system youll need to make sure it goes into turmoil. To do this it needs to be the system with the highest Upkeep when the cycle ticks into deficit. Undermining increases Upkeep so if Bumshart is the only undermined system its Upkeep will probably be the highest.But the problem is that Undermining only increases Upkeep by Income. Maybe Bumshart generates so little Income that even if its Undermined other systems still have higher upkeep. This is particularly a problem for crap systems near your HQ.Systems like Antal and Takurua are furthest from HQ so their Upkeeps the highest by default. If you wanted to lose them youd need to go into turmoil with no good systems successfully undermined otherwise youd lose them instead. This is why people dont try to go into controlled Turmoil if you mess up or the enemy springs some surprise Undermining on you it can backfire in a big way.Ironically you could lose Antal and Takurua simply by doing nothing for a turn since your baseline CC balance is negative assuming you didnt get successfully undermined.Hope that was all fairly clear!,EliteAntal,cv25ep6,1,t5_38iee
5112227,0,t1_cv27j44,It also helps explain why controlled turmoil is such a delicate operation.Lets say you guys end up with a negative CC balance at the end of this cycle and Takurua and Antal go into turmoil. Well thats no problem you think those systems were draining us anyway.Heres how that goesBest case scenario You end the next cycle with a balance of  CC. You lose Takurua and Antal and your next highest upkeep system say Ewah goes into turmoil. You then go on a massive fortification binge without Ewahs considerable income and end the cycle with a balance of CC. Youve successfully shed a couple of systems.Bad scenario You end the next cycle with a balance of  CC. Takurua and Antal emerge from turmoil and all that happened was that you spent a cycle without being able to expand prepare or collect the income from those  systems.Worse scenario You end the cycle with a balance of CC. You lose Takurua and Antal and the next  highest income systems fall into turmoil. Some of these are actually high earners. Without their income and with those turmoil systems potentially being undermined youre unable to get your balance back up above zero even with a lot of fortification and lose all of them too. This might snowball further. This scenario isnt super likely on its own since Takurua and Antal produce so little income they wont damage your economy on their own but this would be a very bad time to encounter an undermining surge.,EliteAntal,cv27qi1,1,t5_38iee

Finally settled on a gimballed canon for now a slight drop in dps but worth it for quality of life imo.Im rocking mirrored composite also with hull reinforcement. I feel there are just more lasers than kinetic weapons but it does mean i have to be a bit careful around certain ship when my shields go down.Do you have that problem where you fry your ship every time you pop an scb?,EliteAntal,cyxfyn1,1,t5_38iee
6232610,0,t1_cyy281n,gt Ill be in combat until my shields deplete completely and start taking hull damage.I dont understand why youd stay in fight without shields but if you do definitely fit armor.,EliteAntal,cyy2vwh,1,t5_38iee
6233544,0,t1_cyy2vwh,I think we all agree with this all the more so in CZ.This makes me think again about the hull  weight thing.As I said above I think that in CZProtest Zones maneuvrability is less important than amount of damage we can take.Because maneuvrability does not help that much against the real danger there eg multiple opponents and if we just pick our fights we will also be multiple allies firing at the same target even in solo so maneuvrability wont either help our damage output significantly.Hence our endurance in the zone and on a smaller scale how much we can take  how long we survive under fire is way more important like TTK in others MMO.Last week at GCRV I was happy that I had improved alloy and  hull reinforcement packages when I finished with my Anaconda at  and my AFMrepaired FSD took me off in front of the  guys firing at me. Had I chosen for maneuvrability I would have paid a  millions bill instead of .In the current version of the game hull helps. And as in expansion wings you easily have .

6305838,0,t1_cz6di5b,Thank you for the very thorough guide!I like to use beams personally. I do agree with the points here but one thing thats very important if enemy is equipped with scbs is alpha damage. Pulses lack that. While they do more damage over a certain long time than beams they cant do the same amount of damage in a short period of time as pointed also in this guide.Lets imagine you are facing a Corvette. They can fit around  shields and x CA scbs and enough heat sinks to actually use them. Thats total of around MJ shields to go through  not including smaller scbs you could equip in addition to class .Lets say you are flying FAS fitted with x medium  x large fixed beams  x large fixed cannon. My favorite move is to move close fire the weapons cap empty with beams while having full pips to weapons and then ram by boostin and make sure to put full pips to sys before the impact. This will drop those nasty shields in one move without the enemy having time to use scbs. This will save you from going through over k worth of shields energy stored in those x CA scbs. Now with the opponent shields dropped keep full pips in sys and only one or two pips in weapons if you are getting hit. Also remember chaff. Cannon doesnt take much energy to fire and will do a lot of hull damage. So you can hammer that exposed hull down while tanking with your shields now that you are using much of your distributor capacity for shields. You dont need to fire the beams much at this point. If your shields go down switch to silent running and keep dropping heat sinks to keep your heat under . This will help you not getting hit.Also plasma and rails have better damage per energy used to knock down shields than pulses and also do much better hull damage. Rails have limited ammo but plasma actually lasts for a long time.... but the thing with alpha damage is that you have to make sure you succeed. If your alpha strike fails you are in trouble. So in the end its all about which way you want to fight. I agree  that for prolonged fights pulses are the way to go over beams.Funny alpha damage video I understand its not a proper fit Corvette but you get the idea,EliteAntal,cz6eif3,1,t5_38iee

Just float around the star with your engines cut km per second in super cruise. Keep an ey o n your left hand tab for contacts. Scan ship that appear. Stick next to the sun. No need to wander off. Your target should turn up soon. If you see a weak signal source you can drop in there. Good chance it might be them. Anyway when they do show up you need to drag them out of super cruise with your interdictor thing. Carrying  tonne of cargo helps.

YLR is closer to them  where theyll presumably be coming from if not further innersphere wise... and so if something started YLR might be first to go  should they fight well.  IF the fed found YLRs neutrality  noncommitement AGAINST the empire to be unacceptable  presumably unlike what theyd understand our rejection of BOTH to be of a kind of  inunderstanding at least in the sense that we reject them the empire as well  so thats not a friend of the empire at least ... they might think YLR a risk as a trading partner TO the empire  especially since YLR encourages high tech ... more of a risk than an oppertunity or something similar.IF that happens if it hasnt already ... then it MIGHT be more likely to be the fed to assume theyd survive something where YLR got destroyed.During such  we and the empire would be NEXT CLOSEST.all nonfederation ... all non hudson.  Winters might come under attack  but theyd presumably be thought of as a secondary consideration.Personally  i think we shouldve long since ago come to agreements with YLR to have much stronger understandings of differences  and freedoms of choice to trademove between for our free citizens at least  and theirs to settle in ours ... not a merging of controlled sapce but of a kind of limitedfreetrade kind of thing  he perhaps exporting the more uncontrolled amongst his open markets to our reform systems to show them another way ... in game i dunno ... meaning that our agents can collect dissidents from their control systems as well as ours?  theirs can deliver ones to us and it creates forticication at their own  as an alernative way of them fortifying their own systems thatd be more in line with the game dynamics id imgaine  but for us that creates population increase?  inconsequential for us but its something.other stuff too tho  stuff LIKE that  ability to collect salary at either  create publicity FOR the other FAVOURED trade deals  factioncooperationslongtermrealtionships ... cooperative things like that  that we could ask of each other TEMPORARILY or would develop in time etc.pipe dreams perhaps but of so few other GPs to choose from  who else should we favour of anybody?  he encourages high tech ... we advocate the USE of it  to get beyond our only human limitations do we not?i heard somone say in the forums once were basically one big hippie commune ... and i thought ... yyyyyeeaahhhh  but no not only.not simply.im no officionado of the backstory  setings  to ED ... but when tech can create socialsolutions from exchange and LEARNING from each other rather than imposed decision making of various shortsighted intentions ... should not  then  newer tech  make our differences LESS significant  and tech  able to be used by everyone ... be something that should be able to?ideally maybe.which tech tho?high tech  in our CURRENT situation  might mean moreso high military tech  high engineering tech ... not pacifiers and happypills and toupees and prostheticextrapairbras  for the zenobiologically challenged ... Dif thats the case ... more highER tech military  might cause too much damage to BOTH the empire ANDOR  the fed.that would be a bad idea  unlike a more CONTROLLED choice of hightech.we would certainly advicate that ... but who ELSE  might  might not?the COMMON interest of the fedempire to trade with someone neutrally aligned  is one thing but how reliable is that?as alien tech starts to become used ... who knows?  weve had to adjust to one emergency already ... and false promises might mean nothing if someone uses more for their own purposes.bet your life on it ... more alien tech will be irresistable to use ... but if YLR is removed from the game... there wouldnt be somone unaligned to the fedempire  stalemate  in control.in my mind that means look out YLR !  it could be difficult to remain neutral forever!id imagine some kind of demand or something might come your way.How can we prepare ?   well if that happens  insist upon not WORSENING tech use  misuse ... claim more than just neutrality i guess ... stuff like that  that what were trying to create  is a interruptum or bandaid space fix until our entire space is bandaided soto speak set a preceadent  to show what can be done with what is already here...growth is advocated by the fed ... thats obvious by the constant progression of badlyprotected false promise worlds far out from even fedcontrolled space alieged TO them ... but how many investors and whatnot  feel betrayed? or not only financially  but people social wise ... how many people detest the fed  because of the where do they deploy  where to they put the effort in questions?more diplomacy might not be as easy as we and other would ask OF them with the empire ... but by comparison  its much easier to criticise the empires much less free controlled business  even if you argue that WHEN a free empire cit  you can flourish in safer more reliably backedup oppertunity.what can we do to prepare?we can point out that THAT difference ... does not MATTER  for longER term  interests in humans living thousands of years from now  if we cannot UNITE against some external force ...that ANY intentional whos closest wordplay should be responded to in equalproportion.argue for the DEFENCE of YLR space in other words at the same time as keeping an eye on his use of alien tech.,EliteAntal,d6m2axx,1,t5_38iee

9502375,0,t3_5axbqz,I hate to say it but Id wait up with getting one of those privilege googles until the next generation comes out. Right now they seem to be not quite there yet being more a gimmicky enthusiast product too uncomfortable for longer sessions and the resolution is still an issue.Yes people cry with joy when they try Elite in VR but after a week the awe wears off they get used to it and usually go back to using a monitor because of the mentioned drawbacks.The differences between the two systems when it comes to image quality are pretty minuscule from what I gathered. So if you are set on getting one and money is not the issue then get the Vive because ValveSteamgtFBIf you can wait get this ,EliteAntal,d9kdcal,2,t5_38iee

9542178,0,t1_d9oq6uu,Not sure what you mean by flying in wing of them..You can launch and fly around in the SLF.  And if you met up with others.. i suppose you can fly around together..They actually pack a good punch for their size.  But they die pretty quick due to their low shieldsarmor.  Will probably be better and more effective once I get the NPC crewmember I hired trained up.  Im glad they can be rebuiltlaunched  times..They are good distractions.  I gave mine the defend order and was using it to distract backstabbers.  I was fighting a corvette when an viper pulled in on my six and just sat there hitting me with a railgun.  SLF raked it with gunfire and the viper broke off to go after it.  Gave me the minute I needed to finish off the corvette..I know Cutter Conda Vette can carry them.. not sure about others.,EliteAntal,d9p9s4a,1,t5_38iee

9781845,0,t3_5ez3dm,I found reddit early on with the beginning of powerplay. I think its been key fire Antal as its help create a community and because its a fairly good way of planning out our weeks activities. Long term planning on reddit isnt great as the threads fade away over time but it suits our needs well.Discord is great for the short term stuff hooking up for civil wars sharing trade routes smuggling and stuff  like that.  Also sharing screenshots and other nonsense makes for a good atmosphere. And the added privacy means you can happily say what you really think about ....Personally I recon the two complement each other well as long as folk can find us!,EliteAntal,daitrgp,1,t5_38iee
9825297,0,t1_dao29ju,Looks good but personally I wouldnt use Brated scbs because they are too heavy. Especially with bulkheads your ship will lose quite a bit of the agility it could have. Id go for scb build  lightweight alloys or no scbs and some Drated hrps instead  reactive armor. But then again it depends on the fighting style. I use all the agility I can get so I try to keep my ships light. Others go for tanky builds and dont use FA off for example and thats fine too of course. Its just that if you want agility you need to get your ship lighter.Also currently plasma isnt that great. Fit huge multicannon instead especially if you can mod it to incendiary to melt shields. You can spam tier  overcharged mod just one nickel until you get special effect and then use favor to change it to incendiary. Big advantage of multi build is that you can keep full pips to SYS to tank a lot.Plasma is about to get a big buff though so it should become a good weapon soon again but I just tried my plasma gunship today and it wasnt good at this point.,EliteAntal,dao99ie,2,t5_38iee
