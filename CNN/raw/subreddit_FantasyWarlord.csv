1768483,0,t1_ck2183n,We actually started another guild as well. iohazard and iosword.  They both share the i tag but with a different symbol divider.  The main guild requirements are k attack unbuffed as stated in your guardian page or constant top  performances in arena.  Biosword is an arena focus guild or a k attack unbuffed requirement.,FantasyWarlord,ck22n4e,1,t5_32ijp
