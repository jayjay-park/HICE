1852133,0,t3_2frlny,Coming from a gamer with nothing to do with developmentI think its a very interesting proposal the idea of making it possible for player of both games meet on the same server is an appealing one.I suppose to keep it viable the players will be limited to the constraints of their respective game but I suppose if this comes to pass terasology is the most liable to work to minimize such discrepancies as I very much doubt Minecraft players would give up any of their game features to retain compatibility even in view of competing Minecraft servers.Overall it would be very interesting to see something like to see something like this happen.,spongeproject,ckcdl8g,2,t5_33fk6

1853212,0,t3_2fqaq9,Honestly I would prefer to see even the vanilla content to be implemented as a plugin.,spongeproject,ckcia0u,2,t5_33fk6
1870000,0,t3_2g0qjg,From my understanding no.Look at clientside Forge if you dont have any mods installed with it the server doesnt need any mods. Id imagine the same applies to the reverse.,spongeproject,ckej15n,1,t5_33fk6
1932089,0,t1_ckjjf4j,I find your position to be delusional at best.Microsoft like Apple consumes amp destroys. Neither two nor one nor even a fraction of a shit is given for the DEVELOPERS DEVELOPERS DEVELOPERS beyond what those poor souls can do for their masters.,spongeproject,ckm03w5,-2,t5_33fk6

2387890,0,t3_2mqywu,You can import any existing world to Sponge it doesnt change the structure of world files. What the hell is a modded vanilla server?!?!BTW you wont have a Sponge server you will have a Forge server with Sponge installed. Sponge itself does not have anything to do with vanillaForge stuff...,spongeproject,cm6un0z,15,t5_33fk6
