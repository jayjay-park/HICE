471854,0,t1_cftt5r2,Cable is a regulated monopoly.  It would be hugely wasteful of resources to have two sets of cables strung to every home two sets of trenches dug in every street two patches applied.  To avoid this localities generally pick one provider and enforce a regulated monopoly.  Power water landline phoneDSL and sewage are generally delivered the same way although lately you have had a choice about your power generation company  not your power transmissiondelivery company!Fiber isnt the same as coax  delivers much higher bandwidth  so localities cant argue that its redundant to string fiber to every house in town.  Actually they can and they are but people who live in those places sure dont like it.Its the same reason that Charter has competition from ATT DSL  different kind of wireline strung for a different purpose.,SLO,cftwhl8,5,t5_2r3yh

936944,0,t3_24su9o,I should preface this by stating that I rarely have any interest in any political races.  In fact Ive never publicly thrown my support behind any candidate. However Ive thrown my complete support behind Dan Dow in the DA race.  Ive worked on cases with Dow and other DDAs.  I can personally attest to his competence and integrity.  There are very good reasons that more than half of the DDAs are supporting him over Covello.  It says something when there are multiple veteran DDAs who support him over Covello.  When you hear DDAs say Covello is unapproachable they arent being misleading.Notwithstanding my personal interactions Dows vision for the office will bring about more success because hes open and willing to listen to alternatives to find the right solution.  Hes interested in creating programs and solutions that integrate multiple agencies and will respond to county needs.  He created the Veterans Treatment Court program despite any support from Covello and Shea and has expressed interest in creating a Domestic Violence court which is common in other counties but noticeably absent in SLO county.  There was a comment in this thread about Dow not planning to stick around the area too long.  This seems rather baseless and purely speculative.  While I cant speak to this either way Dow seems heavily invested in this area and it seems highly unlikely he would be going anywhere.,SLO,chasanh,3,t5_2r3yh

Sunday at pm at First Presbyterian church downtown. You can play there for free for a while but if you are going to be a regular then they ask for  a year or somewhere around that amount.

6356427,0,t3_42n132,Years ago we went on a school trip to Disneyland and we chartered a double decker bus. After all the fun was over we arrived home late at night and the driver decided to park the bus into a parking lot way too small rather than leave it on the street. The back of the bus hit our car as it swung wide in the tiny lot and busted the whole rear bumper it was about a k price tag to fix. It was painful to watch because the poor guy was so scared and knew he would probably lose his job. Funny thing was I was on that bus sitting in the very back when it happened and I didnt even feel the slightest bump.
