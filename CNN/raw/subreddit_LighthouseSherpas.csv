4359643,0,t3_3ay6al,It definitely depends on what you want to practice because each game mode can cater to a different skill set. If you are brand spanking new to pvp rumble is going to be the baseline starting playlist that everyone needs to play until they are winning games. As ursdon said it teaches situational awareness. It encourages many v gun fights and how to use the radar. Not only that but to win it teaches you to be aggressively looking for your enemies.If you want a game mode closest to trials then you want elimination or skirmish. You definitely want to practice with a friend in these modes but its still good even if you cant communicate. You learn that your actions in these games have a much higher consequence so you need to be thinking more about how your going to engage the enemy or let them engage onto you.,LighthouseSherpas,csh2cud,3,t5_38it5

4563101,0,t1_ct5pege,I will take this one because I play my Titan in PvP more than Vibez does. For us Titans are our least liked class in Trials. We find they bring less to the group than the other classes no selfrevive no extra armor from ram no ranged super like golden gun no blink etc. Fist does have its place and can be useful just not as impactful as other supers. Death from above is very mapspawn specific. On widows court for example when on Bravo team top I had a lot of luck doing it over the wall on heavy round and smashing the other team. In most situations we use shockwave as find that nets more kills in trials.As far as grenades I personally prefer the flash bang. We play more in the counterstrike style so flash banging in a chokepointaround a corner then storming in with TLW or similar is very effective. Lightning grenade is useful for putting on an orb to stop revive but given how big some of the maps are in a v mode its not as useful.Hope that helps!,LighthouseSherpas,ct5slyq,1,t5_38it5
