11781031,0,t3_6354d4,Youre young there are plenty of men out there. But dont give up on your boyfriend yet. See how it plays out. You have most of the facts now sit back and watch. People who cheat will ALWAYS give themselves away eventually. I was in my s once ha! and I know how petty young girls who are dumped can be. The ex is trying to cause conflict and create doubt. Misery loves company. The ex may not have been up to par for your boyfriend and maybe that relationship was purely sexual  it happens  and ultimately there was no spark. Or maybe shes just a bitch which her behavior is proving. Text him and talk. Keep an open mind and see what he has to say. But dont be fooled people can cheat during the day while at work not just at night and buying gifts can be their way of making up for their transgressions. Bottom line your happiness and peace of mind comes first. Good luck. Whatever happens I hope you act classy and grown up and come out on top. ,cheatingrevenge,dgvf1oh,1,t5_31z3j
