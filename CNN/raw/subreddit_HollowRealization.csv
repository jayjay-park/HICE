9637128,0,t1_da0wamb,Continue Premieres Quest I havent gotten on for a few hours but Im pretty sure thats exactly what it says because I was looking at it while we were looking for them. ,HollowRealization,da0z3tb,1,t5_3f8p4
9637343,0,t1_da0xq12,Its a bit of an exploit but any time you give your party a command it cancels your current action so you can give a command then dodge out of the way.Chains are pretty confusing at first until you start one then sit back and watch it.Basically the easiest way for me to describe it without being able to show you is that when you hit L It sets everyone in a formation with numbers by them. thats the order theyll go in. Youll see little arrows pointing to everyone. thats also the order theyll act in.They do pretty decent dmg individually but when its your turn if you use a skill as well youll trigger the hollow Synch which does massive damage and knocks them down. You should have a x dmg multiplier as well.The Switch mechanic is also a bit confusing. when you use it youll attack quickly and your partner will hop in to pop them and stun as well. Im not sure if its the intended way to use Switch but your next SS after switching is buffed so it does significantly more dmg.L  gt is how you tell your party to attack. theyll all jump in at once and use a skill which will usually result in a mini hollow synch. I obviously dont know the terms....Anyway its a good way to get a chunk of damage off your target and it will almost always trigger a mood prompt to get you  SP back.I think thats everything Im pretty tired and going to bed now but if you need to know ask and Ill try and help tomorrow.,HollowRealization,da1022m,2,t5_3f8p4

9649573,0,t3_5d4xhe,There are lots of different buffs that boost attack and SP and health. Just have a look through EX Menus and find one you like. If it says PT in the name then it buffs the group.,HollowRealization,da2icxo,2,t5_3f8p4
9664126,0,t3_5cuszo,I have an EX skill question. For the second requirement to unlock Righteous Cross you supposedly have to block  attacks with protection field. Does it only count blocks while you have the  def buff or is it any in the  sec window?,HollowRealization,da4b0ld,1,t5_3f8p4

10110712,0,t1_dbpe4qb,I passed days in the inn until I only had one bubble left Kind each time I tried. I randomly got Planner as well which is something I wanted to keep so I had  locked bubbles when I tried to get warlike. So its just RNG hell huh ,HollowRealization,dbpfpdy,1,t5_3f8p4
