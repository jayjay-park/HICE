183660,0,t3_1w7c15,The previews released so far seem to have contradictory things to say about the level of freedom given to the player. A similar quote from OPs articlegt Perhaps the most obvious departure from the series roots is how larger free flowing level design has been replaced by tidy encounters zones. Similarities can be drawn to the structure of Deus Ex Human Revolution where making your way through a typical stage had you moving between rooms conquering the layout and enemy patrol paths as you work towards an exit leading you into the next.DXHR gave a lot of freedom relative to most modern games but far less than the classic Thief games. So Id guess the discrepancies in how the previews are rating freedom of exploration is due to whether theyre comparing Thief to its predecessors as in OPs article or to its contemporaries.FWIW I thoroughly enjoyed DXHR and a similar level of freedom is roughly what I expected from Thief though not all Id hoped for.,Thief,cezctlw,5,t5_2rduq

423832,1,t1_cfojlhp,In what universe is the Xbox One a definitive experience?  Ive played Thief as well as many other games Assassins Creed IV for example on both PC and XB and the PC is superior in every way excluding social activity but then again Steam makes up for social activity in its own special way.  Graphics controls etc.  All better on PC...,Thief,cfop1ae,3,t5_2rduq
434031,0,t1_cfppti2,I couldnt find any clues so I manually figured out the combo through trialerror. It took about  or so minutes of turning the dials. I think it would have been more satisfying with a clue but I got impatient trying to find one and figured that would take less time in the long run.,Thief,cfpr35s,2,t5_2rduq
435035,0,t1_cfpsdk6,Yup.  As soon as I bought those three I spent a couple of hours wandering the city and breaking into places that Id never have had a shot at otherwise.,Thief,cfpuu6c,1,t5_2rduq

Try to leap off of a corner to catch and mantle it Garrett drops down off the ledge instead and dies because the developers didnt want you jumping that way.How many firstperson actionadventure games can you list off the top of your head that dont let you jump?,Thief,cfqaotw,-1,t5_2rduq

443655,0,t3_1z5lyd,I havent beaten the game yet I lost my hr save accidentally knocked out a dog so I cant give you an opinion on the full story but its not the reason I got the game. I never played the first three so that might have something to do with that.Since people love to compare it to Dishonored and say its what this iteration of Thief shouldve been Ill give my two cents on that. Even on a no kill playthrough of Dishonored I didnt feel like I was being stealthy. I felt like I was playing chess with the game having checkers pieces to play with. You could Blink turn into a rat and do a bunch of other stupid shit. It was a magical first person assassin game. Thief on the other hand actually feels like a stealth game. Swooping from shadow to shadow trying to stay out of sight. I never played the first three so I cant compare. The main story isnt great Im ignoring most of it but Ive gotten immersed in the side stories. andImoutofspace.tldr  Great stealth. Meh story. ,Thief,cfqr02d,3,t5_2rduq
450580,0,t3_1z89iz,So I got a new one.  How in the world are you supposed to outrun the dogs in Chapter  with the reduced speed?  Ive tried pure swooping and a combination of run  swooping.  Both ended up with getting inappropriately touched by dogs,Thief,cfrh99n,1,t5_2rduq

478937,0,t1_cfun0l0,Thanks for clearing up a lot of loose ends.I guess it is rewarding to scavenge the extra documents laying around in the game props to you for doing that. I simply played the game straight through especially right after the scary asylum.Now Im hooked onto the storyline of Thief since this is my first one Ive played. Do the previous Thiefs add to the storyline?,Thief,cfupi5f,1,t5_2rduq

1040712,1,t3_260y4e,Ive started this game and tried to play it. Its like the devs never actually played any of the other thief games and only designed the UI based on descriptions. The action animations are fucking annoying. And the UI is nothing like the originals. Where the originals were smooth and immersive.. This one is awkward and clunky and breaks immersion every time it does an animation when I pick something up. Or when it locks me to a wall when Im trying to peek and I cant get off the wall.  This is a perfect example of how to take an established franchise and kick it in the head.,Thief,chml0el,1,t5_2rduq
