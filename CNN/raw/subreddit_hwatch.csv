5330436,0,t3_3o10o4,Yes I miss notifications and alarms regularly on the metal link strap version of the watch with the strap as tight as possible.

5362738,0,t1_cvx585l,Yeah I am referring to what appear them ignoring the issue and acting like it does not exist. I now have an LG Watch R and the display on it is clearly black like any AMOLED display should be. That is all I am saying...

7162683,0,t1_d1s4xdw,gt Why couldnt a version for women have been developed sooner? News flash there are lots of women who love technology too!Right of course there are lots of women who love technology but there are far more men who would spend money on gadgets like this.This is basic economics like when a midbudget movie is marketed in a single country and released to cinemas then depending on the success might go on to a marketing campaign and cinema release elsewhere or not. There are people all over the world crying about having to wait or pirating the film.BTW I think most people would prefer small watches but the technology esp battery is dictating the size at the moment. Personally my Huawei is smaller than most of my watches but my Dad and a lot of others find it a bit too chunky compared with what theyre used to.,hwatch,d1sbtv4,1,t5_37cy1

7647382,0,t1_d3bfpw6,It turns the screen black but its not off. It also still responds to touch and you can still swipe up certainly not theater mode. If you wear your watch over night its probably best to turn off always on display and gestures before sleeping. ,hwatch,d3bgrpr,3,t5_37cy1
7652013,0,t3_4k3wdg,I use the mesh band too.Only gripe I have about mine is the shiny metal which I managed to scratch within a week of owning the watch quite badly as well. I prefer the all brushed look of Urbane . ,hwatch,d3bzp5x,2,t5_37cy1

8053102,0,t1_d4l7d9c,. is normal for me. I wouldnt be too concerned you are at about . which depending on your use and your watchface I use an AMOLED black face is probably right on the money. At  you are getting  hours of use which will probably stretch to  hours once battery saver kicks in at .  hours is am to am the next day for perspective. And to top it all off I bet it will still get a little better. You are at a week a lot of people see improvements over the first two weeks.

9052074,0,t3_546sco,A word of warning on the black version. Bracelet gets scuffed and scratched very easily with your wrist laying on the desk primarily so the paint comes off leaving the silver showing from underneath. This hasnt happened to the watch face part yet but I assume it will over time. Mine is only just over a month old.This also likely happens to the silver one as its just wear and tear however you wont see it on the silver one.I live the watch but regret buying the black version due to this. My solution for the moment is to look for a leather strap as this wont scuff in the same way. However I much prefer metal straps so its an unwelcome compromise.,hwatch,d7zwy6t,2,t5_37cy1
