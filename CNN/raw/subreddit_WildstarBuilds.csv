4442805,0,t1_csozxa3,Its not an ignorant thing at all.  MB is better in the scenario you stated I agree with that but this is dependent on if you have extra espers or warrior running OP.  Thats what Im trying to say.  And the top progress raids have  warriors in the raid that they can sacrifice this when now most progression guilds have  maybe . Just understand that  Esper having MB over warrior getting OP imo is not going to happen so prepare that the esper cant do MB.,WildstarBuilds,csqp8wo,1,t5_38i7d
5556442,0,t3_3psdec,at work so I cant see your build. but basically....dont use warden or pyro flame. until you get . focus regen use mental boon. After youre focus is ish and . FR then go reverie builder we the name is lol and bolster. Then fixation x cc and a cc break. As far as other stats stack crit to  then intensity. My reverie crits for k pretty often not sure what my max is I look too much.Esper healers arent going to out heal similarly gearedskilled medics or SS. however the x cc they can hit you with back to back is enough to make up the lack of heals and then some imo.Hope youre still playing and having fun.,WildstarBuilds,cwltt5f,1,t5_38i7d
