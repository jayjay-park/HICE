8960048,0,t1_d7ouecg,Mr. RedThanks much for your response! Being able to grow my channel is something Ive been working hard on for the past year. Interestingly enough I recorded two sessions of Minecraft  where the first was p  fps through a capped Elgato but the second session was all on the same laptop so I actually got  fps on it! Im editing the second episode now but theres quite a bit of content before Im able to get to the second session unfortunately. Again thanks much for reaching out!Matt,MinecraftersYT,d7ov3co,1,t5_3fygi
