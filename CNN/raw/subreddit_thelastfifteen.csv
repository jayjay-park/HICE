It helps to remember that it is all water weightif youre strict for a couple of days  will come back on the scale. If you know that you are slipping it might be a good idea to ask yourself what your original reason was to get down to  and . Try to think about those reasons and decide if theyre still valid. Is this just a random goal? Are you just as happy and healthy at  as you would be at ? If so ease into maintenance calories. If not ease into maintenance calories anyway and then go back to cutting for loss when you feel stronger. Remember in order to maintain you have to eat at maintenance! Whether you decide to keep losing or maintain you still have to get the cheat days under control. Visit risplenty and get some ideas for meals that will bring you to a better place caloriewise. Think about an outfit or other reward for yourself when you reach your goal to help get your mindset right again. Remember also to play the tape forward on your cheat daysis it worth it to cheat so much and then see such a spike the next day?These are just a few ideas but they are all thoughts that I use to keep myself on the straight and narrow.,thelastfifteen,d3eae02,2,t5_3eegd

My rant  boyfriend really wants me to lose the weight probably so I stop talking about it but he constantly wants to do treats.  He doesnt understand that to really do this I cant have a cheat day every  days.  And my vacation put me back again.... I need some damn weight loss here so I feel like there is some progress!,thelastfifteen,dab0dop,3,t5_3eegd
