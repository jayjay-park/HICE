Breakfast has been cantaloupe lunch spaghettios and dinner whatever my husband makes because I cant be in the kitchen around the smells too long. Ive also been eating a lot of meat Id like to call mysel a vegetarian but at this point thats just hugely dishonest and Ive been eating waaaay too much fast food. I used to eat fast food like... times a year maybe. Now I always find a reason to! Ugh.

721848,0,t1_cgm94m9,Thanks! Yeah for like  days before I took the test just the mention of fish was making me gag. I thought I had just been eating too much of it because of Keto. As for the medicine it sucks because it is literally the only thing that works to control my Trigeminal Neuralgia and without it I cant eatdrinktalk. It double sucks because I WAS in remission until I got pregnant before I knew I got pregnant. Ended up in the hospital last Sunday and got a very low dose of the medicine lowest Ive ever been on. It happens in some women the hormones will cause the TN to get worse or better sometimes just temporarily. Im actually weaning myself off a little today to see if it has calmed down. A lot of women also have miscarriages from the stress of the pain if they try to go without so Im conflicted. But we will see. ,CautiousBB,cgmbst2,2,t5_30jcb

For my first pregnancy I spent weeks  on Diclectin US name Diclegis until I became immune to it then weeks  on Reglan did not work at all and I had to go to the hospital because I couldnt stop vomiting and my urine was brown then weeks  on Zofran. This pregnancy I was put on Zofran right at week  and I expect to be on it until the end.Reglan terrified me. The side effects list was  pages long and the one that I still remember to this day is permanent facialtongue paralysis. Nope nope nope. After my hospital trip I told my doc that I was never taking it again. There is a zofran pump available. It tends to work better than the pills. It delivers  mg per hour via intravenous drip.

1479475,0,t3_2b3wr0,Im a little nervous about how my family will react. When I announced our first pregnancy my mom told me a few weeks later that she and my dad had already been making plans to cover my momthey ownoperate a business for a MONTH so she could LIVE IN and help with baby. That annoyed me because they didnt even ask they just told us and the very thought drove my husband up a wall and was part of the reason he suggested waiting after the MMC to try again. At the time I just laughed nervously and said we would have to discuss it because a month is a long time when theyre only an hour away. It hasnt been mentioned at all this goaround. We both believe a month is far too long for anyone to stay with uswe have only an old futon for someone else to sleep on besides the couch and we are both fairly private people. A week is pushing it for my husband who needs a safe space to chill out after work but I think hes more on board with that. I think well float the idea of MAYBE a week if I feel I need the help once hubs paternity leave is upbut only if the topic comes up. I also havent mentioned that Ias of now I realize I could change my mind dont want anyone in the labor ward with me but my husband and dont want anyone in the waiting room eitherI feel like that might make me feel pressured to bond and breastfeed quickly so people can come in to meet our son. ,CautiousBB,cj1q7rs,4,t5_30jcb

I was genuinely taken aback because I didnt care what gender my baby was but so many people had it in their heads that girls were cleaner or nicer than boys and it was much more fun to dress up little girls.

Im considering going to the emergency room because my OB is terrible and brushes off any concern I have. However if I can last a few more days I supposedly get to see her at my ultrasound appointment and Ill save a lot of money. It really scares me because Im now sick have morning sickness am high risk and I cant keep medicine or liquids down. Im also reasonably depressed. Im not bonding with my baby due to the fear that something is profoundly wrong. Sometimes I hate my baby. I hate my doctors. I hate the fact that Im useless. This is not a happy time in my life. Im fairly certain I am going to get postpartum depression. I feel like a sociopath. All I do is sleep now. My husband is never home because hes working an extra job to save money and I know its irrational but it makes me resent him. I had an emergency today and I couldnt get ahold of him I spent most of my day in bed starving because I couldnt move without vomiting excessively. Both of our toilets broke suddenly and I vomited all over myself the shower is clogged so I couldnt wash myself off. I hate it here. I want to move from our awful apartment.Im not happy with the care Ive been receiving but I dont have any other OBs in the area. Ive tried them all. I also ordered a heart monitor I said I wouldnt but Im not comfortable with not being monitored or seen until  weeks in my condition and I would at least like a way to feel in control.Cant you usually reach the doctor via email or phone in most practices?

We told immediate family right away and planned to wait until then the NT scan to tell everyone else. We ended up announcing at  weeks though.

1759651,0,t3_2emtmr,You and your doctor are both correct from what I can tell   How you ask is this possible?  You thought you were two weeks pregnant your doctor said you were  weeks pregnant.  For most intents and purposes dating your pregnancy happens from the date of your last menstrual period since most people cannot pinpoint the exact day they ovulated.  Thus even though a digital pregnancy test will say you are  weeks pregnant which lines up with common sense two weeks after ovulation you are actually considered  weeks pregnant by your doctor.  Thats right during your real first week of pregnancy you still had your period.  It makes no sense but since ovulation is really hard to nail down unless youre being closely monitored thats how the docs do it.  That said being able to see anything on an ultrasound this early is great.  By my calculations if you actually did ovulate on August  you are  weeks   day pregnant today.  Thats about the time in my own pregnancy when I was first able to see a gestational sac with a yolk sac inside it.  As far as where youre measuring and whether this pregnancy will be viable its really hard to say at this point.  Everyones HCG levels in early pregnancy vary widely and the important thing is that they are doubling every few days.  Therefore now that its been a week since your initial appointment the test you had this week should show a big jump from the  you got last week.  If not it probably means this baby wasnt meant to stick.  Unfortunately until you get that number back tomorrow theres no way to know whats happening. I hope thats helpful and at least somewhat reassuring.  Your doctor definitely knows what hes talking about.  ,CautiousBB,ck0ym6y,14,t5_30jcb

My main symptoms at this point are fatigue sore nipples very slight bouts of nausea in fact Im still hesitant to even call it nausea and some cramping on my right side on and off. I know people always say they want the nausea and then live to regret that when it comes so Im trying to enjoy not having it right now No idea when my next appointment is. I went to the student health center on campus to get my blood test confirmation so I still need to find an OB  I did sign up for a free consultation and tour at the local midwife birthing center to see if they would be a good fit so I guess Ill start with that and go from there.,CautiousBB,cki16pp,2,t5_30jcb

2054426,0,t1_cl0y5lh,Im sorry that youve joined us though Im sure you will be a lovely addition... we all can agree it sucks. Gestational diabetes stinks. If you are hungry you need to talk to your diabetic counselor! Now is not a good time to be hungry. Maybe you need to eat more and add a little bit of insulin to the mix. Better to take it and be able to satisfy yourself and get enough nutrients to baby. There are things you can eat that dont cost carbs. Vegetables have very minimal carbs plus a ton of fiber nuts are great though they do have some carbs eggs ate great and cheese works well too. I find myself eating more fat than they prescribe in the diet and that helps me feel full. I also have yet to gain weight.... so I guess its not negatively affecting me to add more healthy fats. ,CautiousBB,cl0yo3z,1,t5_30jcb

Take Tylenol and Benadryl to get close to the night version.I hope you feel better soon.This BabyCenter article says to avoid pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine especially in the first trimester.Edit I looked up Robitussin DM because Im not very familiar with it but its only listed as Robitussin DM Dextramethorphan on my safe medications list.

3148081,0,t3_2w7jos,I had a major gush of blood with my daughter when I was  weeks. It was unexplained but didnt affect the pregnancy. Follow your doctors orders and take it easy. The only suggestion Id make is to decline a pap smear if you dont have a strong family history of cervical cancer. I think that may be the reason why I had bleeding because my OB still does pap smears during pregnancy. Since youre having spotting anyway Id decline it. Always ask your OB though!,CautiousBB,cooan73,2,t5_30jcb

Darker or lighter may happen as your hormone levels increase and lighter doesnt mean less pregnant. I had a pretty intense threatened miscarriage at  and decided it would be a good idea to pee on sticks the next week and lost my mind when they were lighter. I despaired until my  week appointment felt reassured then went back to uncertainty despite morning sickness until the week when we heard the heartbeat.

Not as traumatic as yours but they still left a mark on me and my husband. What is helping me a lot this time is a really great OB.  Someone who gets you.  She agreed to see me once a week until I feel OK to have biweekly or monthly visits. My train of thought is that is something is going to be wrong we will catch it early enough.I dont want to question your doctor skills but you never mentioned incompetent cervix.  Im not a doctor.  Is it possible that it contribute to both later losses?  There is a way of catching it somewhat early and intervene before its too late.Can you wife be referred to MFMMternal fetal medicine doc for second opinion?  Second set of eyes will also make you feel better and those doctors have a better knowledge of high risk cases.Please get you wife the best care she can get even if it means paying some extra bills out of pocket.

Midwife is happy with my wright gain and Im measuring right on track!Had my glucose test and check up this morning. I had the fruit punch flavor and it tasted like bad Hawaiian punch not horrible at all though.I got the okay to back off my gallbladder restricted diet slowly trying fatty foods full fat dairy etc. Midwife agrees with me that the OB at the office can be very quick to assume the worst of every situationthis is why I only see him when she is not in. He told me to make sure I was registered at the hospital in case I needed surgery that day! Gave me a heart attack!. There was a bad bug going around my work at the time so it could have easily been that. If I have an attack then Ill back off of those foods again. For now Im looking forward to eating yogurt cheese and butter again!Baby girl has had quite a few days of reduced movement for her normal so we did a nonstress test to put my mind at ease.

3665972,0,t3_32cbec,Sounds like oral allergy syndrome My husband has it. Its basically an allergy to a group of plants. Benadryl is safe and it helps a lot. If thats what you end up having then its not that bad actually. RAW foods trigger a reaction but cooked foods generally dont. So baked fruits shouldnt cause issues.One thing to watch out for though is that even though its not necessarily a huge allergy it CAN get worse cause of over exposure.

3670958,0,t3_32f9xq,My OB had a student at my last appointment.

The OB knows this so he noted the fundal height checked with the doppler gave me a moment for the babies to settle checked their new position gently and remeasured. Totally different numbers by about  weeks I think it was.Fundal height isnt a great indicator of something being wrong because its so dependant upon the babys position the way youre carrying so if you look like youve got a ball up your shirt or if you look like Stay Puft and how much fat is between your uterus and skin.Im sure your ultrasound will be fine but definitely let us know how it goes.,CautiousBB,cqapooj,2,t5_30jcb

4071079,0,t3_376why,Ok this is only tangentially related to pregnancy but its really stressing me out soooo Im gonna vent.On Friday we took our yearold kinda crappy car in for an oil change. The mechanic noticed the passenger axle was looking bad and needed replacing. Fine bring it in on Saturday to get that fixed. It was supposed to be done by noon. At  my husband calls to see wtf is up. Thats when they decide to tell us another part connected to the axle just broke and they have to order it in. Ummmm excuse me? My husband went round and round with them but ultimately the car was undriveable and its only an hour til they closed ... what are we gonna do? I should mention ... this is our only car. We have no other transportation except the city bus. The buses ran on a limited schedule yesterday and not at all today. Today the mechanic tells us ... they cant get the part until Wednesday or Thursday! Now we have to get a rental car as we cant use the bus for everything we need to throughout the week but all the rental places are closed today. My son is with his father so I had to ask his father to bring him all the way here we usually meet halfwayhe readily agreed with no problem but I feel bad. And well have to use the city bus to get my son to school tomorrow bc we cant get a rental until after his school starts. And worst of all the mechanic is implying they think were going to pay for THEIR fuckup which like hell we are so we get to fight with them about that at some point.Im so fucking angry and stressed about this. I nearly had a panic attack this morning . And I know it sounds petty and selfish but dammit I wanted to have a nice relaxing Memorial Day. Now Im stuck at home as I have been for the last  days.

Dont get trapped in a negative line of thinking but instead think about the items themselves  is this item nice enough to store for later?

With a little bit of go ogling I found the main reason was for emotional healing. I passed the mc naturally and didnt need a dampc so was very lucky on that front. I wouldnt say we tried again.  I think I was still in denial that I actually could get pregnant. Im over weight and had been on the pill for  years  I struggled to believe I could fall pregnant in the first place and in my mind it must have just been a fluke and I had it in my head that it wouldnt happen again. My poor hubby had gone  weeks with out any loving so I decided when the bleeding stopped that Id give him some loving! And that was that. We had sex again approximately  weeks later but that time was too late to correlate with my dates. I asked the Dr at my appointment if the baby would be ok considering how soon it was and he said we would have to wait and see but didnt seem optimistic.

4472360,0,t3_3ccfzr,I am a carrier for cf as well.  It was hard for my husband to get tested because he had to go through his doctor who didnt know the proper blood test to order.  If you have this issue  have your ob give you the codes to give to his doctor. Until we received the results we decided that no matter what we would keep the baby.  That is the first decision to make.  While having a child with cf is hard  it is much easier knowing before hand and we could get the proper doctors  child care  etc.  set up before he was born. We I try to make contingency plans when stressed.  Once a decision was made we concentrated on getting my husband tested.

4512454,0,t3_3cunz0,Ill just preemptively slap a big ol trigger warning on this and Ill put a lighthearted one at the top so hopefully you can collapse this comment without seeing anything if need be...During each of my first four pregnancies I would dream that Id give birth to an adorable baby...which would promptly turn into a kitten.  But that was my babykitten dammit and no one got to mess with it and I was gonna cuddle it and carry it around and nurse it in spite of those sharp little milk teeth.  Then fifth pregnancy I didnt have this dream.  In hindsight this was my only indication I was going to have a boy lack of kitten dreams.That pregnancy I instead dreamed that I helped a friend from high school deliver his wifes twins and they turned into kittens.  She did have a girl by the way but not twins.I routinely have absolutely terrible nightmares during pregnancy.  The most recent one of those was that I was told I was having twins but something was horribly wrong with one of them it turned out to be anencephaly and to make matters worse there was a strong risk of twintotwintransfusion syndrome.  When I was pregnant with Psalm I kept dreaming that she was unexpectedly born at home and still had her anomalies but she just kinda hung out in spite of that and in spite of being small enough to fit in my hand.  I guess that was subconscious wishful thinking?I had one dream when pregnant with Doug and the setting was postapocalyptic but we still managed to have annoying neighbor kids who were needlessly loud.  And we were looting this house for clothes and they had an awesome inhome laundromat.In another dream we were holed up in a highrise building post Zombiepocalypse.  It was relatively safe because the revolving door confused the zombies.  Unfortunately for us they quickly evolved to have human intelligence and superhuman speed and figured out how to use the elevators...,CautiousBB,cszfx90,2,t5_30jcb

4650196,0,t1_ctgoqi6,Yeah its a different pregnancy different birth but for me it was more a matter of labor not starting after my water broke. So I was on pit for like  hours with only cm dilation then her heartrate went up. I feel like if my body can do some early labor on its own then I have a good shot but if Im stuck chained to a bed on continuous monitoring trying to get through days of labor it might be better to just bite the bullet and go for a surgical birth. It would certainly feel better to OPT for cs rather than suddenly find myself there against my wishes again.

4719871,0,t3_3fkgdg,I guess its a different culture here in Oz but I was encouraged by my GP to go with midwiferyled care. Unless you have a specific reason to see an OBGYN all your lady care PAP smears etc. are done by your GP here so you dont see an OB until youre pregnant and if you go with a midwife you still might not! So what that means along with socialised health care is that you dont have OBs competing for your business. It meant I got what I think was a fairly objective recommendation from my GP  its no skin off her nose whether I go with a midwife or an OB either way Ill eventually be off her hands. She told me she sees more positive outcomes and patient satisfaction from the local birth centre and felt that for a healthy lowrisk patient like myself touch wood it would be an excellent choice.So this is all terribly anecdotal but I guess my point is that in some parts of the world midwiferyled care is really respected and encouraged by doctors. My sister is in med school and she had a midwife for her prenatal care and delivery. Maybe you could look into midwifeOB ratios in other developed countries to show him?,CautiousBB,ctph8wi,1,t5_30jcb

And also dont get discouraged if you dont find it right away. Depending on the position of your uterus you might not be able to hear it yet. Im a student in ultrasound and checking the babys heartbeat once a day poses no danger at all to your baby.

Your hips are loosening up to make room for the baby. If you put pressure on them they will start to slip out of joint a bit which can cause pain. Crossing your ankles while you sleep on your side will put pressure on your hips especially if you also sleep with a pillow between your knees.

6197098,0,t3_40awt5,Hi! BFP on January th at  dpo on our th cycle. As per usual Ive taken five tests and so far so good. Im still waiting for lines to get super dark so until then Im on pins and needles. No bleeding so thats good. I took a clear blue digital that said  weeks and then freaked out cause I thought it meant  weeks pregnant and that my hcg levels were probably dropping. Its really  weeks post ovulation. Im pretty sure this will be my life until first tri is over... But despite that Im so so excited to be here!Edit Holy crap I have a due date!,CautiousBB,cyu1l9m,3,t5_30jcb

6273820,0,t3_41ii1j,Every other night at  am I wake up from a dead sleep to go puke. Sometimes theres a massive poop beforehand sometimes it is just the most intense episode of vomiting Ive ever had. It wouldnt be so so bad if it didnt wake the dogs as well who then think it is their turn to go to the bathroom outside and wont come back to bed until they do. Trying to be thankful it is just every other night instead of every night. ,CautiousBB,cz2rglf,1,t5_30jcb

6295014,0,t1_cz4rfjh,I had the same thing. My chart shift was CRYSTAL and I was so sure when I ovulated... and yet my due date after my dating scan was a week forward of where it would be if that were the case and it was confirmed correct at my anatomy scan.I guess it happens sometimes!

6364381,0,t3_42sgjh,I think Im one of the odd people that doesnt feel fear about the pain or anything Im just more afraid of death complications and not being in control of my body if I have an epidural or something. I think a lot of it has to do with the fear of the unknown and not being able to predict anything that is going to happen. Im trying my best to focus on the women who have done this before me and how I do not know a single person who has faced severe consequences while in childbirth and that gives me hope that I can do this too. I visualize myself with my child in my arms and that is what gives me the strength to want to do this and to push through the fear and the pain to earn such a great reward. I empathize with your fear  its not fun to feel this way. ,CautiousBB,czd25zd,2,t5_30jcb

6464760,0,t3_43zabt,So the bleeding was only last night and now its basically mild spotting which does not even stain the pad  only see it when i wipe. I got the test results back and obviously they are not looking good. HCG went in  hours from  to  and Progesterone went from . to .. Doctor cant really confirm yet that Ive lost this pregnancy but they said most likely I will. They want me to repeat blood test tomorrow and come in on Monday for a sonogram. I dont have high hopes as the line on my HPT seemed lighter this morning but a very subtle difference. I guess if this is it I hope it wraps up quickly. Im not sure if Im supposed to expect an actual period now or is it just gonna be it until the BFP disappears altogether. Not sure when a new cycle starts when i can try again. My Dr. was not in the office today so I talked to a different doctor and all he said was too early to tell. ,CautiousBB,czo01kk,1,t5_30jcb

6579905,0,t1_czznzfj,Yeah I know a few people whove said the same thing about the nausea at this stage  seems quite common. Hopefully its the start of the end of nausea!! Yes absolutely a change of habit causing it. I was talking to hubs about this earlier. I feel particularly bad on Saturday and any other day where I didnt got to bed early enoughget enough sleep. The past few Fridays have been really late nights. I also eat less through the day and bigger meals at weekends whereas I graze all morning at work during the week. Its definitely explainable and kinda annoying!!! ,CautiousBB,czzwzd6,2,t5_30jcb

Well I feel like shit I have  energy and the only thing that helps my nausea is carbs. So I know Ive gained weight just from over eating.

6828951,0,t3_499w5q,I felt the same with my pregnancy with my daughter at first after my first pregnancy ended in an early miscarriage. I would try to pretend I wasnt pregnant in my mind sometimes so I would feel less worried because I couldnt stand to hope. That feeling did slowly decline as my pregnancy went on and as I could feel the babys movements every day.One thing that helped me was being grateful for every day I got to spend with my baby. I would thank God every night for one more day with her there alive. I would think This was one more day than some parents get. I tried to love every day with her. I still do that with my daughter now that she is born.,CautiousBB,d0qd1aj,6,t5_30jcb

So snoogle and I left for the guest bedroom and I kinda slept onoff for a few hours. Now Im up and exhausted. And I havent been feeling baby move the same way for about a day I still feel movement but its really slow and more like rolls and not as frequent like baby is in a daze or something. Got up at  and had some cereal and drank a bunch of water to see if baby would wake up not much changed...so now Im freaking out that I should call my doc. Its also my birthday and I had a massage planned for this morning but now Im tired and cranky and worried and I dont even think I can go enjoy it...fwp I know  ,CautiousBB,d1p6zaz,1,t5_30jcb

May our babies become awesome and cheery!! Did you tell anyone yet? How can one keep this secret for another  weeks????

You arent close with your mom and aunt for a reason and they clearly reinforced whatever those reasons are with their negative reactions. Im not close with my mother at all weve been estranged off and on for  years but when I got pregnant I knew I had to tell her verbally or else Id suffer insane family drama.

7380668,0,t3_4gfmfl,Wow that on call doctor sounds like he could use a refresher course in bedside manner. What a jerk!I am pregnant for the first time and only  weeks along at the moment but for the past week my temp has been between  degrees most afternoons. I dont feel sick at all stuffy nose from allergies at times but not like sicksick and wouldnt have realized I had the elevated temperature if I hadnt just randomly checked it one day and then decided to keep checking. I have no idea at all what it means but I am choosing to believe its fine. As with anything pregnancyrelated so far every symptom I have seems to indicate something perfectly normal or absolutely terrible depending on which source I read. So I have decided to always go with the perfectly normal opinion until I see my doctor and he tells me otherwise. I hope this helps a little! Feel better soon.,CautiousBB,d2h4qs2,2,t5_30jcb

8303165,0,t3_4t4xme,This is just a shot in the dark but have you ever heard of erythema nodosum? It is an inflammatory condition affecting the subcutaneous layer of skin. I had swelling in my legs a few years ago but attributed it a cellulitis due to a recent nd degree sunburn and rash. It started with a painful bump on one of my shins which I thought was a spider bite and then I developed some swelling and pain with walking. I waited and waited and finally went to the ER. I was sure theyd say cellulitis but suggested EN when they felt my legs. It hurt like a bitch but he could feel nodules under the swelling and sent me to a dermatologist.They tested me for a few things and did a biopsy. Turns out it was from my birth control a new one since I didnt react well to another and they now have me listed as having an estrogen allergy. Weird I know. But when I stopped my pill the swelling and pain went down only a few days later.Typically it involved both legs but it can affect just one. Pregnancy can be a trigger luckily it has not reoccurred during this pregnancy at least not yet. Did you notice any bumps on your leg prior? Typically on the shin. Have you had strep lately or a cold that you never had further tested thought could have been strep? Epstein Barr Virus? Do you have a history of TB IBS Bachets disease sarcodosis? Have you recently taken penicillin a sulfa drug the hep b vaccine Obviously you dont have to reply with which one if you do but keep these in mind and consider going to a dermatologist if you feel this could be the issue. If it is unfortunately itll just have to run its painful course.again shot in the dark but something that can easily be missed. When I tell medical professionals I have a history of it they usually say they have never heard of it. Im a nurse and I had never heard of it prior to having it.

9495091,0,t3_5at1dm,Long story timeI havent experienced any placentalcord flow issues so Im no help in the BP department but my son had suspected asymmetrical IUGR that was detected at  weeks when my fundal height was measuring too small and confirmed at  weeks cant remember exactly with an ultrasound. His abdomen would range  weeks behind his femurs and head circumference at one point it was in the ltnd percentile. We got lots of additional ultrasounds and nonstress tests in the third trimester but my OB and the perinatologist couldnt see why everything else was growing on target except his abdomen.  The placenta looked normal blood flow to and from the cord was normal I wasnt doing any drugs or smoking or anything like that and hadnt had any infections etc.  I dont think it was malnutrition related since I gained the recommended lbs for my starting weight by the time I had him and ate a decently healthy diet. So it was a mystery.  His abdomen just kinda gave up growing near the end for no discernible reason.Initially they said they definitely wanted him out by  weeks but then as we approached  weeks his abdomen started to catch up a bit it was only  weeks behind at that point so they said we could go to  weeks.  Right before  weeks the growth fell to  weeks behind so they said he was as baked as he needed to be and induced me at  weeks exactly so he could start gaining weight outside the womb.The ultrasounds were guessing hed be in the lb range with a margin of error  lb I believe so they didnt think he was a super dire case or anything but they were afraid he wouldnt tolerate labor or that his growth would continue to stall if we left him in until I went into labor naturally so we induced and he was born that same day...at lbs .oz. So maybe not that small after all?His tummy DID look a bit odd compared to average sized babies it was oddly tapered in near his waist. And he was a bit short . but he came out perfectly healthy and crying with high Apgar scores and didnt need any special interventions aside from some time in a warming bed because he was having a little trouble regulating temperature right after birth. He went home with us  days later and aside from dealing with a little jaundice due to low breast milk supply that cleared up when we started supplementing with formula hes been totally fine ever since. I think his official diagnosis was SGA in the end.  He was a bit small especially his abdomen but nobody could find out why. He was perfectly healthy and pretty big for an IUGR baby all things considered and had made it to full term with no other issues...so Im really not quite sure what happened with him to make his abdomen lag like that.He had completely caught up and then some on the weight charts by  months and by the time he was a year old he was a giant.  th percentile for weight th for height. At  hes pretty much the size of a  year old and eveywhere we go people ask me if he was a lber at birth and when I tell them Nope  theyre like NO WAY. Hes always been super hardy too.  No ear infections  common colds in his life eats and sleeps like a dream super happy little guy whos hit all his milestones on time.Im  weeks pregnant with  right now and my OB has had me taking baby aspirin every day since I got my BFP just in case it was an undiscovered blood issue that lead to my sons SGAIUGR.  Ill also be getting an extra growth scan at  weeks just in case.  My OB measured my fundal height at my glucose screening this Monday and didnt say it was off so Im guessing it wasnt an issue. So far this baby has been measuring pretty average the whole pregnancy but so was he until the fundal height discrepency was discovered  weeks so a part of me is worried its going to happen again that suddenly her abdomen will start dropping off in the next few weeks.  As of my  week ultrasound her head abdomen and femur measurements were already a little uneven with the abdomen being the smallest of the  so Im preparing myself mentally just in case.I know our situations are a bit different and that having a fairly large small baby at  weeks is not the same thing as having a cordplacenta and BP issues and being prepared to go at  weeks but Im hoping things will turn out well for you guys!  I was pleasantly surprised we ended up going all the way to  weeks and nobody was more shocked than me when my son turned out to be a HULK as he got older. I was so worried hed be tiny and sickly and have all kinds of health issues but we got really lucky and hes been completely fine.  Hopefully your baby catches up quickly on the outside too!  I just wish we knew WHY his abdomen wasnt growing properly on the inside and I wish I knew if the same thing was going to happen to this baby. But having gone through it once Im a little more confident things will turn out fine in the end if we have the same issue again.Good luck!,CautiousBB,d9jh14i,2,t5_30jcb

Basically I was told that unless the cramps are particularly painful andor accompanied by fresh blood I should try to keep my cool. Cramping in general I was told was pretty normal. They even jokes that Tylenol will be my new best friend. I guess what Im trying to say is that this sounds pretty normal imo. They warned me that I may have some cramping or light spotting after my transvaginal ultrasound. I didnt spot but I had some cramps. Hell I still get cramps and random twinges of pain.Hang in there!!
