215684,0,t1_cf2yigs,gt Strength a  reduction in risk is not a strong relationship in epidemiological data. An increase of  is fairly strong. An increase of  or greater is strong enough to conclude causation almost immediately. Consistency in this experiment fiber caused a reduction in risk in some populations and did not in other populations. Specificity there were some variables that were impossible to separate from fiber or the lack thereof there are other possible explanations. Plausibility how does fiber cause its effects?. Coherence experiments generally dont come to the same conclusions.All well and good but thats simply laying out criteria to use in interpretingcritiquing a single study and what it shows in terms of causation.  It says little about the issue as a whole though.  In the context of this discussion you could say that the study regarding mortality rates doesnt establish a strong causal relationship but even if thats the case this was a study youre relying on to make your point that fiber is not beneficial whatsoever and thats not what the study shows.  Even if the study doesnt show a strong causal relationship between total fiber intake and reduced mortality the relationship it does show is still profiber.At the end of the day I would agree with you that fiber probably isnt the miracle nutrient some people might make it out to be.  Logically it doesnt make a lot of sense to me that fiber intake in and of itself would have a large effect on mortality rates.  I think where I disagree though is that its not beneficial at all at least for some people and I dont think that the data supports that conclusion.  Its one thing to suggest that a data set only shows a weak causal connection but even a weak causal connection is more than no connection whatsoever.It seems to me that the jury is still out and more research needs to be conducted before theres any clear consensus on the issue and I think its premature to conclude one way or the other at this point.  Perhaps we can agree that for some people increased fiber intake may cause problems and for others it may have benefits?  What prompted me to chime in was seeing that chronic constipation study being posted yet again in a post telling people they do not need fiber.  This may be good advice for some people but I do not think its sound advice for everyone and its certainly not supported by that study thats so often cited on these boards.  If your body does better with no fiber Id say go for it and I wont sit here and lecture you that you need more fiber for your health!  But at the same time I dont think that a no fiber diet is the best option for everyone and clearly some people do better with some fiber intake in their diet.  Personally I track my fiber intake and I know I can tell a big difference when Ive gone for a few days with too little fiber or when I go for a few days with excess fiber.  I find that maintaining a consistent fiber intake is particularly important for me on a keto diet.,ketogains,cf30eha,1,t5_2v5mu

415652,0,t1_cfnts7k,PSMF is basically keto but you cut out all the fat. use the same protein macros to prevent muscle loss and eat as little fat and carbs as possible. exercise is optional but if you choose to you should limit your exercise to strength training xweek as HIIT and cardio can actually hinder fat loss by ramping up cortisol levels.  You also may want to increase your protein intake if you decide to lift.  Lyle stresses the importance of incorporating fish and flax oils to get your essential fatty acids in but this should be the majority of your daily fat intake.  You should also take potassium calcium sodium and magnesium supplements to prevent some pretty devastating muscle cramps.  Your meals are basically limited to lean meats like chicken breast and veggies sugar free jello for dessert and thats about it.  Definitely dont skimp on the veggies or water or you will pay for it on the toilet.  Hope thats enough to get you going! ,ketogains,cfnuji9,2,t5_2v5mu

510963,0,t1_cfxdn9x,I am serious.  I know what dedication can do for your body. When i was  I was  lbs. when I graduated from high school. I wanted to be skinny for college in Fall. I went on a   calorie diet and did cardio for  hours a day  days a week. In about  months I went from something to  lbs.Right now I only eat one meal a day on Keto and I water fast  hours. So I take some people view of something being unrealistic with a grain of salt. I take your trolling comment as you way of saying Ive never tried anything hardcore in my life so I am going to blame you for being an annoyance because Ive never had such achievement in my life.I am not looking for someone to agree with me I am looking for someone  to tell me the possibilities and realities if I go all hardcore with myself with such dedication. And I can tell when people give advice but never accomplished a tall feat in their life. A skill you get good at as you get older and can recognize when some people are just flapping off at the mouth with no experience. I explained to another poster already that people say that they lose about  lbs on average when they do  months of Insanity. I will be doing  months so that is an equivalent of  lbs lose or  to  pants size lose. And based on my experience if I lost  lbs per month on Keto then that is  lbs in  months about  pant size perhaps. Add that all together in theory that is  to  lbs lost and  pants size down. Now I know that as skinny you get it is much harder to lose weight and things slow down. But if I got all hardcore like I did when I was  and yeah I know that I am older so the progress will be more slowed down more than before then it is a possibility I would get as close to slim as she is but not as muscular. And I agree with two persons that the woman probably had liposuction done on her abs.Again I am going by me losing one pants size in two weeks without excercising and trying to honestly figure out would look like two pant sizes lost every month WITH hardcore fitness activity. I will stop talking about it because now I dont have the time since being on the internet takes away from my gym time. ,ketogains,cfycl36,-3,t5_2v5mu

562236,0,t1_cg3y7tu,gt His mentioning of GH vs insulin doesnt make a lot of sense to me. To be fair I have a selflearned knowledge about keto and certainly not an allinclusive education about metabolism.See thisElevated insulin levels contribute to the reduced growth hormone GH response to GHreleasing hormone in obese subjects.Its information like this that really gets me to question why insulin works when GH produces bigger muscles. I know insulin plays a role in utilizing energy. It seem like with all the info taken into consideration a strict very low carb lowermoderate protein ..g LBM instead up the upper range seems to be theoretically best for growth BCAAs are recycled better in ketosis More energy is available to prevent muscle loss under high energy demand Insulin secretion is down FFAs block GH but in ketosis FFAs are turned into ketones. Not sure the effect of ketones on GH. Not sure how long FFAs circulate before conversion and how they would impact GH while in ketosis. Uptake of nutrients and protein is improved in ketosis seemingly due to lowered insulin secretion even in spite of peripheral insulin resistance. aerobic output is increased and Timeundertension is a key feature of hypertrophy. timeundertenstion would require mostly aerobic energy until the very end.These are just a few points that seem to point towards SKD being optimal for building muscle. But in practicality we all know this to be untrue. Either people are getting too much protein frequently while lifting and in turn not enough fat to provide energy for enough ketones to circulate or there are puzzle pieces missing in this hypertrophy issue that either I dont understand or science doesnt understand about ketosis.My point remains I still dont agree with this video and I think this dude is missing some standard facts about biochemistry that sound really close but are off just enough to lead him down the wrong path. I agree that I think there were carbs in the BCAA drink or the lady was consuming too many drinks in a day and reducing ketone production by constantly causing GNG in her liver therefore reducing fat oxidation.,ketogains,cg46kkg,2,t5_2v5mu

Most of is in rketogains believe in picking up heavy things and putting them back down always adding weight is a good approach and would benefit more than a cardio program or body weight AMRAP sets. Look in the FAQ to the right have a gander at the recomp protocol which  BF is a pretty good starting point for. So pick a novice gym program like SS SL or ICF and eat above maintenance ketogains calc in the sidebar and eat at a deficit on your rest days. Maintaining .g protein per lean pound. This will ensure a steady gain in lean mass prevention of muscle attrition as well as fat loss. Slow and steady wins this race.

But over the past few weeks Ive exchanged some of the lifts or machines I dont like or that dont work for my body. What are the main advantages for the x stuff? Is it just that theyre your preferred routines or are they more synergized with the keto programme? I.e. the lack of muscle glycogen in comparison to a carbrich diet.Ok.... Well I know how Zyzz is popular and all but his program is not really the best for beginners. Any beginner and I mean anyone should start with the basics. You cant build a house without first starting with the foundations. You need to start with the basic lifts build a solid frame and then start adding accessory work. The x stuff are the most widely known popular and proven programs that give the best results for strength and muscle building Starting Strength Program Wiki Strong Lifts x Jason Blahas Ice Cream Fitness x Novice ProgramI suggest you start with the third one as it adds a little accesory work and skip Zyzz program but its your call. If there is one thing I would have changed from my   years of lifting experience is to start doing these programs sooner and to not follow fitness magazines or fitness blogs flavors of the month. Stick to the basics Bench Press Squat Dead Lift Over Head Press Row.  Those exercises will build ALL your body.gtThats god to know. Im going to experiment with gradually lower carbs and increasing fat to see if I notice any of the sidebenefits of keto and also to see the effect it has on my fitness.

Im surprised that there is no talk about testing for ketones in this thread.  Has anyone over eating peed on a ketostix?  Or blown on a breathalyzer. My guess is that it would be off the charts.  Have you assessed the makeup of your stool Id guess not.  These are all ways that your body can expel compounds that would otherwise have been burned for energy or stored.  I am leaning toward the camp that hormones including insulin are a major driver of the lets store this energy for later and a weaker signal from them may allow a lot more energy be passed over.

1651938,0,t1_cjne1nu,ampampamp Lactate threshold sfw gtThe lactate threshold LT or lactate inflection point LIP or anaerobic threshold AT is the exercise intensity at which lactate more specifically lactic acid starts to accumulate in the blood stream. The reason for the acidification of the blood at high exercise intensities is twofold the high rates of ATP hydrolysis in the muscle release hydrogen ions as they are cotransported out of the muscle into the blood via the MCT monocarboxylate transporter and also bicarbonate stores in the blood begin to be used up. This happens when lactate is produced faster than it can be removed metabolized in the muscle. When exercising at or below the LT any lactate produced by the muscles is removed by the body without it building up.gtInteresting Anaerobic exercise | Interval training | Conconi test | Time trialist Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcjnec oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecjnec.

1700552,0,t3_2dpl6h,OK I can tell you that I have these moments from time to time.One thing that I have found was that nut butters triggered binge eating and blunted my sense of fullness.  In addition after eating a large amount of nut butters in a day I had more soreness and was more sluggish the next day.  Your log shows at least  oz g of nut butters just in breakfast.  If you continue this throughout the day you are going to feel pretty bad the day after.The reason for this is phytic acid.  This acid is present in most nuts but is very high in almonds.  This acid interferes with mineral absorption and digestion so you should really limit your nut intake.

No. I wasnt as clear as I couldve been here I guess. Because fructose is metabolized in the liver it simply is unable to produce the same amount of blood glucose or glycogen blood glucose ! glycogen for athletics you want glycogen. Here gt Unlike glucose which is metabolized widely in the body fructose is metabolized almost completely in the liver in humans where it is directed toward replenishment of liver glycogen and triglyceride synthesis. Under one percent of ingested fructose is directly converted to plasma triglyceride.    of fructose is converted in liver to glucose and about quarter of fructose is converted to lactate.    is converted to glycogen. Glucose and lactate are then used normally as energy to fuel cells all over the body.So dont use fructose because its not good for glycogen synthesis. gt Is fructose not raising blood glucose good since insulin wont be raised Pre workout which means more growth hormone would be released? Quite the opposite. It appears that insulin Im the context of exercise can be good as insulin is anabolic. The difference is with exercise is nutrient partitioning. Increased exercise growth goes to muscle. No exercise  high insulin growth goes to adipose tissue. Pre workout carbs seem to secrete less insulin which is a good thing. Read that article and all the ones at the bottom. There is a ton of sourcing through those. Youll also see a few that show pre workout carbs or protein dont raise blood glucose.

2357315,0,t3_2mcec3,IIRC Keifers Carb Nite author main arguments for the carb refeeds were to boost leptin and ghrelin which were two examples of what he refers to collectively as fatburning hormones. He says studies show levels of those decreasing the longer a person loses weight until a plateu is hit. It may happen slower on a ketogenic diet a year or more but still happens. This really matches up with what Ive found in my personal experience and is what got me really interested in trying CKD. I have only been into it for a few weeks now. Week  lost  lbs week  lost nothing week  TBD. I wonder how long this guy in the video has been on a ketogenic diet and how overweight he was in the past. I think those two things can play a big role in how much success a person has staying strait ketogenic. Edit Couple things to add from my own experience  I find the Carb shock protocol to be helpful in making the carb nites more comfortable and recovery quicker. Carb shock is a supplement Keifer started selling but its really easy to buy the ingredients and make it yourself which is what I did. The main ingredient is gm leucine. I also find it very helpful to not feel like crap and recover faster from carb nite to take electrolytes. I take a magnesium chromium and eat some dairy for calcium and an avocado for potassium. This makes a world of difference for me.I also suspect that exercise is more important than a lot of Carb Nite advocates make it out to be. Both the precarbnite workout as well as workouts following during the week. The week that I lost  lbs I worked out  days after the carb nite HIIT amp weight lifting which i suspect helped deplete my glycogen faster to get me back into ketosis so I spent more time that week in ketosis before the next carb nite and therefore lost more weight.  ,ketogains,cm32pdp,0,t5_2v5mu

If you just eat proteincarb that day its no big deal your plan is decent but only YOU will know if you can tolerate the constant ins and outs of keto.  days isnt enough to get keto adapted I strongly suggest you go full low carb for  or so weeks first before switching to CKD. Make sure to schedule your highest intensity workout for after your carb up. Dont backload any other time or you wont be doing keto at all keep it to the one carb up day.  you can only build muscle so fast I suggest gaining no more than half a pound to a pound a week  any more than that and you will just get fat. ,ketogains,cnh68fy,1,t5_2v5mu

3079294,0,t3_2vdwje,I agree with above comments that doing a very aggressive deficit achieving fat adaptation fastest way possible AND expect no loss in performance  Disappoiiinted !With  hrsxweek youre probably moderately active not lightly active. Ask yourself What is my most important goal ? If that is to performance speed when working then adjust your kcal accordingly.If ketosis and fat adaptation is more important then the answer gives itself. Assuming you understand this might temporarily affect performance.Youre working out a lot and possibly also anaerobically when speedy deliveries. You probably glycogen deplete pretty fast meaning you can possibly eat more carbs than the reced g in the phasing in. Using MCT is a good idea. But there are far more experienced people on this board than me on this matter.I sort of agree with Kingofthegnome. I carb crept down g g g g etc phasing my body into this WOE from a totally carb dominated eating. I experienced some migraines and rashing but no performance loss. Already after  weeks I could cycle for lt hours mixed LIT and HIT with no energy loss only muscle fatigue. By week  the hunger was gone. But were all different. So pick a strategy intake test for  week and adjust accordingly. Listen to your body,ketogains,coh606z,2,t5_2v5mu

3169549,0,t1_coqhpzy,Yeah. I checked your rketo flair for your stats. My wifes also  and had a similar issue. She loves running for pleasure but it stalls her diet.Im really procardio but I would cut out the cardio entirely for a month or two and then dial in your diet. If the lb stat is still accurate you should still have some easy losses from diet alone and youll recover better from lifting. Make sure youre weighing portions and however low your carb intake is go more extreme. You want to establish a perfect baseline and then diagnose your actual caloric needs.I can give you technical suggestions for diagnosing your calorie needs if you like but the end result should be that you find a calorie level that is sustainable and that loses you lb every  days or so. Play with meal timing to see what makes you fullest and dont let carb creep happen. You can lose right now from diet alone with no training and no hunger.Once youve done that you can add back in cardio if you like. I like rowing or similar because its a big calorie sink and low impact. Get a heart rate monitor and go horrifyingly slow. You want to minimize any stress response and feel like youre on a very easy walk. Heart rate  if you can bear it and no sprints. The harder the cardio the hungrier it will make you. Do it gently fasted and in a way that your body doesnt even notice its happening. Youre trying to make a calorie sink and increase your energy expenditure without triggering appetite at all.This isnt good advice for sports training naturally but it works for weight loss. I know theres a HIIT following here. Im not arguing against that maybe its a good approach. My expectation is that it wont help you feel less hungry.But to be honest my wife eliminated all cardio and it works way better for her. She was stalled and hungry and now she loses lbsmonth without feeling anything. I think she lost about  lbs in a year but a lot of that was on either side of the cardio plateau.Good luck I hope this was somewhat helpful.,ketogains,coqitbx,1,t5_2v5mu

3567000,0,t3_312lvi,I have been doing BJJ for a while itll be  years when August comes. I feel old now....I typically use more CarbNiteCarbbackloading strategies personally. These programs do typically suggest a  day keto phase before you begin cycling carbs. I have a pretty tough time making it through  days but there are some factors that people have already mentioned that do seem to play a big part. One personal issue is that my physician and I think that I may have a MTHFR gene mutation. I am going to get an actual genetic test soon but this alters your metabolism of folate and affects other B vitamins. I think this may have personally thrown me off during some keto phases due to the diuretic effect further depleting some B vitamin stores. Ive had to take methylated folate as well as other activated B vitamins and its helped me dramatically. Again this is more of a personal issue but that gene mutation is actually extremely common in the general public. On a side note ive had my testosterone plummet actual lab tests to confirm during some phases. I think this was mostly related to the MTHFR issue but even so i was probably pushing too hard during the keto phases. lets be honest though its easy to tone down your strength training during adaptation phases but during grappling sometimes you just gotta crush some dude regardless of what your diet plan was for that day lol of course this is a pride issue but none of us are perfect so this shit happens.Regarding electrolytes personally I feel that I sometimes really have to take some magnesium. Taking potassium doesnt seem to feel any different but magnesium seems to play a big role. My digestion kind of gets jacked up and I stop sweating even when Im hot which kind of sucks if youre boiling after training. Ill develop some exercise related urticaria skin itches like crazy because Im hot but wont sweat. Taking magnesium with water sometimes lets my body release sweat again and gets my bowels a chuggin magnesium has stimulating effect on bowels.Although I normally try to employ more CBL strategies Ive noticed that if I do a keto phase and then plan to reload carbs relative to training Ive been gravitating towards the followingBJJ or explosiveHIIT stuff reload some carb pretrainingStrengthweightlifting reload carbs afterI keep a tub of dextrose powder around for this.I think the overall issue is kind of an egoperformance question Maybe im too much of a bitch but it does suck sometimes having some crappy schlub pass your guard just because youre keto adapting and you feel like if you try to react quickly your heart is going to explode. adding in some carbs pretraining may have some metabolic disadvantages but i do tend to be more mentally stable and on the ball during training. maybe if i stuck out the potential  month adaptation window i would be a boss but my patience for that long of a wait sometimes wanes.,ketogains,cpyv4x4,2,t5_2v5mu

As youre just getting back into lifting you should be able to build some muscle at the same time as losing fat. I just say this because its one of the only times that youll be able to lose fat and build muscle effectively at the same time. Alternatively you should just lean bulk from where you are now because having more muscle makes cutting easier when you get around to it. ,ketogains,cq3bomc,4,t5_2v5mu

Which fat could do. However pure protein can cause a spike in insulin. Fat would blunt an insulin response. So it depends on if youre concerned about that or not. An insulin release post training is going to put a halt to all the catabolic processes that the weight training initiated and flip the switch from catabolism to anabolism. Personally post workout is the one time of day where I see an insulin response as being beneficial. ,ketogains,cqn4182,-1,t5_2v5mu

3888182,0,t3_34zb97,here are some excepts from Sohee Lee amp Layne Nortons book that I ketofiedREVERSE DIETING ASSESSING AND MAKING CHANGES When and how you make changes to your numbers is really going to depend on how your body is responding. You will ideally be taking measurements and pictures once every two weeks at the absolute minimum. Waist measurement is critical but it may also benefit you to keep track of your hips thighs chest and arm circumference. Try to be as objective as possible. I understand its not always easy to do so but not letting your emotions get in the way is going to be critical to your success. You will then make the following changes  If youve lost scale weight measurements are down and youre looking leaner in the mirror you can add on  to your fat numbers.  If youve maintained your measurements and youre looking the same you can add on  to your fat numbers.  If scale weight has increased measurements have gone up and you are visibly carrying more fat keep all numbers constant. From here continue for another two weeks before doing another checkin. I strongly recommend keeping a close record of your macronutrient history as well as your corresponding weight and measurement changes. These will prove to be invaluable later on as you assess your progress. A  bump in macros may seem insignificant. But if you continue to increase your numbers incrementally over time it will add up. REVERSE DIETING SETTING BASELINE MACROS The best way to determine your reverse dieting macros is to start with your current intake. If you havent really been tracking your intake then log everything you eat for the next three days. Try not to change your food choices or portions simply because you want to be good the more accurate a reading we can get the better. You can use the oldfashioned pencilandpaper method to do this and then find the nutritional information of all foods online. To be clear for this process we strongly recommend using a food scale to weigh everything youre eating and log all the ingredients of meals that you consume. Eyeballing portions is less than ideal especially when you need an accurate idea of what and how much youre eating. From those numbers increase your fat numbers by . Protein intake can stay constant as more is not necessarily going to be better. As long as you have a minimum protein intake ofglb lbm thats more than sufficient. If youve been ingesting an unusually high amount of protein .glb bodyweight or more you may even consider bringing that number down. For example lets say you ended your diet at the following numbersg protein gcarbs g fats From here we have the following calculations implementing a  increase g protein g carbs .g g fats If youve been calorie cycling the same rules apply. Id recommend beginning with a more conservative bump until you have a better understanding of how your body is responding to the increase in food. Admittedly it doesnt look like much. And you may not think that its going to change anything. But remember we want to do this slowly in order to allow your metabolic rate to come back up to speed. If you wanted to adopt a more aggressive approach and increase your numbers by  you would have g protein g carbs.   g fats This is just to give you an idea of how to calculate your starting macros. So remember  Protein amp carbs number stays more or less constantFats increase ,ketogains,cqzhith,3,t5_2v5mu

4190550,0,t1_crxwtp8,Thanks for the info amp advice it helps clarify a lot of things. gt PSMF as explained by McDonald is a crash diet intended for short term use and make no mistake you can use stored body fat but fats are essential and adequate fat is essential. Your workouts will suffer as fat is energy and relying on stored body fat for your full caloric needs is not very efficient.McDonald says all you need is EHADHA omega s amp the rest your body can make is he wrong about that? I think saturated fats are important for making cholesterol and testosterone which is why I included egg yolks for instance. I get why its not as easy as assuming that the body will use its fat reserves for energy due to the speed it can burn it McDonald said every pound of fat on the body can burn about  calories so fatter people can get away with it but not when youre  as it can easily cut into muscle reserves.gt They recover but its a matter of time no one knows how long and why risk damage to your hormone production when you could lose weight efficiently without affecting hormones. If youre OK with low libido slowed metabolism insomnia etc then so be it but seems shortsighted.Ive definitely experienced all those things.gt That would be fine though again I think you need another plan but its up to you of courseMy original plan was to just do ketogains. How low can one go say with TDEE of  calories? Ketogains requires more fat intake than what PMSF does and thats the main difference so whats the thresholdlimit? At higher BFs one can lose more poundsweek since the body can produce more energy thus readjusting every  weeks as one gets slimmer has to be done IMO as the wiki shows. gt Improved exercise performance energy increased satiety reduced hunger improved sleep mood stability...many others which are more specific to individuals.I thinkbelieve that the keto system is what we were evolutionarily designedadapted for amp that the high carb diet had no place in our diets precivilization aka  years. Keto amp paleo are similar in a lot of ways. gt Yes you can go in and out of ketosis but ketoadaptation refers to a state in which your body is primed to run on fat which requires consistent time in ketosis over monthsI saw your other comment about CKD amp that being McDonalds. The Wiki makes a reference that  g is the limit of carbs. I was thinking for my workouts to take in  g of glucose preworkout with BCAA and if Im feeling week sip some low calorie gatorade which has some sodium too amp for a total of about  g of carbs in the gatorade.I read that this should be fine because these sugars will replace any glucoseglycogen that was used during the workout right?gt See above benefits of ketoadaptation as well as other benefits such as managing insulin resistance which is common among people who are overweightobese. For many yes its about the fact that keto makes eating at a deficit easier for most. People with insulin resistance find it more difficult to lose wight eating carbs because they are in a constant state of high insulin insulin is a storage hormone. Thats not to say that they cant lose weight on a high carb diet but its often quite difficult and associated with extreme hunger and cravings.And high insulin means low glucagon therefore less fatty acids can be liberated right? Assuming adherence is not an issue you mentioned the extreme hungercravings which I think is because of leptinghrelin stuff then technically even on a high carbno fat diet on a deficit the body will still liberate fatty acids from fat cells but its just that its much harder to do on a long term basis basically.Also do you see the Minutes RPT Program Berkhans RPT program would be better for my lifting stats? I couldnt see myself squatting deadlifting on the  day program. It seems like RPT is more conducive the bigger the cut overall more time for rest amp less sets basically less time squattingdeading. ,ketogains,crxx7l3,1,t5_2v5mu

There are some philosophies that emphasize meal timings and coordinating macros and calories with lifting days but that isnt necessary if youre still just starting out. Eat at a deficit with proper macros and lift weights. Once you hit your goal weight worry about bulking then. If you try to micromanage everything youre setting yourself up for failure. Easy sustainable meal prep is the key to establishing healthy eating habits.The traditional bulkcut cycles are effective for athletes because body fat percentage is a serious concern for body building and sports with weighins so they bulk at a healthy body fat percentage  usually then drop down to something unsustainable  for competition.

But I think you need a post about HOW to get to your bountiful ass goal.So Im guessing you were entirely too quick to say you know about squats and hip thrusts. These and the others motions that develop the glutes via expanding from a reduced state the angle between your torso and your thighs. So keep this in mind we are trying to make you very very proficient at the act of opening up that angle. This sounds easy and straightforward. My point here is that I think you are better off not being quite so sure about thinking you know how to squat.You may or may not want to be obsessive about this but you will find that better results come from QUALITY MOTION! You are on a quest to learn how to squat hip thrust kettlebell swing or Romanian deadlift with not just the ability to move lots of weight but the ability to move gracefully! You need to cultivate that grace which should feel much better than not being graceful. You need to think that not only will your newly developed ass look good but that the very acts that developed it will themselves look good likely turningonimpressing the males who witness it. Seriously arent you impressed when a man or woman if thats your thing! moves well? Work hard to do these exercises WELL!My recommendation is work with kettlebells. There is an idea not original at all that kettlebells are the easiest way to learn to squat well. Since you have to keep you body tight to properly move without tipping forward this is an excellent way to learn that a good squat a quality motion involves using much of your body conscientiously. These are things that require lots of attention. Think of your self as practicing piano as much as you think of yourself as kickingass.Heres a few guides to goblet squats with kettlebells. The first link is a lighthearted video.  The second is a more complete routine based around squatting like this though it recommends somewhat lower reps than I would for size and hypertrophy Id go no lower than  and probably work more in the  rep range perhaps up to  Both links are the work of worldclass coaches who are latemiddle aged and have worked with all kinds of athletes. As a earlymiddle aged guy whos lifted for years I would listen much more closely to these guys than any  year old keyboard jocks sorry Reddit! or most of the mansplainners you will meet at the gym.As part of this especially since you really should be learning to squat very deeply you should be working on your mobility which should impact your pelvic tilt which another commenter mentioned. This is easier said than done. BUT if you work on your mobility you can start to engage your glutes and grow them to glory! Some mobility ideas. look into what the Alexander Technique folks call active rest. This releases your ilipsoaspsoas the one pair of muscles connecting your back with your pelvis.. Stretching. I like long and slow but sometimes briefer and more intent works better. The list of stretches is long but the list of important muscles is shorter calves hamstrings quadraceps hip flexors glutes piriformis. Id also look to the door stretch for the chest and something called shoulder dislocates find them on youtube to improve my ability to keep my chest up in the bottom of a squat.. Foam rolling. Get a foam roller and gently roll out some tight spots especially in your lower body. The one place you shouldnt roll is your lower back below your rib cage. But you should look to rolling calves hamstrings glutes and especially a part of your quadriceps called your IT band. . Buy olympic weightlifting shoes. Maybe youre a Jimmy Choo woman? Do you have space for another set of shoes? Heres a video explaining WHY you might want lifting shoes And here are some options for the shoes I DONT know about womens sizes but this should give some idea of what is out there. And anyone selling these should be very willing to talk sizes and foot shapes.  These are not made for dancing or even walking they are made to keep you still!Chinese made WeiRui shoes. These are what I use as they are CHEAP! another cheap optionreeboks and suchand another make Addidas is the old stanby the handmade sustainable options.  Reviewed here This is far from comprehensive! You really need to pay attention to where you have problems and look find solutions! A reddit post isnt ideal to teach you all this but the point is you want to prioritize squats or the other exercises  I mentionedhip thrusts kettlebell swings and romanian deadlifts which can be done with a kettlebelland work to do them very very well. There is nothing wrong with say working to get better upper arms but this big lower body stuff is where time is best spent both to get a nice ass and to change your metabolism to make your body more muscular and hence better able to burn fat at rest.And if this works for you please tell others! I think this is a such a worthy cause as Id love to see an ass army out there!Tldr your ass is best grown by getting highly skilled and ultra proficient at squats romanian deadlifts etc. and there are betterworse ways to do that. ,ketogains,cta1zzg,2,t5_2v5mu

6295403,0,t3_41t2vx, Start lifting now. You can still gain muscle even when on a cut and even if you dont gain anything it will help prevent you from losing muscle . For your average person it does not matter. You may eventually have to start doing a TKD approach where you have carbs before working out but that is still in the future and covered in the FAQ. In the FAQ.  The short version is in order to maximize your muscle growth you need to eat at a surplus. However eating at a surplus means some energy will go towards muscle and some will go towards fat. The more fat you have the faster you will gain fat. The bulkcut cycle is a way to work around this without becoming overweight. You bulk for some time gaining muscle and fat then you cut to reduce the amount of fat and hopefully maintain as much muscle as possible. Clean bulking vs dirty bulking just has to do with how you do your bulk. On a clean bulk you are eating at a slight surplus in order to reduce how fast you gain fat.

6395331,0,t1_czgkmj4,Absolutely. Electrolytes are based on sodium potassium and magnesium. The FAQ covers this in detail but the upshot is as you move deeper into keto you end up pissing out all of the water that was bound to the carbs held in your liver and muscle stores. This in turn causes you to excrete a whole bunch of electrolytes causing an imbalance which can lead to fatigue cramping headaches.Easiest way to do it is to follow the FAQ recommendations and smash a teaspoon of salt with half a teaspoon of litesalt in a glass of water. I did this with lime juice a few times a day and it makes a massive difference. ,ketogains,czgl0bw,3,t5_2v5mu
6409776,0,t3_43fp68,No one is answering because they dont like saying read the FAQ  times daily but that said ... read the FAQ.Simplest advice? Start somewhere. Do anything you can do but I would recommend going to a gym and either buying a few sessions with a personal trainer or go online and educate yourself. That said here are some exercise you might look up. Google Alan Thrall YTWL ... first video result. Watch the whole thing if you want but the good stuff for beginners is closer to the end at the YTWL part. Why look this up? Everyone can benefit from stronger more stable shoulders. A lot of people especially as they age have shoulder pain.. RDL Romanian deadlifts ... this is an advanced lift but it doesnt have to be if you keep the weight ridiculously light. Google proper form and see if you can do this with an empty barbell. Slide the weight down your thighs and stop just above the knee. Why this exercise? Allows for possibility of strength increase and a lower start as opposed to some body weight alternatives though you can research any lower back exercise you want. As with shoulders everyone can benefit from this.. A core routine NOT crunches though. Try yoga  you can look up a good instructor over youtube. Try SarahBeth.Theres more but basically the point of this post is YOU have to do the research. No one is going to hand you anything and judging by the fact that you didnt read the FAQ you are not accustomed to self education. I would do some research before posts in the future. Rule of thumb if it can be answered with  minutes of googling you shouldnt be asking others to waste their time.,ketogains,czi86kz,1,t5_2v5mu

Still particularly on a keto diet you can cut those calories down and worry a lot less about burning precious muscle. Otherwise while it does seem like youre making progress  without something like a DEXA scan or whatnot the mirror can be misleading about muscle gain  a lot of times when you cut down you might actually be losing a little muscle but you look more muscular. ,ketogains,d6g42bk,1,t5_2v5mu
8621306,0,t1_d6h8zfw,I started lifting  weeks ago on the SLx program. I was kg when I started and fluctuate up to . kg  but have rarely been under  since I started lifting. My losses had stalled when I started and Ive gained some decent muscle in my arms and legs so Im not too fussed. Ive found that the regular muscle stress seems to have me holding onto more water I drop about kg when I do my hr fast on my  day break each week but put it back on a day or two after refeeding. Have you been taking creatine the whole time? Creatine causes extra water to be stored in the muscles kg worth in some people which is good for muscle development but may be affecting the scales. Depending on your dose and if you loaded this could happen gradually over a  week period. The extra water in your muscles plus any muscle gains may be hiding the fat loss. I figure if Im building muscle while maintain roughly the weight lowest reading for the week then its all good. Give it time and if necessary you can reduce calories with a bit of IF. I think keto by itself will only work for a period of time at which point you need to look at the best way to reduce intake my preference is with periodic fasting rather than daily caloric restriction.FWIW  I started loading creatine yesterday arvo with g my order just arrived and I will take another g today. I dropped about .kg over night just in water weight and I dont know why its the opposite of what I expected. Im hoping the creatine will help with the squats which are killing me now theyre over kglbs.

Looking at your stats heres my experience but non professional or qualified opinion. BMR  Maintenance Calories Sedentary Your ideal bodyweight for your age and height is around lbs. Not sure why youre posting in Ketogains as I think you need to shed a bunch of fat right now. Then worry about gaining. Dont try to do both. Lets shed the excess bodyfat first. The good news is that if your body  health are compatible and its okay for you Keto can help you achieve your goals. Its still hard work and it still takes time but I find it definitely gives you an edge.I would focus primarily and initially exclusively on caloric deficit and getting used to eating less. Id aim on getting  meals a day. Keep a close eye on your protein and keep it to about   .g per lb of lean body mass which for you is about g of protein a day. Id start at  and dial back by g a week if youre not entering ketosis or fat burning.In my experience Id use these macros and tweak as you go along    Total Daily Calories     Macros        Carbs kcalg g or fewer    Protein kcalg min g max g    Fat kcalg g adjusted based on actual number aboveGive it time. Get through the initial phases. Drink lots of water. Dont overmeasure weekly is fine. You WILL see results.I wouldnt do any exercise other than walks or long strolls for now. Get used the calories. After    weeks start thinking about getting a strength training programme going. But tackle things one at a time and youll get there. I bet if you can stick to the above in  months youll be well below lb and around  BF. Huge progress in other words.Good luck! Work hard!,ketogains,dakad0m,3,t5_2v5mu

Just as it took you time to become ketoadapted it will take time for your body to become carbadapted if youve been in ketosis for any decent length of time. Carbs are broken down into glucose and stored in skeletal muscle as glycogen and when you have depleted glycogen stores due to ketosis then lifting at high intensity tires you more quickly than usual.

10911354,0,t3_5vvtt2,Answering in your order. I would avoid the peanut butter for the carb count.  Other than that Ive been eating roughly the same foods for  years including a lot of saturated fat animal products and all systems are good but your mileage may vary.  Some people react poorly to increased saturated fat have your blood work done if it concerns you and if the levels rise significantly switch in favor of monounsaturated fats.  .  Sodium is critical.  Sodium potassium and magnesium are all important but sodium is king.  A ketogenic diet is naturally diuretic so you are constantly pissing out water and electrolytes.  They must be replaced so consistent water intake along with adequate electrolytes are really important.  Start with the guidelines in the FAQ if you still feel bad up the levels.  Use NoSalt or NuSalt for potassium supplementation if necessary both work well but mushrooms and spinach are both delicious and have lots of it.. This seems perfect for you if you are willing to commit.  Keto is a marathon not a sprint so I believe your overall style of slow and heavy will lend itself to this lifestyle.  You could just run a deficit but keto will get you lean while feeling vital with clarity and energy while in that deficit..  You will need to figure that out.  Try working out at maintenance calories.  If you are losing fat and gaining muscle youre on the right track.  If not losing fat lower calories if not gaining muscle up protein and calories.  Be aware that there is an adaptation period.  The fat oxidation cycle is more efficient but slower than the glucosepyruvate cycle so your cells require more mitochondria per cell to produce the same energy after switching cycles.  This adaptation period to gain mitochondrial density takes  weeks depending on the person you may feel weaker than normal in the gym during that period but you will recover..  Its fine to include cardio though some have found more fat loss potential by including the LISS cardio after lifting sessions the intensity of lifting mobilizes the fat and the cardio burns it up.  Not sure if that is truth or broscience but its done me good biking a few miles after my x sessions..  ABalance the calories for your gainloss goals if you need lower calories but more protein than fat has to come down.  But this should fall in line with figuring out where you lose vs gain vs maintain. BThese numbers sound okay Im  at lbs currently maybe  BF and Im eating g fat g carbs g protein.   You may want to lower the fat a little if you want to cut the fat faster but its not unreasonable.Good luck man sounds like you have the drive to do this.Edit English stuff,ketogains,de5fg7a,4,t5_2v5mu

10926319,0,t3_5w16kb,So I was pretty much in the same position as you  on Keto to lose some body fat and to get faster. Had a half marathon I was training for so was gymming and short runs during the week long runs on the weekend. It was all quite hard initially. And then something changed. I found that on the long runs whilst I didnt feel massively energised I felt like I could run forever. I would have eggs and bacon for breakfast and no gels. I wasnt that fast but I wasnt horrendously slow either. Come the week before my half things fell off the rails a bit due to various reasons so did a bit of carboloading. But on race day I had  boiled eggs for breakfast. And got a PB! Cut  mins off my fastest time from when I was super fit and not running on a dodgy knee. I think this was due to a combination of factors  flat course speed work in the week running with a pace group that was a little bit faster than my estimated finish time but I think the most important aspect was that Id trained on a Keto diet and my body was used drawing on its fat resources. Incidentally I didnt take any gels with me as I expected there to be energy drinks at the water stations but there werent any! So keep at it and remember part of its training your body and your mind  youll break through eventually and youll be happier for it  KCKO.

X is successful because of linear progression and focus on form. The ketogains website states Start with an empty barbell. Add weight each workout. Deload when you stall. Repeat. Simple.The super low weight at the beginning is very on purpose so you focus form as well as you dont plateau.

11015556,0,t1_defb4v4,True but there are like dozens if not close to a hundred Jason Blaha hate videos out there. Whether its intentional or not hes great at riling people up and getting hate.

Something about selfdelusion just pisses people off and Blaha is utterly delusional and might even suffer from a major mental illness as far from reality as he is. Best case some form of narcissism worse case mild schizophrenia and probably autistic either way. And yes I am suggesting he has some form of mental illness or that its somewhat likely.

11229262,0,t1_df4ssb0,At  lbs and your activity level your maintenance is much higher than  meaning you are in a huge deficit.  You will lose weight fast but also it wont be sustainable long term for retaining muscle and especially energy.  Find out your maintenance and then cut  calories from it.  Whether you try keto or a regular diet calories in must be less than calories out or you will not lose weight.  A gram of protein per lb of LEAN MASS is the absolute upper limit of protein you need so a good way to calculate your protein is to multiply . or . by your current bodyweight.  Make the rest of your calories carbs or fat.  If you go low carb schedule your carbs pre and post workout mainly.  Start off slow.  You need to be losing a lb a week minimum  lbs max.  Once that stalls lower calories by  or add cardio.  Or both.  A couple months in look into supplementing with fat burners but not before because you want to lose the easy fat without them and not be tolerant to their benefits when fat loss gets hard.  Look into ephedrine plus caffeine stack and yohimbine during fasted cardio.  If you absolutely need a cheat meal try to fit it into your calories so you wont lose progress.

Nevertheless I find it very useful for diet adherence because  large meals a day are very easy to organiseconstruct both from a calorie and macro nutrient stand point. And everyone agrees that overall calorie and macro nutrient consumption is more important than timing.I use the above feeding and training windows whether Im in a bulking or cutting phase.The type of IF youve described above is not ideal from a muscle protein synthesis standpoint but I wouldnt say its overly disadvantageous. As you might be aware extended periods of fasting offers benefits to insulin sensitivity.Overall theres not enough evidence to suggest macronutrientmeal timing has anything but a very very minor impact on performance.I would only suggesting altering your macronutrientmeal timing if you were struggling with either diet adherence or achieving your goals.I also complete semi regular  hour fasts and have found them to be beneficial for weight loss and appetite control.,ketogains,dft55rc,3,t5_2v5mu

11485689,0,t1_dfxtu04,These are the things that are good to hear. Its hard being in an almost totally new body and getting attention from girls like my ex and then being told that things just arent right and that even though she loves me she doesnt see a future... especially when she runs back to her ex a month later and he pales in comparison to me in and out of the gym. I figured I could wallow in the pain of the breakup try and get her back or move on... and in terms of my body and fitness option one wasnt going to happen and option  isnt healthy so I only had one choice and that was to continue on the path of iron.

Go for g of protein  via food have a buttload of green salad or broccoli  zucchini. Get your fats from olive oils.. meats.. eggs.,ketogains,dgwgfto,2,t5_2v5mu
