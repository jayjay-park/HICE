3912118,0,t1_cr20z3d,I wouldnt say that cane is all you get. Most of my blackberries will shoot  inch branches at almost every leaf junction the next year. This is what sprouts the berries on it in the canes second year of life before it dies off. But ultimately your goal should be to nurture and train your first year canes so you have tons of them the second year for fruiting purposes. Once youve an established patch youll be getting new canes every year while your old canes fruit. Cut back second year canes after they are done fruiting. Hope that helps.,Berries,cr27tji,3,t5_2rptp

8173882,0,t1_d4z8fsv,I dont actually know much about blackberry cultivars.  I imagine there are wildcultivated breeds that dont turn purely black when ripe  for example I grow Tayberries which are a raspberryblackberry hybrid and they never turn black.To the extent that someone on the internet who has seen  picture can tell you they are safe they are safe.  The leaves the square stem the thorns the arrangement of the buds the fruit itself... they all point to blackberries.EDIT Here are my r. alleghiensis plants with some very immature fruits ,Berries,d4za9oh,3,t5_2rptp
