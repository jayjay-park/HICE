9211896,0,t3_569cva,So Ursoc...our dps needs to uh really come up if we want to kill this guy or we will probably need to ask some people to sit for heroic. Vellissa  Talents Go earthen fury if you arent going to refresh your totems they contribute a decent bit of dps but are wasted if not kept down.  Windrush Totem gt Gust of Wind especially if you can speed up the raid getting back into position.  Ascendance pretty much wins hands down on single target fights like Ursoc.  Rotation  Flame Shock this need to be up all the time. Average uptime was about   I can understand  not so much. Also you are missing out on about  potential lava burst casts in some the attempts. Make a weak aura for it to pop up when its available to cast helps alot.  Storm Keeper should be used  more too  minute cooldown  minute fight it got used twice.    Make sure that you are syncing up your buffs with your fire ele too.Gear Gems and Enchants!!! There are  methods.  Stack Crit or Stack Mastery and Haste. Pick one and stick with it.  ,SlapfightGuild,d8jocu3,1,t5_388th
