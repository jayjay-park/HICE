1012529,0,t3_25nwqc,Id apologize for the length but were not millennials and you asked   I can answer many of these questions but Im not younger than you. Neither is half the band so were of an ageera and fortunate enough to enjoy the genuine unity of a multigenerational fanbase.gt The cover of the record depicts what looks like two Casualties fans making out.FOB employed punk iconography and references throughout this album cycle noting their influences. I enjoyed their Casbah Clash attire on BBCs Alan Carr but I think it hit bizarro masterclass in music history level last summer when Joe named Sleep as a potential touring partner in a skit video. gt The title track off of Save Rock amp Roll featuring Elton John is a word unrecognized pleasure. Ok theres no way you missed the incredible Dictators Bloodbrothers in desperation! nod. There are better protopunk bands in terms of melodic sophistication but The Taters are for me the nucleus of cerebral punk that makes your brain clickclickclick unbidden between readings of a song  many parallels to FOB members diverse skillsinterests when you look at their careers and their refusal to write a song you can take straightup.  Every protest singer Every guitar slinger Every punk rock sinner sells his soul. My generation is not the salvation So who will save rock and roll?    .... Labels and mutual promotion always play some role in official remixes. But in this case the conceptual underpinning of Alone Together connecting people via music with these acts is solid. Wish it had been a full EP.   Jump Smokers are a house group from Chicago and remixes are what they do. They put fans acts and genres together. Krewella is three people mad FOB fans from Chicago who spent time in conventional bands before focusing on an eclectic electronic dance project with live vocals. They met while attending Glenbrook North. Patrick graduated from Glenbrook South. Theyre passionately adored by fans and are the target of a fair amount of hyperbolic hatred. Patrick cowrote a lovely fuck you anthem about shared experiences in music for their debut album and Krewella did a remix of AT.        .  I respect the right of another to love and enjoy any music heshe considers poppunk. I genuinely try to get poppunk songs  pretty regularly because thats part of interacting with music fans with different tastes. That term to me  Joe Strummer with hayfever vocals cantwont play instruments well lyrics are straightforwardlimited. Its entrylevel music to me. I hate the musical projects of Green Day and Blink as much as I did the day I first heard them charming idiots by singing about whacking off and immaturity. Theres too much music I like to waste time with poppunk.  They inspired FOB no question but I believe many people love TTYGFUCT because a musicliterate exHCgrindcore drummerwho was also a pop genius with a beautiful voice a killer metal drummer who loves Queen an abnormally skilledgearoriented guitarist and a bassist whod take on the world all veterans of many bands at that point  they tried on poppunk like a shirt that was too small and got to higher ground.             I hope you consider my belief that IOHFADSRARButch!PAXRyan! is a steady ascent to genreless immortality blooming from s punk roots.. If not I dont have to defend any shit to you.In my day we called it IDM which stood for intelligent dance music. No... no we didnt. ....Were around the same age and I cant believe you were particularly acquainted with that electronic subgenre because you made a joke about stupidity using IDM. Artificial Intelligence was a comp release title i.e. The Annual for music one couldnt dance to. Americans started using IDM as a catchall term for music similar to those compilations. Richard James  found it funny and said he was glad it wasnt used in any other part of the world.

Since I go to school for this kind of stuff I try to be a bit more understanding since I understand what can happen when the servers are being overloaded like that but its still super frustrating.I dont see any reason why we dont all have our packages other than poor management at GoMerch. If we ordered them the day they went on sale we should have them if we waited until yesterday to order then yeah thats understandable but theyve had weeks and weeks to have everything ready to send out before the release. Its not like Save Rock and Roll and the release date was moved up.Sorry for ranting Im taking my GoMerch frustrations out on my keyboard.

5047089,0,t3_3k0w6v,I think that I needed to give my opinion  and that lacked a bit.I rank Folie probably was their rd best record behind FUTCT and TTTYG.On one hand its a record that totally breaks the more experimental sound that IOH started to build.Disloyal is a great opening song. Its perhaps the best track opener from a record by them the lyrics are cleverly written.Then Shes My Winona and I Dont Care are two meh songs. the first is one of those songs that I fill a bit written to fill. I know there is gomna be people who love it but I never got the real hang of it. I dont care seemed like one of those fuck off songs but tbh didnt quite had thr strenght that yoi felt on This Aint A Scene.Americas Suitehearts is a bit of a weird song. I love the video the chorus is amazing but I left it a bit short. Seemes that the song had a tone of potencial and it hit the crossbar. I feel like somethings missing there and I really cant explain what.The combo of headfirst slide the shipped and coffee are really good. The first song is a proof that a change in sound isnt bad. The lyrics are amazing it fits well. Shipped is one of those cute songs that even it doesnt standout will allways puts on you a smile when you listen. Has for Coffee I feel its a powerful political song really right by the time it was written.What a Catch is perfect.The first song I dont even need to talk about it.  is for me their most underrated song. Its a rocknroll thing that pops out with a lot of anger lyrics and a fun guitar solo. It also is a bit of a total oposite to what What a Catch offer us making it my favorite FAD song.Then again I feel like Tiffany and w.a.m.s are a bit empty. I like the Tiffany chorus but I hate the lil wayne part. Was for w.a.m.s. never could like the song. dollars is a pretty upliftinf beat for the lyrics that it had and West Coast is a great end of the record.Honorable mention to Lullabye has the sweet baby song and to Pavlove which to speak is great. I feel like its better than most Folie.My problem per say with folie isnt the hate or stuff. I just dont find the record has solid has FUTCT or TTTYG. Ita really really good but some of those songs leave me a bit goot out the door. Its  or  years later their sound got better and stuff true but perhaps call it nostalgia I feel like it allways missed something to Folie a bit of magic touch that the  other records had that made them special.Other than that also feel that Lake Effect Kid was a better sing than much from the record since that song was really good. Even Alpha Dog is better imo than most songs.Though tbh not enterly sure on how they fill.Hate me if you all want but for thosr of you open to discussion  tell me where Im wrong and why you love the songs that I dont.,FallOutBoy,cuud5uu,1,t5_2u7q6

But while SRampR which I loved is to me a solid mix of their older style combined with modern pop experimentation. Their prior vibe is still there to me on SRampR along with shaking things up which I admire when artists do stagnation is boring. With ABAP it all just comes off as very style over substance to me in a lot of areas  very hollow very mechanical. In some spots it sounds like theyre trying to be Maroon  its just too pop for me. But I dont necessarily hate it theres definitely good stuff on there  Centuries is of course a great song. I like Irresistible. Fourth of July is brilliant. I love Novocaine.

I think thats why that whole train of thought bothers me so much and why I post about it as I do is that some of fans seem to legitimately believe that theres a right direction for the band to go. The truly amazing thing is that this direction happens to perfectly align with these fans personal tastes and preferences.    Fall Out Boys music has changed a great deal with each album very little about the band as a whole has stayed the over the last  years. But there is and has always been a portion of their fan base who cant understand why even artists and musicians might change over that time span and their art along with them.

11700594,0,t3_66xx0s,Foli A Deux embodies failure in something beautiful.  While the album has become one of the most beloved of Fall Out Boys discography in recent years it was not greeted with open arms upon release.  The album touches on a myriad of intricate topics and new musical styles that help it maintain a depth far greater than any album the band had put out prior.  The album also brought with it the hiatus and taught the importance of decompressing as Pete put it.  Without the problems that arose from the creation of Foli A Deux the band would have ceased to exist.  Not everybody will see beauty in something you create.  Those people may come around or they may not.  There is always something to be said about those who persist in the face of failure those who want Hell or glory and nothing in between.

11770387,0,t1_dgu1zpx,Ive never done VIP wout MampG.The only thing thats super appealing to me about VIP this time is exclusive merch.  I didnt bite when Panic! did VIP packages that came w an exclusive  vinyl and I REALLY regret that because I need that single in my life This is Gospel piano version.  I dont want to regret it again this time but with my luck itll be merch I can live without.,FallOutBoy,dgu7dgy,2,t5_2u7q6
11782796,0,t1_dgveem1,I joined in  actually maybe  when I first heard My Songs in a fan video I dont like fan videos that much anymore and since then its my favorite song. But I only listened My Songs Centuries and Phoenix. At one point I started listening to Dance Dance Sugar and Dance Dance. Later I started listening to the latest two albums but I didnt listen to it on a much deep level. Then in  I completely dived in and spanning the entire year I listened EVERYTHING. GOOD GOD IT WAS AMAZING.,FallOutBoy,dgvm9f1,1,t5_2u7q6

11792458,0,t1_dgw2rdg,Same.  I didnt know what the colors looked like beforehand but I like interesting looking vinyls and I figured Swirl would be cooler than the solid redbluelavendar.  Swirl sold out pretty quick too in the standalone vinyl,FallOutBoy,dgwpqvw,2,t5_2u7q6
11793896,0,t3_688n8c,So it wouldnt leak before they were ready for it to get out. Because people are constantly on the hunt for whenever theyre working on things and they didnt want their surprise ruined.,FallOutBoy,dgwvm6v,1,t5_2u7q6
