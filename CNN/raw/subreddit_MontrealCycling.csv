783569,0,t3_222fs2,A little late to the party but here it goesBought a bike with a frame I really liked in a horrible neon color.  Sanded it down best I could and then brought it to ADN powder coat in Sthubert.The person I dealt with Andy had warned me that on occasion bright colors will bleed out during the baking process for the color I had chosen white.Got a call  days later saying I could come pick up the frame.  Andy explained that the bike was great except for two small spots where the previous paint had run.  I told him the spots didnt bother me too much and he agreed to only charge me .  The quality of the paint looked great but keep in mind this was my first time getting a frame powder coated.  While looking at the bottom of the frame I noticed the color had run in a cloud shape.  It looked like a small yellow cloud painted above the color I had requested.  Showed this to Andy and he apologized profusely.  He tried to give me my money back immediately and he agreed to sand it all down and repaint it no extra cost to myself.Im suppose to be picking up the frame later this week.  Wouldnt hesitate to deal with them again and looking forward to seeing the end product.  Said he normally charges around  to get a frame and fork powder coated.,MontrealCycling,cgtcg9i,1,t5_2wyrv
