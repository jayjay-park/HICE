8987556,0,t3_50ztod,Chapter   The Structure of the PsycheExecutive SummaryJung spends most of this chapter leading up to then talking about the collective unconscious so the following primarily draws from Jungs exposition. Question If the unconscious is just like the conscious and the conscious has dreams then does the unconscious have dreams and if so where do they come from? Answer Yes and they come from the collective unconscious Jung postulates that the rationally explicable unconscious which consists of material that has been made unconscious artificially ... is only a top layer and ... underneath is an absolute unconsious which has nothing to do with our personal experience p. He calls this the collective unconscious. The collective unconscious can translate ones experiences into mythological motifs. In the case of problems this elevates the personal problem to a collective problem and gives the patient an opportunity to see that their experiences are shared by other people making the experience appear normal and bringing compassion into their healing process. Example the symptom of heel pain relates the patients disappointments experiences to the treacherous snake in the Garden of Eden mythological meaning in order to heal the disappointments.  Magic by analogy a myth may become a template for a ritual to extract a particular result The whole psychic organism corresponds exactly to the body which though individually varied is in all essential features the specifically human body which all men have. In its development and structure it still preserves elements that connect it with the invertebrates and ultimately with the protozoa. Theoretically it should be possible to peel the collective unconscious layer by layer until we came to the psychology of the worm and even of the amoeba. p The psyche like the organism reacts to its environmental conditions. The Collective unconscious as a timeless and universal psyche reacts to universal and constant conditions p The whole of mythology can be could be taken as a sort of projection of the collective unconscious. ... We can therefore study the collective unconscious in two ways either in mythology or in the analysis of the individual. p The psyche must exhibit organs of functional systems that correspond to regular physical events. For example the Sun is the centre of various regeneration myths. p Its not physical occurrences which remain as images in the psyche but the fantasies caused by the affects they arouse. p. Affectladen fantasies ... repeat themselves and give rise to archetypes as I have termed mythmotifs in general. p ordinary everyday facts which are eternally repeated create the mightiest archetypes of all p the collective? unconscious as the totality of all archetypes is the deposit of all human experience right back to its remotest beginnings. p the archetypes are ... the forms which the instincts assume and creativity comes from instinct p Mans countless magical practices civilization religion and philosophy exist to help him come to terms with the unconscious. p All the most powerful ideas in history go back to archetypes. This is particularly true of religious ideas but the central concepts of science philosophy and ethics are no exception to this rule. In their present form they are variants of archetypal ideas created by consciously applying and adapting these ideas to reality. For it is the function of consciousness not only to recognize and assimilate the external world through the gateway of the senses but to translate into visible reality the world within us. p,ThePortableJung,d7s5zn2,1,t5_3fwc5
