Sounds good?I was going to wait for the other dude to answer but since hes taking a while and I actually found other codes that are like mine Im pretty sure they both work actually I was just having doubts because one had  digits and the otehr  but I found out the first ones starting with PX from PAX had  and the other ones starting with AW from Alienware I guess had . Plus I gave him my code first so if theres any problems he just doesnt need to give me his code. P,SmiteTradingPost,clypeef,1,t5_2zlk3
