47838,0,t3_1umqgv,gt Do you think JimmySteve is really dead? I mean they didnt show him die die so I am wondering.gt gt Emmy Rossum Exactly. Im not sure. You should have seen the version of the script they never shot. It had the drug lord playing polo with JimmySteves head. That was supposed to be the last shot of season . And THAT would have made it clear that JimmySteve was dead. The fact that they never actually shot the scene makes me think that they didnt want to solidify the idea that Jimmy is dead so it leaves it a little open.From Here,shameless,cejvkj4,12,t5_2sctv

296593,1,t3_1xhj6f,Just finished watching the episode. Does anyone else think its a possibility that Carl had something to do with Liam getting the coke? Fiona handed Liam to Carl when Carl walked in the house. And after seeing Franks reaction to all the help hes getting from his oldest daughter its safe to say that Carl was definitely in a weird place. Fiona is still an asshole for allowing the circumstances to be as they were but I just cant help but wonder about Carl.

Ive known about the breakup for a week and there are several scenarios where I could understand Ians motivation for breaking up with Mickey but the reasoning we got here wasnt that Ian didnt want to be a burden to Mickey it was that Ian wanted to stay off his meds.  And then to have him not even be phased as Mickey is being chased down the street as Sammi shoots at him and tries to kill him?  And to make a joke about it?  It was so off.,shameless,cq2p547,12,t5_2sctv

They know that a subset of the fan base cares and they take pride in weaving a set of stories that all hold together. Small errors are going to slip through and its a bit of a game to spot them. Nothing wrong with that. If there get to be a lot of errors even if all small then it says something about how much or little effort the writing team is putting into the show. ,shameless,dasspyz,15,t5_2sctv

9935267,0,t3_5himb0,I know you were asking straight dudes but Im a straight female who isnt normally excited by romance plots in the vast majority of tv shows I watch. I agree a lot of the time a romance plot is not done well and only serves to get in the way of a good plot or used as a distraction for a lead character. However when a relationship on a television show is done correctlywhich is rarely then I can fangirl with the best of them.Mickey and Ian are lightening in a bottle. They are played by great actors they have unbelievable off the charts chemistry the characters are three dimensional and interesting and their characterrelationship development has been a beautiful thing to watch.Most television shows dont get the relationship thing right. They usually just throw two people together for the sake of drawing viewers who crave that type of plotdrama. It doesnt matter that they are gay to me. Im not saying that to be politically correct. I say that because if a romantic couple is written the right way then it can be an amazing thing to watch...sexual orientation should have nothing to do with it.Mickey and Ians relationship is written and performed in such a way that a lot of people are excited by it and can empathize with the different things that they go through. When Mickey and Ian saw each other again for the first time I was jumping out of my skin in full fangirl gush mode. If Mickey and Ian can make a romantic cynic like me feel that way then you know there is something special about their relationship.,shameless,db2l9xr,3,t5_2sctv

11057141,0,t3_5xql51,Yes characters are complex but not as complex as real life people. In real life sexuality is complex and can be fluid but for the sake of this story I think they want to show Mickey as someone who wants to appear tough masculine and feared and is not the person you would expect to be gay. ,shameless,delb48m,2,t5_2sctv
11087645,0,t1_deorcco,I dont know I feel like theres still time for Mickey to grow up.

11125159,0,t1_derpb3l,Mickey never cheated on Ian when they were legitimately together. He did pick up a guy in the park after Ian went off with his mother and Mickey had figured Ian abandoned him after several days of no contact. Ian did cheat on Mickey while they were together but it consisted of anonymous hook ups and back room stuff at The Fairytale. The behavior was there as an example of how hypersexuality can be a part of manic episodes. It was more about Ians mental health than a symptom of a bad relationship. Its not like it continued after he got on meds. They also werent always beating the shit out of each other. They got physical each other  times in  seasons. Only once prompted by Ian  not Mickey was it while they were in an actual relationship. The first time was when Ian was trying to get Kashs gun back from Mickey and they happened to hook up during it and the nd was when Mickey was deliberately trying to NOT be in a relationship with Ian because he knew his dad would kill him for it. Ian was baiting him and Mickey lashed out at someone he did not want around. I would not make that a point agains their actual relationship. That was a reaction to an external issue. I dont romanticize their relationship. It definitely was not perfect although extremely compelling. They did not have good communication skills to put it lightly. But overall I think your comments are exaggerated and do not consider the actual circumstances at play.,shameless,det0zy3,16,t5_2sctv

11180974,0,t1_dezc9u7,I dont think that makes up for it. Kind of just flipping it and looking at the bright side but I dont think they will ever make a season as good the first few. Of course the characters have grown up etc which is why I said if they wanna go further than  seasons theyre gonna wanna pull some older characters for cameos and even some arcs cause they have so many great ones to choose from.,shameless,dezcn2o,2,t5_2sctv

11241596,0,t1_df62zle,Yeah but thats sort of what a backend theme of Shameless is. Poor people can only scam money out of the rich or something like that. Lip said it better when he was selling tickets for a concert which was a scam. All I can say is that Id love for the writers to make her likable again this doesnt necessarily mean watching the kids but make her a generally more intellectual and understanding person. Although I feel like she may when her apartment investments fail. ,shameless,df67vhe,2,t5_2sctv
