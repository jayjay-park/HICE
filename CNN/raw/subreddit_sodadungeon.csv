5442215,0,t3_3pism0,In general it seems like a good idea but in reality the thread would get full of blinking neon puppies and ladyboy patrons. If you get a brainfart post it that gives the community a chance to toss it around and devs to monitor. The reddit system provides a natural mechanic to allow hot ideas to surface and flashes of brainleakage to sink into obscurity. Do we really need to consolidate all brainfarts No we do not. The devs will already have done this on their end. Besides we all need something to do while grinding on auto and trolling these boards doesnt provide enough content yet lolz. Post away. When the devs arent kneedeep in bug fixes and tweaks there will come a time when they will want feedback on possible new ideas both feedback on their ideas and curiosity for fresh idea from the community. Thats the time to dump on their thread. Afro amp the gang are quite active at monitoring anyways. Its not likely any random idea will go unnoticed.,sodadungeon,cw7anni,1,t5_35aph

9554235,0,t1_d9qmvu9,You want the healer first so he gets a chance to use his heals before the thieves kill everyone. This is especially important if you came off a boss battle because the very next rounds you have only single or double enemies. Thieves will mop up the singles and doubles and the healer will be twiddling his thumbs. Its lost opportunity.Once you get him the reason zerker should be first is he casts his buff on one person. You want him to have that chance too. If the healer is first and doesnt have anyone to heal he will attack and can clear the singlemonster waves.Knight is a high priority need! He blocks ambushes which is way less damage to deal with over a run. He allows guaranteed correct doors when they pop up so your casters can refill mana.My preferred order as I acquired more classes was  H T T T T  H T T T K  RZ H T T K  DM DM DM DM K  DM DM DM T K  after  DMs are getting all the kills  DM DM Wiz T K after  DMs are getting all the killsOf course with Shifters I now do  Sh DMThief  Sh DMGlad  Sh WizMerch  Merch  KMerchants have Wealthy for  gold find and with two accessory slots they have the highest gold find. Shifters only have one accessory so a Merch stone will allow them to get more gold find. However a shifter will randomly use either DMs Necroblast or Merchs  on single targets. You do NOT want a merch stone in either of the first two shifters since you need guaranteed Necroblasts on bosses.Gladiator stone has Brash which gives high initial attack bonus but . attack per kill down to a  attack minimum. It also has Banding which gives him . attack per teammate kill. The first shifter gets most of the kills so put the Glad stone on the nd shifter. He will net gain  attack after every full floor or . attack on floors that end with ArtifactPikes Ghost or any Dungeon Boss the first shifter cannot oneshot. With my level  Potable Potion giving  to magic damage the second shifter is being constantly buffed up and crushes anything that gets by the first shifter.The Knight stone does not work on shifters for blocking ambushes. May be a bug. If this changes I would swap Knight for a Shifter KnightMerch since knights only get one accessory.,sodadungeon,d9qr8w1,3,t5_35aph

9790245,0,t3_5ffpzo,Thanks again to everyone that voted for us in Greenlight! I couldnt post about it in a timely manner because  I was home for Thanksgiving and  I was in the middle of moving to a new house. Unfortunately during the move I managed to bunk my main external hard drive. The Soda Dungeon source files were on that drive but theyre mostly safe as I keep regular backups of the most important stuff. However I did lose some of the more recent sound effects and art assets so I need to do a full run through of the game and work with pox to piece back in any missing content. On the other hand I also lost a lot of personal data that wasnt backed up pictures docs etc. Will have to ship to a company for recovery and then try to learn my lesson by implementing redundancy for EVERYTHING.

While Slys example is wellreasoned and makes total sense his scenario predicts a result where the FIRST Shifter starts doing less and less damage. However in my case and it appears Tritous the first shifter does not see a dramatic decrease in damage ONLY the second shifter. So Slys model as it stands does not describe what we are seeing.Something else may be going on here. Is it possible that Brash is capped at  ONLY for the first shifter but some bug in the code of the game makes it so shifters after the first one can have Brash take attack below the original ?,sodadungeon,df4h2pg,1,t5_35aph
