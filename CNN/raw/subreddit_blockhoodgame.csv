7748947,0,t3_4la6ur,So I made this...   It turned out a lot lower only  floors than I wanted because the sandbox size was so big and to be honest I kinda lost focus after some time since the whole thing is quite complex and confusing and you always have to avoid bumping into another piece and I started getting a headache... I wanted to avoid any regular forms though... I still think it turned out quite cool and really green and I was a bit surprised at how easy it became to make all the roofs accesibble... I almost expected that to be the most complicated part but it turned out that building pillars was more difficult haha!,blockhoodgame,d3mzxwj,1,t5_3d4gy
