10682217,0,t3_5spjtw,gt Michel Houellebecq is the king of the current European zeitgeist.I read Plateforme a few days ago and I loved it very much so I read extension du domaine de la lutte one of his early books which I did not enjoy so much the characters and story are not very credible. How accurate would you say Houellebecqs description of sexpatry is? Also would you know any Chinese author that would write in a similar style as Houellebecq?
