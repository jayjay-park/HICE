Also for nice outdoor lighting find the main light source ie the sun in the map and make the light actually point from that direction and take some of the blue out of the light so its nice and straw colored be careful less is more. But Im saying perfectly white light outdoors looks kinda funky especially on a deserty map. And turn the intensity down jussst a bit.     Dont take it as you suck Im getting real picky here.

6544433,0,t1_czw7hu7,Not usually. Animation is about taking reference material and enhancing it. Real world timing looks boring and lifeless in animation so its good to speed up the timing by about  right off the top. Then you can takes that further but adding emphasis on certain poses by holding on them longer and making the transitions between poses snappier. I have played with motion capture! Its a lot of fun to experiment with and Id love to get my hands on a reliable setup that I can use at home Perception Neuron seems to fit that bill its just super expensive right now. Ive heard some industry vets Colin Graham and Brent George both of whom worked on Ubisofts Watch Dogs talk about their methodologies when working with mocap. The short and skinny of it is that mocap is great when used effectively. Even perfectly captured raw motion data looks lifeless and boring on a d character. So the same animation principles apply to mocap  take your data and enhance it. Make the poses stronger make the timing more interesting add layers of detail and character on top of the base animation. ,SFM,czw8x56,2,t5_2tlh5

Did you try instancing the particle effect some need to be? Was the particle preview at least working in the particle editor? Also some effects are actually made of multiple particles not just one. Also theres a bug with particles where you have to move your time line out of the clip youre working in and then back in for it to actually show up.
