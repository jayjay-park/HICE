Its exhausting and setting up a panel and booth is stressful and always full of the unexpected. But STLV is the Trek Mecca. There are just so many friends stars costumes events Star Trek fans and most importantly Star Trek Online fans! Its just wonderful to be around so many fellow people who love Star Trek as much as us. There are so many Star Trek geeks and nerds  it truly feels like home.gtgtgtgtSeveral of us from the STO team went this year including our executive producer Stephen Ricossa lead artist Samuel Wall producer Maria Rousseau ship artist Thomas Marrone content designer Kate Bankson environment artist Nick Duguid content designer Jesse Heinig and myself. We had a big team. Like most years we had an STO panel and this year we had a booth where people could play Star Trek Online.gtgtgtgtFirst day on the floor. Everything went smoothly and we had a great first day. We met several STO fans and regular convention goers. STLV is just a great place to reconnect with old friends from around the world. We also made new friends and introduced them to the game. Its so cool to see new players see the game for the first time.gtgtAll weekend we were giving away a special EMH Mark  goldquality Bridge Officer. If you missed it you will have to wait for the next convention to grab yours. We also were joined by Manu Intiraymi Icheb from Voyager and Cirroc Lofton Jake Sisko. That night was something special. The STO team went to dinner with some very amazing people. We were joined by Chase Masterson DS Leeta Aron Eisenberg DS Nog and Denise Crosby TNG Tasha YarSela. Also at the table was Kipleigh Brown.gtgtgtgtSome of you may know Kipleigh from her guest appearance as crewman Jane Taylor from Enterprise The Forgotten. And finally Kipleighs husband comedian Emo Philips and friend James Kerwin rounded up the guest list. I cant begin to tell you how surreal that dinner was.gtgtThese are people we work with but we are all fans. Its impossible to not be starstruck. The fact that they are all simply such warm and wonderful people makes it particularly special. They are everything you imagine them to be. Nick Duguid even shared a cheesecake with Chase Masterson.
