574323,0,t3_20n4gk,gt But one thing was clear the opposition which before was primarily electoral and procedural had changed into something not seen before in Ukraine or its political neighborhood.All governments in Ukraine are weak. Ukraine has been in last  years in state where loser of elections never acknowledges that they lost and winners are always corrupt no difference between west and east Ukraine there.  Opposition will be always working against government and undermining it.  The democracy and law work so weakly that it can be challenged by fringe groups outside the parliamentary system. gtEven those not intimately involved in the daily architecture of the protest agreed that the intensity of events around the Euromaidan was forging the beginnings of a new civic and political nation.Only after fringe neofacist groups  football hooligans from Kiev started to stir shit up did government start losing power. Few leaders in these groups received positions in the government and in the new security apparatus as a reward. That is fucked up. These people dont have popular support.

862642,0,t3_23z0d6,Ahh this sounds a lot like the question posed that correlates well with the grand chessboard publication Ive been looking into a lot lately. Well taking that perspective into context whoever controls the Eurasian supercontinent has the most influence in it is the global superpower. As far as the question goes relating to the supranational govt that is in the midst of being created A totally unified EU could potentially be a threat to vital US interests as the European continent is the gateway to all types of access on the supercontinent whether that is through security alliances like NATO or economic groupings like TransAtlantic Trade and Investment partnerships. Also having historical roots in Europe as well as somewhat of a common culture adds further to our relationship that could make it difficult to become tenuous. I think the question of a single nationstate like Germany as you have proposed will not be successful in aspiring to take on total Europe leadership and just kicking out the United States no one in Europe wants to see the Germans have a resurgence in military buildup because of historical fears and a counterbalance of France that also works alongside the Germans in implementing input to policy decisions despite being considered a retired superpower and more of a middle power nowadays look at who led the discussions in indoctrinating a SE expansion of vital EUNATO states of Greece and Turkey. They are both considered to be key geopolitical players on the European landscape but as their peripheries tend to overlap around central Europe and Western Europe you will probably see continued talks of coordination between the two.Also the demographics are a very big constraint that will limit Europeans as well as an energy sector that doesnt seem to have a diversified energy market that can provide themselves with greater autonomy in overall energy production if US LNG becomes an major exporter to balance RF role it will further this idea of economic constraints. However given the specific Ukrainian crisis on the hands of EURF leaders if the US is not able to uphold their security measures in ensuring to the European community that the NATO article v clause is protected by such military readiness then you could possibly see the excuse for further militaristic proliferation originating in Europe. Still the question for this would be how do you have military buildup fairly constructed in an institution composed of many different nationstates? ,geopolitics,ch2c6bc,2,t5_2qhnn

1145415,0,t1_chydtj0,Well first of all bear in mind that this is an opinion piece so its obviously going to make it look as though the whole region is lining up against China. That said I generally agree with the idea that powers in the regions will look to maintain future freedom of action and stay independent of China. My take is that China understands balance of power theory. Small states balance against larger states pretty much no matter what the actions of the larger state. China really wasnt that strong of a state until recently and alliances and cooperatives to balance against them are really just now starting to form. Theyre trying to get what they can before these institutions and alliances can fully from and present a viable economic and military threat to China. That is what explains their aggression in my mind they see their window where the other Asian powers can be turned against each other is slipping and theyd rather get what they can now and close the window faster than hope that they can keep the window open and slowly assert their claims. I still think they moved too early though. IMHO they shouldve waited until they got their new carriers operational and then start pushing the pace.

I plan on applying next year.With regards to job opportunities. Yes there is loads going but it can be very competitive. You need to build up your experience not just your education. For research you wont necessarily need a PhD as someone has said. You can certainly apply to some well respected think tanks and NGOs with just a undergrad degree or a masters. But if you want good career progression in the research field the higher your education the better the jobs available.Try and apply to an internship position as a research assistant at some foreign policy think tanks. There are plenty going. That should give you a better idea of the direction you want to take.On another note consider joining the Army Reserve obviously this may be something you are totally uninterested in.

Shortly after World war  China dive back into civil war between the Communist and the Nationalist Republic of China. Spoiler alert the Communist won. The Nationalist government flee to Taiwan. This is why the government in Taiwan is officially called the Republic of China. Also why Taipei is the wartime capital and NanJing is the true capital.Due to US invention by stationing aircraft carrierth fleet into between the two countries the fighting stopped for the most part.

1792927,0,t3_2f1kjs,Heres a post on reurope I wrote justifying my decision to post there I think that they were already too sick to death of proRussian propaganda to like my post though. Feel free to educate and correct on any errors or misconceptionsOf course but it is difficult to find sources on the ground that are completely unbiased and I am mindful of being used as a useful western idiot by the Russians. You have to be careful to sift the truth out from the lies. The rebels are the ones who are providing on the ground updates so if I want some on the ground updates I simply have to listen to them and be mindful of obviously dumb statements such as denying the prescence of russian troops.Nonetheless I think though I am not from the country there are  points that are not covered in this sub The Ukraininan Army is at least somewhat incompotent and have stirred up resentment by shelling their own people and playing into Putins hands. This post claims that the Ukrainians are over extending themselves in an attempt to quickly snuff out the rebellion before more help arrives? Too little too late it seems. The Ukrainian government provided fodder for the rebellion by attempting to ban the teaching of Russian in schools. The number of Russian troops is fairly small around  as I recall but feel free to correct me most of the attacks must therefore be led by local forces with the russians providing support and acting as a mobile counteroffensive force as necessary.  This post suggests that Russia is pursuing a strategy similar to that used by the U.S. when they invaded Afghanistan. Send in a relatively small force and provide support to the locals and let them do the  larger part of the dirty work. This is reflected in the Rebels denials  they probably are genuinely doing  of the fighting. Even if Ukraine achieved a military victory they would never defeat the subsequent insurgency with their hamfistedness. The rebels would have two of the major conditions for success in having sanctuary and patronage. It would be like the Mujhadeen vs the USSR except the insurgents would be even better armed and have fire support from across the border.All of these points portend a somewhat bleak future for Ukraine.Whilst I do not support Putin I think that some people here are getting far too caught up in a proeurope lovefest and not being cold blooded enough.

2035723,0,t3_2i3fzy,What does this bar graph mean to you OP?Really interesting bring up of transit spots in key areas for global trade facilitation and shows how and why specific spots are so sensitive to action when maritime trade is still the predominant way of funneling goods across the world. The two that are the biggest to me are the Malacca Straits and of course the Strait of Hormuz that have significant geopolitical impact. While the Dardanelles and the Bosphorous have gained some attention as Russia annexed Crimea and retained their footprint in the Black Sea only specific clauses like Turkey being under time of war can the straits close down and if Turkey were ever to be in such a war Article V would be cited very quickly in NATO. So the only real conclusion to me is that Russia would be at war with NATO for the straits to be closed down which makes the situation pretty unlikely but tensions will continue over Syria. The Strait of Hormuz is always going to be particularly important as long as the world is consuming petrol products and emerging nations cannot get enough of its availability to ensure GDP rates stay up as heavy industry uses it as an imperative. The US navy will continue the Bretton Woods system and police this crucial spot for the global economy as long as it takes for another modernized navy to come in and take its place which could take DECADES if another country becomes hegemon. This is a symbolism to me that Pax Americana is still somewhat out there and if the Gulf states were to go at war with one another Sauds and Iranians namely this would really I mean really impact every country hard. The Malacca Straits are just important because the center of globalization has shifted eastwards towards Asian markets because labor pools there are younger cheaper and it is relatively stable for business investmentopportunity. The problem here lies in the piracy industry in intercepting cargo ships for plunder and commodities before they reach their final destination. As of now international law and national law only permits military fleets to protect open sea lanes but I think a change in doctrine to permit mercenaries or nationally affiliated guards on cargo ships trading company of origin would make this problem even smaller than it is now.

Even without the Euro the economies would still be interconnected and having each country independently try to address the issue could have caused chaos.   Likewise while I agree the changes Clinton and the s republicans made to the banking system where less than ideal its was the complete and total failure of the available regulation both self and governmental that caused the meltdown.

Chinese people are a pretty broad group and like most people their political views respond to changing conditions. I didnt say that the rest of China was economically unimportant. I said it was poor. The central government has most certainly not spread economic development around the country. The stats you cite show a massive disparity between GDPPC amongst provices. GDPPC isnt a measure of income inequality. Its a level of net wealth produced annually divided by population. of China lives on less than five dollars a day.

2223540,0,t1_clm5xmw,gt You remember it well. Was it  that I said that? Or ? or ? Im sure I said it in  but that would have been after ISIS grew and invaded Iraq from Syria...gt Well Id start by asking who said it and in what context.This was a fantastic dodge. However you did nothing to actually address the point. The claim was made in the article posted the one that I doubt you bothered to read in full.Ill ask you again how would U.S. intervention in Syria which had the express purpose of toppling Assad have prevented the expansion of ISIS in the region? How would a power vacuum in Syria following the collapse of the Assad regime have hindered ISIS instead of helping them?gt  I also do like to point out that many of those retreated to bagdad that the army there has regroupedRegrouped? Thats an interesting word for AWOL. If any other military force on Earth were to do what the Iraqi military forces did they would be mocked without end and would lose all legitimacy in the eyes of the global community.Ill humor you though. They regrouped at Baghdad and have failed at pushing back the ISIS forces even with the assistance of U.S. air support and regional militias. The Iraqi military is ineffectual and another U.S. occupation will not lead to a better Iraqi military. The country cannot stand on its own two feet without an effective military force so how will U.S. occupation lead to the creation of one when it failed to do so in the decade following our last invasion?gt the Prime Minister stepped down without bloodshed and was replaced by a new prime minister interested in a more representitive governmentIf you dont consider the massive loss of life following the ISIS advance bloodshed then sure it was a smooth transition. What you fail to realize is that it was a hastily implemented transition under the influence of Iran in the face of an expanding insurgency. This is not indicative of a successful government. Its indicative of a panicked reaction. Youre going to have to do better than linking a news update from CNN.gt It is. You do a great job of illustrating and presenting the meme. You are clearly an ardent believer in the meme. It has been a meme since about  here in the US. Im not sure where you are but my guess is its a decade old meme there too.Youve done little to nothing to refute the claim that the Iraq invasion was a failure in the long term. All youve done is spout rhetoric and advocated for another decade of occupation. I have yet to see your reasons for why another decade of occupation will be any different than the last decade of occupation in terms of producing an effective military force and a government that can fluidly adapt without the threat of annihilation hanging over its head.

What kind of discussion would this article generate based of the quality of the article?

I looked at your history thanks for posting the article in the comment by the way! and see I deleted your last two articles. One I left a comment this one I did not. I apologize for the inconsistency on my part and would also like to clarify some things for the future.I leave comments as to why I make my decisions because I know from having my own articles deleted that its frustrating to realize what has happened and not know why. Those explanations are by no means a right. The second thing being though I may be the most visible mod because of my community interactions Im by no means the only one.

2355521,0,t1_cm28qtk,Hey dude I will have to get back to you on the full points later but I just wanted to put this here for nowPoroshenko did not have support in the south. Im not sure what the map you shared is. Ill have to look at it later. What I do know is where voter turnout was for the election. Look at this map from the wikipedia articleAll the votes for Poroshenko are coming from the western regions the same regions that mostly voted for Yushenko and did NOT vote for Yanukovych. Those disenfranchised people who lost the president they voted for had no one else to vote for and did not vote. This doesnt mean they support the government. Give them a chance to elect another leader and separate form Western Ukraine in a state of relative stability and theyd probably accept it. Ukraine could have been Czechoslovakia but instead will be ripped apart by force. It will be good for Southern Ukraine and bad for Western Ukraine. In any case no one sponsoring Western Ukraine has Ukraines best interests at heart. Everyone is out for themselves. So the question is what do those people want. Realistically people make rational decisions based on the decision matrix available to them. People in positions of power can change public opinion by changing the situation and the way its presented. The point of propaganda is to change public opinion and control democracy. Im sure they can find a way to make Southern Ukrainians accept the split. They just have to win the PR war.Also democracy isnt what people want. Youre mistaking the symptom for the cause. What people want is selfish. They want more power. So people without power often want democracy because they think it will give them more thingspowerwealthfreedom. People in power dont want democracy because their intent is the same. They want more powerwealthfreedom etc. If you can provide people with those things they have no need for democracy as they already will have everything that this political system is promising. Its the same logic that explains why poor people are often socialists and rich people take capitalistic attitudes.

Bulk freight can turn a profit if there is enough traffic to pay for the investment and maintenance.  It is highly questionable that the silk road can be profitable for bulk industrial and agricultural products when the sea lanes can move the same products for th the cost.  But a passenger line is virtually impossible.  Are you aware that no passenger system on earth is turning a profit?  Not even tiny Japan with everyone using it every day is turning a profit.  The fast rail lines of France and Germany are loosing money.  Passenger lines always loose money.  You only build them when the congestion is so great that it is worth it to you to loose money year in and year out.

The real risk to Iraqi national unity is still the restive Sunni element. While Baathists like Izzat Ibrahim alDouri alTakrit and the JRTN may have cooperated with ISIL during the Mosul offensive due to their mutual enmity of Maliki they posses disparate ideologies and their almost immediate split  was highly predictable and not indicative of Sunni or Baathist reconciliation with Abadi. The mobilization of Shia militias and their abuses of Sunnis by forces such as the Badr Brigades is placing immense strain on national unity and trust.

Further acquaintance of such matters can only promote ones geopolitical understanding. In my mind geopolitics is on the top tier of things as basically it allows for the explanation of how states interact. As we enter the state we have to explain how groups of people within it interact basically it is always an oligarchy in my mind but as i said at the start it has many flavors. And what sort of means to these groups of people use to promote their interests. And then we have to look for what people want. What are their interests? We have to take into account also how people tend to go about organizing themselves in families. We just dont make kids and send them off.

2875772,0,t1_cnuyigy,gtWhy do you think this transition would have ever taken place? Again his entire strategy was to remove the institutions that would even make such a transition possible.Long lasting democratic progress doesnt come from the top down but the other way around. He may dissolve the institutions but the growth of political culture of the population and the growing acceptance of democratic values and understanding of the same by the bottom layers of society is what facilitates that long lasting democratic change. That is how democracy in the West emerged. By the pressure from the bottom layers of society dissatisfied with their living conditions on the upper layers of society. The upper layers of society never decide without reason to give up their power. Either they see themselves that too much power leads to unsustainable economies and public unrest and they decrease their powers or they are forced to decreased them by the already happening public unrest.When you see reports of dissatisfaction or unrest in undemocratic countries you only see those who are rebelling you dont see the vast amount of those who are not. Then the Western countries start supporting those who are rebelling against autocratic regimes the regimes are toppled and anarchy emerges. Either because the rebels didnt want true democracy but rather to replace the current dictator with their dictator or because the vast amount of the rest of the society simply doesnt possess that level of political culture required for democracy to function properly. If that level of political culture was present the population would have been able to topple the dictator themselves.gtThe exact same state of affairs that created the present anarchy would exist whenever the dictatorship ended.Only if the dictatorship ended abruptly and not by the popular uprising.gtThe alternative then would be to just let the dictatorship exist indefinitely.Are Western democracies still brutal dictatorships as they were once i.e. brutal monarchies or are they democracies? They didnt need foreign influence. The popular dissatisfaction with the current system reached the tipping point and the systems changed and that change was in the vast amount of cases long lasting.However in the Middle East the West is trying to rush that process and facilitate the change from top down rather than the other way around.gtAt that point it is a choice between a brutal dictatorship that oppresses its people and perpetuates an atmosphere of terror and personal uncertainty and a state of anarchy where things are generally unpredictable violence is decentralized but where individual freedoms are greater.Yes.gtI am not sure you can argue that one is clearly preferable to the other and I dont think there is clear evidence that either naturally transitions to democracy. I believe the latter is preferable because it is stable and some rules exist which can be gradually changed through the gradually growing political culture as was again the case in the West. Anarchy on the other hand is a complete setback some few thousands of years in the past where there is no rules whatsoever. And for anarchy to be constrained youd again need a strongman which you just got rid of and replaced him with anarchy.gtI think you would have to clarify what you mean by the phrase forceful integration.Well something along the lines of Bismarck. You dont like the new state and you dissent  youre beaten with a stick without a trial. An oversimplification but I think you get the point. Whomever is resisting integration into new nation state is forced to do soIndia is an interesting example. However you have to again take into account geography. Middle East is a barren desert scarce with resources  India not so much.India is decentralized. As I said decentralization is a bad form of government when you have to protect the outer borders because decision making on state level is slower which is why it would hardly work in Middle East where natural geographical borders are scarce and youre surrounded by enemies.On the other hand India is surrounded by Ocean Pakistan and the highest mountain range in the World.

3027712,0,t3_2uprru,Im thoroughly disappointed by this article. At first glimpse it appears to be an in depth look at the Obama administrations strategy with Iran and the middle east using events and policies to bring to light an unannounced strategy. But the dispassionate analysis of policies and strategies is hard to come by and a credentialed author can get ten times the readership pushing partisan politics. The author deviates from analysis and instead plays the card of Obama being inexperienced and naive and the Iranians being naturally blood thirsty. After the news of Netanyahus visit to Congress was met with a poor media reception in the US Doran wrote a piece to justify Netanyahus going behind the back of the executive branch to reach out to congress. In his narrative Obama went behind Congresss  back to Open negotiations with Iran did it secretly and spun his utter failure as a success to the public. On the other hand of this narrative Israel is left with an Iran that is months away from acquiring a nuke and is digging around in its Syrian backyard. The article was published in Mosaic a new paper established to publish agtmonthly essay on an issue or theme of pressing significance for Jews gtJudaism or the Jewish state.So in short whats practically click bait for any person interested in geopolitics ends up being nothing but partisan politics sung to the choir.The only portion that I found to be of true value was a mention of the final report by the Iraq study group commissioned during Bushs presidency. I am yet to read it but the strategy outlined in the article points togtfour major steps withdraw American troops from Iraq surge American troops gtin Afghanistan reinvigorate the ArabIsraeli peace process and last but far gtfrom least launch a diplomatic engagement of the Islamic Republic of Iran and gtits junior partner the Assad regime in Syria,geopolitics,cobtjec,-1,t5_2qhnn

Qatar is infinitely more proSaudi than proIranian.While Saudi Arabia and Qatar have a twodecadeslong history of mutual dislike their involvement in Syria presents a confusing mix of close cooperation and open rivalry. It is difficult to know what to make of any of these reports. Im going to side with the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace over a random anon. Qatars relationship with IranSaudi Arabia is not black and white so maybe my wording is the problem here. I should say Qatar leans more to Iran then it does Saudi Arabia. A counterpoint would be that would be both Qatar and Saudi Arabia are a part of the Gulf Cooperation Council. Yet the only member that tried and failed due to intense internal resistance to have Iran included in the GCC was Qatar. You lobby for friends not enemies.gtThey have some cooperation on a small number of issuesI dont see how a security cooperation a joint oil field extort of Qatars and the worlds largest gas field and many economic ties counts as small.gtIt is a major supplier of support to the Islamic Front JAN FSAAlthough private businessmen provided the lions share of the funding youre right to say Qatars funded those groups. Pulling from the Carnegie article again others have noted the presence of the Qatari Foreign Minister Khaled alAttiyah at meetings with soontobe Islamic Front commanders in the fall of  and they point to previous reports of Qatari backing for some of the fronts member factions like the Tawhid Brigade.That said just because youre prothis or antithat does not mean youre completely subservient to said country.

Now many people challenge this hence the movement against Putin seen in .The problem is that if Ukraine has a real chance of reform through alignment with the EU which is potentially much more dangerous than NATO then perhaps it can overcome the problems that it has shared with Russia. The thing is that there is no real difference between Ukrainians and Russians it is just that the former have a smaller country so potentially easier to change. If Ukraine can reform so could Russia and that would be a direct challenge to Putin and his powerbase.Russia will continue to spread the myth of a Nato threat but the reality is that Ukraine must be kept down and firmly in the Russian sphere but outside their direct responsibility. For Russia it becomes advantageous to leave it as another frozen conflict.The problem for the adjacent EU countries is that such zones seem to be a haven for criminality that can and does spread across the borders.,geopolitics,cpdj4ba,1,t5_2qhnn

If you are moving hazardous materials via rail you can take extra precautions like using slower speeds and spacing trains more. Human error is always going to be a factor too. Trucks crash more but they spread the waste out more. With trains these days they are using GPS and black boxes so if conductors break rules they get fired. If you add multiple conductors rule compliance and alertness is more likely. I mean freighters sometimes crash too. Most derailments are minor and they are less likely now that there are better wheels and stronger synthetic railroad ties. If you run a train light you can improve your braking a lot too. These days they are adding sensors and cameras to crossings so conductors get forewarning of obstacles like disabled buses. ,geopolitics,cpkncxs,3,t5_2qhnn

3566327,0,t1_cpysawu,Not sure how. Heres a copy of the articleThe Iraqi militarys operation to root out Islamic State militants from Tikrit this week has empowered a new generation of militias which emerged from relative obscurity to take a lead role in the battle.Now U.S. and Iraqi officials are hoping these irregular Shiite troops which they say arent beholden to Iran and are more careful to avoid stoking sectarian tensions with the Sunni community will help defeat the Sunni militants across Iraq.One of the challenges to this plan can be found in the hills surrounding Tikrit where thousands of Iranbacked militia members who helped in the initial stages of the monthlong fight for the city are amassed. These troops are resentful after being sidelined as a condition for U.S. airstrikes that helped liberate the citythe largest to have been reclaimed from the extremists forces so farand their responses are unpredictable.U.S. officials also warned that the Tikrit fight is unlikely to be finished. Iraqi forces were still clearing the city on Wednesday and attacks from remaining Islamic State fighters could hamper the citys submission.Still U.S. officials were heartened by the apparent ease with which Iraqi forces swept into the city a relatively short time after American and allied aircraft joined the Tikrit fight last week.Everyone is trying to portray this fight as a sectarian thing The Shiite side trying to take revenge on the Sunni side said Thaer alAssadi leader of a Shiite militia Soldiers of the Imam Brigades whose members celebrated by shooting off gunshots and dancing around battered tanks and armored cars. Its not.Policy makers in Washington have long been conflicted over the Shiite militias warning that using them to liberate Sunnipopulated areas threatened to worsen sectarian tensions. But they acknowledged that with the Iraqi security forces weakened by Islamic State invasion the militias were needed to defend the U.S.allied government in Baghdad.On Wednesday military officials reiterated the U.S. would continue to work with Shiite militias as they did in Tikrit as long as they were under Iraqi not Iranian control.U.S. officials say they deliberately used the Tikrit operation to drive a wedge between Iran and Iraq while opening space for groups such as Mr. Assadis who passionately want to defeat Islamic State but are less beholden to Iranian interests.After fighting stalled in Tikrits center U.S. officials agreed to launch airstrikes against Islamic State targets in the city only if the Iranianbacked militias who began the assault on March  were sidelined. This officials said provided what the military calls unity of command a key principle of military campaigns.U.S. officials assessed that the Iranianbacked assault on Tikrit was failing because of the inaccuracy of Iranian artillery and the failure of the Tehranbacked militias to respond to orders or coordinate their movements with the Iraqi security forces nominally leading the fight.The Iranianbacked militias disagreed saying they were being cautious to avoid civilian casualties that would have inflamed international opinion.Though designed to help Iraqi forces take Tikrit the U.S. request also distilled the militia groups Those most vehemently opposed to the U.S. airstrikes withdrew from the front lines in protest.They included such fiercely antiAmerican groups such as Asaib Ahl al Haq Hezbullah Brigades and Badr Corps. Those three groups comprise the strongest antiinsurgent forces in Iraq. But their proximity to Tehran means they effectively act as Iranian proxies in Iraq officials say.Hezbullah and Asaib Ahl al Haq routinely attacked U.S. troops during their nearly decadelong occupation of Iraq. Hezbullah Brigades is still listed as a terrorist group by the U.S. and its leadership has recently threatened to launch missiles at American fighters.Those Shiite militia groups who remained in Tikrit and agreed to follow Iraqi government orders were easily identified as potential partners. That means every aspect from top to bottom the Iraqis had to be in charge a U.S. defense official said of the final phase of the battle.The most proIranian militias were still outside Tikrit when Prime Minister Haider alAbadi announced the citys liberation on Tuesday.The Shiite militia groups most palatable to U.S. officials were formed after influential Shiite Ayatollah Ali alSistani issued a fatwa in June  asking for volunteers to help defend Baghdad. These forces have largely put themselves under the control of the central government in Baghdad.Mr. Assadis Soldiers of the Imam Brigades is one such group. Though Mr. Assadi and his comrades earned their Shiite fighter bona fides by fighting for their sect for decades the group only crystallized in its current form last summer.Born in the Shiite holy city of Kerbala Mr. Assadi joined his sects cause during the s when he picked up arms to fight the Sunnidominated regime of Saddam Hussein during the IranIraq War.When the U.S. failed to intervene to help overthrow the dictator during the Shiite Arab uprisings of  Mr. Assadi said he was heartbroken.Of course it made us feel betrayed he said. We realized that the Americans were halting the ambitions of the Iraqi people. It was a crime.Though Mr. Assadi sat out the Shiite resistance to the U.S. occupation he rejoined his old comrades when Ayatollah Sistani called for volunteers to fight Islamic State last summer.Unlike the most entrenched Iranbacked groups Mr. Assadis new unit made up of his old comrades was made legal upon inception by an act of the prime minister and it still answers only to the Iraqi government Mr. Assadi said.We are always with what the government says said Nadhim Al Assadi one of the leaders in the Soldiers of the Imam Brigades. Yes we have our ideology and visions but at the end of the day we go with the interests of the majority.With around  fighters the Soldiers of the Imam number among dozens perhaps hundreds of small Shiite militias that claim to answer directly to the Iraqi government.Mr. Assadi said his men even earn salaries of about  Iraqi dinars  each month from Baghdad. Experts say such groups certainly take at least some material support from donors religious institutions and foreign countries.Soldiers of the Imam had been fighting on the outskirts of Tikrit for several weeks when news came of the impending U.S. airstrikes.Mr. Assadi said he was still smarting from the Americans betrayal during the Shiite uprising against Mr. Hussein more than two decades ago.But as the U.S. airstrikes eroded Islamic States hold on Tikrit he and his men swallowed their pride and remained on the front lines while the stronger Shiite militia groups pulled back.And on Wednesday it was Mr. Assadi not the famous commanders from the larger Iranbacked Shiite militias who was facing television cameras in Tikrit during celebrations over claims of the largestever victory against Islamic State.The toughest challenge that weve had since we came here is that this fight has gone international said the mildmannered Arabic instructor while standing in front of a tank on Wednesday. The big challenge was to control our soldiers and show the whole world that were not doing anything wrong and to control our soldiers.,geopolitics,cpysdcb,2,t5_2qhnn

We want to stay on top and that means playing a bit offensively strategically.  See the TPP.   Maybe in some sense in that there is a fair amount of evidence that at least some significant portions of ISIS are largely run by former Baathists like the late al Douri.  Taking down Saddam put them in conflict with us and Paul Bremers debaathification order gave them the time and incentive to fight us.  ISIS rose from what was in essence the remnants of the more competent resistance groups from the Iraq occupation which again were largely run and organized by the professionals that we put out of work.  However this is a manifestation of much larger and longer in the making trends than this.  There are larger dynamics at work here the budding SunniShia war going on in several places across the middle east the larger tensions between the Gulf nations and Iran the even larger dynamics between the WestNATOUS and RussiaChinaIran.

Are your complaints about this subreddit valid or merely a means to promote another subreddit? Speaking generally though moderators are encouraged to hide short comments that do not contribute much to the discussion. This happens on any thread regardless of the topic. Article submissions from nonWestern sources are allowed and encouraged but like any article they need to be of a certain quality to be accepted.

You should at least know how the sites system works.EditAnother note try creating a ruleset that definitively outlines what is and is not low quality content without resorting to highly restrictive measures such as requiring sources for claims length requirements or other such standards. You can have a ruleset that is more lax and relies on moderator judgement for content removal or you can have a ruleset that is specific and results in a majority of content being removed. Your pick. I suspect that you would complain in both instances because I get the feeling that youre not the kind of person who is satisfied with anything that limits your ability to do whatever you want.

Imagine being able to get detailed mapping at high resolution in kilometer wide swaths using off the shelf components with very low fuel and deployment costs. the whole swarm could probably be transported in a pickup bed maybe a box truck. Youd do that by merging the data from each sensor suite in a capable graphics computer using what I believe to be fairly wellknown solutions.Youd only get one big win out of something like this in a conflict and only that if you used it really cleverly  but thats usually the case anyway. ,geopolitics,ctzyenw,1,t5_2qhnn

But many of the trade deals provisions that have leaked into the public domain are highly controversial and will disproportionately favor rich countries over poor particularly the bits on intellectual property protection and digital innovation which appear to go beyond current U.S. laws and international trade treaties. One antiTPP activist I recently communicated with referred to the IP provisions as a wish list of the . Its not a done deal yet far from it but if TPP is enacted as currently proposed there will be grass roots cause in many developing countries to reach for the torch and pitchfork. ,geopolitics,cuesoii,7,t5_2qhnn

This could be in response to issues in the South China Sea.. Russian military intervention in Syria manages to stabilize the Assad regimes control of Western Syria while stalemate between ISIS the Kurds the Assad regime remains in the rest of the country.. Oil prices begin to slowly pick up again reaching between  and  by the end of . This stabilizes Russias financially position slightly although recession will remain. Most OPEC nations still remain financially precarious.. In Turkey the AKP form a minority government in the aftermath of November  election and violent protests break out in parts of the country from perceived abuses of power by the AKP minority government. The KurdishTurkish conflict escalates but doesnt reach outright civil war.. In Libya the UNsponsored peace talks between the rival governments of the country result in a fragile coalition government that works to reduce but not eliminate ISIS present in Cyrenaica.. A Third Intifada officially breaks out in Israel and Palestine with renewed conflict between Israel and Hamas contributing to the conflict.. Robert Mugabe dies resulting in a relatively smooth transition in which his wife Grace Mugabe succeeds him.. The Paris UN Climate Change Conference results in a weak legallybinding agreement that isnt unanimously accepted by member nations.. The migrant crisis in Europe maintains the same inflow rate as  resulting in the construction of border walls by most landborder member nations and temporary suspensions of the Schengen Area by multiple member nations. Refugee inflows across the Mediterranean from North Africa may decline depending on the outcome of the UNsponsored peace talks in Libya..

There are some that might slide over towards China.  Some claim select central Asian countries the stans Thailand or S. Korea might side with China eventually but I dont see that happening as soon as others like Burma or Indonesia.  I also cant see China developing alliances far from home till the PLA can sufficiently project power.  ,geopolitics,cxinp3v,2,t5_2qhnn

6009022,0,t1_cy6y1kd,The short of it is that India wanted to remain nonaligned but was buying weapons from Russia.  The US didnt take kindly to that and kind of drove India into Russias sphere. Combined with US support for Pakistan and youve got a number of stumbling blocks to the IndianUS relationship.  Now the cold war is over and the US realizes that it alienated a potential friend in India so its trying to repair some of the damage.  The Indian military still holds some suspicionsgrudges towards the US but there are probably a number of factors that have changed their posture since the cold war.First the cold war ended. This cant be understated.  The US is no longer locked in an globe spanning ideological conflict with the USSR and therefore a much less aggressive attitude. This makes it possible to frame relations in a more peaceful and less paranoid context. Second while the Indians have close relations with the Russians the Russians also have close relations with the Chinese and India isnt too fond of China.  While it remains to be seen whether Russia will have to choose between India and China India doesnt want to have to rely on Russia choosing India over China.  This feeds into the whole nonaligned aspect of Indian foreign policy which we can call point .. While India leaned towards Russia during the bipolar world order of the cold war pax Americana has afforded India more diplomatic breathing room so it can balance between the various powers in order to get more out of those relations and not get tied to the fortunes of any other state.  This will also help Indias own rise to become one more pole in a potentially multipolar world order.  A final point is that the US is a western democracy and shares quite a few values with India. The Indian population in the US holds influence and has been a large factor in improving relations. And while the two countries share a lot including being former holdings of the British empire the US also has a lot to offer India whether militarily technologically economically diplomatically etc.  The US could potentially even be a factor in improving IndiaPakistan relations but I dont know if thats really on the table right now.Its extremely unlikely that well see a USIndia alliance but we are seeing and will likely continue to see Indias relationships with the US and its alliance network grow deeper and closer.,geopolitics,cy7bb9e,5,t5_2qhnn

6074396,0,t3_3yqoqz,This is all my opinion others will give theirs. I am shortterm  years bullish on China and past that Im pretty bearish.Economically speaking  China overtaking the US. Is it really going to overtake the US? Chinese economic numbers are heavily inflated with several sectors of the economy with lowperformance from SOEs and many bubbles. Speaking of bubbles does nobody remember of the economic crisis that occurred last summer? Where China essentially shut down the stock market i.e. keeping people from withdrawing money after the market dropped like  in a day? As a person who has lived in China I can pretty much tell you that things are regularly inflated significantly just to look good. Heres a reputable source theres many more you can google  . Another issue is the fact that an economically improved China isnt something that the US is necessarily opposed to. Why should the US oppose economic development for one of the largest countries? Especially a country whose economic development betters the US and its corporations. Though this is changing  were investing more in India and other SE Asian countries as China gets more expensive and transitions to a servicebased economy. Another thing to consider is that with development comes liberalism. Maybe not in the traditional western sense but they will get more educated have less children be more productive to the world  at the very least. Segments of the population will also be exposed to western ideals and that may drive the government itself to adopt certain things.Lets address your military question. Nobody  and I mean nobody in the world is close to overtaking the US militarily. The US is the single most powerful nation in the history of mankind. Look at how many supercarriers we have. I dont care to look it up but we have  or so supercarriers about  aircraft carriers. China has one working carrier. Which was bought from Russia in the late s. Look at Chinas military. The quality of their military is not nearly to the point of the US military which is the finest in the world. Look at military funding. Technologically the US is far superior. China has to resort to stealing technology from Western corporations which invest and operate in China. They also steal military technology they cant develop it on their own. One problem of this is that China cant actually manufacture the hardware as efficiently as the US can. Off the top of my head Im thinking of the F where the US version has the US made engine whereas China had to resort to a Russian dualengine which wasnt as effective. I personally dont see China taking the US over militarily before Chinas government fractures due to internal pressures or has a major transformation  for instance transformation to a complete police state. Another problem is that the party itself has factions  you can see this with the battles between the members of the CCP and subsequent purges. And on and on and on. So be the problems of a developing country with problems of corruption.Lets now look at the allies of China in Asia. The US has basically contained China strategically in a sense. Japan SK Taiwan AUNZ Vietnam Indonesia the Philippines are all pretty much allied with the US to different degrees. Japan  the third largest economy in the world is a staunch US ally for instance They have aligned themselves with the US essentially because theyre the only one who can oppose China. Theyve also wrapped the nations of the Pacific in the TPP to create an economic union led by the US to shield those economies from China. So China is actually very constricted. So if there was an all out war the US could basically shut down their shipping lanes with its incredibly powerful navy and landlock China. That itself would shut down their economy since they are an exportdriven economy. Land invasion would be trivial though I doubt the US would even do that. I would be surprised if the NSA doesnt have control over the Chinese power grid various internal spies and sympathizers indepth information on their military structure etc. I personally would argue the US is doing what is in its national interest. We are beginning to transition out of the middle east and into Asia. Once this transition completes  probably by the time the next president is elected  well see more pressure on China. I also doubt that China is actually in a position to legitimately challenge the US for quite a long time. Meanwhile China has to deal with economic bubbles it has to transition to a servicebased economy which will be a very big challenge for China and it has to transform its military  and develop a military industrial complex which can develop advanced technology domestically. I dont really see this happening in the shortterm and I imagine China will face a larger problem in the longterm with actually enacting this. Any failure in the above areas will cause problems for Chinas national and economic security. I dont think the government itself is stable. There are various Chinese revolutions throughout history it wouldnt be too outlandish to imagine another one occurring if the government cant keep delivering on its promises and doesnt get rid of corruption.,geopolitics,cyfu8os,53,t5_2qhnn

My problem with this hypothetical is that if the Sunnis wanted a fundamentalist Islamic state wouldnt they continue to support ISIS and not attempt to form their own state with elected officials?I think a cause of many of the problems in the Middle East is that these oppressed and disenfranchised people have not had control over their futures. They need to be able to live as they choose without outside interference. If the world powers continually interfere no matter what lifestyle they choose the region will never find stability.

6175944,0,t1_cyrn2qn,Text continued in case of paywallAs a professional what is your view of the Israeli intelligence and special operations community? Specifically as an army generalturneddirector of Central Intelligence what were the distinctive features of the Mossad? Is it better for such an agency to be headed by a senior military officer such as retired Maj. Gen. Meir Dagan whose term of duty ended just prior to your assuming your position at CIA or a career Mossad official like Tamir Pardo your counterpart?There is deep welldeserved respect for Israeli national security institutions their leaders and their members  and these institutions include Mossad Shin Bet and of course the IDF. I am among those who have enormous respect for those institutions  and in my case that respect is founded on years of partnership with key leaders of these extraordinary organizations. In that regard both Meir Dagan and Tamir Pardo were exceptional leaders of Mossad and great partners for their American counterparts  and Im thus agnostic as to the proper path to the head of such an important organization.I recognize that over the last few years some differences and disagreements between the leaders of Israel and the U.S. have been in the spotlight. And I am keenly aware of voices in both countries that have argued that our two countries are pulling farther apart. In my view at a time when civilization itself is under siege from forces that wish to tear down the world we have helped to build we would be wise to take a step back and focus on the big picture. The simple reality is that Israel and the United States are longstanding friends and allies in an increasingly dangerous world  and we ought to treat each other as such.From an American perspective Israel has proven itself to be an exceptionally capable resourceful and valuable ally to the United States in a very important and treacherous region. We share many fundamental interests and we face enemies that wish to do both countries harm.Just as importantly we share core values and we therefore wrestle with many of the same questions  about how to keep our people safe from the forces of terrorism that seek our destruction while preserving our respective democratic freedoms rule of law and respect for fundamental and eternal human rights which define who we are.With the rise of cyberwarfare and the spread of digital data emanating from countless sources is HUMINT human intelligence as important a discipline as it used to be? How do you practice tradecraft against tough nuts such as Islamic State?The explosive growth of the digital realm has changed the practice of intelligence in countless ways not only with respect to cybersecurity tradecraft and surveillance issues but also with the increase in prominence of socalled big data and opensource intelligence. Some of the best analytic products for instance now derive from information collected on publicly available social media platforms rather than through clandestine means.That said just as the rise of satellite technology and fixedline telephones in an earlier era didnt eliminate the need for HUMINT I dont think the current changes in technology will either. To the contrary I would caution strongly against those who think technology can reduce the importance of the human element in intelligence or national security more broadly. If anything I think the human factor carries even more importance today in the face of challenges like the Islamic State and Russian unconventional warfare than it did in the days when the most pressing and sensitive task was to count Soviet nuclear warheads or tanks. So HUMINT will rightly still be regarded as extraordinarily important by those seeking insights into the thinking and intentions of those who wish us ill.,geopolitics,cyrn38x,3,t5_2qhnn

The Muslim Brotherhood was the only nonregime affiliated group to be able to do this theyve had a long history in Egypt particularly in the Cairo slums and on top of that they were able to draw on support from Qatar.  There were plenty of other groups campaigning that were secular leftist socialist etc. but whos supporting them?  They were repressed during the Mubarak era and they hardly had any real time to be able to organize aboveground and build up political and social infrastructure to build support and win elections.  And of course after Sisi threw out Morsi and reestablished authoritarianism everybodys been forced back undergroundexcept like before the Muslim Brotherhood can count on their international networks and funding from the Gulf while leftists can only count on themselves and maybe the trade unions.

What MiG had was not HMS which is merely moving HUD to the helmet but full helmet AR linked directly to the fire control radar similar to that being built in F. When US got their hands on the DDR MiGs even the modest assessment was that it had at least  times wider frontal targeting cone because of it than the best system US aircraft had at that point.gtHow many Su derivatives use this rear facing radar? Ill answer that for you not many because it is a stupid idea. Currently known are Su and Su. When Su was announced for sale one of the major selling points was in fact capability to fire active radar homing missiles at targets directly behind it. The fact that you think this to be stupid idea shows remarkable depth of ignorance of subject of aerial combat. One of the biggest problems that all fighter aircraft have is lack of radar coverage outside frontal cone. Thats why all relevant sides build complex data links to allow fighters to share radar data with each other and AWACS aircraft. Equally great problem is lack of fire control radar coverage which renders active homing missiles that require mid life update such as AIM extremely vulnerable to enemy counterfire.,geopolitics,d08fqde,1,t5_2qhnn
6669108,0,t1_d08wg1n,gtIf the House of Saud fallsThis is the part in question. How would it falls? If its Jihadist takeover like what happened in Syria and Iraq it should be noted that ISIS and Jihadist organizations in general is known for targeting already failed states such as Libya and Nigeria. This returns into what rLuckyio said Saudi is a functional state It is not prone to collapse by ragtag army of Jihadist youngsters. In order to take Saudi from functional to failed state there requires tremendous amount of geopolitical effort most probably coming from Iran however so far it looks contained.Not to mention all the black market money that made ISIS possible had been flowing from private donors in gulf states such as Qatar and allegedly Saudi. I bet its not the interest of the guy transferring money to ISIS to see his homeland collapsing into hellhole.The only part I can agree on is the training level of the Saudi soldiers. But if theres anything that lacks proper training that would be Jihadists especially foreign recruits which comprises like  of ISIS force IIRC. Also its not only the level of training that matters but moral too. Iraqi army were crippled by ISIS not simply because they were useless but they were highly demoralized.

6714300,0,t3_47lt0h,Last September tens of thousands of opponents of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe gathered outside the National Diet building in Tokyo often in torrential rain holding placards and shouting antiwar slogans. They were there to protest the imminent passage of legislation designed to allow Japans military to mobilize overseas for the first time in  yearsa shift they feared would undermine Japans pacifistic constitution and encourage adventurism. On September  Japans normally sedate parliament dissolved into scuffles as opposition politicians tried and failed to prevent a vote on the bills which ultimately passed.They and the protesters may have failed in their objective but they got something right Japans foreign policy is indeed changing. Since returning to power in September  Abe has pushed through a series of institutional legal diplomatic and military reforms that are reshaping Japans national security posture and that promise to enhance Japans regional role over the coming decade. Responding to rapid changes in the region particularly the dramatic increase in Chinas power Japans prime minister has distanced his country from its postwar pacifismwhich was predicated on a benign view of the international systemand unveiled a new more realist foreign policy.Japans pacifism which many Japanese see as key to their countrys postwar identity dates to . That year the country still occupied by the United States accepted a U.S.drafted constitution forbidding Japan from maintaining a military with the potential to wage war. When the U.S. occupation ended in  Tokyo essentially outsourced its defense to its new ally Washington. In the decades that followed Japanese leaders also put their faith in the liberal international institutions such as the UN that defined the postwar world.In recent years however Abe has increased the defense budget and loosened the constitutional restrictions on Japans military passing laws that allow it to cooperate with partners in limited security operations. Bidding for a larger leadership role in Asia he has deepened the countrys engagement with regional groups such as the AsiaPacific Economic Cooperation forum and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and he has strengthened the U.S.Japanese alliance. He has also built military ties with other democracies in Asia including Australia and India.Taken together Abes actions and those of some of his predecessors will enable Japan to play a larger role in defending its interests and contributing to regional stability. Although controversial both at home and abroad changes in Tokyos foreign and security policies are a positive step moving Japan toward a regional posture more commensurate with its economic strength. They enhance the U.S.Japanese alliance and serve as a liberal counterweight to Chinas increasingly assertive challenge to Asias rulesbased order.JAPAN GETS REALSince the end of the Cold War Tokyo has expanded the primary goal of its defense policy from defending the Japanese home islands to also protecting its farflung maritime possessionssmall largely defenseless islands such as Yonaguni located just off Taiwan more than  miles from Tokyo. To that end it has sought to uphold freedom of navigation and an open rulesbased order in Asia. It has stepped up its military preparedness and strengthened security cooperation with an expanding set of partners.These shifts in Japanese policy can be traced to the uncertainty that followed the collapse of the Soviet Union in . Almost overnight the original rationale for the longstanding U.S.Japanese alliance disappeared and the future of East Asias security ordernot to mention the future of the U.S. presence in the western Pacificbecame uncertain. As the United States struggled to craft a postCold War global strategy the U.S.Japanese alliance entered a period of drift tied in part to questions about Washingtons commitment to the region in the new era.In August  less than a year after the fall of the Berlin Wall Iraqs Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait. Washington assembled a huge military coalition to oust him but Tokyo refused to send troops paying  billion instead to help defray the costs. The move failed to win Japan much credit however. Critics in the United States and elsewhere widely derided it and the episode which raised new questions about Japans ability to translate its economic might into strategic clout tarnished the countrys image as a leading global power.Then in  North Korea launched a ballistic missile over the island of Honshu. This was Tokyos Sputnik moment raising Japans sense of insecurity and fears that its key ally might not be able to protect it from new threats. And Japan suddenly realized that it was facing what could become an existential threat from a rogue regime known to be pursuing nuclear weapons.A final ongoing reason for Japans strategic evolution has been the steady rise of China as a political economic and military power. Long accustomed to being the major player in Asia Tokyo has recently been forced to contemplate a future in which Beijing will dominate the region.Together these shifts have helped erode Tokyos commitment to pacifism and have undermined its leaders belief that international institutions alone can be trusted to shape the future. In response Japanese leaders have embraced a sort of classical realism predicated on the belief that nations seek power above all else and that the only way to defend Japan is to forge stronger security partnerships and pursue a more activist foreign policy.,geopolitics,d0dte97,8,t5_2qhnn

6917265,0,t3_4ahhs8,Google the article to get past the paywallA Dispatch from a Train Wreck Obamas National Security Legacy One of the more lamentable consequences of the Republican party trainwreckthatmaycome Donald Trump is that it distracts attention from the trainwreckthatalreadycame President Obamas national security legacy. For whoever wins this years presidential election cleaning up his mess will be the urgent priority in . And as this unintentionally revealing selfportrait in The Atlantic by Jeffrey Goldberg demonstrates the one thing we can be certain of is that Obama will not clean up his mess between now and Inauguration Day because as far as he is concerned he will have left everything neat and tidy  or as neat and tidy as any one could have.As Goldberg documents Obama is still stuck in  earlier than that even   maybe strangely unreflective about what he has wrought. The dragon Obama seeks to slay is the dragon of Churchillian clarity and bellicosity a beast not seen in these parts in quite some time. He seems not to notice the very real and close menaces of indecision halfmeasures and failures to act.Over the past seven years we have come to learn that the most reliable indicator of how bad things are is the flimsiness of the strawman Obama concocts to defend his policies  the flimsier the strawman the worse the actual policy.In the interview he blasts past his own record for flimsiness and claims that the alternative to his policies is believing we can at any given moment relieve all the worlds misery. We all knew Obama had a bad policy but did we know it was so bad that it needed such a toweringly absurd strawman to defend it?The key reporting breakthrough in Goldbergs piece is his discovery that such strawmen are not merely rhetorical devices conjured up to serve a particular spin of the day. They exist not in the reality of the real world of course but evidently in the reality of the minds of Obama and his key advisers. Goldberg relates how angry and confused Obama and his advisers were at the negative reaction to the infamous we dont do stupid s bumper sticker that he tried to give to his doctrine. When even former cabinet officers dismissed this as a false binary Goldberg writes the president became rips angry according to one of his senior advisers. The president did not understand how dont do stupid s could be considered a controversial slogan. Ben Rhodes recalls that the questions we were asking in the White House were Who exactly is in the stupids caucus? Who is prostupid s? To be fair Goldberg does clearly document that Obama took one of his most consequential sets of decisions  the decision to issue a red line on Syrian chemical weapons the decision to set in motion the enforcement of that red line and then the decision to suddenly shut down enforcement at the last possible minute well before there was any knowledge of the Russian diplomatic gambit  all against the advice of most of his senior national security team. This episode cannot be blamed on a weak interagency process the familiar bugaboo that has haunted this administration. Instead according to Goldberg President Obama wrote the script from start to finish his own advisers were as wrongfooted and dismayed as our international allies partners and other outside experts.Yet like his predecessors Obama has bolstered himself to the point where he sees no problem whatsoever with what he did. He is proud of it and according to Goldberg views it as one of his shining moments.It takes a certain cast of mind to look at todays Middle East and be proud of ones record. But according to Goldberg Obama has that cast of mind. What helps preserve it is another key Obama ideological tenet that the United States is just powerful enough to do the things Obama would like to do but not powerful enough to do any of the things he would not like to do. Thus if Obama does not act he cannot be blamed for the negative consequences that ensue because he knows that American power could not have produced a different result. The outcome whatever it is is the absolute best outcome possible given the limits on American power.This same tautological measure of success keeps showing up in every national security episode. The Cuba deal was the best that could be achieved. The Iran deal was the best that could be achieved. Whatever progress there is in Afghanistan is the best that could be achieved. Staying committed and engaged in Iraq in  could not have produced any different outcome. Acting faster might have helped in Rwanda not on Obamas watch but it would not have helped in Syria on Obamas watch. And on and on.To be fair in another way Obama has not accomplished all of this on his own. He has had some help for instance from fawning amanuenses in the press. Goldberg has done his part in this remarkably generous interview. As has the hapless editor at The New York Times who gave the paper version of a recent article on Obamas latest Middle East gambit this howler of a headline Obama Seeks Way to Save Mideast Gains.What such kidsglove treatments have in common is their failure to confront the realities of the legacy. It is a kind of reporting that relates without further comment as Goldberg does that Obamas awareness of his own limitations consists of this the belief that he is too rational informed and reasonable in his approach to foreign policy and thus not as effective at communicating the brilliance of his choices to a public including apparently experts and his own former advisers who apparently only connect to these issues at the level of feelings and emotions and politics. Somehow Obama tells Goldberg he must figure out a way to connect with others without being simplistic.A much more candid treatment can be found in Blind Spot Americas Response to Radicalism in the Middle East a new book by the Aspen Strategy Group. It is an edited volume with contributions from Democrats and Republicans alike including a sizable number who were directly involved in forging Obamas legacy. I have a chapter that analyzes Obamas counterIslamic State strategy that holds up reasonably well even though it went to press well before Obama ramped up operations in the fall of . Blind Spot and other evaluations by former Obama officials see here here here here and here all are more honest about Obamas legacy than he is himself.Perhaps it is unrealistic to ask any president to fairly and reasonably assign his own final grade. This president seems especially challenged by the assignment. But in a few short months another president will take over. Shortly after that President Obama will pen his own memoirs to do just that. You might say Goldbergs piece is Obamas first draft.,geopolitics,d10e8i0,1,t5_2qhnn

6943649,0,t1_d137s5n,I have to admit I was a bit suprised by this interpretation as while it is not wrong I would put the main point on Russias sphere of influence.Prior to the civil war Syria played two key roles for Russia as far as Im aware. The facilities directly in the Mediterraneans lessened the need of the Russian navy to be allowed passage through Nato controlled waters thus hugely increasing its potential area of activity especially for actions at odds with Nato wishes. Syria is the only? territory not directly surrounding Russias domain essentially being controlled by Russia. Therefore it is the hinge on which Russia traverses between being perceived as a global or a regional power.It shouldnt be a stretch to say that the Syrian government faced the very real possibility of losing and thus ceasing to exist the conflict prior to the Russian intervention. If it were to be lost Russia would in the demise of the government lose the garant of the safety of her naval installation and with it would be perceived as being unable to act in distances greater than Ukraine. Both of which would be a major hit to Russias prestige as well as international influence.In waging the Syrian campaign Russia gained the follwing. It stabilised the region far enough for its installations to not be threatened by military means. . It stabilised Assad and with him his government far enough to be able to hold some territory making it unlikely for a non friendly government to take hold of the territory the Russian bases are located in by othrer means.. As a result of  and  Russia does not lose the ability to take naval actions provided by these installations.. As a result of  Russia proved its ability keep its minions in power and to push back rebel forces. This should increase the faith of Russian backed rulers and decrease the chance of insurgency within Russias sphere of influence.. By demonstrating its ability to take military actions outside of its immediate surroundings Russia has proven to be a military threat to any minor country outside of Nato increasing its international influence.Still I would assume that Russia was only partly sucessfull as Syria is now in ruins and rather unlikely to be once again permanently united under Assad. The reason for Russias failure may be attributable to the Ukraine conflict binding Russian logistics. As such in my opinion the combination of both conflicts also cleary showed the limits of Russian power and ability which means that the Syrian conflict as a whole was and is detrimental to Russian interest and influence.,geopolitics,d13e4yq,4,t5_2qhnn

When Trump became the GOP frontrunner with a commanding lead despite making enemies of his partys elitesdonatorslobbyists and having one of the lowest campaign budget in recent history he threw out plenty of rules that were previously thought to be cemented into American politics.If he plays on Clintons weaknesses like the email scandal the fact she is bought and paid for by special interests like Soros and the publics mistrust of them or frame her as part of dynastic politics like with the Bush family he could attract some of Bernies crowd in the coming months. They both share the antiestablishment outsider angle after all.Trumps advantages are his unpredictability and aggressiveness forcing others to react to him and possibly make mistakes. For him saying controversial things flipflopping or outright bullshitting is not fatal.

7206641,0,t1_d1x945h,gt  How much of an impediment do you think public sympathy for jihadists and the clergy who advocate jihad is towards KSA efforts to crack down on financing and other means of support? If its a considerable stumbling block is there any sign that KSA is trying to change peoples minds on such support?This is a question that the government faced almost immediately after . Their attempts to curb financial support for jihadist groups placed them in an awkward situation to say the least with the main argument from the Saudi populace and religious establishment boiling down to you guys were helping us openly collect funds for these groups when we were fighting Russians and Serbians now that its Americans its suddenly Haram? Which the Ulama who are directly under Sauds control managed to counter with fatwas that differentiated between civilian targets and military ones and reassessing the requirements for a legal jihad mainly that the government has the only right to call for one. This goes against everything the average Saudi was taught in school throughout the ss and of course was rejected in spirit by practically everyone with the few daring to verbally reject and accuse the government of rewriting Sharia having their liberties severely curtailed. This situation along with Bushs invasion of Iraq actually helped AlQaeda in the beginning that is until they stupidly and thankfully brought the fight to Saudi itself. AlQaeda launched a campaign of serious terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia which makes the accusations of complicity even more retarded then one can possibly imagine  where they attacked targets they assumed to be filled with Westerners but were in fact mostly Arab foreigners and the government made sure that footage and pictures of the carnage were plastered all over the media. This more than anything turned the populace against AlQaedas cause. It was a complete and utter PR disaster for them. This strategy went hand in hand with a fullspectrum strategy launched by the interior minister Prince Mohammad bin Nayef to turn the people against AlQaeda and pull them towards the governments side and it worked. For a more indepth account of MBNs strategy read my post in this thread .gtAll that aside I think the largest criticism of KSA is their funding and advocating of wahabi and salafi Islam...Jihadists are often thought to espouse the same or similar ideas... and so people think if the KSA arent actively supporting it...Up until  I would say youre right and to a certain extant I would say the criticism is valid with my caveat being that the Saudi government didnt ever support terrorism or terroristdriven aims or policies foreign or domestic. The fact is that fundamentalism was on a rise throughout the muslim world for at least a century. You mention Qutbism which in fact was the modern seed that jihadist philosophy sprung and branched out from but Islam like the other Abrahamic religions always had cycles of Revivalism throughout its history and Mohammad bin AbdulWahhab was one of those Revivalists who as you probably know had the luck of having his aims run parallel to that of the Saud tribe whose combined efforts lead to the modern Saudi state. One lends legitimacy to the other this has been the formula since the states inception so there is no way to divorce Wahhabism from the current government. They can only moderate it when they need to by elevating the Quitist aspect of the creed when the followers get too rowdy and push the Jihadist aspect of the creed when they need it. They needed it during the ColdWar and it wasnt only the Saudis who saw its utility as the CIA famously equipped the Mujahedeen with Stingers among many other avenues of logistical support as you also probably already know.The legacy of that particular era was a generation that were taught all throughout school that the infidels life is forfeit in so many words and that Salafism which is what Wahhabists term themselves Salafists is the only true path. So it didnt take too many leaps of logic to go from We are the righteous and they arent to They must become like us so we all live in peace or they remain our enemies and must die. And although this is a thoroughly unpopular opinion but US and Israeli policies really helped affirm this mentality and give it substance. They dont value our lives or liberties therefore they are our enemies was an easy sale and still is today.Regardless the Saudi government realizing that its continued existence was at stake launched a concerted effort to deradicalize its curriculum and delegitimize the more militant theological strains. For instance they pushed the issue of takfir to the forefront of the debate they also stripped nationalism of its negative connotations and pretty much sacked or silenced those among the religious establishment who were too vocal in their opposition to these reforms or were too antimodernity.These actions and more blunted the more virulent and violent aspects of Saudi Salafism Wahhabism and although we already see its effects in Saudi itll take time before the peripheral nations where the theology was exported to settle down although its worth noting that the vast majority of ISISs recruits arent Wahhabists from Saudi but are either from wartorn nations IraqSyriaTunisia or from societies where Muslim youth feel disenfranchised and unassimilated mostly Europe which begs the question... Is the problem really just religious or does it have a fundamental socioeconomic aspect?  ,geopolitics,d1xc644,2,t5_2qhnn

But still CatholicOrthodox are way closer politically and culturally than christianmuslim during the entirety of history.gt Constantinople  Istanbul really seems like the most natural geopolitical cutoff point possible.Geographically speaking yes. But that doesnt negate the fact that Anatolia the Levant and northern Africa were already christian for a couple of centuries. The muslims were at their height a very existential threat to Christianity which was not martial in nature enough to combat Islamic forces.During the golden years of Islam which actually refers more to the golden years of Arabic Islam from ish to  the mongols utterly destroy Baghdad and massacred almost the entire population the caliphate made serious incursions in the Christian world all of North Africa almost all of Spain parts of Southern France albeit shortly Southern Italy particularly Sicily the Levant and Anatolia were all conquered. That was almost rds of the entire Christian world conquered remember that christianity was not spread a lot of northern Europe at that time AND you must keep in mind that the Mediterranean was at that time in terms of population wealth and importance the centre of western Eurasia. After the reconquest of Sicily after almost  years of muslim rule the pope of that time thought up the concept that would be known as the crusades. Basically the crusades started as a reaction of the swift losses to muslim conquerors.Theres also to consider what we are talking about here. Are we talking about muslims or arab muslims? Because by the time the crusades were done islam had spread far beyond Europes close environment too. And other nations because islamic but not directed towards Europe or the middle east per se. Europes muslim enemies have actually mostly been only  peoples The arabs the Turks and the mongol successors particularly for Poland and RussiaAt the end of the day. It was probably the crusades that created Europe as the crusades solidified Christianity particularly Roman catholicism and made it spread in the pagan parts of Europe.

7482818,0,t3_4hvd6f,The easy answer is its a mix of all three archetypes cast by this article.Sure Russia felt threatened by Ukraines obvious rejection of them but they likely felt Yanukovych was a little more durable than he turned out to be.  That created the need for improvisation  and the way he sold the annexation to both the people of Crimea as well as Russians back home was this was righting a historical wrong.  It provided a good cover to disguise the fact that it was likely a decision made out of fear rather than any sort of overarching appetite for more territory.In looking at the prospects for this to happen again you need to find similar circumstances that bred the annexation in the first place  Russian territorial anxiety coupled with fastchanging events on the ground and the ability to Russia to operate quickly to lock in its results before any kind of reaction.  When looking at Russias periphery even the Baltics I dont see a scenario where that happens again.

Furthermore none of this actually addresses the points from my previous comment.gt My understanding is that he uses the evidence of detailed knowledge of sports and raucous public debate as a sign that people are more than capable of understanding complex political and economic policies.I pointed out that often this detailed knowledge of sports is little more than a parroting of material that has already been presented by other professional commentators and analysts. It is not evidence that people are more than capable of understanding complex political and economic policies although I dont necessarily disagree with that assertion either. Additionally I can say from personal experience that following sports analysis is easier than following political analysis and far easier than following economic analysis.gt I think he also uses the sports examples to show that corporations use these spectacles to entertain and drain the resources from the general public and further the concentration of wealth to the top.Nonsense like this is why I cant take Chomsky seriously sometimes. If you distill this down to its basis then the idea is that any form of entertainment is essentially a means of draining the resources from the general public. Its just selfaggrandizing elitist tripe.gt Looking up sports stats spending hours in front of tv and on the internet simultaneously every night is a poor use of the little private time Americans get these days.Looking up sports stats and listening to commentary really does not consume that much time and often takes place in the midst of other activities. One also does not need to spend hours on a nightly basis to keep up with a game. Games do not take place every night and they always last around two hours. If this is coming from you then it shows me that you do not know very much about following professional sports in the same way that Chomskys commentary betrays his own ignorance on the subject.Following economics and politics is stressful and emotionally taxing. I say this from personal experience because its what I do with a majority of my offtime. However I also have the luxury of working in a fairly relaxed industry. To expect people who work  hours a week to come home and spend their offtime engaging in a stressful and contentious activity is yet another reason why this whole line of thought is ridiculous. Yet again Chomsky reveals that he himself occupies the same elitist bourgeois position that he so often criticizes the American establishment for. Chomskys job is to comment on these topics and he has much experience in processing them. He has the luxury of both education and living standards that enable him to follow these matters. His dismissal of professional sports and his expectation that everyone waste their offtime pursuing policy study just tells me that sometimes he can be laughably outoftouch with the world.Once again he also assumes that people who follow professional sports are not also engaged in political or economic discourse.I really dont think there is anything defensible in his commentary on this matter at all.gt Unfortunately the general public arent likely to change their behavior anytime soon because media such as sports and entertainment has gotten remarkably good at taking up peoples time and money.Yes God forbid some people enjoy themselves instead of arguing on the internet about politics.

7933828,0,t1_d47mlpa,Maybe the international community is reassured by knowing that Hillary Clinton didnt need the superdelegates to win since she won a majority of the pledged delegates too as well as a majority of the votes and a majority of the states. Plus of course the international community is probably keenly aware that the phenomenon of primaries as you have them in the US is pretty rare in the first place. In other countries at best parties decide who will lead them into the general election in primaries in which only paidup party members can vote. More often party leaders are elected by the partys elected officials and delegates from local chapters  kind of as if the Democratic Party would just have the DNC choose its nominee. In other countries still party leaders are just chosen by the top party brass. The wider electorate has no say in this stage of the process and just gets to choose between the parties and their leaders in the general election. All in all the US model is already exceptionally open in international comparison. So the international community would look pretty hypocritical if it were to criticize superdelegates and the like. In many countries  even just talking parliamentary democracies  superdelegates are all there is.,geopolitics,d47u52z,8,t5_2qhnn

The problem is that the original claim from toughasgrapes said that China doesnt have a foreign office and that its foreign policy is a myriad of various institutions with their own competing policies making it sound like theyre all operationalizing those policies at the same time.Im sure you can recognize the difference between having various institutions and factions and groups who try to compete and appeal to the central government to promote their own policy and then having the central government sign off on a final foreign policy orientation which is what Ive been describing  versus what toughasgrapes has written where hes essentially claimed that theres no central coordinating body aka the central government and the foreign ministry and that its a free for all where any institution can go and conduct any sort of foreign political activity without oversight.If what hes described was the case in real life then we would have obvious evidence for it because Chinese foreign policy be a constantly twitching and uncoordinated mess and that is why wed need every single instance of Chinese foreign policy to be uncoordinated to support his original claim.,geopolitics,d4lsrar,5,t5_2qhnn

8271867,0,t3_4srbpb,Weve all heard it  Pokmon Go has taken over the world. The augmented reality video game which superimposes lurid cartoon characters onto the real world as viewed through your smartphone camera is the most downloaded free iPhone app of all time and has sent developer Nintendos stock soaring to an alltime year high.Droves of youngsters  and older folk who dont mind looking daft in public  are scouring their reallife neighborhoods where the game craftily hides a mlange of creatures and loot to collect. But describing Pokmon Go as a global phenomenon comes with one huge caveat  China whose . billion people spent a worldbeating . billion on video games last year has not had Pokmon Go released in its territory.I have tried every method I can find to down load Pokmon Go but nothing works and its driving me crazy posted one user of Chinas Twitterlike microblog Weibo. It is my first time to be so interested in a game who can help me?What is loneliness? chinstrokes another. I feel lonely because Pokmon Go hasnt been released in China. Facing the empty prairie without any Pokmons I have nothing to do but to reflect my life. Please release Pokmon Go in China I dont want to miss these childhood memories.In fact the game has only been released in the U.S. Australia and New Zealand so far as designer Niantic Labs wanted to be sure its servers could handle the influx of players. And in hindsight with good cause. But Chinese gamers are nothing but resourceful and have adopted myriad means to gatecrash the Pokmon Go party.The first enterprising gamers thought that by changing the region setting on their smartphone or purchasing Apple IDs registered in the official release nations that they could skirt the geographical restriction. This works to a degree except that upon entering the virtual world the games GPS parameters kick in and the gamers are bereft of any Pokmon characters to catch.Popularity Of Nintendos New Augmented Reality Game Pokemon Go Drives Company Stock UpDrew AngererGetty ImagesTim last name not given plays Pokemon Go on his smartphone outside of Nintendos flagship store July   in New York City. The success of Nintendos new smartphone game Pokemon Go has sent shares of Nintendo soaringHowever some websites are cashing in by flogging Chinese customers illicit versions of the game in which San Francisco locations are superimposed on Chinese streets reports Quartz. Other gamers have resorted to buying hacked versions of Pokmon Go that have the geographical restrictions removed. These appeared for sale online soon after the official release though Niantic Labs has vowed to ban anyone caught using them.Many gamers have instead opted for Chinese versions of Pokmon Go like City Demon Go which has seen a huge spike in downloads on the back of Pokmon Go fever. These are similar in concept except crucially none are yet augmented reality. Players hunt for monsters and treasure just like in the real game except they roam a virtual world without the need to leave their sofa much like any standard roleplaying adventure.Of course that may soon change especially since Niantic Labs has said that due to burgeoning demand global rollout will be slower than first anticipated. Plus there are hurdles specific to China where a local partner for release hasnt been confirmed and Google  the main medium by which players log in to Pokmon Go  remains banned. That will only give impetus to Chinese developers to create local simulacrums complete with the requisite augmented reality.Many irked Chinese gamers have even sworn off the Pokmon Go  some citing national security concerns. Dont play Pokmon Go which has GPS functions posted one Weibo user. Americans and Japanese can detect our secret military bases.On Facebook Nintendo depicts Taiwan as a country instead of a province that belongs to China posted another. Also it probably tries to gather information about Chinese military bases. So I would play another game.And those devious Pikachu look so cute too.

8646342,0,t1_d6mcyrk,Yes there are plenty of smart Russians but the minute any of them look too smart or start gaining popularity Putin chops them down to size and they are jailed or must flee the country. Its not a question if Russia has the smart people to run it of course it has!   The problem is that there are competing interests and the only one keeping those interests in check is Putin.   There is no immediate hierarchy because Putin sees that as too dangerous for him.  So he has made himself irreplaceable.   It is a dangerous game Putin is playing.   What this means is that there is going to be a serious POWER STRUGGLE if anything should happen to Putin as outside of Putin there is a poorly defined power structure.  This is mostly due to him relying on yesmen.... folks that will get steamrolled the minute he is gone.  The good thing about Western style of government is that there are plenty of people in the ranks qualified and ready to take control so no one relies on just one individual one figure head like Russia has.   You can replace anyone and the markets will barely register a blip.  They are constructed as stable as possible for the corporates they serve.   There is no single master.  The President of the USA has no where near the power that Putin has over his oligarchs.  In the USA the oligarchs choose the president.  I think the CHAOS that will ensue if something shall happen to Putin is understated.  The oligarchs will step on the gas peddle and try to eat everything up they can in the middle of all this and that will mean Russia as a country  will be on the back burner as these folks will be looking to serve themselves.   They will not care about regional border conflicts or states with deficits... Russia is being held by force as we speak.... with Putin gone its going to fall apart... and this is mostly due to how powerful he has made himself and how little power he has left to the government below him.   You think any of the Oligarchs want to fund Crimea out of their own pockets??  Haahahah not a chance... in fact it would not surprise me if the oligarchs are waiting to put a hit on Putin so that they can play monopoly with whatever is left.IF ANYTHING this report is UNDERSTATING the shit show that will ensue. ,geopolitics,d6mek2k,5,t5_2qhnn

8716333,0,t3_4zep9n,Submission statementAn investigation by the United Nations and the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons OPCW over three chemical weapon attacks in  and  in Syria has stated that the Syrian government is responsible for the first two while ISIS is to blame for the third. Although the Syrian Civil War is now in its fifth year there is no sign that tensions will be easing.  Turkeys decision in the last  hours to intervene militarily in the Syrian town of Jarablus marks a turning point for the conflict especially since it coincides with US VP Joe Bidens announcement that the Kurds fighting under the banner of the Syrian Democratic Forces must vacate the lands east of the Euphrates River.Despite the fact that the United States and Russia have been seeking a political solution to the Syrian conflict and the recent speculation that they may be close to reaching an agreement to jointly target ISIS in Syria this indictment by the UN has the potential to raise tensions within the UNSC.  Considering that Russia is sympathetic towards its Syrian ally it is likely that any move by the AmericanBritishFrench voting bloc to increase pressure on the regime of Bashar alAssad through sanctions would be met with hostility and a veto.  Worthy of note is that despite the fact that the Syrian government voluntarily handed over its chemical weapon stockpiles in  the governments use of chlorine gas against civilians has continued relatively unabated. Therefore with an official indictment by the United Nations the impetus for action against the use of chemical weapons may be stronger than ever before. It will be interesting to see how this effects both the diplomatic and military situation in Syria and how the various actors will respond to this in furthering their agendas in Syria.,geopolitics,d6v6i1m,1,t5_2qhnn
8724715,0,t1_d6w1aum,Hello Hongkie This is Peter. This question contains several huge topics so Ill do my best to take a crack at answering part of it about urbanization. Please allow me to riff on this topic a bit. Im a prourbanist in that I believe that cities are remarkable things and are central to our collective future in every way including ecologically. First things first. Urbanization is ongoing all over the world and will continue for decades to come. By midcentury maybe  of all people will live in cities. How does that matter when it comes to water? It matters for two big reasons. The first is that in general urbanization causes societal wealth which in turn means people consume more stuff clothing cars consumer goods eat richer food meat especially and use a lot more water for daily life. All of those things require more water. Second because cities concentrate people into small areas they also concentrate water problems through direct water pollution industry energy plants sewage systems etc.. And of course that pollution also means people will need clean drinking water which should be treated but often isnt in the worlds informal settlements.Despite all of this I am a believer that cities can and should be a part of the solution for water issues and for every other environmental problem we face. Thats a very long essay in and of itself. In a nutshell cities are both causes of water problems and solutions to many of them as well. But the latter will be true only if we are smart in how we plan build and rebuild cities. There are cities that have a much lighter footprint on the planet compared to others think of say Copenhagen. The challenge will be to ID and scale up the best solutions. This is an enormous challenge especially given how rapidly cities are growing in Asia and Africa and how many of the cities on those continents are facing difficult fiscal and governance conditions. ,geopolitics,d6w8by5,3,t5_2qhnn

9815052,0,t1_damw6ft,I dont think this is the breaking point of liberalism. Having a strong liberal state means you can have e.g. religious freedom across a nation of four languages and  cultures  like Switzerland  but still have little statelets doing the actual work. What killed Liberalism is the Leviathan growing over the heads and hearts of the people. We probably talk about the same but I wonder what system of governance truly reflects human nature. Because there were hundreds of different systems in our history and probably all failed. A lazy mathematician would propose there is no human nature as all attempts of representation failed. Switzerland had a little Brexit too but not one abroad noticed it.  We had votes on  immigration everybody denounced them as xenophobic. Now the parliament delays and defers hard decisions. Huh just like in TFA. Technically they can do whatever they want because they are on par with the plebiscite but they shouldnt. Being liberal also means to decide and act for the common good of the state not morality or monied interests because only a strong i.e. functional state can intervene when liberties are at stake and this can only be done through self conscious long term aware institutions. And ffs a state is there for its people not for others. If the EU has a problem with us because we value the things our constitution protects more than some contracts well then voil a ribald nulandian fuck the EU.Todays institution even global institutions arent long term aware anymore. Look at the very thing we write on. There are by now thousands of top level domains I guess. ICANN at the UN! For what? This is identity politics for DNSnerds I guess. Institutions who just say  even a provisional  loud NO get to live longer or can profit from a sudden spread between what gets wrecked in society and still works within the institution.

9822468,0,t3_5fy2bb,ArticlePresidentelect Donald J. Trumps pick for national security adviser retired Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn has been much more outspoken about militant Islamists than he has about China and North Korea the two main strategic concerns of the United States in Asia.That has left scholars and analysts looking for clues about his views on Asia. A book published in July for which he was a coauthor The Field of Fight How We Can Win the Global War Against Radical Islam and Its Allies offers some tea leaves. The halfdozen mentions of China and North Korea are couched in generalities but there are glimpses into what the general thinks of the two nations.General Flynn wrote that the United States needed to confront a global alliance between radical Islamists and the governments of China and North Korea as well as Russia.China and North Korea are officially secular Communist states and China has blamed religious extremists for violence in Muslim areas of its Xinjiang region. In the book General Flynn acknowledges that people may find the idea of an alliance between the Communist nations and jihadists to be strange but asserts that it exists. He does not go into details on the alliance.General Flynn is about to take on one of the most important foreign policy jobs in the United States government. He will be expected to coordinate policymaking agencies manage competing voices and act as Mr. Trumps main adviser and perhaps arbiter on foreign policy.By appointing General Flynn a former Army intelligence officer Mr. Trump has signaled that he intends to prioritize policy on the Middle East and jihadist groups though the Obama administration seems to have stressed to Mr. Trump the urgency of dealing with North Koreas nuclear program.General Flynn is an outspoken critic of political Islam and has advocated a global campaign led by the United States against radical Islam. He once wrote in a Twitter post that Fear of Muslims is RATIONAL.Based on his book that campaign is the framework through which General Flynn sees China and North Korea. In the introduction he wrote that radical Islamists are not alone and are allied with countries and groups who though not religious fanatics share their hatred of the West particularly the United States and Israel.The introduction continued Those allies include North Korea Russia China Cuba and Venezuela.The general expanded on his definition of the antiWestern alliance The war is on. We face a working coalition that extends from North Korea and China to Russia Iran Syria Cuba Bolivia Venezuela and Nicaragua. We are under attack not only from nationstates directly but also from Al Qaeda Hezbollah ISIS and countless other terrorist groups.Suffice to say the same sort of cooperation binds together jihadis Communists and gardenvariety tyrants he added.General Flynn mentioned reports that North Korea had cooperated with Syria and Iran on nuclear programs and trade. Iran is the linchpin of the global antiWestern network he wrote.The general also wrote that there was a common ideology that bound the nations and militant Islamists together. There are many similarities between these dangerous and vicious radicals and the totalitarian movements of the last century he wrote. No surprise that we are facing an alliance between Radical Islamists and regimes in Havana Pyongyang Moscow and Beijing. Both believe that history andor Allah blesses their efforts and so both want to ensure that this glorious story is carefully told.Early in his career General Flynn served with the th Infantry Division in the AsiaPacific region. He wrote This opened up my eyes to the type of enemies we saw across a wide swath of the AsiaPacific rim. There were many and still are.General Flynn did not reply to a request made via Twitter on Wednesday for an interview.John Delury a scholar of Chinese history and the Koreas at Yonsei University in Seoul South Korea said in an interview that after reading General Flynns book he was struck by the contrast between the generals focus on Islam and the Obama administrations pivot to Asia from the Middle East.Flynns obsession with eliminating radical Islam is likely to color his view of everything else  including key strategic questions facing East Asia like the rise of China resurgence of Japan and nuclear breakout of North Korea he said. Running the National Security Council is all about juggling priorities keeping your eye on the ball while maintaining strategic balance. Flynn doesnt come across as much of a juggler. For him there is only one ball out there. If Flynn is able to press his global war on radical Islam Americas rivals in Asia will seize the opportunity to further their interests.,geopolitics,danvynl,1,t5_2qhnn

9840815,0,t1_dapgmcs,Just to play devils advocate I dont believe that the generational warfare theory is anything more than a fun little idea made up by some people who wanted to say that they predicted the future.  In reality GW is simply describing a combination of modern insurgency and information warfare.  Lind and co.s descriptions of the generations of warfare are laughable at best and downright historically revisionist at worst.  I dont disagree that the US has done a poor job at handling its engagements since the fall of the USSR furthermore I think that Putinera Russia has done a pretty decent job at maintaining an aggressive foreign policy.  But you have to remember that Russias economy has not done very well in the last  years nor is its political system in any way as free from corruption and topheavy power systems as the USs is.  This like you and others have said allows for a much easier control of its population when it comes to information warfare.  But I think that my main criticism of fourth generation warfare theory is absolutely the fact that there hasnt been a single important interstate conflict between comparable powers since the IraqIran War.  And guess what that war aligns itself much more closely with what would be described as third generational warfare.  It was by no means a quick straightforward war of constant pitched battles but it was most assuredly not a quagmire war that revolved around insurgents international coalitions and terrorist nonstate actors edit I emphasized revolved around because while it was certainly a messy war that had a ton of nonstate actors it was still at its core a conflict between Iraq and Iran. We live in a world that hasnt seen a real balanced interstate conflict besides the IraqIran War and some of the minor IndianPakistani conflicts since WWII.  Everything has been asymmetrical.  Even more important is that they have mostly been asymmetrical wars against thirdworld powers with incredibly poor infrastructure and difficult geography.  Because of this I dont think its rational or fair to declare that we are in a new generation of warfare nor do I believe that we can or should so easily compartmentalize some as ridiculously complex as warfare into simple generations.  Instead Id argue that the modern understanding of warfare has evolved at a reasonable rate and a not altogether crazy path.  Is it really so insane to think that information is inherently tied together with conflict when we are living in the selfdescribed Information Age?  We live in a time where the world is interconnected where I can get live feeds of Syrian battlefields from some  year old insurgent.  Politics has always been a part of war its just that in todays age its much harder for a state to control its own population.,geopolitics,daqa4xx,3,t5_2qhnn

Even if there might be more nefarious aspects of the US military I think that is pretty impressive that they were letting journalists into one of the most combatintensive areas of Afghanistan during the war and giving them basically absolute freedom to report what they wanted.

Threats are no way to build a relationship  this applies to personal institutional as well geopolitical relationships.And yes by friendliness I meant the perception of a nation and its people. For instance people from Canada and Scandinavia. And regardless of what the PRC and Chinese Mainlanders think perceptions matter. I personally think that the biggest loss from a Trump vicotryBrexit will not be economic or geopolitical. Those are just blips. It will be a loss to the image of these countries. Prior to Brexit people had used to think of UK as the place of Harry Potter Tea Queen Elizabeth II and the financial hub of the world.

9943055,0,t1_db34oer,I need you to stop posting in this thread Im running out of upvotes to give you.I think youre absolutely correct about Trumps intentions and Im cautiously optimistic of the outcome. The One China policy is an unresolved matter and one that I think the PRC has reason to address. That Trump may be leveraging this to open talks with the PRC doesnt mean hes threatening a trade war or whatever as so many folks seem to like postulating about. I guess what my point is is that offering to discuss Taiwan which is what I think Trump is doing with his comments may not be as much of a threat as our lovely media is portraying it as edit here that is to say I think Chinese politicians are smarter than the  of our re US population that still take Trumps statements at face value and can see past the echo chamber of western media. I mean from the PRCs perspective Taiwan is a pretty wellsized island full of usurpers that are constantly acquiring more US hardware and telling everybody else that they are the real China. Obviously this is an absurd caricature of Taiwan but important elements are described. What would be disadvantageous to the PRC if they opened discussion with the US re Taiwan? I dont see much of one other than a loss of face value an ambiguous attribute that pundits love to say the Chinese put high importance on with little to no evidence outside of moves like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon and Hero.I know this is leaning away from being a rational comment so let me get back on track. In terms of both domestic and foreign policy the PRC has significant and proximal issues arising from Taiwan and the One Chine Policy that it will need to address at some point. If a US president is going to approach them and possible offer to resolve a few of the more troublesome matters I fail to see how China could do anything other than accept talks with Trump  and treat them as a welcomed conversation with our much respected trade partner.

It would have saved the US a whole lot of effort fighting a war which did not even vitally threaten our national security. Iraq was a mess not because of the bad intelligence that Saddam had WMDs but because neocons in the Bush Administration idealistically believed that they could install a democracy in Iraq through the use of force. They should have known that this would not have worked the intelligence predicting a massive insurgency regional destabilization and Iranian empowerment was already available but their commitment to this idea lead them to engage in debilitating groupthink and biased planning. There are two clear differences with Syria. The Syrian Civil War quickly became a massive humanitarian disaster before the US got more seriously involved and began to act as a staging ground for international terrorist and criminal organizations. Allowing it to fester only empowered these terrorists and destabilized American allies and partners like Turkey Lebanon Jordan and Europe due to immense refugee flows and weapons trafficking. There is also the fact that Iran had been using Syria as a conduit for attacks against Israel through Lebanese Hezbollah and removing Assad from power would have seriously undermined Irans efforts to spread its resistance ideology and become the regional hegemon.As an aside I do not think the US should have pursued regime change in Syria because we are terrible at nation building and the Syrian opposition was totally fragmented due to a plethora of domestic and foreign factors. If intervention was going to occur it should have happened before the Russians got involved and the country was destroyed with the goal of changing the military balance within Syria so Assad had an incentive to negotiate and agree to a transition of power without destroying the state apparatus.,geopolitics,dbcsb5p,1,t5_2qhnn

Many TV shows some writers music the BBC the accent pretty girls etc. Of course I would be a fool to conflate this Britain with the blood thirsty ruthless and brutal Britain that committed numerous massacres and lead to millions of  preventable deaths in the Indian subcontinent.I dont mean to digress but the current Britain still benefits from the wealth derived from colonialism. Exploitation of British colonial subjects contributed to Britain achieving world hegemony helping it win in the two world wars and even its current status as th biggest economy. But I sometimes see articles in conservative British press defending colonialism as mostly beneficial despite evidence to the contrary to me this seems similar to Trump supporters defending slavery nowadays and things like this  on part of the government itself. I dont really see the fight against British colonialism as over. Colonialism is dead but  perhaps the symbolic aspect of such a fight is still unfinished.

None of the agencies have thus far formally claimed that the Podesta emails and the DNC emails have been provided to Wikileaks by the russians but anonymous CIA leaks reveal that this is the CIAs informal position whereas the FBI and ODNI have formally through Congress hearings and otherwise stated that theres no link between the disclosures and the hacking attacks. ,geopolitics,dbh6uuw,1,t5_2qhnn

10052700,0,t1_dbhmttt,gt We want to make the Chinese feel like they cant press their influence far outward but we definitely do not want to get in a war with them.This is one and the same. China is a rising power it feels that it has a right to press its influence outward and is arguably totally correct in that assessment literally every other major power has throughout history. Resisting that will lead to conflict. China will be unable to increase its influence through soft power and thus will turn to hard power and thus become an aggressive and expansionary power. What needs to be done is to guide China into wielding that influence positively and in a way that doesnt dominate other countries to become another America not another Soviet Union. Sure build those economic relations with other countries but also build them with China. Encourage China to take its place on the world stage both in terms of influence but also responsibility.gt the Russians could actually invade them and with present technology theres almost no way that the Russians could successfully invade us.Russian invasion of Europe will result in a global economic meltdown total collapse of international instututions and probably a nuclear exchange and America would certainly be fighting that war.

10056529,0,t3_5jn6dy,Im certainly not going to deny that Russias hacking had an influence on the election but the author needs to slow their roles.Did Russian hackers call all Trump supporters or lukewarm voters Deplorables? Did they delete all of Clintons planned stops to Wisconsin or Iowa? Did they tell her no matter what you do never step outside of Philadelphia or Pittsburgh when you go to Pennsylvania? Did they tell the DNC that there was no need to have an effective grass roots effort in potential swing states?I might be biased because I worked on the other side the ground campaign but simply put the Democrats ran an embarrassingly low effort campaign in terms of voter outreach and thats why she lost. Liberal voting blocks didnt go to the poll.Republicans won the election not just Trump. Hard antiRussian Congressmen stayed in office at the same time Trump entered it. John McCain is arguably the most famous antiRussian hawk to stay in but Senator Toomey Republican from Pennsylvania never stopped the rhetoric against an aggressive Russia and he won all the same.I wont deny that the Russian hacks are concerning and need to be addressed at multiple levels but saying Russia won the election doesnt match up when you look at the Clinton campaign voter turnout and Republican victories. Add in purely domestic issues like the price spike in Healthcare.gov plans and simply saying Russia won it for Trump is becoming a way for the same people who said Trump has no way of winning this from the end of the primary to  November to justify the poor effort of his opponents.I know this rant is about domestic politics but so many articles focusing on the TrumpMoscow dynamics of the election choose to ignore the important domestic details in favor of a far scarier narrative.I cant be surprised that a Politico and Huffington Post writer wants to deflect blame from the inadequacies of the Clinton campaignDNC but the narrative being pushed does not help antiTrump efforts going into .,geopolitics,dbie213,5,t5_2qhnn

The easyest way to get more oil fast is to take actions that cause the price of oil to go higher than the price of all methods of extraction. As long as oil is  a barrel Arctic and deepwater are not worth pursuing. Russia already recently discovered deepwaterarctic oil in just one area of the Kara Sea that may have more than the entire US part of the Gulf of Mexico but its not worth it to bring up. Who was their partner in this huge find? EXXONMOBIL and CEO Rex Tillerman. Sanctions need to be dropped AND oil prices must rise for Exxon to benifit. The Canadian oil sands wouldnt be expanding at . Fracking in the rest of the world wont be happening much as the only reason its profitable now in the US is the infastrcture and technology was already built by  oil. If both the US and Russia were working neferiously tword the same goal of quickly getting to high priced oil to then drive new infastrcture investment and production increases in their own respective countrys the Middle East would need a new war in the Gulf and particularly Saudi Arabia. ,geopolitics,dbtqzhb,4,t5_2qhnn

10178723,0,t1_dbxlmvh,Cultural but not ethnic. I mean the idea of a Russian state as it existed from the Imperial days throughout the life of the Soviet Union and up until now.  Obviously this is just my take on the situation and since Im not from Russia a lot of it is derived from the analysis of people who are much more familiar with the subject than I am. I enjoy reading reports released by the Russian International Affairs Counsel for instance as well as the perspectives of American diplomats who worked in Russia. The perseverance of the Russian people and their strength in overcoming hardships is often referenced as an important national ideal that shapes the way Russians perceive events much like the role that individualism and liberty plays in America. The continued unity of Russia as a geopolitical entity despite having experienced several radical changes in its system of government is a testament to that mindset. I think ideals such as that help to unify the diverse range of cultures and the perception of Russia overcoming the West helps to reinforce it.

Moro Muslims Cambodians and Laotians will all oppose your balancing coaliation.America is the invading aggressor in Southeast Asia..The natives of Mindanao are Moro Muslims and Lumad Animists. America signed the Bates Treaty in  with the Moro Muslim Sulu Sultanate promising to leave their internal affairs alone. America then violated the Bates Treaty in  invading the Moro Muslim Sulu Sultanate massacring their women and children at the Moro Crater Massacre in Bud Dajo and annexing them to the Philippines. Then flooded their land with Filipino Christian settlers from the Visayas. Moros and Lumads were turned into a minority in their own lands. American companies then began to loot Mindanao of its mineral and natural resources mining logging and building plantations to steal the resources of the Moros and Lumads.The American backed Marcos administration started the Jabidah massacre against Moro Muslims sparking the current war. Filipino Christian settlers formed the Ilaga militia which committed mass atrocities against Moro women and children like the Manili massacre. At the Malisbong massacre Moro women and girls were mass raped by the Philippine army. The Moro National Liberation Front fought against the Philippine army.The war is still going on to this day. American troops are stationed on Mindanao in Operation Enduring Freedom to fight against the Moro armed groups. The Lumad tribal leaders meanwhile have been repeatedly assassinated by people suspected to be related to the Aquino administration which was in power before Duterte. Aquino was the antiChina President whom Obama supported in the Philippines for his Pivot to Asia directed against China. Aquino started criticizing China over the SCS and filed the international court case.The Moro National Liberation Front denounced Americas moves against China in the South China Sea. It reminded everyone that China was a traditional ally of their Sulu Sultanate. Chinese merchants traded peacefully with the Moro Sulu Sultanate Maguindanao Sultanate and Maranao Sultanate and sold them guns to use against Spanish attacks.Moros and Lumads peacefully protested outside of the American embassy in Manila in a joint demonstration demanding American troops leave Mindanao and for the assassinations to stop. They were then violently tear gassed attacked and dispersed by the police.Vietnam used to be just north Vietnam. The Vietnamese conquered what became modern day south Vietnam from indigenous peoples. The Vietnamese conquered the Champa Kingdom and mass colonized it with Kinh Vietnamese settlers until Chams became a minority. Vietnam also attacked Lan Xang Laos and Cambodia reducing them to subject vassal status and acting as their overlord and Vietnam annexed lands from both Laos and Cambodia taking Saigon and the Mekong delta with Cambodia. Kinh Vietnamese settlers once again colonized Saigon and the Mekong Delta and turned the native Khmer Krom into a minority. Kinh Vietnamese also colonized the Central Highlands and turned the native Montagnards into a minority.The Khmer Krom Chams and Montagnard Degars gathered together in an alliance called United Front for the Liberation of Oppressed Races FULRO to fight against South Vietnam and North Vietnam. FULRO started its first attack against South Vietnamese and American special forces. They then fought against the Viet Cong and North Vietnam. Cambodia under Sihanouk and Lon Nol supported FULRO militarily because Cambodians hold strong antiVietnamese sentiment resenting Vietnams control over Saigon and the Mekong Delta and overlordship. FULRO fought Vietnam until . Montagnards demonstrated in  and  against colonization and settlement in the Central Highlands but were heavily cracked down upon.Montagnard and Cham websites accused Obama of lifting the arms embargo on Vietnam just for being antiChina Champaka which is run by former Cham FULRO fighters said Obama didnt care about human rights and ethnic minorities. These groups noted the fact that Obama explicitly only criticized Vietnam for persecuting ethnic Kinh dissidents like a blogger not over violations against ethnic minorities like Montagnards. Meanwhile Obama and his New York Times supporters regularly bash China call China a threat and support antiChina actions.When Vietnam invaded the Chams in  the Chams asked China to invade Vietnam and stop the attack. The Chams were crushed in that war. The final remnant Cham state was conquered in  by the Vietnamese.Cambodia and Laos both support China in ASEAN over the SCS dispute because their civilian populations are antiVietnamese due to centuries of Vietnamese invasions of their countries and Vietnamese annexation of their lands. Cambodian civilians protested in support of China. Cambodians are more extreme antiVietnam Laotians less than Cambodians but the prodemocracy opposition Laotians still are pretty antiVietnamese and Laos agreed to help China in ASEAN.,geopolitics,dc3hk8i,23,t5_2qhnn

10343534,0,t3_5o3o8a,Id guess this is part of Chinas plan to prepare for Trumps presidency. With DJT questioning the One China Policy and his SoS advocating for a blockade in the SCS blockades are commonly understood to be an act of war China must of course reach out to potential competitors in order to preempt the DJT administration.Its an open question whether India will bite the hook. Modi seems to have lost some credibility due to his demonetization policy which seems fair at this point to characterize as impetuous and likely a blunder. He therefore needs a few big wins before the next election in . Getting concessions from China re trade deficits or Pakistan large Chinese investments etc might therefore be attractive even solely in terms of party interests. Also China reacting to an antiChina US administration is the perfect opportunity for India to get compromises from China that would be impossible in all other scenarios. On the other hand wariness of China seems to run deep in the Indian strategic community so it seems possible to me that theyll reject concessions that would be in Indian interests just out of distrust fear or spite.Now for India the US has been at times practically a foe e.g. Nixon admin in  at other times a nominal friend who nevertheless supports their archenemy and more recently an aspiring bff. But the DJT admin and the BJP imo have many similarities similar ideologies inclination to see terrorism as a priority DJT got some support from proModi IndianAmericans and even has some business interests in India. Its likely considering that DJT seems likely to radically break from precedents that this is a huge opportunity for India to get great geopolitical benefits from the US  e.g. expansions of Obama policies for tech transfers joint ventures in military industry and other sectors US state support for Indian manufacturing cheaplabor dependent manufacturing has to go somewhere if not China etc.In pursuit of this goal either accepting some Chinese proposals or at least appearing to seriously consider Chinese proposals would be of immense help.

10661786,1,t1_ddfmqa4,I meant the world wars. But as far as their modern military goes theyre not nearly as prepared or equipped as we are nor as well trained or experienced. The French only just recently replaced that relic FAMAS rifle with the HK and many of the others are basically still retrofitting old rifles or still using dated platforms. Joint training exercises are not as common as I would expect either. As far as intelligence its not that they dont have worthwhile abilities if youre cherrypicking but their abilities are significantly lesser or in some cases nonexistantBelgium lacks foreign intel service iirc. Despite programs like fiveeyes the ability of european nations to cooperate and pursue intelligence objectives jointly leaves a lot to be desired. They dont work together enough or share enough and they behave as separate entities yet their borders basically make them as one. So hypothetically if someone gets the attention of German intelligence they could go to France or Belgium or wherever and not be on their radar and commit an attack there which to some extent is what actually happened if I remember correctly. Just imagine the logistics on screening all those refugees and immigrants and monitoring them it was hard enough doing it before the crisis. Not trying to be a xenophobic dick or whatever but its a valid consideration Iraq Syria Tunisia Algeria Afghanistan Iran Somalia Libya etc. have issues with radicals to one extent or another so its reasonable to expect that in a pool of  people at least a few might be radicals and as weve seen in the attacks across Europe it only takes a handful of people. Im not against helping them though Im just saying it carries risk and Im skeptical as to whether Europe is equipped to handle it. It helps to have US intelligence working alongside them to help them but imagine the headline US spies on Europe not exactly the best thing to see in the morning news with your breakfast. PBS Frontline had a good segment on this whole issue I can find it for you if you want.As far as Americas position in NATO I would think the value of that would be obvious.

Sovereignty is both a key component for developing a full Autarky along with food water energy military and manufacturing AND a common exercisable result of such. However there is no proven correlation between Autarkic policies and national sovereignty. Full Autarkies are rare but every country in the world has policies of self sufficiency relating to specific matters. Often this includes sovereignty but in many places it does not such as Greenland individual American states or even potentially nations in the EU. This excerpt is also rather interesting although I apologise for the horrific layout on mobile. The see more section on Autarkies is full of useful links about self sufficiency especially as a political ideology.

10945388,0,t1_de6zhky,Sorry if my truncated response previously caused any confusion I was referring to a historical claim over water namely that included behind the  dash line and not of the islands themselves. Land is predominantly claimed by historic ties. And while I am more than happy to hear any critique of the examples included dont prioritise attacking them they merely provide a frame for each point.Most claims for territorial seas are based on historical ownership of land would be a more accurate way of stating that.And yes that is certainly true. Britain has a history of owning Gibraltar the South Sandwich Isles and the Channel Islands amoung numerous others. And so has a claim to the territorial seas around them. Yet there are a few things to note about these claims.Firstly they all refer to the historical ownership of land and so the water around them provided within the confines of UNCLOSs legal framework. Britain would have Historical fishing rights to the Icelandic and Newfoundland cod banks. Yet is does not pretend that this gives them a claim to those seas. Nor does Italy claim the entirely of the Balearic. These Historic Fishing Rights are a fundamental part of Chinas  dash line as identifed by Dr. Wu Shicun president of the National Institute for South China Sea Studies which is allegedly sponsored by the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. No other country that I am aware of claims exclusive fishing rights over High Seas let alone into the EEZ of a non adjacent neighbour.  If you have any examples of other countries that made such a claim without coming to a bilateral agreement with the relevant countries I would love to hear them.Secondly they all constrict their claims in relation to other nations claims within the UNCLOS framework and independent bilateral agreements. For example Gibraltar limits its Territorial Waters to just nm and while some hardliners still contest it the Spanish Government has accepted it albeit informally the signing of a new treaty detailing the Spanish Gibraltar relationship fell through under political pressure a few years ago. Brexit has further delayed formal ratification. The claim does not cross the median of the channel either as UNCLOS demands.Nor does Britain draw a line from its current territorial seas to cover and include the Falklands and South Georgia then demand that the territory inside it the majority of the Atlantic is their Territorial Seas EEZ Sovereign Waters or make any other claim for it.It does not matter who owns the islands in the South China Sea that is an entirely different issue. Lets say that ITLS rules that Chinas historical claim is quantifiably better than any of the opposing historical claims and so they are all Chinese for this example. The Territorial Seas would still be limited to nm from the Baseline A and to the median line with the next nation A. The Contiguous Zone would still be nm A and the EEZ nm A. The rest of the water covered by the  Dash Line would be High Seas. This is what the PRC suggested in their  Declaration on the Territorial Sea. The idea that China has control over the seas behind the  dash line as they suggested in the  Law on the Exclusive Economic Zone and the Continental Shelf and have continued to suggest since is entirely farcical irregardless of who owns the islands included within this line. As for the islands and reefs themselves all of the countries involved have historic ties. When does it stop becoming people squatting on the land you have a historical tie to and instead becomes people creating their own historical ties to a place? That is an entirely different question but it is possible to disagree with the  dash line without agreeing or disagreeing to Chinese claims for the islands included by it. ,geopolitics,de8xty5,1,t5_2qhnn

And now China is conquering the sea by developing ships that can deploy those missiles.Americas only bet to counter it is that Chinas missiles would have a hard time hitting moving targets while America would try to make short work of Chinas radars. That in itself presupposes that America would not restrict an eventual war to sea only.I think railways are more about transporting people than goods. In an actual war those railways could become easy targets too. Although now that I think about it its possible that China may have developed some underground railways used exclusively by their military.I dont think China can be picky about where they get their food from. Their supermarkets are stocked with products from all over the world from what I could see. There is a site that shows in real time the ships as they are moving day to day on the sea. Id bet that  of them have some dependence on China lol. China imports a lot of commodities.Now here is the deal. I dont think that China would be happy to depend say on an American corporation like Monsanto for their food. At the scale that China works at they cannot really be picky. They will get what they can. And unfortunately a lot of the time they have to get it at the sea as its quicker even if again they cannot be too picky and have to eat of everything a little. From what I could see they will try to make dishes even with what is in the guts of animals. For real. The comparison to Americas food customs could not be more different. Oh and in China they supposedly try to avoid drinking from tap water for the fear of heavy metal poisoning.I think China may use a combination of land and sea developments and try hard to avoid a war that could imperil their population. But China will definitely fight over both of them and will not allow for America to try to colonize China by way of any of them. China has more to lose with a population  times larger than Americas.

However both parties wants to win the arms race to be free to pursue their strategic aims with no one in the world being able to stop them. The arms race has for several decades now had America in a very solid lead but perhaps not quite enough to dispense with the arms race altogether. MAD is still somewhat in effect. Though the destruction wouldnt be symmetrical it would be enough.As for the motives of the US and Russia we know those motives already. Soviet didnt crumble that long ago. Russia controlled andor occupied most of their neighbours for a very long time including all of Eastern Europe. As a European I know for sure that none of those countries are interested in getting occupied again if Russia reestablishes dominance. So thats what would happen if Russia ever won the arms race we have already seen their ambitions. The US on the other hand is less interested in open conquest which is why we have seen  comparatively little of that even though the US has been the undisputed top dog for decades. Of course they still pursue their own strategic aims as I said and there has been a couple of invasions in the Middle East.

Kaszeta is an independent consult who has written extensively on the Syrian civil war. In  he put forward an idea that would decisively prove the Syrian regime was behind the sarin gas attacks that killed over  people. This was based on a certain chemical hexamine being found in the sarin.In this email exchange the professors ask Kaszeta to back up his theory by providing the sources for some of his technical information. He fails to do so the conversation turns passive aggressive and then is cut off.I dont think it undermines any of the arguments made about this current incident but it may be worth trying to corroborate what he says with another source. If he starts talking about hexamine then definitely wait to hear opposing information. Thats the best suggestion I can make.But again this was all really technical stuff that I am in no way qualified to understand so its a bit hard for me to judge how wrong Kaszeta was or even he actually was wrong at all if its a constant problem with him or if it effects other statements hes made. EDIT Postol the man refuting Kaszeta has written about the current incident. It is a bit all over the place because of twitter but it might be worth reading Also worth pointing out that there seems to be a bit of rivalry between the two.EDIT The rabbit hole gets deeper. In the email exchange Postol enlists the help of a person called Syrian Sister. As far as I can tell this is a conspiracy theorist who engages in holocaust denial  trutherism and has been interviewed by David Duke. Postol says she is a chemist but she dropped out of uni.

11779421,0,t3_682fkj,I honestly think that this post should be removed. This does not discuss geopolitics and the posters fear of war breaking out is honestly incompatible with knowledge of the geopolitics of the region.
