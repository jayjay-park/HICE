1833824,0,t3_2fkk88,Hi. Good luck with this new competitionComparing with FPL i can say they have a similar point system. They also give  point for Every five recovered balls.Transfers you have one FT per week like FPL but a hit only costs  points.. so many times hits in this game can work. Build your team based on Group Stage. You will have free transfers before Round of .You also have a wildcard which one you can play when you want. i Play this game for  seasons and i use  times between GW and last year in gw due injuries.For me the best time is before GW Last game of group because big teams already qualified will rest their players so i usually use that roundto take advantage of that.real changeThe difference is the manager substitutions. Champions league has games at Tuesday and Wednesday so after all matches on a single day have finished and before the next matches start you canReplace any player unless they were sent off with one from your bench whose team is yet to play.Change your captain if he was not sent off with a player from your squad whose team is yet to play.Players who are substituted out will score  points the captain bonus will be lost from your original captain if a new captain is selected. Substitutions and captain changes cant be cancelled once confirmed.An unlimited number of manager substitutions can be made however it is not possible to make manager substitutions after games on the last day of the matchday as all fixtures will have been completed.Attention If a manager substitution or captain change is made then no automatic substitutions will take place on your team that matchday.Basically you can put all your Tuesday Players in XI then if someone have a bad performance you can sub him out for a Wednesday players  same applies for captain.  that means you should have a balanced squad all your players should play. and they must be shared by two days. One gk plays on tuesday another should play on wednesday avoid have all forwards playing in same day or mids.Edit Example  ... all  on benchhelp ,ChampionsFantasy,cka6582,4,t5_2yfzq

8920746,0,t3_52fqvd,I actually went with Pepe Reina and Iker Casillas ... Do you guys think its wrong to have two solid GKs to make sure I get a clean sheet ?! Do GKs get save points ?! In that case if my goalie from Day  is shit I switch in Semper for example and rake in the save points if he didint get a cleansheet ,ChampionsFantasy,d7k55uh,1,t5_2yfzq
