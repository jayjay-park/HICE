3130322,0,t1_com9pbx,Wellllllll....The group of Norse blew past our line they just kind of outplayed everyone there. It was kind of embarrassing tbh. They flew through the bridgeriver area got the two keeps in their way and made it to the relic. At that point we maybe had  defenders left because  groups decided they wanted to kill the dragon while we still had some land leftSo they got into the relic keep took the relic headed north and were ambushed by an equal size hib force. Their fight lasted about  minutes before we all charged in like loons and started the next melee.In the struggle though we thought the mids got the relic and it had turned out that they had a small man group sneak by both our lines and out the northern bridge back  towards Midgard and the entire fight was to distract their movementAll in all took place between pmam and then I was tired PEdit Theyve been trying since about PM today to take our secondary relic in the center of the three rivers Here and we kept them pushed to the maze most hte day. Had a great few back and forths and our line broke so bad we were pushed to the inner courtyard of the keep of the dudes who currently own the center but thankfully they purchased all the guards and bought all the equipment we needed to build the keep to its most effective defensive state  and the relic remained secure  ,TestOutfit,comgeyf,2,t5_2t6h2

3378705,0,t1_cpdcqwk,Sure the problems occur when you spill the industry standard coffee all over yourself.  Page  search tempest.I have taken a look at your request form  Ill act under the assumption that the final reason was because of the  hour window from Cobalts reservation to your request.  Ill note that there also seemed to be a lot of frustration on behalf of Maelstrome and SgtMile.. The time in UTC wasnt inputted at the time of your post judging from the initial response.  You may not know this but putting it in PDTCDTEDT confuses the shit out of our EU counterparts.  If you think its easy for them to convert the time of every single request consider how much easier it would have been for you to originally put it in UTC.  I saw why you didnt do it at the time thats understandable but still not enough in my opinion.. You had two separate requesting dates in two different places  in title and  in your post.. Two out of the four outfits requesting provided a contact there were policies in place before your post requesting this information.  Although I recognize that there is a degree of vagueness with the second and third bullet.  I also see no previous request approved without each identified outfit providing a POC point of contact.. The example and requested format was very clear with examples.. A two hour window from Cobalt scrim to Emerald scrim...are you aware that by necessity accounts are not just left asis after they are used by players?. Im not going to assume this one were your scrim participants in PSB TS when they did the scrim?edit If you have read this far here is what Ill say on the whole thing.  I mainly defended the reason why the request was denied.  I actually believe that your request in essence was not a big deal.  The way you went about it however was really wrong.  You and I may have and have had complete disagreements about things.  But you should at least know that you can come to more than one of the admins on the subject me included and well fight for the idea if we feel you are in the right.,TestOutfit,cpdebtq,0,t5_2t6h2

The road to town is along a steep ridge but should give us a good overview of the city. If our IFV driver wants to make TEST Outfit proud try and wait until AFTER the mission.North Burough itself may present some interesting combat encounters with the long sight lines and large amounts of rightangle cover BonusIRL shot of a similar area As for the target itself unless we can find a boat not likely were gonna have to go around unless everyone likes the idea of swimmingampwading in Northern Alaskan leadinfested waters in January Hint I dont recommend it Before we lost the drone to hostile actions it did pick up a couple of points of interest Some sort of bunker or mining facility and a small lake islandThe mining bunker may be a good bugout point if its not held the Youtubians if we need to regroup and the island may be a good extraction point if Camp Crook is overrrun in the event of a counter assault by the YTers.If we have time it may be good to investigate both sites after our mission is complete. ,TestOutfit,cz7itue,3,t5_2t6h2
