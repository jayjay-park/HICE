51557,0,t3_1uod5q,I thinkHousing regulations need there to be measured strengths of the materials used to build the house for it to be up to code. for example building load bearing and free standing walls they need to be up to some code for it to pass inspection but since varying compositions of dirt may not have these measurements and tests done on them such structures might not pass inspections.Some earth structures made with dirt and other materials excluding concrete solid rock formations and certain clays might actually be a facade that hide metal support bearing structures. These supplements are for it to be considered a safe residential structure up to code. thats just dirt and mud hits though. Perhaps like in new zealand.Concrete structures are strong as balls given the right concrete reinforcements and the proper head on your shoulders to put it together. You can bury them deep and they will stand whatever you throw at it underground. Again given the right concrete. Dig a hole build concrete house bury it. or dig a hole pour concrete into hole make house in hole.You just have to make sure that the roof is ready to be loaded with weight so your underground home doesnt collapse and water stuff. Hobitt holes per the book were probably made by digging into a hillside and supporting openings with wood beams. Like partially buried homes im sure they thought to dig up some parts to add things like chimneys and rebury them.You can make clay homes quite easily apparently with sacks of clay. Buying sacks of clay like you would cinderblocks and stacking them and just blending all the blocks of clay together. Let it harden and you got yourself a cheap clay igloo house thing. I hear the building a house underground is just as much  as building a house above ground. You can also meet LEED specs for partially buried buildings for their energy savings. Maybe even qualify for tax credits for a green household or building.You could just build a bunker.I thinksources HGTV Planning my own house internet,RPI,cekatdt,6,t5_2rg3u

If he does do the XOR neural network again make sure to convince him to do it as a proper programming assignment and not through excel. Thats probably the only real negative about the class was that last assignment.The really big difference is that Xias projects seem to focus mainly on search algorithms minimax and qvalues and bayesian which is more inline with the usual approach how my undergrad did it. Dunno if he will do neural networks but wouldnt be surprised if he didnt. MacDonald covered a lot of topics he talks about minimax but no assignments on using it same with qvalues and the like. instead of just focusing on searching and bayesian which is sort of what I expect in most AI classes.I perferred MacDonalds approach but that might be because Im biased towards reasoning over Bayesian stuff so it was nice to see it included but Xias is probably the more standard approach as Ive mentioned before.The logic for MacDonald was use of actual formal deductive reasoning rules to solve facts and stuff which is a couple of chapters in the book but is sort of skipped for Bayesian approaches by most classes,RPI,cga6nvp,2,t5_2rg3u

Every lecturer for the class is super boring and the lab is honestly terribly laid out and is far too time consuming. There really should only be one lab report for the semester. It doesnt help that lab content is super vague about the procedure and the overall message of the lab. To make matters worse is that most of the TAs that get stuck with BIOL  arent always studying biology so their teaching styles during the lab could leave students confused. Ive been a UG mentor for some sections for several semesters now so I can understand the pain! xD The best way to get through the lab is to look through the packet you get in the beginning and try to get an idea of the procedure on your own before the TA starts going on about it. Youll understand it more if you read through it yourself. Im pretty sure the labs get posted on LMS some time before you have to go in. Anything you need clarification on ASK THE TA OR THE MENTOR. Seriously. Ask anything. Dont worry about it sounding stupid! Knowing the lab will also help you do well on the weekly quizzes.,RPI,ck83evp,2,t5_2rg3u

I understand that these issues are overblown and the result of built up racial tension.But Im a nd generation american and I have no slavery guilt so do excuse me if im less apathetic towards this social issue and if i think that people are better off without all this hype.Cops in troy arent required to have college degrees. The majority of towns also have these minimum requirements. maybe instead of putting stupid people behind guns we shouldnt. AND AND maybe we have only ourselves to blame.People are acting like it isnt common knowledge that police are judged differently.And I guess everyone that didnt already know this deserves to march in the streets like idiots and shout I DIDNT KNOW THIS! AND I DONt THINK ITS RIGHT! There is no one that is saying that it doesnt exist and that it isnt wrong. Everyone agrees that this occurrence is a bad thing. so everytime i see these things i dont sympathize with the organizers. PSYou dont talk back to cops. and you dont assault them. You dont try to get anywhere near their gun. Just let them draw it on you while you are completely still. You listen to their orders because you trust them to do the right thing. You do not start running towards the cop with his gun out no matter how far you are from him. You walk slow or lay down with hands on your head. SO what do you have to say about that? I agree that this is an injustice but we cant let cops not make judgement calls.

3230760,0,t3_2x4bpj,I have heard from others that Machine and Computational Learning is allegedly the hardest class they teach at RPI. Although I will add that difficulty differs from person to person.One of my CS friends loves coding but not the algorithmproofs part of it so he loved Data Structures while struggling with FoCS. And I have friends where the reverse was true. Currently though my friends are dedicating a lot of time towards Advanced Graphics so theres that as well.But once again difficulty does change depending on the student.

3645887,0,t1_cq7jvdf,I respect your views and you are free to act as you see fit in the future with regards to our screenings but I strongly disagree with much that you have said.  First the forum is not mandatory to watch the film.  It is simply available for those that want to get something more out of it but if you would like to watch the movie without that there will be no issue.  Additionally I personally dont see how added discussion of a work of art will ruin it but I suppose that much is up to personal interpretation.  Second I see lots of people thinking that this sets a precedent when it has always been Cinemas policy to listen to what students and the campus community in general has to say with regards to our event planning.  In the end Cinema will always have the final say so if we feel a complaint has merit and there is a reasonable solution that can best serve all parties then we will take that action as we did this time with the movie shown at a later date.  If we do not feel there is such an option we will follow the course that we feel is best whether that is continuing with our normal programming or not.

Get a roommate and you can share a decent place for .K a month but not in downtown SF. Youll have to commute. Saving up money on top of that is hard in SFSilicon Valley. A lot of your savings will come through company stock plans that will take out some money from every pay check and then buy company stock at a discount after a certain amount of time. Most SV companies are huge into stocks. Its like NYC west.  However startups are less likely to have this sort of program or at least youre taking on a lot more risk with stock. If youre going to take the risk with a startup youll want to negotiate up on salary and make sure youre getting compensated really well in stock. All that being said this also depends on the job.

Shes paid like a corporate CEO  and corporations pay property taxes.Then theres the mansion.The house is barely visible from the road. It is set behind an iron gate towering trees and a large expanse of grass. Theres almost always an RPI security vehicle parked near the entrance.The building replaced a perfectly fine Colonial which with seven bedrooms was hardly petite. RPI presidents had inhabited the house since the s but the school said its limitations made it impossible for the president to entertain prominent visitors appropriately.Oh how those visitors suffered crammed into that squarefoot house. Really it just had to go.The new house looks like a classic Georgian on steroids. Its height at nearly  feet even exceeded what was allowed by Troys residential zoning limit.The house was controversial when it was being built. In some quarters of campus it was seen as unnecessary icing atop Jacksons already frosted cake.RPI officials always said that the house was for future school presidents too. It was not being built for Jackson alone they said stressing that the mansion should be seen as a longterm investment that could help the RPI woo potential donors.Thats money perhaps that could help the school pay off all that outstanding debt.,RPI,cvyjjaz,15,t5_2rg3u

6969128,0,t1_d0yp379,Just going to add here if you or anyone else reading is interested in the Sound Design and Popular Culture concentration as an alum of it get ready for weird shit. Like in a really cool way. But dont come in expecting to come out knowing how to make EDM bangers or well much in the realm of specifics in industrystandard music production or traditional musicianship besides some music theory classes arguably or just one since only one is required.Im not saying these things arent covered. Im saying thats not exactly the goal of this concentration. The sound design program is a crossdisciplinary concentration that prepares you for the world of avantgarde largely academic sound art. Basically if you want to be on the cutting edge of philosophy of sound and sound design and thinking outside the box in terms of music this program is ABSOLUTELY FOR YOU. If you feel like youd be frustrated doing experimental music  of the time MAYBE THIS PROGRAM IS NOT FOR YOU. But if youre like me and like unusual and challenging music I think its damn worthwhile.The audio professors are generally topnotch some being distinguished in their field. They are amazing artists of their own rights. And even if people tell you otherwise if you take Deep Listening seriously it will have a significant impact on you as a listener and as such as a musician.Plus the equipment room and labs especially WH with its fancy board and  speaker arrayexpandable via portable JBLs in case you need MORE have tons of resources for you to utilize. In addition to going out of your way to network with people through academic and social channels going out of your way to just understand and know how to use all that really cool fancy gear might just come in handy in the future. You never know! Plus its super fun.Just dont expect to be using EMPACs resources as an undergrad without very special circumstances. Thankfully there is a very excellent club called P.U.L.S.E. that is basically the EMPAC club for musicians run by EMPAC staff and it is definitely a great way to at least get involved there somewhat on the audio side.As far as the future after undergrad goes youd be best off with three options arguably. One you dual with something safe like CS and make your CS projects COOL AS HELL which is good for potential employers down the line since coding multimedia installation things is pretty impressive at face value. Two you try to get into either RPIs Architectural Acoustics grad program under the School of Architecture or a similar programRPIs is one of the best in the countryworld. Or Three you go on the MBA track and root yourself in academia forever which does suit some people just fine if they can handle it. Regardless of what you choose to do you can also keep in mind the small comfort that an EMAC degree by itself is a Bachelor of Science not Art. Thats neat.Lastly as far as I know the sound design concentration is still quite small in terms of enrollment so its pretty easy to make friends in itespecially since most of the people who choose to study what amounts to experimental music at an engineering research institute are generally speaking super cool people to be around if you are also a person who chose to study what amounts to experimental music at an engineering research institute. If that makes sense to you even a little this might be a good social fit for you. Plus theres a healthy alternative music scene on campus kept up by WRPI the radio station and Ground Zero the literally underground studentrun music venue amp housing thing primarily.Hopefully this is helpful for a handful of people or at least one!,RPI,d16acfo,5,t5_2rg3u
6973735,0,t3_4b7ogy,Quite honestly the rankings for those schools do not mean much. If he has done his research in game design he will learn that most employers only care about what is in your portfolio. What youve actually created in school and on your own time is much more important than what school you graduated from. As for our game design program here we have a lot of awesome professors and some great courses. You choose a concentration to take along with the games programs. These include computer science electronic arts psychology maybe writing and sound design. There might be a few more concentrations I am missing. Out of all of those computer science is by far the most popular and useful as you can easily decide to go into software engineering instead of game programming if you wish too. This is coming from someone who picked an electronic arts concentration which the course work for is not nearly as flexible.Hope this helps and if you have any more questions feel free to ask.,RPI,d16t6g0,1,t5_2rg3u

7090928,0,t3_4cmnb8,Who is liable for this legal situation? The Student Union or The Institute and its Board of Trustees?Hi Everyone!The important points for the question are bolded.I have a question about Dr. Jacksons answers from the town hall on the Student Union. It wasnt clear and I want to understand it.Video located here At the  minute mark to the  minutes mark Dr. Jackson gives this answer for the oversightThe Student Union will retain autonomy and power in deciding clubs recognizing them figuring out whats the right funding and how to support them. my paraphrasingHowever Dr. Jackson glosses over what seems to be the main question for the Board of Trustees  this situationA Situation Student Government can hire the Director of the Union and do the things listed above. A student organization hosts an event that is intentionally or unintentionally racist or sexist. Someone discriminated against feels their rights have been violated. They sue the student group. Since the Student Union gets its power and ability from the Board of Trustees who are the ultimate authority for the Institute the student group is not legally liable. Instead the Board of Trustees and the Institute itself must meet this civil or criminal case in court and pay all the fines as well as repercussions. The Board of Trustees wishes they had an Executive Director in the Student Union to either advise the student group that the event could be problematic or could alert the right people in the Institute that a potential court case could be coming.Questions Does anyone know the law and know if the Institute and the Board of Trustees is responsible for this if it happens? If the Board of Trustees is responsible do they have to make a decision on what happens in a situation like this if it arose in the future? If the Board of Trustees is not responsible then who gets the blame in this situation and has to fight the court battle?Is this a viable compromise?If this is really is the case then would this be a viable solution for everyone?There would be no Executive Director hired for the Student Union.In exchange anyone who wants to use the Student Union or be part of a student organization has to sign a waiver.The waiver says in case something like the above happens that RPI and the Board of Trustees are absolved of all liability.Instead the students the Student Union and the Director of the Union especially would find their own in house legal counsel and handle all cases on their own without the Institutes legal protection.Anyone more knowledgeable on the law know the answers to these? Does this solution seem like a good compromise for both parties? Would this solution be too complicated to do legally? Would Dr. Jackson and the Board of Trustees be kept awake at night wondering if the students would get in a situation where the administration cant use the influence of the Institute anymore to protect the students?Thanks!

7107564,0,t1_d1kewnx,DIS major here! ujriki is definitely right about the project based and social science oriented nature of the program. Im not sure if I would say the classes are easythere is a lot of reading and writing and the professors expect you to put in a significant amount of effort. That being said if you apply yourself you will almost definitely get a decent grade regardless of the quality of your final product. The professors are interested in watching you solve problems and they dont want you to feel like youre going to get shafted for pursuing something promising but untested. There is a lot of reading writing discussion and working with other people! If this is something that doesnt appeal to you you probably wont like DIS. Also worth noting is that it isnt really intended as a standalone major most people pair it with something more technical like MechE CS Management or EMAC. Im a CivE dual but I can talk about the MechE track if that is something youre interested in. Another thing you should know is that the curriculum is set up to be taken in a certain order. This makes it somewhat difficult to transfer into the program if you already have credit elsewhere and dont want to add time onto your stay here. Overall I really like my program. Ive learned a tremendous amount Ive come to see the world with a more analytical and compassionate eye and I think Ive become a better person. The vast majority of my professors have been topshelf. That being said the program does have faults and it suffers from a lot of the same issues of the EMAC program as outlined in this post Do you have any specific questions or areas of interest?

NSBE and SHPE privately run the better career fair at RPI but should not be allowed to discriminate against the way someones is dressed. Its time they realize that especially as engineers we dont live in a suits world anymore while Im sure this was once important. Im sure its  people fr the clubs that think they are doing the right thing but are just repeating what they think is right learned from possibly a national organization that is more old school focused. Some of the highest paying jobs in our field all allow casual dress freedom for hairstyles and exposed tattoos. The dress code should reflect the companies that come.

However he taught Network programming one semester I think he was forced into it and he really didnt put in much effort. He came to class and read the slides verbatim which was taken from another professorsemester.  I dont even think he changed the dates on the slides.   Also he kept on having to ask the class questions about the content on the slides if he didnt know about it.  I kinda felt bad because he clearly didnt want to teach it. However on the other hand I felt like I was wasting time and money taking a course where I didnt learn enough about the subject. ,RPI,dd6cswm,9,t5_2rg3u

10888134,0,t1_de2s7xe,Its unfortunate that you had that experience. Speaking from my experiences on the social side I found grad students to be quite the opposite. There are some that are highly reclusive and unsociable but many of them are mostly because they have families and lives outside of school that they focus on. For the people that are still living a college lifestyle I found grad school to be extremely open and welcoming. Generally the grad classes are small in each department leading to tight knit groups that work hard to integrate new students. Then many of the more senior grad students remember grad students often stay far longer than undergrads will have connections to the groups from other majors making for a big network of grad students that are all very friendly with each other.,RPI,de317sx,1,t5_2rg3u
