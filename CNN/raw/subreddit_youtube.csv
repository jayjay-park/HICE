720879,0,t1_cglbdzx,gt its a matter of time before Google will be forced to change this system...I have a hunch that this will not be the case if Google gets enough patronage from Big Media like Disney Sony and Viacom. Overall with the changes Google has been making to YouTube I think this is their plan. They continue to marginalize small independent content creators and promote the big independents and their ContentID system seems motivated by a desire to make big corporate media happy.Ultimately what I think Google wants is for YouTube to become an internet TV network with a few very popular high revenue independent content creators and a lot of corporate ones. Small creators and hobbyists low revenue will be pushed out by lack of promotion and content strikes.Of course this is very unfortunate for all of us because YouTube is much more than just a video streaming site its also a platform for thousands of small communities who share common interests. These small communities earn very little money for Google and so they are a financial burden.BitVid on the other hand is trying to prevent this business reality by implementing a method for users to optionally donate money to the site and to content creators directly. This will allow control to remain more in the hands of the users rather than being taken over by corporate interests.,youtube,cgm7twq,1,t5_2qh44

2194515,0,t1_clinmi7,So its clear that your playback is going poorly. In fact your HTML playback is actually not HTML  it failed as HTML and automatically tried again on Flash. This is consistent with you not being able to talk to the YouTube servers for video  however I cant see any evidence that other users on the same ISP are having issues. By taking the debug information from both your laptop and your computer its possible to dig into what the differences might be between one and the other.At this time the best advice I can have is It seems like the computer youre connecting from  but with data from the laptop I might be able to confirm or deny that.

2322410,0,t1_clyowp9,partnered channels under an mcn are split into  tiers affiliated and managed. affiliates are the most common and in my experience although this is contradicted by what uneonerz has said so i could be wrong the only real benefit for affiliates was not having the video approval process to worry about which is why a lot of your videos have been rejected. affiliates are still subject to the rd party content id system youtube has which will auto flag videos as matched third party on certain games this can become a real pain. main benefit of a managed channel is that you are not subject to the content id system however you can receive copyright strikes as usual its not a free pass but it will save you a load of hassle if you do use third party content under fair use otherwise youd have to appeal every time a vid gets flagged. ,youtube,clyri4n,2,t5_2qh44

This just often happens with my custom music playlists where videos get deleted also many get claimed via copyright strike but in that case the first view words of the video title are still there.

3661654,0,t3_31xp6i,I have noticed this also and have seen comments from others that have also noticed it.  It is very noticeable in shots with a lot of panning or with regular flowing motion such as flowing traffic on a street.  It started happening a while back.  Unfortunately I didnt make note of when it started happening but somewhere around a year ago or so I would guess.I even did a little experiment where I uploaded videos with the individual frames numbered at various rates from  to  fps this was before YouTube supported .  I then did a screen recording at  fps of the playback and looked at it.  Sure enough some of the numbered frames were missing and were not played at all.  Since my screen recording rate was more than double the rate of the videos it should have captured every numbered frame.  But frames were definitely missing.I assume it is some sort of compression that YouTubes player is doing to not play all of the frames but I dont know.  It is kind of annoying on certain videos.The YouTube help on upload formats is useless in this regard it just says to leave the frame rate as the original.  It gives no clue as what frame rates are best for those people who have a choice of what frame rate to create the content in.  Many cameras let you pick various frame rates but the YouTube help gives you no clue as to which rates might be optimal for YouTube.  In my experiments all the rates I tried had skipped frames when played back but  fps had the least.,youtube,cq9njli,2,t5_2qh44

Unfortunately the specific failure mode is one thats probably outside of YouTubes control it appears that for some users on your ISP there is very high packet loss to some of YouTubes CDN locations.You might want to try running a traceroute torsngsmk.googlevideo.comAnd seeing if you can see any packet loss. If you do see packet loss you might have better luck approaching your ISP technical support directly.

4187282,0,t1_crxjjhd,Huh thats actually much more interesting this got me thinking a bit. Making a decision about your expectation to like or dislike something based on other peoples opinions is really making a comparison of yourself to other people. You see this with people who say things like rfunny isnt funny or If rotten tomatoes hates a movie Ill probably love it. Its probably also why niche subreddits have a strong sense of community through shared interest which is validated every time you see something you end up liking get voted to the top.With youtube you cant segment likes and dislikes into subcategories to look at only the opinions of others in your tribe. So the problem isnt that lots of dislikes is a good or bad indication of how I might feel about a video its that I cant attribute those dislikes to people like me.,youtube,crxjv0r,1,t5_2qh44

4727243,0,t1_ctqds5v,I wasnt specifically speaking about you in this case  Its a general role I take on Getting yelled at on the internet.YouTube extensions absolutely break the YouTube watching experience all the time. Several times per week users post to this subreddit complaining about the Skip Ad button being missing  this is almost universally caused by bad extensions. Dozens of users have complained so far between here and the YouTube product forums that they can no longer watch YouTube because they just see a blank screen. This is caused by YouTube extensions. Finding the edge cases that cause these is just as hard for us as it is for extension developers every configuration option that exists is a better chance that something goes wrong in delivering a video to a user and the more of them there are the worse off all YouTube users are because the more time we have to spend fixing all the options rather than actually working on things people want.So lets take the new player vs. old player line. A relatively simple player layer change like this is probably say KB of data CSS JS etc. that we have to deliver. If we have to deliver two of these then we have to look at delivering twice as much data to every user every time they come to the site. I have no idea how big the player JS actually is the above is a naive assumption.Now there are  billion YouTube users who come to the site every month lets imagine that they come to YouTube an average of every  days. If this was teh case and we delivered all of these users the option to switch between players we would deliver GB of bandwidth to our users every month . petabytes of data. If we take the average incremental cost of bandwidth to our YouTube users  say around GB for mobile users  we would be costing our users an extra  million dollars per month.Extensions can do these things because theyre used by on average nobody. They are updated separately from the site they can break for days and only a small number of users are affected they can be delivered and maintained by a separate development team.Can you address each of these problems separately? Could you create a more modular experience which might work differently? Could you achieve the same goal in a different way? Absolutely. Any of these things are possible. But theyre much more costly and right now frankly YouTube drops the balls on so many things that are more important than which pixels show up when you hover a mouse over your screen to most users.I think that were doing something that most users like. The data seems to support that. Though there is a vocal set of people complaining about the way we do things  and always will be  we work really hard to try to make users happy. And dont think that Im not seeing the completely legitimate complaints in this forum thread about some of the issues weve introduced Ive got a running document about them even if I dont think anyone will listen to the feedback.But it is not as simple as Just provide two options forever! I cant imagine how that would go wrong! It would. It already has. And it will again and again.Options are bad for users  not because the users are wrong to want them but because providing them will hurt the users more over the long term. We absolutely target making our fans happy first but in order to keep our fans happy we have to keep working to make things better  not living in a past that we already know is broken.,youtube,ctqeqvf,1,t5_2qh44

4963034,0,t1_cujztem,The things you just mentioned are not infrastructure in the way its typically used in talking about running a website.Infrastructure includes  The exabytes of storage that Google uses to store videos.  The processing infrastructure for transcoding those streams.  The internet infrastructure for serving those videos to users with low rates of buffering.What youve commented on are as far as I can tell Social issues comment section legal issues Content ID policy issues mod bots I dont even know what that means since we dont have anything Id described as a mod bot.You then say Several YouTubers have received DMCA takedowns that are false.   The DMCA takedown process is a clearly laid out legal process that almost all sites will follow  including sites like Facebook Twitch Vimeo and Vessel. This is not a YouTube policy issue this is not a Content ID issue this is a US Copyright Law issue.  You then say no recourse  there is no process of the copyright policy on YouTube that Im aware of that can not be challenged by a creator whose account is otherwise in good standing. This includes disputes and appeals against Content ID claims and counternotification for DMCA notifications.    By definition your argument that several large YouTubers have been affected supports the argument that this is a a vocal minority. Thats kind of what the definition of vocal minority is a small number of people who are significantly affected and have a platform to share that information.The number of people affected by bogus claims from Content ID is very small. The number of people affected by bogus DMCA claims is probably significantly lower because DMCA claims require human action and cant be done by automation.But none of that relates to the infrastructure of YouTube.The infrastructure of YouTube is the  peering locations where we peer with thousands of individual ISPs to deliver traffic directly to them.The infrastructure of YouTube is the fact that every live stream has transcoders unlike Twitch.The infrastructure of YouTube is the ability to have DVR modes on every live stream to have full VODs of all of the videos. To be able to upload  hour videos of any resolution and see them on the website. k content. Transcoding into VP so that people can actually watch it over the crappy internet in the world.Infrastructure is the HTML player the mobile client on Android the mobile client on iOS the AppleTV client the Xbox client the PS client the fact that YouTube is everywhere.These are the things that are infrastructure. And if you make an argument with me that Twitchs infrastructure competes with YouTubes... well I think you underestimate the size of YouTubes infrastructure.,youtube,cuk4o0j,1,t5_2qh44

Knowing this you can atleast choose for which account you want the search history to be saved.Step  go to your phones account settings.Delete the Google account that is currently saving search history from your phone.Step  now delete Youtube cache files and data.Your youtube application will now set your phones second google account as the main one automatically. And search history will start saving.It shouldnt matter if you have multiple youtube channels connected to that one specific google account either they now all share the same history on your phone.You can now add the account you deleted again.  Right now both account work and saves history for me although I have a feeling the newly added one is just temporary.

5470525,0,t3_3pzwx0,Just to cut some of the common misconceptions out of the way  Most creators  those under the largest YouTube partnership program the simple AdSense program  were automatically changed to the new terms back in April effective in June. This applies to me and probably most people here.  As the article says  of the partners theyre talking about... are also signed.  Most of the remainder are probably just cases where these are people who signed a deal with YouTube in the past and have since stopped using YouTube arent responding to emails etc.The choice to hide content is not about being coercive its simply about providing a consistent adsfree experience for a service with no ads. Otherwise the press cycle would have gone like thisYouTube launches new subscription service but there are some videos you can watch that still have ads!links to crappy p video uploaded in  from a channel that stopped updating in  as a demonstration on how YouTube is terrible.I havent seen anyone who understands these terms seriously argue that the Red revenue will be a bad deal for creators. The numbers people are throwing around seem to suggest that this will be a break even for creators if not better I dont know why people would want to not sign the deals and Ive seen the same statement from almost all informed creators.,youtube,cwawt6w,3,t5_2qh44

5540010,0,t1_cwjpje2,Okay its all good man.  Typically linking to your own stuff or creating an account to promote your own stuff is frowned upon.  You only have  submissions and theyre both to your site.  Reddit isnt an advertising platform.  I come here for organic discussions from plain users with nothing to gain from it.  If someone else finds your content and wants to share it then thats awesome.  not just a different user name I mean someone other than youfriendsfamilygtFeel free to post links to your own content within reason. But if thats all you ever post or it always seems to get voted down take a good hard look in the mirror  you just might be a spammer. A widely used rule of thumb is the  ratio i.e. only  out of every  of your submissions should be your own content.If you were a member for  years and linked to your own blog rarely thats a different story and I think thats whats encouraged. ,youtube,cwjs9gw,3,t5_2qh44

Of which it would take several days longer than the time until your assignment is done.As for whether it classes as fair use its a bit wishy washy.If its transformative doesnt hinder the artists image and  or  other things which dont come to mind at this present time then you can claim fair use.If you upload it it might be taken down however the worst that could happen is a Copyright strike.

I personally wouldnt because once you hit  subs YouTube will give you a custom URL. .comuserCresentDaemonzProd was before I hit  then .comcHitpoints was after . The thing is your URL will always be the same as the one you chose but it will be masked as YouTube.comc instead of YouTube.comuser.

6544806,0,t1_czw8mh8,I think that youre wrong on what advertisers look for.If you look at the Google Preferred program    these are package deals of content sold to advertisers and having checked the content in these  theyre all higher production value content. To an advertiser especially one moving over from TV where ad spend is currently way higher it seems that these creators are compelling to them. Im not going to guess why I dont understand advertising in the slightest. One thing I do know from personal experience is that the RPM in views is much higher in content with a broader audience  and with gamingonly content you run into limitations on how much people are willing to spend. This ad program must have taken a ton of money to put together I would hope that its paying for itself because otherwise I wouldnt expect them to keep doing it.This is of course generally straightforward to understand broader market  more advertisers bidding on the same space  higher revenue for Creators and in the end for YouTube. So appeal to a broad audience rather than a high number of niche viewers can be better for overall revenue and higher production values draw broader audience.As a small creator I disagree with the idea that YouTube is pushing people like that out. Ive made a few grand from my viral video I continue to make about thousand views on monetized content and in the livestreaming space the addition of YouTube Red is drastically increasing my revenue. The  of my views that are YouTube Red on my livestream for example generate  of my advertisingrelated revenue. Granted the money is still tiny  but instead of getting  cents like I do from ads out of my  view I get more like  cents per stream.In addition the rollout of Fan Funding  and integration into the live streaming interface on YTG  has significantly increased my revenue generated from YouTube Ive gotten about  in ad revenue and about  in donations from users through the YouTube Fan Funding mechanism. Add in other efforts like Sponsorships basically like Twitch Subscribers where you pay a recurring fee and I think that its reasonable to say that YouTube is  in my personal experience as a small creator rather than YouTube employee this is heading in a better direction than I have seen in the past.,youtube,czwab4h,1,t5_2qh44

6802300,0,t1_d0moyem,The problem here is twofold  Just because something is listed as CClicensed doesnt mean that it actually is. For example I could download the latest Marvel trailer drop it on my website and slap a label that says CC licensed on it and if you tried to use it you would still get claims.  But if the person making the claim is the person from whom you got the license  in the case of the OP here if it was actually NCS making the claims  you would absolutely be in the right to dispute with I have a license and the person making those claims would be wrong.   If the person releasing under a CC license is the one putting it in Content ID thats in violation of YouTubes policies on Content ID which say The following examples are ineligible for use in or as a reference Content released under Creative Commons or similar freeopen licensesSo yeah the real question is who made the claims? The artist  or their representative  who put them up on Soundcloud? Or were those SoundCloud files remixes or something and the original creator was the one who made the claims?So now Ill go to your video and we can go through that.  You got a bunch of claims. We can see them. Cool. They seem like theyre likely on behalf of the artist and the artists wasnt incorporating some other artists content or anything like that. This seems like a solid case.  You actually pulled up a song that you didnt get a claim on in order to demonstrate that the claimed content was CC licensed. Not all of the Ramses B tracks are for example  is not.   But the first claim you got was for New Horizons which is listed that way    You say in your video theres a limitation on number of ongoing disputes. That isnt actually true. You can dispute as many things as you like  and in this case you definitely should as you have a license. Well you should check each of the tracks but you say youve done that so thats fine. Appeals have a limitation but hopefully this wouldnt get to the appeal process.  I agree with your assessment  Ramses B does not have the right to put this track. New Horizons is a bad reference and should not be in Content ID.  But CD Baby isnt really the person in the wrong here Ramses B gave them this content to put into Content ID and YouTube is just acting as a middleman. The long and short is this artist did the wrong thing.  But then you say But its not worth it to file the dispute. But that is the only way that the claimant can be aware they did something wrong. Someone at CD Baby has to look at your claims when you dispute them it might be that if you provided details they would even prevent these songs from making more claims in the future! Having talked to people who run YouTube CMS systems this is an option when they review claims the claimant can release the claim and clear the reference material so it doesnt make new claims. This is the best way to communicate the CD Baby that something is wrong!   You also say If they refute my dispute then I have to take them to court. That hasnt been true since . Instead what happens if they refute your dispute is that you can then appeal and if they reinstate their claim again via a DMCA takedown you can then counternotify that claim meaning your content goes back up unless they take you to court.  You then say YouTube doesnt have anybody looking at these things. YouTube says otherwise as do major MCNS    YouTube takes action to address cases of abuse and error in the Content ID system. These include disabling specific reference files or segments of reference files and releasing all associated claims requiring manual review for certain categories of references disabling Content ID or even terminating YouTube partnership. Help Center     This was confirmed via a presentation at VidCon by Rian Bosak the CMS manager for the largest MCN on YouTube Fullscreen who basically said Make false claims at your own risk. YouTube does kick people out of Content ID for making these mistakes.  This whole thing sucks but by not disputing these  at least Im assuming you didnt since you deleted the video  you have abandoned the best tool you had to communicate these claims are incorrect to the claiming party. If you dont do this how can they know that theyre doing something wrong? Ramses B came to CD Baby and said Hey heres my CD go manage it for me. They followed his instructions and they were wrong but how can they know?  And in the end I put this right back on the Artist He made a representation  presumably to his label and through them to CD Baby  that he had no ability to make that this was an exclusive deal. That was not cool. He should follow up with CD Baby  presumably still through his label  and clarify that this is not acceptable because he licenses this content under Creative Commons.  Other artists who have had this problem and reached out to CD Baby have gotten quick responses  within days  with all claims released and the content removed from Content ID. But unless someone tells CD Baby  through disputes or through direct communication to them  that something is wrong the problem wont get better.,youtube,d0nc0vq,3,t5_2qh44

This may be surprising to you but even users who are paying for Mbps internet often dont actually have Mbps of connectivity to YouTube. So we pick bandwidth limits that allow us to make most videos work and some videos that are high motion high texture or otherwise require more bits run into limitations.But none of that should explain random behavior like this where the same video sometimes works and sometimes doesnt.

Subsub tends to lead to a lot of empty subs  whats the point having that number high if the views stay low?With the other  they often tend to get reversed as soon as YouTube notices anyway. I dont think its really worth the hassle. Again it comes back to the fact that lets say you viewbotted and gained  views. Do you now get to sit back and go awesome. Ive made it. I got actual views amount of views!? Not really because you didnt. You know you didnt. Either it gets reversed or you manage to convince yourself that What Im doing is working! I got actual views views! Everything is fine! and youll never work out whats not working.With regards to selfadvertising its much less of a hard no and more of a it really depends how you do it.Getting involved with a community and engaging with people can be a good way to have your content brought up organically. If someone asks if you have a channel after youve given them some adviceasked a questionmentioned your channel in a relevant way you can introduce yourself to new people quite naturally. Engaging with other people in your area on Twitter or in their video comments in a genuine way not a I LOVE YOUR VID CHECK OUT MY CHANNEL way can also be beneficial. One of the things we found helpful was whenever we had a problem that a similar channel seemed to have solvedgotten past  we just asked them about it.You dont have to go in saying check out my channel you can say hey I noticed youre doing XYZ or hey so I was wondering how you managed to.... Youll be surprised how helpful others will be and theyre more likely to check out your channel if youre not just saying GENERIC COMMENT. CHECK ME OUT or posting CHECK OUT MY VIDEO in  vaguely related subreddits. I know from experience that anyone that takes a genuine interest in our channel is more likely to have us see what theyre about and check them out than someone that puts something really generic and copy pasted.,youtube,d6s5n71,3,t5_2qh44

9077671,0,t1_d82yz57,I have but the policy hasnt ever been different. Its just published now rather than being internal only.I understand that this is a frustrating policy to some. Id say that judging a policy by its guidelines rather than its implementation is kind of silly. I remember a book that I got in nd grade Donkeys cant sleep in Bathtubs It listed hundreds of laws that were technically on the books for all kinds of silly reasons but not enforced. I think the YouTube Advertiser Friendly guidelines are most often like that. There are certainly some topics that are hard to make content about but the boogeyman of You Cant Swear On YouTube! Is a completely false narrative based on paranoia not on reality.Anyway I look forward to more YouTube competition! Competition helps keep us on our toes. But I think that thinking of these policies as new is misleading theyve always been there theyve always had a small effect lt of videos effected and they will always limit some types of content from being on the platform.,youtube,d82zlwg,2,t5_2qh44

9618594,0,t1_d9ymp05, per  is pretty high even for this holiday season where advertisers spend more money.  It is more closer to  per  views.  Of course that only applies to monetizable views meaning not every view on a video is monetizable.  You are correct though there are outside Youtube ways to earn money such as brand deals paid promotion donations ect...  Also running a site off Youtube can help.  Having affiliate links on said site works too.  Its difficult to make youtube a living as you have to really treat it as business and not a lifestyle.  I do Youtube as purely as a hobby and make a little money at it to offset the cost of producing the videos and I get to keep a little bit after that.  Most people have to have a nd job to pay the rentmortgage until they can build enough of a following to support it solely however that is very risky as online video is ever changing.,youtube,d9you24,3,t5_2qh44

10084928,0,t3_4zgpv8,Just offering a different perspective I have a newer channel and Id gladly trade subs just to hit the  mark so I can have a short url. Its not because I dont want to work for it want to look more important want money or dont understand that those subs would have little to no value in terms of loyalty and growth. Its because the url structure bothers me and it only takes  subs to change it.   I wasnt thinking about subs at all otherwise until I realized I need  of them to do something that on other platforms is available right out of the gate. And no I wont feel more accomplished if I reach that number naturally because my fulfillment comes from my content not from the number of subs Im able to garner from it.    If trading allows me to hit that arbitrary benchmark so I can quickly brand my url to match everything else great. Anything beyond that Id prefer be people who subscribed because they like my channel but functional access to that one basic feature matters more to me than how I get it.,youtube,dbm31t5,1,t5_2qh44

You probably have an explanation like that in the video in the Video Manager if not an outright strike.If you see people with other videos up its not because of a trick or anything they did to get around it. Sometimes the copyright holders have their audiovisual fingerprint in the system sometimes they dont. Sometimes they find it manually.

10155904,0,t3_5lfbem,Ok. To gain exposure is easy. You have to do the following. Be very broad in your tags. This is the only thing Youtube will sort your video by. If you write alot of words that refrences your video topic then you are more likely to get seen.. Make high quality. Todays Youtube is about watched minutes. And that requires you to really make each video special. If you make the same type of video like everyone else then people are very unlikely to subscribe.. Upload as frequently as possible and stay systematic about it. A video a day is ideal but a video a week can be okay. Your growth will be different depending on your content and people rarely get extremely popular over night these days. Just keep at it and adapt to what people watch the most.,youtube,dbv883u,2,t5_2qh44

11359692,0,t3_61zvz8,Until they change the ad system. The current system favors youtube and youtubers. Company place bids for ads by telling youtube their budget but they dont have a say with who they want to advertise on. Companies can specify their target audience children adults age group etc to make it more specific but they cant choose the youtuber. This benefits new youtubers as well as those who drop f bombs every other word. Can youtube allow advertisers to only place their ads on certain youtubers? yes it can but only for top youtubers and its more expensive. Think about it from the companies perspective do you want to advertise on youtubers who keep dropping f bombs and makes jokes that go too far? im  and even i dont like listening to rant videos with cussing every other word.

Why did those  account for a majority of your revenue? Because they were serving more expensive ads. Who pays for the most expensive ads on YouTube and is constantly bidding high in ad auctions for them? Big companies and ad agencies.Who is scared of YouTube and pulled out? Big companies and ad agencies.Its important to remember the ads are bought in an auction style fashion the less big bidders and less competition between bidders means the prices for ads go way down and the amount paid to creators goes down with it. This is what happened to the  most likely the other  were not effected this way because advertisers probably arent bidding for them and driving the price up like they were on those .Now it seems that no one is bidding on them and YouTube hasnt replaced them yet with something else.,youtube,dggdpxx,1,t5_2qh44
