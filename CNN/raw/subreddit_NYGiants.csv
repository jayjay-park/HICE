450707,0,t1_cfrhrw2,ampampamp Swinging gate American football sfw gtThe Swinging Gate is an unorthodox setpiece play in American football executed in either the offensive or specialteams sections of play. It is unusual in that the offensive line with the exception of the center will line up to one side of the field leaving the quarterback and running back unprotected on the other. Its goal is to disconcert a defensive front in order to allow a quick screen pass to a wide receiver with six blockers or to allow a short run by the running back. Surprise is the main goal of the play and it is not typically run outside of shortyardage situations. It is not often found in the NFL due to the danger of a quarterback injury. In a Wild Card playoff game on January   against the San Diego Chargers the Tennessee Titans lined up in the Swinging Gate formation on their first play from scrimmage. Tennessee quarterback Vince Young threw an incomplete pass on the play. In a December   game between the Washington Redskins and the New York Giants the Redskins attempted this play with Hunter Smith the punter at quarterback which resulted in an interceptiongtgtImage iInteresting Trick play | Duluth Minnesota | s | List of AfricanAmerican firsts Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcfrhso oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecfrhso.

572862,0,t3_20owlq,You are being cynic..How are these signings not justified? Ryan Mundy left and we needed to fill that void so Demps was brought in. It is a nice addition that he can also return kicks. David Wilson was our only return guy and when he went down last year. It was left to Mike Cox and he didnt do very well. David Wilson also had spinal fusion surgery so I dont think Giants want him to take unnecessary hits from kickoffs. Thus Holliday was brought in.Speaking of running backs before the signing of Jennings we did not have a number  back. Andre Brown is injury prone and David Wilson had neck surgery. Hillis isnt an every down back. Jennings did quite well last season avg  yards a carry when he was a starting subbing in for the injured McFadden. Bringing him in fills the hole at the RB position.The NFC East is a division that has incredibly fast number  receivers. Djax Dez Garcon. We need a guy that can actually keep up with them. DRC has the ability to match speeds and cover for extended yards. DRC took less money to join the Giants so that says something. And his lack of effort wont be tolerated by Coughlin.Im pretty sure the Giants arent done signing players. They brought in Walton to play Center but I think theres more to it. Also Jermicheal Finley had the horrific neck injury last season. Its too much of a risk to bring him in to be the starter at TE. Im certain the Giants will get a TE through the draft as they want to stop signing TEs to fill the void for the season and get a guy that plays long term and develops.Lastly NFL contracts arent guaranteed. The only part that is guaranteed money. Ok im done here.,NYGiants,cg5e0wc,10,t5_2ruqw

Most of the people you normally hear about in such conversations Like Ray Guy Dave Jennings or Reggie Roby were not expected to kick to a spot. It really wasnt until the mids that directional kicking became the norm. Our first directional punter was Mike Horan and I remember being worried that it would result in a lot of shanks. I may have listened to John Madden to much back then. I certainly cant think of a better directional punter than Feagles. EDIT This is what he says about that With directional punting I think I got ahead of the game and was able to really define how to do that Feagles said during a news conference at the teams headquarters.

And while were on the subject of failure I think Jerry Reese has been a borderline terrible GM in his tenure here the one positive about having a bad season is he will finally be fired hopefully though this would likely mean the end of TC as well.On the other hand youre being a pessimist. You call us all homers well go to ANY other teams sub and youll see the same level of homerism. Predicting your team to have a decent record isnt blatant homerism when they have the potential to be there. Do I think well get the WC spot? No but Im not going to attack anybody who does. Ths signs are a joke nobody here seriously believes we are destined to win this year because of some coincidental bullshit.gt JPP has done nothing but talk every offseasonNot true. Before  he said he wasnt feeling . Now he says he is. So now hes talking. I dont necessarily agree with it but JPP is a lot more confident this year than lastgt Our first round pick WR is now injuredIts a god damn strained hamstring he didnt tear his fucking ACL or anything. Hold the kid out of camp hold him out of the preseason hell even hold him out of the first couple games if you have to. It will hinder his development this year sure but Id rather that than him playing at  all year and possibly making the injury worse.gt Pugh came off an average yearPugh was a top  RT for the seocnd half of the season. If your reasoning for Beatty being bad is that he sucked last year then why cant you assume Pugh will be good again this year? He was not average especially when you factor in that he was improving all year and by s end had the look of a franchise RTgt Im not trying to be a downerYes you are. You are assuming everybody will play to the lowest level possible and nothing will go right for us. Youre calling us spoiled children like youre high and mighty for shitting on your own team. And shitting on its fans do you really think most of us would jump ship if the team played poorly? Maybe YOU should jump ship then because you seem to be very cynical towards your team and its fanbase.Of course when I clicked your username I realized that youre an ignorant asshole sitting at  karma who never really contributed anything so this is probably just  a moot point anyway,NYGiants,cj7ldpk,9,t5_2ruqw

We need to get Foles running as much as possible and drive him out of the pocket.  Get him uncomfortable in the pocket and force him to make some bad throws.The offense cannot drop passes like it has been. Boykin is one of the best slot corners in the game and when Cruz gets his opportunities against him if Boykin plays he has to make the most of it. Rueben needs to make his plays as well. He needs to stop make his mistakes that could end up costing the team. Dre Dre needs to barrel through and bulldoze anyone that gets in his way like he knows how to.

2267995,0,t1_cls0er7,Did you read what I wrote. If Eli has to move the chains solely by himself were not going to do anything to anyone. I think Eli caps out at  yards perhaps much worse if your pass rush gets online and I think it will get ugly if the running game doesnt get online. BUT THE WHOLE POINT IM TRYING TO MAKE IS THAT OUR RUNNING GAME NEEDS TO GET ONLINE FOR US TO WIN AND WILL SET THE TONE FOR THE ENTIRE GIANTS OFFENSE.Were not going to beat you through the air but were going to do some damage well give you some damage.  yards sounds about right for Eli in this offense if were moving the ball on you on the ground. Coupled with  yards of rushing offense and winning the turnover battle means we win the game.If we put up a  yard rushing day we might as well not even show up.People think that getting to Eli wins games. I does. But you cant get to Eli if were going to run the ball every down and your not going to stop it. Stop the run then pressure Eli then beat the Giants. Thats how it goes. The Eagles and Lions did that with gusto. Everyone else struggled and had to win the turnover battle to win the game or lost catastrophically.,NYGiants,cls1lbk,1,t5_2ruqw

2564105,0,t1_cmt6sxh,Giants are adamant in picking best player available and if they think Amari is a generational talent at WR then why not? Cruz is no guarantee to come back as a  WR and pairing Cooper with OBJ could be a WR duo like never seen before. Looking at some of the best WR duos in the league and even in NFL history you usually have an older veteran WR and a young stud on the other end or at the very least theyre a few years a part. e.g. CarterMoss BruceHolt HarrisonWayne whiteJulio MarshallJeffrey. Having Odell and Amari to start the season next year would be insane and would cancel out any kind of double coverage for years. There are bigger needs obviously but if the Giants pick up a FA or two to fill our oline hole or picking one up in the nd or rd could be a good strategy in fixing our line. I have confidence that even if we just resign our guys on defense and not make any big moves on that end and simply pick up a good DC we could be a good defense. ,NYGiants,cmt9lu3,4,t5_2ruqw

3225062,0,t3_2x1jqz,Price estimates are a bit off.  Guys like Jernigan Stevie Brown and J. Williams arent going to command more than the League minimum.  Zack Bowman is on the outs with the coaching staff.  They benched him in favor of Chyckie Brown late in the season because of effortattitude issues.  Stars are allowed to make the occasional business decision.  Minsalary vets are not.  I doubt that we see him back.  Franklin is a reasonable target.  Im not especially interested in Bulaga or Iupati for varying resons.  As others have mentioned McCourty aint leaving NE.  FS is the biggest pure hole on this roster right now they have literally nobody under contract who projects as a deepcover guy so a free agent acquisition there is probably one of the teams highest priorities.  Someone like Darian Stewart from the Ravens or Ron Parker from the Chiefs is a more likely target.I wouldnt underestimate DE as a position where theyd like to add a veteran either.  And no it wont be Greg Hardy.  Ayers is likely penciled in as the starter opposite PierrePaul but when have the Giants ever been happy with having only  established DEs?  Moore has done little to show that hes ready for more responsibility and Wynn is probably best cast as a DaveTollefsontype allhustle deep backup and ST guy.  One possible guy who is taking in more cash than his performance merits cutultimatum that nobody here wants to talk about is Steve Weatherford.

Youve represented the Giants fanbase horribly as a whiny little brat.  I dont care enough to continue this any longer so go right ahead and downvote away and say whatever else youd like which will likely be when was the last time your team won a championship? Lulz. At least my team is currently competitive and fun to watch and most importantly beating your team over and over and over and over. If you want to compare histories go right ahead but thats all youve had all day.

My morning started with a visit to see my newborn baby girl JJ at the hospital in San Diego. I left the hospital to catch a flight to Newark to join my team today for OTA practices. This is where it gets crazy. All flights into Newark were cancelled due to thunderstorms so my flight had to reroute to DC. We didnt land til pm. It was already too late to train or bus to NJ so I rented a car so I dont miss practice today.  hours into my trip at am I run into a massive body of water on the NJ turnpike I hydroplane slam into the median get blasted in the face by the air bags. My rental is totaled and I walked out without a scratch. I am feeling so incredibly blessed. Not only has God given my family and I a beautiful healthy  pound baby girl. He sent his guardian angels to keep my car from flipping and possibly dying. So I call  and the finest Highway Patrol in America the NJ State Police come to the rescue and offer me a ride back to Hoboken. These guys didnt do it because they were football fans they didnt even know who I was or what I do. Im super proud to have always been a supporter of the NYNJ Police and Fire Departments. So I want to give a GIANT thank you to Officer Adam Brozek and his partner Officer Kim Smith for coming to my aid in my time of need and going that extra step further for driving me  miles home. God saved me and the NJ State Troopers delivered me. Now Im home shaking like a leaf trying to pack my bag to go to practice. Im so thankful to even be walking right now.

Give a mediocre QB elite pass protection and a few track star receivers and he looks like Joe Montana.  On the other hand surround a top athlete with a garbage team and a lazy playbook and you probably wont even remember his name.  This isnt basketball its not baseball.

Hes not running any advanced plays or packages just simple timing routes to get the receivers and Eli on the same page.. Test out players. Very very often youll see odd things like the  RB getting the bulk of the carries over the perceived  RB. Hes a big fan of trying to get their depth players ndrdth string into the rotation with the s so he can see if they really could have any value during the season. So all in all I try not to read into the preseason at all. The fact that Williams only had  carries doesnt really tell me much. Honestly Id probably read more into the beat writers saying that Williams has been seeing a lot of passes in practice. Its very possible that Coughlin is feeling good about where Williams is at right now but not  sure about Jennings at the moment. Theres not a ton to see from a guy like Williams you give him the ball and tell him which side to run to hes going to get you whats blocked and maybe rumble for an extra yard or two. Hes a Coughlin RB through and through. Same concept Im not reading a ton into the awful catch percentage Beckham has had this preseason. Theyre practicing timing now so they dont have these issues in the season. Hes also unlikely to be running at  speed or willing to give up his body for a pass like he will do on every down mid season. Well have a better idea how this season will go down within  minutes of Week  against Dallas than we have after  quarters of preseason football. ,NYGiants,culriyn,7,t5_2ruqw

Didnt think wed keep Preston Parker but he does offer KRPR insurance in case Dwayne Harris goes down. Glad Darkwa got a spot. Same with Trevin Wade.

Theres a big difference in playcalling and comfort level from the  versus from the  not to mention the pure yardage difference which can eat their time and force onedimensional playcalling.

Also there was no real advantage to the field goal.  If they score a TD they win regardless if were up  or . If theyre down  and settle for a FG then worst case we go to OT.

He had a rough game last week mostly because in my opinion Pugh want there.Now...the important thing. IM NOT WORRIED!! I honestly believe he has the makings of a fantastic LT. I dont think hes playing any worse than any other big name draft pick LTRT players over the past  years. And I think hell come out ahead of all of them.  Hes a natural run blocker Hes a manchild with the strength of a guy  years older than him Hes a student of the game He has a huge desire to get betterAll of these things make me believe that Flowers will be a great player.

Tiki is gone Giants finish season  almost beat Pats finally end undefeated run in SuperBowl.  a MIRACULOUS victory.   team on high from SB we are rolling  Plax shoots leg team cant recover offensively go  to end season.  Then we lose AGAIN to Philadelphia  even though we were st seed.   team is whatever blob of boring  season.   start  like before then finish first half . YAY.   by week  and then the infamous Matt Dodge punt vs Philadelphia.  no playoffs   start season  only to fall back to  later.  finish  and make another miraculous superbowl run vs. NE.  I firmly believe that if the SF did not beat the Saints and we had to play New Orleans this never would have happened.  They always seemed to have our number and Drew Brees loved carving us up.  while watching that game I cheered for SF like never before and hope to never have to.  I think everyone knew we could beat GB.   start season  jeez what a trend then finish season .  Remember completely COLLAPSING in last  weeks of the season to Baltimore and Atlanta?   started season ........ uwotm?... finished  which was respectable for how they started but ultimately a lost season.   an unspectacular crappy season of .   which brings us to today.  another season of potentially finishing  where a plethora of decisions have plagued the team on game days.TC is  and wont be around forever we are pissing away the last years of a franchise quarterbacks years for what?  to keep a guy around for another year or two or ?  when is the HC accountable?  others have been fire for less even if they were successful previouslyThere have been TOO MANY games and seasons wehre this team is a freaking no show.  too many times I have seen players being played out of position for who the hell  knows why and other personell decisions that certain guys play when it is absolutely obvious that they should never be near a football field.

Arent you tired of seeing the same damn thing year in and year out no new messgae the same down trodden garbage that is just inexcusable.  I cant stomach one more game let alone another season of the same shit. I am in no way excusing our GM because he has failed miserably as well.  he takes too many risks on players with injury histories and for some reason thinks you can plug dog shit into the LB position and everything will work out fine.  Hhhmm ask Luke Kuechly what he thinks about that.the players can LIKE TC but honestly who gives a shit your job is about results and frankly has failed miserably to produce them.

The fact that we are    and in the division race is pretty good for a teamHC that has worked with HasslebeckWhitehurst for the past what  weeks? And before that Hasslebeck played  games. Half our season has been without the main piece of the offence and its because of our oline. Despite our horrific oline Pep insisted we run deep    step drop passes multiple times per drive even when LuckHassCBJ didnt have the time in the backfield.

6712991,0,t1_d0cjlci,Id disagree on Billings not being able to rush the passer. The kid is ungodly strong. Its fucking scary how strong he is and hes also wickedly fast at least on tape. Im not sure what hell end up running in the  but as the saying goes Theres game speed and clocked speed. Theyre not the same thing. All I know is Billings has an extremely quick twothree step closing speed. That said Billings is a nightmare when it comes to mechanics. Hes essentially gotten himself into being a st round NFL talent on pure physical prowess. He has no fucking idea what hes doing with his hands or his feet. He just bullies people. He wont be able to do that as much at the NFL level. But remember the same was true for JPP coming out of college as well. The fact is Billings was an unstoppable force for Baylor with no idea how to even play the position. Get him a good coach who knows how to coach D Linemen like oh I dont know maybe if we could get Spags back on the team joke obviously? I really think Billings could be one of the best defensive lineman in this draft. Just wait for his combine production something tells me hes going to put up Aaron Donald like numbers. Likely a bit less on the vert and broad but more on the bench. I think hell come very close to Donalds  and cone though.

6952903,0,t1_d149omw,Youre also discounting the fact that we had three of our starting five OL injured. Our starting LT missed the entire year with a tore pec which caused us to thrust our rookie RT into the LT role and start Marshall Newhouse at RT the rest of the season. Ereck Flowers played the second half of the season with a high ankle sprain that never quite healed fully. Geoff Schwartz went down for  games as well. If the Cowboys had John Jerry and Marshall Newhouse starting on the line theyd be middle of the road in the NFL as well. All that said...I already went over the fact that the Giants allowed fewer sacks than the Cowboys. The Giants allowed  QB hits last year the Cowboys allowed . Both good for Top  in the league. When teams like the Browns and Titans allowed in the  range the Cowboys and Giants were roughly even in this category. I cant find any real information on QB Hurries. If you have the numbers Id love to see them I believe theyre only accessible with PFF Premium Stats which they dont sell to the general public anymore. I can leave you with this howeverThe Giants allowed  QB hits and  sacks on  passing attempts. For an average pressure  of around . The Cowboys allowed  QB hits and  sacks on  passing attempts. For an average pressure  of around . So unless you can find the hurries numbers and show me that the Giants had like twice as many hurries allowed as the Cowboys?

If Eli comes out this season his first away from Coughlin and puts the team on his back and has a historically great season? Its going to make people wonder did Coughlin hold him back his whole career? Could this be the Eli weve always deserves but never saw? I think thats the point the guy is getting at if he has another up and down season it will confirm that Eli is a streaky QB. But if he has an amazing season it will lend credence to the theory that Gilbride and Coughlin were holding him back from greatness in the regular season always playing it safe and never lending him the freedom to be as good as he could be. The article isnt saying hes not a HoF. But he has a chance in these final years of his career to possibly change everyones opinion of him and put himself in the greats conversation by putting up a few fantastic seasons to close his career. To cement himself as an unquestionable first ballot HoFer. ,NYGiants,d37f3az,4,t5_2ruqw

8860788,0,t1_d7cu706,Ive always wanted us to draft high or get a big money LB but its definitely a philosophy issue with Reese and idk if I can disagree. When questioned about it a few years ago he said we won a super bowl with a guy who was teaching gym class the first half of the season and started through the playoffs all hail chase Blackburn But every time I hear that it restores faith. I think we have best group of LB in years and was actually happy with Brinkley cut. Shows me Mac doesnt play favorites as others have said above brink doesnt bring anything to the defense the other LB dont possess. Kennard shep Robinson Castillas are all better in coverage and BJ is a tackling machine on run downs....

I was reluctant to post because in the UK new fans dont really exist if you understand. In football soccer most fans in the top flight know all about each other already so it was daunting for me getting into the NFL but im really touched that you would be so kind. Thank you!

If Bradford has to make long throws to disrupt our formation he might get in trouble especially if Apple and DRC are back.On the flipside our offense could excel against Minnesota because they dont have  solid corners to run a real nickeldime formation. Sure they will feast on our OL but if we can focus on running  personnel and mix shortlong throws we could take minnesota away.Green bay isnt that worrisome. Aaron Rodgers may still be amazing to good but their defense sucks especially without Sam Shields who I assume is still under concussion protocol iirc.

If we fall behind early we will probably look to lean on the passing game more.We do prefer to play a pretty conservative ball control  time of possession game so if we take an early lead you can expect to see us try to keep it on the ground unless we need to pass to keep the drive alive.,NYGiants,d864ciz,21,t5_2ruqw

One thing is for sure tho if something isnt done about fucking Wade Rogers and Flacco are gonna eat big time.  As for why our receivers cant get open im drawing a blank.  Looked to me like the Viks were just selling out against the deep ball on every play as its our biggest threat.  Not sure if we can scheme them open more or what but its tough with Jennings and Vereen out.  The Vereen loss really hurts makes our offence that much less dynamic.

9234661,0,t1_d8m74b2,Our closeness in these game is a mirage. The Packers easily could have and in my opinion should have put up  on us. We got bailed out a number of times by a select few people making great plays like jackrabbit or keenan robinson both of whom had at least  huge plays in high pressure situations. In  games we are averaging  fgs against us. We have allowed the most field goals out of anyone. And you know it is better to allow fgs than tds but we shouldnt be in so many fg situations anyways. We are middle of the pack in punts forced at  most is  and least is  but our turnover differential is abysmal at bottom  in the league and the teams right above us have a  while we are at  and only  forced turnovers  being jackrabbits  picks last night. People thought turnovers would be a strong point for us. We are th in terms of yards allowed and th in points against. We are last in the league in sacks which people thought would be a strong point for us. And our defense is the BRIGHT part of the team right now.Our offense is abysmal. We are now tth for yards gained but th in points scored. The team is incapable of putting up points and it starts with eli. He has looked awful. And you can blame whoever you want for it the oline for giving up pressures odell being a headcase at times whatever. In the end he is missing throws and he needs to rectify it. We are also th in the league in rushing yards. No one is scared of our runningbacks. Not when jennings is playing. Not when darkwa is playing not when vereen was in perkins or rainey. Its all the same. No one fears our running game. We are st in ypc.Not to mention the lack of discipline and obvious coaching flaws. I dont think anyone thought Mac would be a stud at all and for sure not right away. But people expected more especially when hes calling the plays and the offense is playing the way it is. I wanted coughlin gone for years but he did have the teams respect. Right now Mac is failing to get that respect and failing to keep his team disciplined. Any shitty team can be graceful winning. A disciplined team can take losses gracefully too and we are not doing that right now. We have flags on every other play players shoving reporters in the locker room and had a player fighting a kicking net. A team like this shouldnt win games. You say we could have been  or even . I say that more feasible than that would have been this team going . We won two games in the last moments possible lost  the same way and lost two games we really had no business being in. Yeah  was possible but  looks a lot more realistic than that from where Im standing.The team is struggling and drowning. And they have a lot of work to do if they want a shot at success this year.

9353786,0,t3_58mjjg,Another disturbing part of this aside from the obvious disturbance associated with the abhorrent behavior of Josh Brown is that this is now the second domestic violence offense which had a light punishment from the NFL that become a bigger deal when more information was made public.  From what Ive read Josh Brown admitted to everything to the NFL and the Giants.  The punishment was determined to be  game.  He was welcomed back to the Giants.  Then this letter becomes public and the league is looking into the matter further and the Giants have signed a new kicker but as of now still havent cut Brown.  Just like the Ray Rice case it seems the only thing that has changed is that information became public.  Reports show that the NFL had full knowledge of the fact that serious domestic violence occurred with both Ray Rice and Josh Brown.  This suggests that the NFL and its teams care more about their image than they do about domestic violence.  If domestic violence was really the issue they claim it to be the punishments doled out up front would match what happens when more information becomes public.  Its upsetting that the NFL only really care about domestic violence when it hurts their image. If its occurring out of the publics view it appears that they dont mind as much.  That is one of the big problems I see with how this was all handled.,NYGiants,d91nqzw,11,t5_2ruqw

I dont need that.  I dont need a degree in astrophysics to tell you the suns going to rise tomorrow because the Earth is rotating while orbiting the sun.  And I dont need to be a pilot to realize that since the planes on fucking fire and everybodys screaming somethings fucked up.You know what I do have instead?  Empirical evidence.  I have Prince Amukamara Marvin Austin Jerell Jernigan David Wilson Reuben Randle Jayron Hosley Damontre Moore Ereck Flowers Landon Collins Eli Apple Darian Thompson James Brewer Adrienne Robinson Brandon Mosley Nat Berhe Cooper TaylorYou know what else Ive got?  A free agent horrorshow to match Shane Vereen Rashad Jennings JD Walton Dwayne Harris Geoff SchwartzBut dont forget the Pice De Rsistance of dumb free agent contracts the Alpha and the Omega of injury risks the platonic ideal of What the FUCKING Fuck was Reese thinking Jon BeasonJon Beason.  Lets all stop for a moment and stare in gaping openmouthed horror at the idiot deal Jon Beason was offered after mustering all of one measly season of relative health.  Lets all pour out a little bit of beer from our bottles in memory of the .M of dead money that Beason is still counting towards against our cap.But dont think on it too hard.  Being a Giants fan and contemplating too long the madness that was the Jon Beason contract is like staring at the ark of the covenantI dont think that all of these guys have injury issues because they lack the skill of staying healthy.  I only think threequarters of them do.  The other quarter of them have injury issues because football is a rough game and because sometimes guys get hurt.  Shoot Flowers was less hurt though he did claim to be injured all of last year than he was just fucking bad.  But you dont end up with a list this long by accident.  The evidence when taken in the aggregate is overwhelming despite what I guarantee are going to be posts by somebody sayinggt Youre wrong player XYZ is actually great!  Hes finally healthy now!  He needs    whatever number of years to adjust to the NFL I just picked the number which gives him just one more year to not be a bust!Posts like those and theyre coming make me laugh.

True that has been going on since the draft. Her views being in direct opposition to the Giants organization over their handling of the Brown issue is another animal entirely. As it pertains to this thread the fact that shes called out the Giants for trying to use her son to control her. Thus putting Eli Apple squarely in the middle of a bad situation  between his mother whom he dearly loves and the organization that showed faith in him and gave him an opportunity of a lifetime. You dont think that would wear on a young mans mind? Sheesh the kid is only what  years old? Thats a rough spot to be in at any age. Prior to this game Apple has been focused poised and above all performed well. This was a rough game for him  an oddity. Which then brings up questions as to why.

9656285,0,t3_5dbanp,The giants have a tendency to play to the level of their opponents. I really dont fear the bears much. Unless their defense plays out of their minds we should win that game with ease. The only things that scare me on their entire team are trevathan and freeman at MLB and McPhee coming off the edge.  Id put zach miller in here too but cutler is too much of an anomaly to make me confident in miller. The loss of kyle long is also a huge factor there as far as I am concerned. Should be one of the easiest games we play all year.Im honestly a little concerned about cleveland...Yeah they have no wins but that roster is talented. They have many offensive weapons while their defense struggles. Theres two major ways to beat that team and thats to absolutely dominate on one side of the ball or the other. Or both. The ravens showed the merit of smothering them defensively while the Patriots and cowboys did so more offensively. I dont know that our team from what Ive seen is a dominant team on either side. The red zone defense is key having them kick field goals is good.

Eli has been struggling the run game has been weak all season and receivers not named Odell have struggled with routes drop passes etc. I dunno just a normal guy watching and not an analyst.

This defense is absolutely fantastic and arguably coming off its best game. Where JPP wasnt on the field.

Your passing offense is st in the league. Once this running game fades which I think it will at some point what will you have left? Youve gotta improve the defense you simply cant give up  a game.

10195559,0,t1_dbzn8cb,There are other things involving SoS than just WL record too a lot of people really enjoy DVOA. Its a pretty good study that is wildly accepted around the league circles. In terms of their SoS they had the Giants listed as the th hardest schedule and the Packers as the th hardest. In terms of consistency they had the Giants  by a wide margin too. Now consistency isnt always good for example the  most consistent team is the Chargers but basically what its saying is theyre consistently bad. Its a judge of how true your performances have been. It can help show how youve performed throughout the season and allow a bit of insight into whether your season has been all over the place in terms of offensive and defensive performance or if youve sustained mostly the same level of play. The Giants are  the Packers are th. DVOA ranked the Giants defense  overall behind only Denver. In fact ranking all playoff teams in DVOA the list looks like this . NYG  nd overall . DVOA score. SEA  th overall . DVOA score. HOU  th overall . DVOA score. PIT  th overall . DVOA score. KC  th overall . DVOA score. NE  th overall . DVOA score. DAL  th overall . DVOA score. MIA  th overall . DVOA score. GB  th overall . DVOA score. OAK  rd overall . DVOA score. ATL  th overall . DVOA score. DET  nd overall . DVOA scoreAs for the current position I like weighted DVOA the best as it weights current performance of the entire team defense and offense a little heavier than early season performance. So for example... the Bucs are nd in DVOA because of how bad they were early in the season but their weighted DVOA is th because of how much they turned it on in the second half. Similarly the Vikings are st in total DVOA but weighted DVOA is th because they collapsed. As far as weighted DVOA of playoff teams ranks they go like so . Pats. Cowboys. Steelers. Falcons. Chiefs. Giants. Packers. Raiders. Seahawks. Dolphins. Texans. LionsGiants and Packers are neck and neck. Giants have a weighted DVOA of . Packers of . basically no difference. As far as DVOA is concerned this game is a complete coin flip. As for the Giants defense ability to stop great offenses over the course of the season weve held some of the best offenses in football to some of their worst scores of the season. We held the  DVOA offense Cowboys to  points. The  DVOA offense Redskins to  points. The  DVOA offense Saints  points. So to say that we wont be able to hold the  DVOA offense Packers to a low enough score seems silly. The other important thing to note imo is Spags ability to adjust to prior tape. In teams our second games vs the division we drastically improved on each games score from the last. Game  vs the Cowboys  points allowedGame  vs the Cowboys  points allowedGame  vs the Redskins  points allowedGame  vs the Redskins  points allowedGame  vs the Eagles  points allowedGame  vs the Eagles  points allowedSo I wouldnt expect  points your score last game odds are this game will be won somewhere around  regardless of which team comes away with the win. Id honestly be shocked if either of us scores over  in the game. ,NYGiants,dbzq129,1,t5_2ruqw

I have yet to hear a compelling reason as to why we should dump one of the most dynamic players in the league.  Even if his personal production drops  its generally a reflection of the opposing team putting more coverage on him  which opens up other avenues.  Yes  he had a shit game this week.  But one game doesnt make a career.  This team went from back to back  seasons to  with the second best record in the NFC  and you are talking like the sky is falling.  O line needs to be the focus  and pick up a QB Eli can mentor in the middle rounds.  No quarterback is going to play to his full potential when you have defensive ends running right past Flowers every single game.  Get him an offensive line  and hell get another ring before he hangs it up.  And keep Beckham  without question.

I understand thst Beckham and Shepard are preferred in the slot but the Giants should mix it up more.If he goes so ewhere where he is a slot receiver I think he can be really good. If he gors to New England or GB as their slot receiver I think he will be back in the pro bowl. He isnt what he was. He is slower but he is still really strong.

Asking a player to restructure after he posts an outstanding year  just did insults the player and simply encourages him to tell the team to go fuck themselves.  Furthermore to restructure a deal the team needs leverage.  The Giants have none.  Threatening to release DRC is no threat at all Hed just pocket the M in bonus money the teams already paid him and hit the free agent market as the best cornerback available and receive a substantial raise on his current .M  salary.

Our offense made a lot of terrible defenses look Amazing Browns Saints Packers but it wasnt all Eli as well.

10527523,0,t1_dd1ahl1,Well firstly youre doing a great job with the language theres no need for a space before a question mark just so you know but otherwise I never would have known!Secondly as a foreigner WHY THE HELL WOULD YOU CHOOSE WASHINGTON!?!? THAT CITY IS EVERYTHING THATS WRONG WITH OUR COUNTRY!!! Im kidding...kind of.Maybe Im wrong about Garcon as I said that could very well be true. Ive hated that guy long before he ever put on the Period Blood and Yellow uniforms in Washington. I just dont trust him as a person. As a WR though youre right he makes the tough catches and always shows up.Since youre hell bent on talking about our offense. Eli saved his best game for the playoffs and it has given most of our fanbase a new sense of optimism. Im a little bit outside of that. I think hes better than Cousins but Im not so sure hes a hall of fame candidate. That will get me downvoted to hell here on this sub but his career averages are middle of the road. His career stats are all top  but a lot of that has to do with timing. He joined the NFL at the beginning of the passhappy explosion and he never sat out a game. In that respect hes a lot of what I see in Cousins other than natural arm talent and football intelligence. Both of those highly important intangibles Eli has in spades over Kirk. We need an offensive T. First and foremost. Having the worst tackle in the league on the blind side ruined so much of what we were trying to do this year. So much so that we had to remain in  personnel all year because we needed quickness on the outside. Eli couldnt allow for plays to develop. And we at least need on Tackle to correct that. Unfortunately there arent a hell of a lot of options in the draft or in the free agent market. So we could be in trouble again there.TE is a need as well. I think its an overestimated correction from our fan base. We do need a  way player blocker and pass catcher or at the very least a much better blocker. But it doesnt fix our offense. It mostly lessens the need for a stud to replace Cruz. Who needs to be replaced.A great TE would surely open up our offense if we had Reed wed have a different offense for sure. A way better one. But just adding a TE doesnt do that alone. But yes Im hoping we add one in the first  rounds of the draft. We do need to replace Cruz. We need to send him somewhere where he can play in the slot again. He may be able to resurrect his career and I think wed all be happy if he could do that as long as its in the AFC. But we need to add a Garcon type ideally with a bigger body though. Brian Quick from LA would be ideal. He wouldnt take away from Odell and Shep but hed offer a big body with reliable hands who can also be a deep threat. We do need pieces. For sure. But central to my argument against you guys is Kirks right arm. Its an Alex Smith arm. Its about to get a pay day like Aaron Rodgers arm...which will quickly make him look like Brock Osweiler.  ,NYGiants,dd1eqvc,1,t5_2ruqw

It seemed every time there was a penalty on the line it was always him. I think if he got that under control he could be a semi decent linesman!

11692673,0,t1_dgld23s,The  CBA severely limited offseason contact between coach personnel and players as well as cut a lot of time for OTAs and practices that was being used on developmental players. Practices where young guys could get reps in on the scout team or get tips from team coaches in the offseason like what Rodgers got are just gone now. Theres less time for teams to gel and develop which is why the value of proven talent and immediate producers has gone up so high.,NYGiants,dgldse6,3,t5_2ruqw

By the time his second contact hits hes going to be  and will want a big contract by that point.

He has to be able to show some level blocking especially if the Giants dont pick a decent OL in the nd round. I said it before I would trade the house now to go up and grab cam Robinson...

11791953,0,t1_dgw9eig,Hey man I see youre pretty banged up about your boyfriend not being chosen by your fav team. Condolences. I usually masturbate when Im down in the dumps. Picks me right back up. Maybe you can use Webbs highlight reel as spank material. Im pretty down in the dumps right now actually so Im going to use your comment thread as spank material because I get off on people salty about something then taking to social media and condemning people who have nothing to do with it. Webb is our next Nassib and Im hard as fuck just thinking about how pissed it makes you that your fav QB is going to be a backup for the worst team. Ill add this in too hes behind GENO SMITH on our depth chart. Hes not going to have the privilege to pass to the elite receivers of the New York Football Giants. Hes not going to be able to be sacked from blown coverage by Flowers. This does bring a tear to my eye too. So buck up buckaroo. Dont blame Jerry Reese for making a horrible choice on draft day.
