2760169,0,t1_cnhq40q,Thats what I was looking for.  Smart curious and laid back.  At one point my female Artemis was the runt of the litter.  The breeder offered to swap her for another kitten who was a bit larger but I was happy to keep her as long as she was healthy.  She was the most outgoing of the litter and she and her brother Maximus who I also go were partners in crime.One thing I was not prepared for was the amount of shedding.  My previous two overlords were domestic shorthairs from the shelter.  They were awesome but my MCs shed at least x and worse when they change coats.,mainecoons,cnhtjrg,1,t5_2s82i
2800521,0,t1_cnme9l2,I kept him on a strict grainfree low carb high protein diet. He got two small meals  oz. each of canned food daily no exceptions. I used Binkys List of Canned Cat Food Nutritional Information to choose the best food I could afford and stuck to it like his life depended on it. He started out at  pounds at his worst then I got him to . which was too thin for his size. I increased his food so now hes around . which is good for him. He currently gets two meals of  oz. each. Also I moved to a cottage with a fenced in yard hes old so he doesnt climb out so hes more active than he was and that helped.I feed him Wellness Grain Free canned food the Chicken amp Herring and the Turkey amp Salmon flavors he likes Wellness CORE chicken and EVO cat amp kitten. OCCASIONALLY I put some EVO Turkey amp Chicken Formula Dry Cat Food in a treat ball for Gizmo to roll around the house if its raining or cold and hes not going outside. It keeps him moving around and he loves to crunch. But thats like a couple of tablespoons of dry food a week at most.,mainecoons,cnmepv4,6,t5_2s82i

3264242,0,t1_cp0bf7t,Hed stopped pooping stopped eating and drinking and was projectile vomiting  The vomit started smelling really wrong which is what tipped us off that it wasnt just a nasty hairball. Because he shares his litter tray and food with his sister we didnt initially realise the other symptoms until we thought about it. Poor kitten. We just called the vet for an update and apparently he was very stable overnight while on fluids so the signs are as good as they could be at this stage. ,mainecoons,cp0cmnc,1,t5_2s82i

4027630,0,t3_36n96c,This is my  month old MC. Every now and then he likes to pee outside of his litter box on one of our couches. Its usually the same coach. I thought the root of the problem could be when a couple of months ago we changed the location of the litter box. We werent sure if he liked the new locationbox or not. This is when the peeing outside of the box started...We have since moved the litter box back to its old location while keeping the other litterbox in the new location thus now having two litterboxes. All seems fine and he uses both litterboxes at this point....My other hypothesis is that he is peeing on the couch because he is angry with me about something. It could be the wet food which he doesnt seem to like very much it could be that im not waking up early enough for him. He seems to do it when i lock him out of my room in the morning to get some sleep. Has anyone ever dealt with a situation such as this? Any advice is greatly appreciated. ,mainecoons,crfdoin,6,t5_2s82i

5685384,0,t3_3raerg,Im a little late on the bandwagon here but I figured Id point out a brand that didnt get any mention  Fromm. My maine coon mix gets about a cup a day of dry Fromm Gold and on average one can a week of Fromms wet food. It doesnt contain any filler and theyve never had a recall. Supposedly Fromm is in control of its entire supply chain  Blue Buffalos been getting a lot of bad press because it was discovered that their biggest suppliers werent giving them the ingredients they were supposed to thus making the food different than advertised. I recall there being a big class action suit underway for it. Regardless of what you decide to do I hope you have lots of fun with your new best friend!  ,mainecoons,cx1ts0q,2,t5_2s82i
