4237715,0,t1_cs37xzv,Ive been reading a lot about nutrition lately and I would have to say that I wholeheartedly disagree.  There are different camps of thinking even among professionals.  Some people think only the number of calories matter.  But I personally think all of these things matter  Drinking that liquid sugar ever meal has horrible effects increased glycogen stores increase insulin levels until diabetes.  The bun will also increase glycogen levels and insulin levels.  All leftover glycogen will be stored as fat.  That fast food bun is loaded with added sugar.  The bun and meat are loaded with preservatives.  The main job of preservatives is to inhibit bacteria growth.  We currently do not understand the effects of eating preservatives but its likely bad for our good gut bacteria.  All animals in nature just eat until theyre full and none of them are obese.  Kids going through growth spurts eat more naturally they dont have to consciously count calories and eat more.Reasons why caloriein calorieout is bad advice  Less calories will cause her natural activity level to lower making it much harder to exercise.  Exercising will increase her appetite making her consume more calories.  Artificial sweeteners have been shown to cause glucose intolerance and are correlated with weight gain and diabetes.I wholeheartedly believe that the changing the TYPES of foods is much better advice than eating smaller portions of bullshit food and sugar.But whatever Im not an expert.  Maybe we should both stop pretending we know what were talking about.  Nutrition is really fucking complicated.,getoffyourass,cs3ahtc,-1,t5_38mc8

4237920,0,t1_cs3akox,So that specific opinion went out and beat up a fat kid in a school?That persons opinion was confined to the environment of which the text they wrote was allowed. The environment was not forced upon you. Whoever was banned from fph in the image had to voluntarily go out of their way and persecute an idea and community in order to solicit that particular response.,getoffyourass,cs3bc9d,1,t5_38mc8
4238032,0,t1_cs39poj,I love swimming too. and bizarrely some people with an inefficient swimming stroke often burn more energy than someone with a good swimming stroke helps to rule out that excuse that because youre not a proficient swimmer that you shouldnt swim for your exercise.,getoffyourass,cs3bsug,20,t5_38mc8
