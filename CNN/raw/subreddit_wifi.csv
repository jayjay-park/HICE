1706093,0,t1_cjtyzrb,Youve described mostly what Im hoping to do any gear suggestions?I know enough to avoid GhZ like the plague for interfloor bridging but other than that our requirements are cheap easy to admin and effective.  Youre right that the floors are probably made of dense unknown substances that excel at absorbing RF.,wifi,cju7r7t,1,t5_2rfxq

4459669,0,t3_3c3bom,Last comment is right. Clients make stupid decisions but a desktop is a little more flexible.I noticed that you have the access points on channels  and . Those channels overlap. You should really stick to using  and  channels that do not overlap.  Switch the one from channel  to  and youll get less interference and a better connection.,wifi,csstlen,1,t5_2rfxq
5307553,0,t1_cvq254u,Yeah very true. Usually in a very dense building all channels will be used and youll even have some smart guys thinking they are clever by using channel  or  Most APs have auto channel select so usually you see a split among all thr channels. But for sure check it out to be sure.,wifi,cvq3nwz,2,t5_2rfxq
5690204,0,t3_3t0z4d,Ive dealt with similar products before but never had much luck. From the comments on amazon it looks like it should have two different SSIDs so you should be able to set your computer to automatically roam to the best APgtWell when you set it up you link it to an existing WiFi so it will use whatever password is on your current WiFirouter. Once its set up you will have  separate WiFis available one for your original router and one for your range extender. Both of these will use the same password.,wifi,cx2fbbs,3,t5_2rfxq
5968119,0,t1_cxup4sa,No do not use a range extender. Heres why WiFi is half duplex which means that only one device can talk on a channel at a time. A range extenderrepeater creates an extra hop which means it takes twice as long and twice as much airtime to get that frame moved back to the router. Repeatersextenders effectively halve your data throughput. Its much better to run an Ethernet cable or powerline adapters to a second router or access point. ,wifi,cy1y9r7,1,t5_2rfxq
6292025,0,t3_41rr8g,For that distance you basically need line of site. If there are houses or forests between you would need to mount antennas outside and likely on a tripod on the roof. youd need an AP with an outdoor yagi or high gain patch antenna,wifi,cz4tzbc,2,t5_2rfxq
6401254,0,t1_czeykyr,Yeah but there are many other things you can do with Who Is my WiFi or NetWatcher. First find your device and then rename it and when you see same mac address you can easily specify your device and then you can block the other one. For blocking they dont use Mac filtering.,wifi,czh9afe,1,t5_2rfxq

7947340,0,t1_d48rl1s,Unfortunately i do not have any experience with ubiquiti gear on such a largescale operation as yours would be. so i do not know about the channel autoselection. but since your surrounding wifi should not change too much id say do it right once and keep that fixed.Upgrading from nonac to accapable APs would be a major investment it is better to invest in AC now than thowing out all your APs in three years. luckily ubiquitys current lineup of APs all feature AC.Different SSIDs and VLANS are supported Firewalling is not something your AP does. however there are firewalls available from ubiquity if they are any good goes beyond my knowledge.And the interconnection with real pysical network cables is pretty much a must A since ubiquitys APs are powered by PoE and B everything else is guaranteed to give you massive headaches.BTW you can find a nice writeup of the management consoles capabilities here,wifi,d49ctgh,1,t5_2rfxq
7950656,0,t1_d49i024,Its absolutely a thing if Google sees too many DNS requests bound for its servers it will stop responding and sometimes post a redirect to its own web page stating its being blocked temporarily or as a means to prevent a DDoS. Its happened to us at a handful of events where we setup Googles DNS access directly to clients. Weve since put our own DNS servers at these show networks and have not had issues since. Granted its a high limit but without knowing the OPs sourcing as far as how the ISP handles their NATing its a possibility.,wifi,d49q9cg,1,t5_2rfxq

8964878,0,t3_531d6s,I would advise you not to use a common name for your network. You can find a list of the  most used network names here. The reason for this advice is that a network is in laymans terms less secure if it is using a common network name. If you want i can explain the details but you can also just trust me on this one.In my experience even a random string has some recognition value so dont overthink it. for reference my network is called Spaceballs the WiFi.,wifi,d7pfyyf,2,t5_2rfxq

Most of these smaller outfits would gladly take a few hundred bucks for someone to use gear thats just otherwise sitting in their closet. Do you or your team know the software well enough to make it worthwhile? Why not just hire someone for the task?
