851910,0,t1_ch0ypwi,Im going to be the Devils advocate here and say that a concert is the easiest to learn on and I did most of my own learning on a tenor.The soprano may be easier to wrap your fingers around but for some it may feel too cramped. On top of that you can produce a nice sound on concert and tenor ukes without having perfect form.So OP Id recommend a concert if her fingers are on the smaller side or a tenor if theyre larger.For brands I use a Leolani Tenor and a Pacific Ukulele Concert both around the  range. I have tons of friends who when picking up an ukulele decided to go Lanikai which is honestly pretty fine. And if you want something pretty Luna is unique even if the sound quality sounds a lot... softer than most.,ukulele,ch147yo,2,t5_2qltz

865316,0,t1_ch2layi,Well to expand a bit on what I said before ...It depends on what kind of player you hope to become. If you play in one position which is what learning the scales across four strings helps you do it works though you can be a bit limited. If you decide to play chordmelody solos it is helpful to learn how a melody or scale works across a single string. Best approach and one I suggest for my students is to do both. Learn your basic scales in one position across four strings but also learn the scales on one string so that the upper reaches of the fretboard arent strange lands. A good onestring exercise is to figure out a melody using only one string. Take a simple melody even a nursery rhyme one. Once youve figured it out on one string learn it on two strings then on three and finally on four. Of course some melodies wont stretch out to two or three or four strings so be aware of that!TLDR Do both! ,ukulele,ch2n3zt,1,t5_2qltz

1108102,0,t3_26t53b,Well look at what the chords are actually doing in the prechorus youve got an Fm whose bass note is just descending by a half step every time it changes. The problem with that is that its tough to get the F at the bottom of an Fm on a uke in standard tuning.Without a uke in front of me to see how it sounds you could play the prechorus chords as     or  to make it easy. Thatll give you the right descent from the F but it wont be in the bass so it wont sound quite the same.The E E E at the end of the prechorus is sort of ornamental Id just probably play a straight E.,ukulele,chu8yw2,2,t5_2qltz

I can imagine that people from all walks of life pick up the uke and that a lot of first ukes are going to be painted plywood generic brand guys..That being said I copy pasted from my post.Martin CK a solid hawaiin koa concert with Martin Flourocarbon strings. This series was made in Mexico to cut costs and it is an amazing uke with a very powerful full sound. It plays like butter. Martins in general are high end I find that they do not make anything under  and rightly so because of the reputation they have to uphold. Price ProsAmazing projectionPlays like butter very smoothVery round warm and very full.Neck is very thin I like this but others might not.ConsUpper register doesnt resonate that well. Higher on the fretboard fret  loses a lot of sound.Action came high.Pono MGT solid mango tenor with Daddario strings and a martin flourocarbon G. I needed to string it to high G for a recording. The mango has a very sweet melancholic mellow sound to it with lots of warm tones especially when its strung lowG. Pono is actually the affordable lineup of the KoOlau company which makes all their ukes in hawaii. Price Pros Beautiful sweet mellow sound. Almost quimsical in nature. Good resonance in the lower register.High attention to detail.ConsNo fancy designs and inlays on fretboardNot as much volume as I likeVery string dependent doesnt play well with aquilasKala KAGATUS a solid top golden acacia soprano travel uke. These ones have recently been discontinued so the savings were huge. Kala makes all sorts of ukes now at the lower to mid tier price point. I find I  general that they are very good quality but have no soul. Play a Kala solid acacia and compare it to a pono and youll know what I mean. Originally being strung with Aquila I made the switch to Flourocarbon because the tiny body on this uke didnt go well with nylgut. Nylgut enhances sound throughout but there was nothing to enhance. Flourcarbon strings gave this thing the projection it needed to be a good uke. This uke has a really punchy bright sound to it which was what I was looking for in a soprano. Price Pros excellent sound for a thin body uke. Golden acacia rounds out the tone significantly.Cons does not play well with Aquila strings amplifies all the bad tinny parts of the soundNot as much projection as a full bodyLittle attention to detail some frets were sharp and the tuners are cheap.,ukulele,ciex3k5,2,t5_2qltz

I ended up with a compressor a fuzz pedal and an envelope filter as well as a few amps. Its an excellent uke for only .  As long as youre going to be using a decent amount of effects on it yes you can get a very guitarlike sound out of an acousticelectric uke. But if you were going for more of an electric clean sound like you would use for smooth jazz or something it will sound like more of a ukulele  and thats where youd need a solidbody steelstring uke to get a guitar sound. So what kind of rock music will you be playing? If you need a solidbody steelstring but cant shell out the  for a Eleuke or Risa there may be a cheaper brand out there.

1657397,0,t1_cjnp55f,What kind of amp you would want to look at depends totally on sizeoutput and price range. Marshall and Vox are good brands to look at. I got a good W practice amp for about  used in perfect condition at my local guitar center it has enough output for small shows. When it comes to pedals it sounds like for the type of music you want to do youll definitely need some kind of overdrive pedal and a compressor and probably a wah as well. Im not much on timingbased effects like delay reverb chorus etc but a lot of artists do use them. If youre on a tight budget Id definitely recommend checking out Joyo Pedals They do clones of bigname pedals and sell them for about rd the price. When I got started with pedals I threw down about  each for a fuzz pedal and envelope filter. Then I found Joyo and bought their Dynacomp as my compressor pedal for like  and I couldnt be happier with it. If youre new to pedals and not sure what they all do there are plenty of good resources on the Internet. Id recommend Youtube as you can look up the name of a pedal and usually find videos that will demonstrate how it works and what it sounds like. I ended up buying that Mahalo steelstring uke I should have it by tomorrow or Thursday. When I get it Ill play around with it a bit and I can let you know how it is. Although as bazmaz said in his comment below one singlecoil pickup isnt going to sound as good as the humbuckers on a Risa LP.,ukulele,cjo2tgk,1,t5_2qltz

1671821,0,t3_2dgi1y,A uke is a great place to start! Its a great place to stay even. You can be playing songs the day you get it but as YouTube will demonstrate theres plenty of scope for developing technique.Cheap ukes can be fine but spending a little more than the minimum is a good idea. should get you a decent model.Try to get to a store and check some models out in person. As has been mentioned holding the third fret on the bottommost string will give you a C. Strumming that will give you a fair example of how the uke will feel and sound in play. You might also find an employee who can demonstrate it for you but its important that you feel comfortable with it and enjoy it.  Its not always easy to tell so early on but you might find that some models just dont work for you right off the bat.Get yourself a tuner too  if you have a smartphone or tablet there are a number of free ones that will do the job or else the store should have affordable electronic ones. Your uke will enjoy going out of tune a lot in the early days but itll get better.When you have a uke you like hit the internet for tab sites. Many of them will have beginner collections. I focused on playing You Are My Sunshine when I got my first uke which I think worked really well for me as it has a good mix of easy chords and keeps your fingers moving without being frustrating. But find a song you like that seems doable and stick with it. And have fun!,ukulele,cjpw848,1,t5_2qltz

I think what puts off some people is the uniqueness of what theyre doing... cocobolo isnt considered an obvious soundboard choice as far as tone woods goes but it seems to be working out well for them.

2124895,0,t1_cl9oln7,Jake Shimabukuro uses DAddario Pro Arte strings which are also the strings that Aldrine Guerero uses. Britni Paiva I believe switches around a lot but I also think she blends strings from different packages a technique some players use to get the right tones they want to hear from their instruments.The other thing you may be forgetting is that those two usually play plugged into an amp via a passive piezo pickup system from the amp you can add reverb and other subtle yet dramatic effects. I assume that youre playing acoustically which is what makes your instrument sound dull. Ukuleles by nature of being small instruments do not have the resonance that a guitar will because they are on a much higher tonal register as well as a shallower body that wont project sound as much as youd like it to acoustically.As mentioned elsewhere in this thread Aquila Nylgut strings are about as close as youll get to a fullbodied sound while playing acoustically. They have a very punchy sound geared towards acoustic players. But if you ever plug into an amp youll end up with a really sharp sound because of the high register. Putting steel strings on your uke will probably snap your bridge clean off the body. If you like the sound of a wound string or a deeper fuller register you should consider getting strings with whats called a wound rd or wound th string. Those will generally have a longer sustain than plain nylon will. I love playing with wound rds. The other thing you can do is buy a tenor uke and fit your th string with a low G which can also be wound. If you have any other questions feel free to ask!

If you take it into a shop they could charge you up to  or so.  Be careful about filing the nut without proper tools its easy to make the slot too big.,ukulele,clzymt7,1,t5_2qltz

2714591,0,t1_cnciulw,I just sold my favorite ukulele ever an hour ago  an old s Robert E. Pearson banjo ukeThats it before I got it completely set up. I even priced it a little high because I didnt want to sell it. Oh well. Im about to list another really interesting banjo uke for sale. This one is an old s Maccaferri Mastro in mint condition in the original box. Theyre all bakelite plastic  with a few metal pieces. They sound really cool. This one is interesting because its probably the most racistlooking banjo ukulele ever. The head has a graphic of a guy in blackface tapdancing on a riverboat called the Robert E. Lee. The box that the blackface guy too. I sold another one recently that was a promo item for Carlings Black Label Beer. They sound really cool  very echoey.

2977418,0,t3_2u6tdh,In general Id say the best plan is for you to get used to constantly moving your arm down on every down beat and up on every up beat. go for DUDUDUDU until you can keep it steady or just DDDD for something more basic... I learned strumming on the guitar years and years ago so I dont even really remember how its just kind of ... something you get used to.But once youre used to a steady updown rhythm you dont really have to learn strum patterns. I listened to this song partway through then played the strum pattern or one of themshe changes up a few times instantly almost by reflex. I cant do this well with chords or notes but it is one of the easier things I think to pick up on once you get a little experience on ya.DDUUDDUDU is how Im hearing most of them. That would beDDUUDDUDUampampampampampampampampnot sure how that formatting will workAnd like I said she mixes it up a little but ... get the steady updown of your arm going rocksolid and then you should be able to play any rhythm as easy as if they tapped it on the table and youre tapping it back to them.I just rewatched more of the video and if you look closely even though shes resting entirely on  you can still see her arm make the same updown motion with no stroke ... thats what I mean by it being instinctive.,ukulele,co6jr3m,1,t5_2qltz

3044523,0,t1_codj485,With high end multi effects that cost hundreds I can agree. But with cheaper units like a Zoom we have to agree to disagree I am afraid.There is a world of difference to my ears at least between the effects of cheaper multi pedals and good dedicated pedals.Ive got a Boss multi effects unit I use as a backup and its nice and uses same pedal models but its night and day difference that using some good real pedals.Not trying to sound snobby  as I say  I own both and dozens of pedals too. Re keeping resale value in my experience individual pedals always fetch more than multi units  plus you can just sell part of your set up.End of the day though  top musical artists have pedal boards with many pedals and dont tend to use multi effects.,ukulele,codkbcs,1,t5_2qltz

You will get more versatility and better tone out of a passive pickup and a preamp than you ever will with the cheap battery on board types. Its what most professionals use on stage  and for good reason. The other advantage is you can add them to most acoustic ukes meaning you are not restricted by just the electrics on the shelf. Any good ukulele specialist store will tell you this is the best way to go. Most good stores will also fit them for you.,ukulele,cs71d0r,1,t5_2qltz

4747220,0,t3_3ftlcf,The break looks pretty clean. This is totally fixable. If done by a good luthier even complex breaks can be fixed so its almost invisible. For a clean break like this I dont think you even need to take it to a luthier. No dowels or screws needed. Hide glue is preferred but a hassle to work with. Titebond should be ok. Use plenty of glue enough so that the excess squeezes out when you clamp it. Then clamp the pieces together as tightly as possible without digging into the wood wipe off the extra glue and let it set for at least h.

The webmaster for one of the Big Name Ukulele Sites has behaved in a boorish way toward members of the community sending those who submit to him the kinds of harsh rejection letters that would make Simon Cowell say thats a bit much.  Hes also insulted his readers with disingenuous statements.  Im not looking for folks to bend over backwards to praise others but I do think that being rude to your readership is less informative and fosters less of a community than do inspirational quotes and pictures of ukuleles and baby animals.

7401211,0,t3_4gomfl,Regarding the possible selection of the Les Paul. I owned and played one for two years low G tuning. It is a great option for practicing as it is quiet when played without amplification. If you are playing for more than a couple of people you will need a small amp solution.

7444083,0,t3_4h8dof,Im relatively new to the uke as well  having only played for a month and a half. Listen strumming is one of those things that takes an awful lot of practise. I had a similar problem at first having issues with my upstrum and my fingers getting caught in between strings. Keep on going  practise with different techniques try the claw using a a thumb and then try each individual finger on its own until you find something that feels comfortable. Itll take a while but eventually strumming will come as naturally as fretting. Just stick at it. Id also like to suggest strumming on the fret board especially as its a soprano. ,ukulele,d2ocfcc,2,t5_2qltz

7990543,0,t3_4on3v5,Try playing the melodies of the songs you already know while arpeggiating the chords. This is a good way to learn how melodies relate to the chord structure. You can then come up with countermelodies and learn how to put together solos and improvise.Look for other musicians to play with. Its easier to pull out nuances of a song while other instruments are accompanying you. Strumming and singing is fun but playing with other musicians who are better than you coming up with song arrangements and learning to take solos will take you to the next level.And thats how you get the gig.,ukulele,d4e7oqi,3,t5_2qltz

8934947,0,t3_52nacq,First I am left handed so I have a lot of experience with left handed instruments. Heres what you want to do Option one buy a left handed uke. Its super easy to find LH ukuleles in soprano and concerts. I suggest the Oscar Schmidt OULH. Great instrument for a beginner. Option  Buy a right handed ukulele and have a PROFESSIONAL put it on their bench. They will flip the nut and groove it for each string correctly. They should also depending on the uke you buy flip the bridge. Not every uke needs this. Either way a professional luthier can usually correctly flip a stringed instrument. This is not always the case but I personally just bought a baritone uke and had this done. Sometimes it costs but if you buy from a reputable shop with a good luthier they may throw it in with the purchase. Id personally avoid places like guitar center. But thats me. Hope that helps. ,ukulele,d7luk1r,2,t5_2qltz
