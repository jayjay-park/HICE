4336860,0,t3_3aogz7,First time Ive made these. I used this recipe for the buns I made  not  and this one sort of for the filling. The second link tells you how to put the filling in the dough and gives you the approximate amount you need but I just diced some onions garlic bell pepper and pork and added bottled BBQ sauce. They turned out pretty great!,eatwraps,csehsk4,2,t5_2uzxn
