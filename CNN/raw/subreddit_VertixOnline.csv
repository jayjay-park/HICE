8151153,0,t3_4qv5a0,... This class has a same problem with your magician at first before edit. Too weak damage!You said he has vintage WWII pistol that shoots extremely quickly but fire rate  is slower than fire rate  of Triggerman. But he has half damage of Triggerman  so his actual damage is even lower than half Triggerman. But in contrast with Spray n Pray he only has  health.Even ammo is much fewer Warmonger lt Triggerman so even fire duration also shortampnbspThe secondary weapon Mustard Gas Canister is also not that useful.It just create  Mustard Gas Cloud which has  damage and if damage mechanism is same with Arsonists fire then each gas just can do  damage so max damage of Mustard Gas Canister is just . But grenade do  damage at direct hit killing enemy instantly.If it wasnt  same mechanism you should have to set damage per time like  damage per  seconds in cloud. ampnbspAnd if Mustard Gas Cloud is very large and do big amount damage until escape this means he can do nothing without gas but can kill enemy surely whenever Mustard Gas Canister is reloaded.Then every player just run away until reload end and just shoot it again and again...ampnbspThe last thing is If there are many Warmongers in one server then that sever will be overflowed by gas at everywhere. and nobody will be unable to move until it disappear. It will be very annoying.,VertixOnline,d4wfwz1,2,t5_3ahit

8310939,0,t3_4td8b9,Then a lot of new players would vote to end the game when losing. The objective of the game is to win and it is unfair to vote to end the map when losing. Besides you literally vote on the next game mode each round. Why would there be a need to vote to change the game mode when that is what the people voted for? A game lasts only a few minutes so just wait until it is over or just refresh to join another game.,VertixOnline,d5gfanb,3,t5_3ahit

9210023,0,t3_55rm57,This is stupid. Hunter does not have a high level skill cap it is very easy to play. Run n gun is balanced. Spray and Pray needs buff but not  health and  dmg per bullet. Youre basically making him a weaker class.  Arsonist is bad enough in competitive already. His range and lack of a secondary weapon makes him very ineffective in comp. Hardpoint idea no.
