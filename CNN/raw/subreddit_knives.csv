290454,0,t1_cfavahz,This is ALV titanium I took this one to sandpaper and a strop so sharpening it is pretty much the same. From my experience so far it doesnt take as good of an edge as steel but it holds a surprisingly good edge definitely surpassing in edge retention From my experience cheaper blade steels. Id say the edge retention was on par with crmov if I dare say. I will say though that on softer materials like cardboard and such what you might use a utility knife for is ideal the hard woods Ive used seem to hurt the edge a bit but very very little. Ive had steel take much more damage on the hardwoods Ive cut it holds pretty well for what it is. Its fairly tough I was surprised. The edge it takes isnt as keen also but then this is very very light and will never corrode. So they have their place no one knife can do it all ya know?

471343,0,t1_cfrtdv6,Most people take their edges way to fine for any kind of serious outdoor work to be done. If you sharpen a knife to a razors edge then its going to dull and possibly roll or chip on you with any kind of real use.  If you need a razor then buy a razor. Most people who just have knives to look at like them to be hair splitting sharp so they pull them down off the shelf put them through the many sharpeners they own and then gingerly slice through sheets  of paper to prove to themselves how awesomely sharp a blade is. And thats fine if thats what youre  into...But if you want a good survival knife a knife thats going to hold up out in the woods splitting timber to make kindling guttingskinning an animal cutting meat or ropes or canvas bark or branches... you dont want a razor sharp knife because youll have a dull piece of shit in no time. What you want is a sharp edge but a STRONG edge hopefully in enough of a wedge pattern that  it is reinforced by the sides of the blade so that the whole knife does the work and not kuse the fine edge. If you have to sharpen your knife every time you do anything with it then your edge is too sharp.,knives,cftue0e,3,t5_2qzyn

624085,0,t1_cgb5j6e,One thing I think we should bear in mind is that the concussion explosive used was a nonlethal weapon that was employed and was clearly unsuccessful. Not only did it fail to stop him but it caused him to escalate and present two knives which could be taken as a threatening manner. If a nonlethal method was used and failed which thus lead to an escalation in threat what evidence is there to guarantee the safety of the officers if another nonlethal method was used? The level of force used should match the level of threat and when the man escalated brandishing weapons that can inflict lethal wounds it is acceptable to match that with lethal force to neutralize the threat.Using the use of force diagram while these steps may vary depending on police forces the general frame work is the same the subject was in a state of active resistance by disobeying orders and walking away. Given the terrain attempting to close the physical gap and employ nonlethal or intermediary such as a taser baton or handtohand do not look feasible and I cant think of anyone willing to take that risk given the terraindistance which is why the explosive was used. It clearly backfired as rather than incapacitating the subject he immediately escalated to an aggressive state with the threat of bodily harm. At this point rules dictate that a threat needs to be neutralized which is where the use of the firearms came in. While it may seem like overkill to use rifles against knives a threat is a threat and we cannot underestimate the effectiveness of knives as weapons At this point the role of the shooters is to ensure without any doubt that the threat has been neutralized sometimes it takes one round sometimes it takes  Just because he is on the ground does not mean he is incapable of harming someone whether this is the case its hard to tell from the video footage.Im not saying the LEOs were in the right here as a short youtube clip without much context is very very difficult to paint the full picture Im just trying to give some perspective on why what happened had happened.,knives,cgb7ji5,3,t5_2qzyn

964254,0,t1_chd7sp5,. Thats how I do it. But...Some folks suggest you can pull the edge of the knife lightly across a piece of wood to remove a burr. This must work at least on a tiny burr because some really knowledgeable people do it. But if your burr is too large this method tears the edge.If you still have problems you can try out a microbevel. By raising the sharpening angle on the final few strokes by a few degrees you can usually cleanly remove even a stubborn burr. Use your finest stone.And do use a flat stone or a strop. Rods dont remove a burr as cleanlyeasily. ,knives,chdw82e,1,t5_2qzyn

The knife that fit most of my needs was a Benchmade  Emissary with except that the Emissary carry clip is polished silver and there is no factory option for a black carry clip. The polished silver clip was a big issue for me because that stands out like a sore thumb when wearing dark pants.I ended up buying the Emissary and sent off the carry clip for Cerakote because I wanted a very durable black finish.

Just a drop on each side work it in and Im set.gt how do I avoid over tightening the blade screw without leaving it at a point where it can loosen from opening the knife?What I like to do is have the blade in the closed position and from there I will adjust the pivot screw as I see fit.

For instance I stonewashed this knife in a pringles can. POf course I find that vertical grind lines gives me a more aggressive looking acid stone wash depends on what youre after.

1599977,0,t1_cjgthwe,Ive used the turn box but not the stone system. The turn box is passable but not as easy or effective as a Sharpmaker. Even though the Sharpmaker is  or so more I would suggest that. Buy it once.As for the stone system. I have not used it but I really like the design of the Lansky boxed system. It should give you seriously good results at the price. Its very similar in practice to the Edge Pro system which is... really expensive. If youre interested in best results you should watch a few demos on the EP and youll learn a lot of applicable information. The edge this gives you wont be open to much customization but it will be sharp. Almost certainly sharper than the edge the knife came with.The one thing I havent seen in the demos on the Lansky system are stropping or deburring techniques both of which can be done with common household items specifically a wine cork and cardboard. Try this guide Its excellent. I dont rebevel every knife I use but the entire thing is technically correct.Of course you could always join me on the dark side and sharpen with stones. You could get some cheap starter stones at any hardware store. Your future Benchmade would thank you. I can do more than any of these sharpening systems the EdgePro or the Wicked Edge or whatever combined.,knives,cjguh4d,2,t5_2qzyn

1778317,0,t3_2evfyg,I did not take these pictures since I have a potato for a camera and bought this knife instead of a new camera. These are the pictures that were taken for the listing and I can confirm they are of the knife I received in particular.The knife is nice and light yet very durable. I can attest to this by the knife box being destroyed to the extent that I think someone at USPS actively destroyed it but the knife itself is without a mark and in perfect condition compared to the pics. The switch action is so powerful that I thought I was going to drop it the first time I hit the button it is very awesome. The blade has an extremely small amount of blade play considering it can be folded closed without hitting the button.It is pretty dull though really disappointingly dull for the factory edge. I know most people dont care about the factory edge and put their own on immediately but I am clumsy as hell and ALWAYS mark up blades. Not sure if I should try it myself or take it somewhere to get it sharpened.Also I dont really dig the plastic grip insets. They do provide for a better grip than if the handle was straight aluminum but I dont think the benefit is enough to balance out the ugliness. Anyone know of a place that I can order different insets that look better with the knife?,knives,ck3b88h,1,t5_2qzyn

Some plastics can become brittle and crack! or get gummy if exposed to the petrol solvents that are in WD. WD is basically mineral oil with a lighter solvent carrier not unlike unrefined lighter fluid and mineral spirits that is designed to evaporate off leaving the mineral oil.I would be tempted to polish the bolsters and handle. But the patina on the blade looks pretty wicked. I bet its a carbon steel blade. Id just rub off the red rust with fine bronze or steel wool after the oil soak. Or alternatively you can degrease the blade with alcohol and then wrap the blade in a napkin and dip in vinegar. If you let it sit like that for an hour the red rust will transform into a black patina that should nicely match the rest of the blade.,knives,ckf28kv,2,t5_2qzyn

Not pretty just simple rugged farming tools. Condor Knife and Tool is also made in El Salvador and theyre more expensive . Very high quality they come with a very sharp edge out of the box and they come with very nice leather sheaths. Cold Steel machetes are made in South Africa and theyre in between the other brands in price . Good blades super comfy polypropylene handles at least on the model I own but they dont come very sharp.

2031070,0,t3_2i0ru6,Switchblades butterfly knives gravity assisted knives and OTF knives are illegal in Canada. Pretty much any knife that can be opened without touching the blade is illegal. You can have spring assisted knives or just general folders because you need to manipulate the blade to open them. As far as I know there are no size restrictions on the blade I personally have three  blades and I have had no problems with them. Knives like karambits are technically legal but are used mostly for self defense making them illegal. If you have a legitimate use for it the cop might be okay with you having one. Im not too sure about the laws regarding fixed blades. In urban centers like cities and towns I believe they shouldnt be carried a cop would most likely question you on your intent. Small towns or in a wilderness environment they should be okay.My advice is to find a knife shop and look at their selection. Any knife they sell should be legal to carry. That way you see what is available you get to try out the knives and ask the counter staff questions.Most of my information comes from talking with the guys at the counter in my knife store and reading about Canadian knife laws online. ,knives,ckxzs28,3,t5_2qzyn

2385493,0,t3_2mptpj,You couldnt possibly predict it.The prices youre talking about pretty much puts you in the range of production knives and what percentage of the current production knives are going to have collectors value in  years?Even customs of that value or double rarely gain value in the short term. there are surprisingly few knifemakers whose original work around those prices now has genuine collectors value ie bob lovelessThe only value you can cultivate will be sentimental. which fits with your vision of a used knife..I think youre underestimating just how long  years is.You see loads of slipjoints and buck s that are already too far gone after  years to be any further use.furthermore if you do use it of course it will deteriorate. and some day when youre gone your great descendant is going to come onto rknives or whatever and say this knife belonged to by great great grandfather so i rubbed it with steel wool and baking soda to restore it to its former glory and ruin the whole bloody thing as we see far too often.So you can either buy a brand new knife and sit on it or use a knife and create a short term legacy.I would definitely want stainlessto avoid hairtrigger restoration morons and youre probably safe with anything other than a leather handle.Get one with mammoth that shits been around a long enough time. lolI actually think Ivory will have probably a great deal of collector value. One day when all the elephants are gone you can tell your grandkids how man used to kill them for some bullshit reason. Thatll have value.,knives,cm6k05b,5,t5_2qzyn

2537863,0,t1_cmptc2m,The tip on the Civilian held up fairly well actually considering the amount of cardboard it was used to cut up. As I recollect in the end there was a small chip out of the edge of the tip sort of more of a small gouge than a chip actually and the tip itself did get bent a little out of shape probably due to my using it to pry out those big staples that get used to secure cardboard boxes occasionally but was quickly restored to straightness using a small hammer and anvil.None of that affected the effectiveness of the knife as either a tool or an intimidation device. It was my EDC for a couple of years and was used for any and every cutting need I had. Considering the abuse I gave it it didnt really show much wear at all.I had a friend who also had a Civilian also used as an EDC to massacre cardboard boxes and I remember that he did succeed in breaking the very tip of the knife off like just an eighth of an inch but as I recollect it was due to him dropping it on a concrete floor.,knives,cmpu2c0,2,t5_2qzyn

2551709,0,t1_cmrbrxr,Not sure about his prices but mine range from  unfinished to  finished depends on the amount of time each finish takes. An unfinished knife comes complete with unfinished or raw block scalesdepends on requested materials metal and CF scales come cut but unfinished. G wood and micarta come in raw blocks that need to be shaped and finished and a sharpened rough sanded blade ready to be powdercoated painted polished etc. Simple painted metal scales are  complex painted metal scales are  and finished CFgmicartawood are  depending on intricacy.Adding anything to the blade beyond polishing increases the price based on finish. Also blades are SV unless otherwise requested and can lower or raise the price depending on the blade material. a is cheaper titanium and Damascus will be more. I can only price based on my local material costs and time spent per knife so this just represents my pricing. I also do cloning which can lower the price as I dont have to do a ton of work to rough out a new design just have to adjust for material tolerances. Honestly any hobbiest knife maker will charge whatever they want to. I try to base my prices on materials and labor but try to be fair on labor as much as possible. I charge hour labor. The drawback is if I spend  hour and  minute on your piece youre paying for  hours of work because Ive already promised that two hours to you and I credit the remaining time to repairsreplacementsupgrades. It helps keep my costs down while providing the best service I can at a decent rate. For  you can have any custom knife you want from me under . Over  were getting into several thousand dollar range because you want a sword not a knife and I have to hire extra help to make long blades.Just as an idea of what someprobably most hobbiest blade smiths charge not because we are gouging you but because we have to spend a lot of time and money to make knives since we arent set up like a mass producer and have to pay to userent equipment buy materials and so on.,knives,cmrn8z7,-16,t5_2qzyn

3027165,0,t3_2usucn,You are always going to find this and not just in knives. What you have to do is shop for what you think is best.Under  youre not going to get a super steel but you can still get a good steel that holds its edge fairly well and will sharpen up easy. Some knives are slick  if you find that you want one with a good grip look for that. If you want a knife that is comfortable in your hand I suggest holding a knife before you buy it. There is no guarantee that its going to be perfect for your hand. Assisted knives in that price range by good brands like CRKT and Kershaw seem to have no problems except they do wear out eventuallyand were talking in years but the company will take care of it for you.It really depends on what knife youre talking about and its all based on person to person. You may find the knife perfect while the next person hates it. So you really have to take peoples reviews with a grain of salt and find out for yourself.It doesnt matter what price range youre in someone is bound to find something that isnt perfect and it doesnt mean that youll think the exact same thing as them.I would go for a knife that you like the design of no matter the reviews. Make your own opinion.Do you want to know the best knife I have or the favorite knife of mine that I own? Those are two completely different things lol. My favorite knife I own is my CRKT Wrinkle. It doesnt fall short at all it could have a tip up option but thats not the end all be all function for meanymore. Its handle isnt super grippy but I dont need it to be as long as I have a good hold on it. It fits perfect in the hand. The blade shape is excellent and slices right through everything. The jimping on it is nice but not too aggressive. The blade steel is not the best out there but it is a decent steel that holds an alright edge and sharpens up easily. The blade is centered there is no blade play it locks up solid and fires like a rocket with the slightest push of the flipper. Overall its an excellent knife and I love it. Oh and its only    over your  mark.,knives,cobri1t,1,t5_2qzyn

Why havent you sent it in then?You get a lot for your money with their China knives...if made in USA is that important to you then dont be cheap  pay for one of their knives that was made in USA. The fact that they even offer to fix a knife that probably doesnt make as much profit as their higher end knives says something to me.

5142977,0,t3_3lfq7j,To my Canadian understanding of the law regarding stiletto knives is that they are a type of knife within the classification of an automatic knife. Automatic refers to a knife that has a button or trigger to deploy the blades that requires no other interaction like a flick knifeThe difference that may help you find an easytoopen knife is that often assisted opening knives are allowed at least where I amThis does not include the use of gravity but rather usually a tab on the back of the blade that you can push that helps to deploy the blade.Your best bet is honestly to go to your local police department and ask about the specifics of what is allowed and not allowed in a polite manner they are usually very willing to clarify legislation for you.

5201633,0,t1_cvccvvh,I personally disagree with the sentiment about it being easier to learn on medium grit stones compared to coarse ones  at least in my case it wasnt until I started using coarse stones and actively reprofiling that things started clicking because the changes in my technique manifested themselves in edge changes fast enough for me to identify and adapt. Im sure it depends on the person and their learning environment though. As long as you practice on knives you dont mind making ugly and wasting some steel from I think using coarse stones as a beginner can be a lot of help. But as always uuncannygodot s info is spot on. The norton crystalon or smaller economy stones are very cheap and functional coarse stones if you dont mind making the change from oil stones to water stones which I often do but its a bit irritating because of extra steps. You can even take a gamble on the cheap stones at ace hardware or the like they can vary wildly in characteristics some fine for bevel setting others not so much. Another cheap option are the king k   combo stones that have a coarse stone on one side  these are like  bucks on Amazon. Youll probably burn through that thin coarse stone relatively quickly but it will get you a functional coarse waterstone in the short term without being too spendy. Ive also seen coarse king and naniwa stones listed cheaply on ebay if you want to take that gamble.,knives,cvczndr,2,t5_2qzyn

5389554,0,t3_3otcbw,Carbon steel is not hard to care for. of it is just keeping it clean and dry especially around food which tends to be salty. When you use it just see that its clean and dry before you put it back in the sheath. Oiling it is helpful but not strictly necessary its more important if you live in a damp climate. If you might be cutting food with this knife get a little bottle of mineral oil. If you are not using it for food any oil or rust protectorant will be fine.Hoppes gun oil not the gun cleaner the oil is just pain old mineral oil and is perfect for this use. That little bottle will last a lifetime and youll never have a squeaky hinge on a door again.Put a single drop on the blade smear it around with your fingertips theres plenty for both sides and wipe off the excess with a paper towel. You want to leave a barelydiscernable thin film thats all you need.Carbon steel will discolor and it can happen within minutes of cutting into an acidic food like an apple. The discoloration is called a patina and most of us consider it a desirable thing it builds over time and give he knife a nice character. Many of us force a patina with things like vinegar or mustard or gun bluing solution but a natural patina has its own charm. You can scrub it off if you want but it actually helps protect against rust. It changes color over time it might look blue or gold or even reddish for a while but it fades to grey after a few weeks.A little rust if it happens is not the end of the world either. Scrape it off with the edge of a copper penny or some fine steel wool used in combination with plenty of oil. Itll still cut just fine.,knives,cw0kqwh,1,t5_2qzyn

5473357,0,t3_3q0w6z,Spyderco have achieved a perfect finger deployment even gloved in the case of the larger holes by taking something away from the blade instead of bolting on something additional and increasing the number of components and the complexity.The Spyderhole gives you a very good thumbhold on the blade and allows you to both open and close the blade until the lock engages even withagainst the spring of a backlock with equal confidence. It also doesnt get in the way when cutting as thumb studs can do in some cases.Not only is it reductionist it is perfectly functional and to some people aesthetically pleasing!

5788329,0,t3_3uet18,I agree that an Opinel   or  is a solid choice I have several Im going to suggest a Swiss Army Knife. Im a former Boy Scout amp I carried a Tinker Phillips instead of the cork screw for  years before during amp after my Scouting stint. When I lost it I replaced it with another Ive used every day for the last  years or so.The rules mustve changed since I was a Scout. If they require a locking folder there are SAK that lock. I used to carry a fixed blade in the field IIRC it was some sort of official BSA knife by Western Case or something. It was ish clip point with a stacked leather handle like a miniature KaBar.If I were outfitting a Scout of my own Id go for a SAK Tinker for personal use food prep grooming etc an Opinel  or  whittling skinning light bushcraft and a Mora Companion or FireKnife heavier bushcraft. If your not afraid of the extra maintenance Id go carbon on the Opinel. Youll get a sharper blade if better edge retention plus develop a cool patina for added character.,knives,cxelhkv,4,t5_2qzyn

I have a Spyderco Sharpmaker and after a little practice had gotten to where I could get a pretty good edge with it. Then I read about somebody who was talking about what a great edge he got with sandpaper. I could not resist so I got a bunch of different grits and tried it for myself. I totally ruined my knife a cheap one. There are many who say they sharpen with one thing or another concrete floors coffee cups car windows and many others. Some might work but if you really like your knife use your common sense and learn how to sharpen with something traditional Sharpmaker Lansky etc then when you are confident and have a couple of knives you dont mind ruining try the sandpaper. ,knives,cxrqxh0,1,t5_2qzyn

6186414,0,t1_cysassn,Ok so if you have any questions at all. To what will no doubt be me incoherently rambling feel free to ask me to explain in further detail. Sharpening is grinding steel until you form a clean edge apex. No matter how people tell you to do it. What you want to do is use whatever method you choose to make the two sides of the edge bevel to meet at as clean a point as possible. I would advise you to get a benchstone of some sort guided systems are easy to pick up but not at all versatile. For edge angles i would probably advise that you at the start try to follow the pre established angle of the knife on a benchstone this is as easy as laying the entire bevel flat on the stone. sharpness and cutting ability are to different things. Sharpness is determined by the edge apex if its a clean and even apex then its sharp. polishing the apex using progressively finer stones will reduce the slicing agression and improve push cutting ability for most everyday use cutting rope cardboard etc. a fairly coarse edge would probably serve you best. for a skinning or kitchen knife a more polished edge would serve you better as it is less about sawing through things and more about making a clean cut.Cutting ability is determined by the geometry of the knife. Thinner knives cut better simply because there is less steel to push through whatever you are trying to cut. this also applies to the edge angle as a lower angle means that the knife thickens slower.The idea behind sharpening serrations isnt different from sharpening a straight edge but it does require some special equipment like some wetdry sandpaper wrapped around a wooden dowel or some diamond needle files.now go look up the following people on youtube,knives,cystwxq,4,t5_2qzyn

If you want to fine tune the action take off the locking ring and then gently pry the inner ring apart. Usually tight action is from the ring squeezing a little too hard. Be careful. Its pretty easy to mess up the finish of the locking ring when taking it off and the inner ring when prying it. Also if you tune it to have a little looser pivot make sure to use the lock in the open and closed position. Wouldnt want it to come open in the pocket. ,knives,czj29ry,3,t5_2qzyn

You have to keep the blade clean while cooking I have a sink next to my prep and after cutting something like and onions or tomato will run the blade under water to neutralize the acid. Some people will use a damp towel. It doesnt take long to form a patina and you probably wont have to baby the blade as much. Alternatively you can force a patina by leaving mustard any acidic food set for a minute or two and then wash off.,knives,czteqyp,6,t5_2qzyn

If the blade moves from the grinding pressure you will not get a consistent bevel. I had the problem of not being able to put a really sharp edge on my knives. I started clamping up a little higher or I should say deeper into the clamp going with a shallower angle to avoid hitting the clamp tip with the stone and I got a better edge. Of course follow up with really good stropping and you should have a nice edge.,knives,d0yz44s,1,t5_2qzyn

The company is one of the last few who are still making their knives using the old fashioned forging method where metal is heated and shaped to form with hammers as opposed to the stock removal method cutting metal away from a sheet into a form of a knife that most companies do today. And not only that their knives are customized to each customers preference. The wait list is about  years.Source Randall Knife Company wiki,knives,d2o54o3,10,t5_2qzyn

WD and a scrub pad or fine steel wool should get it off if just surface rust.  Maybe something like barkeepers friend would work too.Once clean you have a couple options.  You could put a patina on it or you could coat it with oil to prevent rust.  There are lots of ways to do a patina so Google that one.If oiling use mineral oil if you want to keep the knife food safe.  You can find it with the laxatives at wally world.  If you dont care about it being food safe then any oil would work.  Dont use wd as its not actually oil.  If oiling make sure the knife us totally dry before applying if it is wet oil will just keep the moisture in and encourage rust.,knives,d435cbe,1,t5_2qzyn

Yea they look like an old mans knife but who cares it cuts well and stays sharp for a long while isnt that what you got a knife for anyway?  Can you remember the last time you got into a knife fight ?  Me either no one outside of military or rescue needs a super fast opening knife.  My grandmother has one that her brother brought her back from France after WW still locks up great and she still uses it to cut her irises every year.  If thats not the definition of a quality blade then I dont know what is.

You may be safe and appropriate with the knife in every way but everyone can make a mistake which can lead to you getting hurt. Your parents may not want to risk that.That being said theres no harm in trying! If you screw up that just makes a learning experience whether it is small or large. So one of the things your parents are probably worried about is whether or not you will do dangerous things with the knife when they are or are not around. I think the only way around that is to compromise. You can say that they can hold on to the knife and you can use it if they ask and only use it under their supervision. Once they feel comfortable and possibly trust your knife skills some more they may loosen these restrictions.You can also ask if they would feel more comfortable if they helped choose a knife that they didnt feel threatened by. If you could compromise with them on what type of knife youre getting it might influence their decision even more.Good luck!,knives,d5i29zz,1,t5_2qzyn

8490486,0,t1_d60q68w,The hardest part about sharpening a knife is making sure your grip on the knife is strong enough to keep your angle solid going and coming. Dont be scared to put a kungfu grip on it but just make sure you are putting your grip back the way it was when you switch.When i sharpen knives i start with a  grit you want the whole blade to be equally dull throughout the edge so when you are done the blade is equally sharp. The length of the knife blade sees different amounts of usage so if the knife has been used for a while its just better to do a quick rehone then I take it to a  then to  and if im feeling cheeky ill put it on my  to make sure that if I do cut myself it will just go clean through. Hope this helped with the technique. I would buy a shitty plastic handled knife from walmart and wear that thing out until you can get the technique down.,knives,d62uxbl,2,t5_2qzyn

9341888,0,t1_d904wkj,okay thats most likely not sharpening evenly and i have made a quick set of drawings to show why. a dull knife is essentially a knife where the edge has rounded over. when you sharpen it to a burr on one side you have removed a lot of steel to create a new fresh edge after that you do a quick sharpening on the other side to remove the burr. but most of the actual steel removal was done on the first side thus creating the uneven bevel.as for what is usually causing people trouble when sharpening as for not getting a sharp edge. it often comes down to them not properly removing the burr. once you have finished removing the burr i would recommend going really lightly on the stones as in just barely touching the knife and switching side every  strokes. do that a couple of times each side.if that doesnt work then try the same finishing steps but at a slightly higher angle as in  degrees higher.,knives,d905gt1,1,t5_2qzyn

There are counterfeits out there and they are not at all representative of what the knife should be awful fit and finish and nearing dangerous with how poor the lockup can be. The PM is a hell of a first knife. Ive owned pocket knives since I was  years old and the the highest quality knives Ive bought have been sub  ESEE IZULA and Benchmade minigriptillian. Id recommend strongly that you do a little reading to try and acquaint yourself with knives and terminology and how to safely handle them. You could easily have a hospital trip in your future from mishandling a PM.Edit Sorry just looked back and realized that I assumed that this was your first knife though you never stated so.

10730948,0,t3_5tippr,Man its hard to beat a Delica. Its pretty light  and slim already. The Native  is a knife that Ive found to be like a perfected Delica. It has the same cutting edge length but a little more blade overall. Its a touch lighter at .oz. Its a touch thicker but also slimmer from spine to back when in the pocket. Its made of thicker blade stock so the lockup is more solid. It has the improved ergonomics of the finger choil. Its in svn so a vast steel improvement over the Delica. The one downside is the clip really sucks so youd want to get an aftermarket clip.

Its hardened steel and it will be slow. If you use a power tool the new tip will likely overheat and lose hardness its tricky to prevent that.

10950610,0,t3_5wdyms,Well if you want an absolutely silly knife a VDK war admiral. Now with the silly out of the way I would personally suggest a boker urban trapper with with the wooden handles a lot of bang for your buck comfortable thin and with a nice blade for engraving. If you dont like that a benchmade griptillian would be a great choice too small compact with great ergonomics and it is extremely comfortable to carry. The lionsteel Kur is another great knife it uses an unusal steel but looks nice and is very comfortable in the hand though from my limited experience with it the pocket clip did easily get caught and rough up my pockets. The Mcusta tactillity is coming from one of my personal favorite companies a great knife with a nice broad blade for engraving my only gripe is the lack of a flipper or thumb studs. If it is legal in your area the protech whiskers is a great automatic gentlemans carry and with the new ones with the copper handle inserts I can see that being an awesome area to engrave. The quartermaster quiaken with titanium handles is a pretty nice knife even though the company itself doesnt have the best reputation but none the less the knife offers itself to some great engraving and its small profile is easy on the edc front. The spyderco paramilitary  or  would be very nice offering great ergonomics and blade material and the blade is fairly large for engraving. At the very top of your budget the WE knives O or H are very nice and could be engraved. And at the very end the Zero tolerance knives the Jens Anso flipper the  the BW and the  are all great knives with titanium handles allowing for a great are for engraving.,knives,de9h7ls,3,t5_2qzyn

10957250,0,t3_5whaia,OK something important to know here.Sewers smell bad because things decay in there. Decay removes oxygen from the air. Whenever you go into an enclosed space where organic things have decayed you might be going into a lowoxygen environment. Whats worse is that hydrogen sulfide a common component of sewer gas is also a deadly poison.The problem with a low oxygen environment is that it feels fine. You wont have any trouble breathing or feel bad. Youll just get dizzy pass out and die.Youre probably OK if its ventilated  if you feel a breeze on your face that means there is an opening at the other end. Almost every tunnel of any size has a constant breeze going through it because there are always air pressure differences from one end to the other.If you do not feel a breeze that probably means you are entering an unventilated chamber and if there is organic decay in there it is very very dangerous. Its the kind of mistake you make just onceEdited to addDont go when theres rain in the forecast either!,knives,dea5usx,16,t5_2qzyn

While theyre nice for cutting rope they make the knife almost impossible to sharpen there and a well sharpened flat blade can still make short work of almost anything serrated blades can. As for the blade shape I like sheepsfoot but the difference between these two is not large enough for you to see much of a difference that is really more about preference. Sheepsfoot is nice if you want to make slicing cuts and it can be easier to pierce but you dont have a flat edge in it so its up to you.,knives,dexhoti,1,t5_2qzyn

You can also make your own kydex sheath You can find a ton of YouTube tutorials on that. ,knives,dfok7dg,1,t5_2qzyn

11487143,0,t3_63yec3,There are two things that can affect the rockwell C reading of a blade. . martensitic hardness. carbidesmartensitic hardness is by far the biggest factor in determining the hardness of a steel to the point that the carbides almost dont matter. martensite is the strongest phase of steel and it is what you are aiming to get when you heat treat the steel.carbides are small very hard inclusions in the steel. think of them as the rocks you would put in concrete to make the concrete wear slower. some steels have a higher carbide content than others svgtcmmartensitic hardness is never an issue for the stones as the abrasive in the stone is always harder than the maximum hardness of martensite. what can cause trouble is if there is a lot of vanadium carbide present in a steel such as in sv. but i wouldnt say that diamond plates would ever be necessary. as a well maintained silicon carbide stone can still quite easily deal with sv.,knives,dfy2e9z,2,t5_2qzyn
