1564499,0,t3_2c6ayu,I cant type a thorough answer to this now since Im on my phone but the quick answer is that cognitive linguists dont follow Chomskys theories. Cognitive linguistics was created as a reaction to generative grammar so its a bit like asking how the republicans theories fit into the democrats theories or something along those lines. Also there is more wrong with generative grammar than just the fact that it is symbolic .  It has many theoretical downsides for describing language it makes claims of cognition and language development that are antiquated if not entirely misguided. Anyhow Im a cognitive linguist as well as an experimental cognitive scientist and Im happy to talk more about this if youre interested when I get back to a computer later. ,cognitivelinguistics,cjcdshn,4,t5_2tf6g
