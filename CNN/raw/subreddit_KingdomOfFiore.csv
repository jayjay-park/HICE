9693060,0,t3_5docyr,Evening Star GuildOCC This is an open thread for all of Evening Star Members. Feel free to interact with anyone in the guild be it Player or NPCKurt sat at the bar drinking and chatting to the barman discussing the news that Guild Master had delivered. The converstation was in reality one sided Kurt too happy to let the barmen say a word. Kurt was already packed for the trip his small bag flled with pieces of paper pens and enough drinks to get himself through the day.All of the strongest mages were gone and the job in Algor was up to the weaker mages. Kurt knew that alot of people in the guild wouldnt appreciate being called weak but it didnt bother Kurt in the slightest.The mages of the guild that were left seemed thoroughly excited all of them ready to leave the guild and go on an adventure. Kurt finished his drink and moved off to the gathering room where everyone was to gather before leaving. Kurt was one of the first there and he sat down waiting for his companions and friends to show up.,KingdomOfFiore,da7vizw,1,t5_3h7jv
