309328,0,t3_1xn1uk,Unfortunately Ive been waiting for a long time VelKoz is likely neither. He is a researcher the Viktor of the Void. Going on the assumption that KogMaws father is the leader of the Void invasion VelKoz would likely serve him directly. In MY opinion that means we can probably expect a lot of Void activity and possibly see Koggy senior soon enough.,loreofleague,cfctvnv,5,t5_2xuqg
483427,0,t3_1znhig,I like Lissandra way more now. The thing is whats up with them not telling us the lore?? Why are they keeping the lore to themselves??,loreofleague,cfv7w55,1,t5_2xuqg

1828155,0,t1_ck9h786,There is no hype train for the Shurima update Riot is treating it more like wet fart than anything whereas the Freljord update had better teasers music videos highlights... etc. All we are getting is things shoved into our face no subtle reveals no coy smiles just straight rushing us through it. Its ridiculous. ,loreofleague,ck9hgl7,-1,t5_2xuqg
