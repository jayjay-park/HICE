250162,0,t3_1wx0ik,I think I would be more interested to see the results of the test if the questions were in English.When I think of composing a story in Russian with say a house being a protagonist I dont doubt it will be a boy if I am to choose the gender because the word  is grammatically masculine in Russian and the story goes much smoother if you call it he all the time. If I am to have a feminine house in a story I would probably give her a name like Mary.I know in Spanish la casa is feminine so they might feel different about such a protagonist.However Im not sure what gender I would attribute to a house if I were to compose a similar story thinking in English.

Does agree mean agree with stem cell research agree that it exists agree that it works something else?The question ending Do you think that stem cells should be taken from embryos? is out of scientific context and therefore leadingbiased. I suggest you study how this is done accurately.The question Would you support embryonic stem cells if they came from is unclear do you mean support embryonic stem cells as in nurture them and perhaps allow them to live or do you mean support research using embryonic stem cells? Also the first option is unclear is it meant to imply from an embryofoetus or from the womb itself?The question starting Stem cells from donors have the potential to develop into an embryo and become a clone of the donor. is misleading. Nonstem cells from nondonors also have the potential to develop into an embryo and become a clone.The question Who do you think should fund stem cell research? should by multiselect.

2525683,0,t1_cmnmjjp,Yeah fuck nuance right guys? Everyone just stop discussing moral quandaries and accept my blackandwhite definition!Wait no. What does agree mean? If a persons decisionmaking is constrained by explicit or implicit threats can they truly agree? If person B believes that person A will physically harm them if they say no or that theyll receive a promotion if they say yes how do we evaluate their choice? By your definition there is no difference between the two scenarios Person B and Person A are coworkers and have a flirtatious relationship although Person B is somewhat shy. At the company party Person B and Person A share a few drinks. They are both tipsy but person B is drunker. Emboldened by alcohol Person B suggests that the two find somewhere quiet to talk. The two end up going back to Person Bs apartment and having sex. Person B wanted to have sex with Person A while sober but would have been too shy to suggest it so Person Bs drunkenness led to them having sex with Person A. Person A and Person B are coworkers but barely know one another. At the company holiday party Person A uses social pressure to convince Person B to have more drinks than they wanted to. Person B ends up very drunk. Person A then offers to give person B a ride home. Person B accepts. Person A follows person B into their house and initiates sex. Person B gives consent but is so drunk that they seem confused about what is going on.I do not think that a reasonable person would view these situations as equivalent from a moral perspective from my perspective it would be reasonable to call scenario  rape but unreasonable to call scenario  rape. Of course I designed these situations to be fairly unambiguous but there are lots of situations in the middle. What if Person A and Person B dont know each other before the party but at the party Person B is suddenly acting flirtatious? What if Person A and Person B have a flirtatious relationship in general but Person A also pressures Person B into having a few extra drinks? What if Person B is married? Its easy to adjust the situations to make them very grey indeed  and thats why we need to talk about what rape means.,SampleSize,cmo8s68,3,t5_2tlqg

Using something like surveymonkey or google docs  to build a free survey that asks your target demographic middle and high schoolers those questions would be a good start to gather that data.  Do you know how to build a citation?  YN Do you use MLA citations? YN.  There are lots of ways to ask this question.  Perhaps building a list of anonymous questions?    You could also get teachers in your school to support you in your survey so that you can gather data for your own school which is the question you really want isnt it?  It wouldnt make a lot of sense if all the Redditors who respond are MLA freaks from Finland who know how to build citations out of the crade.

4959052,0,t1_cujgs03,I felt the same. The Catholic Church recognized that same sex attraction is real and is inborn but considers it to be that persons cross to bear just like some others are slothful etc.. They do not consider homosexual people to be bad or evil or even sinful unless they act in an unchaste way. Similarly heterosexual couples are also held to the same standard and are required to live chastely. Within the bonds of matrimony heterosexual couples are allowed to have sex  for procreation. This is why condoms and birth control arent allowed. And this is why same sex marriage is not allowed in the Catholic Church there is no possibility for offspring. Catholicism doesnt base its teaching on same sex marriage on the Old Testament since thats a flawed argument the new covenant is no longer bound by the laws of the old. Instead it is based on really quite cold and impartial logic. ,SampleSize,cujmm9v,6,t5_2tlqg

However I stand by my statement that I dont really know beyond the Anglophone world and it makes sense to me that in nonAnglophone countries the practice of not eating animals or their products would be referred to differently in English or otherwise. As prevalent as English may be in India the native speaking English population is still a fraction of a percent of the population. Linguistically speaking English in India would not be considered modern English parlance for this reason. Ive a casual interest in Linguistics as a topic so I guess for me it was obvious I was going by that definition but in retrospect I probably should have been explicit.So I also stand by my statement that its much more common to say dietary veganism or something to that effect in modern English parlance with the addendum that I am using a linguists definition.Im not too sure if those ideals have direct links to veganism Id find it fascinating if there was evidence suggesting that though but youre spot on there are definitely movements similar to veganism that predate it.,SampleSize,cz5dpyu,1,t5_2tlqg

8401874,0,t3_4uopwu, Are video games beneficial or harmful to the learning process?Why or why not?Both. To play a game you must first learn it and this improves your ability to learn new things. Some games have smaller learning curves so they arent has helpful while others can be more helpful. They can also be harmful because of how addictive they are. In my opinion the addictiveness outweighs the benefits. How have video games increased in popularity in schools?if you know of any waysMobile games are easily accessible so everyone has them. What skills have you learned from gaming?teamwork reflexes etc.I learned to not get as frustrated when my expectations are shattered and how to keep an improvement mentality. This is from primarily playing competitive games at a high level of play. How have video games affected your life in a bad way?Im addicted. It consumes a lot of time. When I find a new game that I like it takes over all my free time and things like exercise and relationships often get pushed to the side. Also the gaming community is pretty immature. As they say your IQ is the average of the people you hang out with and experiencing the gaming community for extended periods changes me in a way different than studying hard at school or working with older people did for me. What has gaming done beneficial in your life?Im more stoic and competitive. I always feel ready to take on challenges knowing I can keep a calm mind and improve along the way. What do you think the future of gaming may do tofor people in the future?The future of gaming clearly rings the VR bell and its irrefutable that itll cause people to become more reclusive as gaming already has. Sure there are some benefits but overall its a poor influence.,SampleSize,d5rs3yb,1,t5_2tlqg

It could change in the next one but by the end of TFA it felt more like a platonic friendship and it was probably written to divert away from romance.

9004510,0,t1_d7u13i1,Well for me personally its because I was traumatized as a little kid. I went in to have them remove a single tooth that was loose but wouldnt come out. When they examined my mouth they found another two they thought should come out and so asked my mother for permission to do so. Trusting fully in their competence as dental professionals she conceded but rather than the  they had permission to remove I lost  teeth that day. Those last  they did not ask for permission. One of those teeth a back molar would not grow back in for  years. I was probably  or  at the time so thats almost half of my lifetime thus far spent with a gap where there was once a supposedly loose tooth.Additionally I was underanesthetized and cried the whole time and most of the day afterwards and iirc it broke one of my teeth which would later need a cap. I say iirc because this was a long time ago and Im fuzzy on the details I definitely had a cap around that age but whether it was tied to the traumatizing procedure mentioned here I cant recall for certain.Needless to say we did not return to this dentist. Id say we shouldve sued but Im not sure my parents couldve handled the legal fees nor would they have known how to proceed. Luckily my dentists since then have always been wonderful kind and understanding people whove done wonders to help me get over my fear of dentistry if not completely then at least in part. Additionally Im terrified of needles and I always worry about any sort of procedure that might involve novocaine injections.My mother had a somewhat similar experience with a bad dentist. When she was a child she had an unprofessional and aggressive dentist who never washed his hands didnt wear gloves and chewed tobacco while working. He was according to her mean and would often handle her roughly. Various incidents with him instilled a similar fear in her and she would avoid dentists for most of her adult life until my father convinced her to see his incredibly understanding dentist. A good thing too because her teeth were in a sorry state especially for a generally very healthconscious nurse such as her. She cried constantly the first few visits and needed a lot of anesthesia to calm down enough for even simple procedures.I hope that helps to understand why some people might have a fear of dentists. Of course Im sure its not all due to traumatic experiences as children for some Im certain that theres an innate psychological fear of dentists or their practices one that defies explanation like so many other phobias. This is much more difficult to understand Im sure as well as not something I have experience with,SampleSize,d7u7a9z,2,t5_2tlqg

10247804,0,t1_dc5366g,I dont believe that advertising revenue is the only viable way to keep a site up. I also think platform and site owners should quality control and screen ads better as it will push people away from their site if poorly controlled. The onus is on the business to make their adverts bearable  advertisers created this problem themselves and need to look long and hard in the mirror.Ive avoided ads for so long that when I do see them they just seem ridiculous because Im just not used to the conventions of it. I properly laughed aloud a few weeks ago at a billboard that was literally just a white background with a woman in a tracksuit and full makeup? Holding up a yoghurt pot and saying she does well at sports cause the yoghurt keeps her regular. Its just stupid. Ads for cars that dance and bounce around a CG background to a loud indie track but tell you nothing about the technical specifications of the car. I even hear ads made by the company I work for and they sound ridiculous. We produce a product thats  ethically sourced and a percentage of the profits goes to charity they didnt mention that at all just a  second ad of a woman saying chocolate chocolate chocolate. I fucking dispair. and No wonder people block them. People are sick of empty aspirational messages. We dont shop like people did back in the s.

10500935,0,t1_dcy11wq,It was a very weirdly made survey but I guess this was the point of it to show some subtle differences between cultures. For example I am from Romania. In here and I guess eastern Europe in general or at least the Balkans we have more of a group mentality. If  friends would plan a trip and one of them cant go on that trip that is a really good reason to cancel the trip. The point was to go together as a group on that trip. If one withdraws than the trip loses its point and it might just be considered cancelled as if the one other one wanted to do a solo trip he most probably would have planned things differently as in this example the girl would have gone to Iceland. I expect that in your culture the mentality is more like when  friends plan a trip together it is because they both just wanted to do that trip and if it just so happens then why not to go together. Then if one withdraws the other one can just go on with the trip he is not at all affected. Neither mentality is better than the other one.

10525732,0,t3_5qp8tp,The thing with Connor makes sense I think.  In Englishmajority countries English names will be the norm.  English names are the default mainstream names of society.  So nonwhite parents might want to give their child a mainstream name so that they can fit in and not be marked as an outsider by their nonmainstream name.  Like I know quite a few Asian kids whose parents are immigrants and gave their children very English names specifically because they wanted their kid to fit.  But there is no real reason for someone nonAsian to want to fit in to Asian culture within an English speaking country.  If asked if a person named Connor living in Japan was white then I would be fairly certain.It might be interesting to see the difference between a name like John and something like Johann.

Being taller means more bones and blood and muscles and slightly bigger organs all which weigh something and thats not including body fat and additional muscles from exercise.Are you trying to see if theres a magical fluctuation somewhere?

It merely assess if you have ever questioned thought about or wondered in the past hobbies that you would like to be associated with and variations of that factor.

Check out hackathons and youll understand what Im talking about. I feel its important to break away what news media and Hollywood have essentially rebranded.
