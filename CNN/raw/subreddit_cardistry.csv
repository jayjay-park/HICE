1498447,0,t3_2bc6sq,The thing about improving is that you shouldnt see things as too difficult and thus not attempt it. Just give the harder stuff a go it may take a while but youll get it. I forced myself to learn Pandora even when all I knew was sybil. I took about a week to even get the moves down but its very easy to learn anything else now.Another thing you could try is learning the more progressive cuts. Such as Madonna  and . They have elements that are similar to each other but get progressively harder. After that proceed to Jackson ... haha.I guess the best way to learn any cut is just to break it into very small portions. No matter how big or difficult the cut is as long as you do the small parts well youll learn it no problem! Good luck! D,cardistry,cj43sag,1,t5_2sjb1

I have a couple sets of bikes Im using now but I was thinking that I could use the  extra virtuoso decks for learning cuts if I went for  more instead of . A big part of it is deciding how much money I wan to sink into the hobby at the moment. Additionally I know I could always get more decks next year but that is still quite far away. One final note. Could you explain a dead deck to me? What are the signs that a deck is done and how does it affect flourishes?,cardistry,cq2z5gf,2,t5_2sjb1
3752967,0,t3_337r8n,Mechanics grip should have your index fingerpointer at the top of the deck and the pinky at the side. The pinky moves to the back of the deck when youre in straddle grip but your index should still stay on top here. Im not familiar with any grips where your index rests on the side of the deck so I would fix it now if I were you. You need your index at the front of the deck for many flourishes and to help keep the deck aligned. ,cardistry,cqk2cqv,1,t5_2sjb1

There are other cardists in Spain that have taken it to the international level such as Sergio Roca which has published several tutorials on The Wire.Also the trend here is to follow what some of the most wellknown flourishers do. People here are into what Zach Mueller Dan and Dave and the Scandinavians do too.And as uMattBeaudouin said English is the language everyone uses to communicate at an international scale.

9785995,0,t3_5fcht1,I used to have this problem as well so I started to wash my hands before using any of my cards and it seemed to solve it for me. Humidity can be a factor as well just be aware of hand sweat. ,cardistry,dajc54p,3,t5_2sjb1
10133632,0,t1_dbsbaap,sorry auto corect haha but yea if you wer your hands under the sink then dry them off a bit youll make your hands a little sticky and you can learn new stuff trust it works thats how i learned atm after days of pratice good luck! dont make your hands too wet but just a little will help you learn the mechanics of the moves,cardistry,dbsf1aa,1,t5_2sjb1
10196712,0,t1_dbztu15,Great point and i stand corrected about shutting down criticism because theyre just playing cards. In the whole scheme of things getting upset about a card color doesnt seem like the best use of time.

11462451,0,t3_63haqw,Hey! Weve stacked with these decks in early . Ininally we filmed a short promo video with them  and set a price in our shop at as low as  USD per deck. Since that time we had multiple orders both nation and worldwide and had to raise the price significantly due to extremely high demand. Anyways if youre interested we ship worldwide ,cardistry,dfv9fj7,2,t5_2sjb1
