You can not achieve this while staying on the bench.Dantes case is different. It looks like he has a solid place in the starting  with an injured Barstubber and competitors like Boateng and van Buyten but his form is starting to drop.

Mourinho gets a lot of shit for his mind games but at least hes willing to admit when his team didnt perform well enough. Wenger kept going on about Robben diving like it was the sole reason they lost a twoleg tie. He got the tactics wrong in the second leg seemingly playing for a draw when he needed goals. This is the reason Arsenal fans should be angry not any perceived diving.

611150,0,t1_cg9plmu,I could see the last  fixtures causing some trouble depending on how the relegation battle and Bayerns CL campaign unfolds. Stuttgart and Hamburg are right in the relegation battle at this point Bremen could very well be as well when they play in the Allianz Arena.The teams probably will fight for their lifes on the pitch while Bayerns players wont have anything to play for in the Bundesliga and their main concern is to not get injured for the hopefully waiting CL games. And the games are quite close to the CL semi finals at least the Hamburg and Bremen ones plus Braunschweig but I think they may be out of the relegation battle already at that point so I expect some heavy rotation by Pep.Hamburg and Stuttgart have some good players if they fight for all theyve got and play vs. a Bayern side mostly thinking about the CL I could see a loss there,fcbayern,cg9qnj6,3,t5_2sgxj

698903,0,t3_225zz2,Personally  I am nervous too. We have lost our very physical midfield assets and are now forced to work with a smaller lineup theres positives and negatives to this in my opinion. The positives I think will be this we will see more attacking Kroos playing deep and Gtze back in the starting line up will be hectic. Theyre both incredibly dynamic attackers with a healthy blend of technique and creativity. With Kroos playing deep he will naturally get forward both on and off the ball leaving Lahm very much alone holding possession in some instances Toni will need to be sharp and he will be asked to do a lot more defending than usual IMO. Assuming Mandzukic starts as well I think our pressing will be feral Man U will not be able to play long balls comfortably from the back something I think benefits us. However on the other hand our defensive presence in the midfield will be much more reliant on Lahms ability to both shield the back line while simultaneously applying pressure to Man U while theyre in possession. Again Dante and Boateng in the back I believe will be nice however I think Lahm may drop between them with more frequency to prevent being outnumbered on quick counters. Overall I think that because of these changes we will see a much more open style of play from Bayern taking advantage of open space and forcing one on ones both in the middle and on the wings. I also think that due to the nature of our lineup the back line will drop deeper and effectively eliminate the threat of long balls over the top. I expect Lahm and Kroos to do a great deal of work on both ends of the pitch.,fcbayern,cgjpupk,12,t5_2sgxj

That means the price will go up a bit. m for Benatia may not be enough anymore.If we sign Benatia for m he wont be a backup when Javi comes back. A m CB will be a starter. Even if everyone is fit.A m CB should be a top  CB in the world. He should be better or at least more consistent than Boateng Dante and Javi.So if we go for a m CB now why didnt we go for him before Javi got injured when we already didnt have that many fit CBs which are in shape?,fcbayern,cjs27e2,0,t5_2sgxj

3822288,0,t3_3478h9,To all the people blaming the referee I am sorry but no. If you miss  out of  penalties after having missed  hundertprozentige german for OHMYGODHOWCANYOUMISSTHAT during the game you really have noone to blame but yourself. Our ambition this season was to win the trebble and we had all the chances we needed to do it.That being said I am tired of discussing referees after big matches. There is so much money in soccer matches are so important and yet we are somehow expecting  humans to decide all contentious situations correctly? And no mistakes are not an integral part of soccer as some people have pointed out. I am never happy to discuss wrong decisions with colleagues they diminish victories and worsen defeats. They also dont even out at the end of the season let alone every game as every decision changes the flow of the game. Take the match against Leverkusen in the DFBCup quarter final Thiago should have seen a red card in a very specific situation which probably would not have arisen had the  by Lewandowski counted. I guess there has to be a clear noncall in a Champions League Final for such a system to be implemented similar to how the not given goal by Hummerls in  lead to the Goal Line Technology being implemented.Another point I wanted to mention is the apparent concussion of at least Lewandowski as well as probably Benatia. Research has shown that secondary impacts after receiving a concussion are extremely dangerous see Second Impact Syndrome and I think neither one of them should have been allowed back on the pitch. The problem here is who is supposed to make the call? The player surely is not going to especially when the stakes are even higher in a CL match the team doctor is going to get a shitton of flack if he prevents a player from going back in from all sides and the trainer wants his player back in as soon as possible. I think the only solution is to get neutral doctors to the sidelines to evaluate people.

Rafinha and his absolutely pointless air balls every time hes close to the box especially when there was noone being able to head the ball costa gotze Gotze not quite Lewandowski leaves everyone just hoping for him to get better and luckier next time as always Alonso getting subbed on meant slowing down the game he gets too much possession everyone just relies on him too much hes like that kid that everyone passes to each time they get the ball because they dont have enough confidence in themselvesCouldve been easily  when being realistic  when being optimistic.

Take your pain medication with a small amount of food and take it before pain restarts.  Your best bet for food is Ice cream  Make sure it doesnt have nuts in it  may go and gt stuck in the sockets Yogurt and cold blended soup also works.nd day you can start warm compresses  use a towel that has been warmed by steam.Full liquid diet is still a good idea but depending how much you can open  you might be able to move to soft mechanical diet  Anything as soft as or softer than scrambled eggsDont forget your Antibiotics if you are given any.Ask me any questions !Edit proof reading.,fcbayern,cv9f7gi,11,t5_2sgxj

A World Cup year or a EURO year has always troubled us. And then theres also the Confed Cup in  so basically our German NT players wont have any time for Bayern in the upcoming three summers. While I love the EUROs and the World Cup these years also always mean exhausted players who miss the biggest parts of preseason.As for club level its just fine in Germany. Liga Pokal and possibly European competitions. My opinion on the Europa League is divided. Its a good way of introducing these little clubs to European football.

5755002,0,t3_3tz6fc,Heres the thing lets face it hes never going to start over Lewy and Mueller in the big games he wont play a deeper role because he cant hell only start on the wings if  of Robbery and Costa get injured and you could very well make a case for Coman at this point. In the beggining of last season he was on fire unfortunatly due to Robberys constant injuries and our lack of depth on the wings made him play there for the second part of the season where he played terribly for the most part when he finally started picking up his form he got injured. I think this season is extremely important for his career here at Bayern if he underperforms regardless of injuries I believe hes getting sold because as of his latest performances theres no way in hell he should be earning more than Mueller Robben Neuer etc... and the fact that if we plan on offering him an extension well likely offer him less than hes getting now and I doubt hell take that. This of course if keeps playing the way he is now if he suddenly starts playing amazingly of course well do our best to keep him but as of right now I dont see a future for him here.,fcbayern,cxago5a,4,t5_2sgxj

Hes invested so much into the team the style of play clearly influenced which players to bring in learned the language the culture I could go on. It feels like he just got the team to where he wanted it. Why leave now? Sign for  more years and give yourself a few more chances at it. Make the fans happy.

Then again Bayern didnt create a big opportunity to score in the first half so obviously there is room for improvement.

Most of its fans are opposed to foreign investment ticket price paying for tv  how else you cant expect other clubs to hold on to players. Another thing that can solve this problem is scrapping cl and make super league  not breaking up domestic league  that can bring in extra  m. If we take out epl cluns from joining super league it will reduce their income by  m that they get from cl plus a league without european participation will lose its prestige.

Now thats up to him. Since we are probably going to use  CB that means he really has to perform. Or wait for an injury of his teammates. But Badstuber is also going to come back so... No clear answer but that sums up to him willing to fight to get first team football pretty much. Also we could get some decent money by selling him this summer rather than waiting another year.

8244191,0,t1_d57wnbz,I think hell do fine domestically especially given that the Manchester clubs pretty much picked over Dortmunds better players except Auba and the rest of the league isnt anywhere near us in terms of talent. His rotation issues at Madrid stemmed not from his own decisions but pressures from Perez and other higherups at Real that forced him to play new signings regardless if they were fit for his system or not. I think hed be able to rotate heavily with us given how deep we are.    If he has us playing the way Real played us in the CL in  well for sure get a large trophy haul. We also dont have to deal with Barca day in and day out which I think will also make Carlos life easier. Besides hes the king at cup competitions.

Mller only played in one of them on the right wing. Then theres two games against Barca which were completely atypical for Bayerns playstyle against the only team in the world that would have more posession than us in a game.

Alonso is doing well too. Costa is everywhere in a good way. Rafinha is playing his best game ever. Generally this is a huge improvement on previous weeks so lets not screw this up.Negative Lewandowski is being more selfish than normal and complaining every time Robben doesnt pass to him. Like actually throwing his arms around when Robben almost scored but didnt pass. Funnily enough Lewandowski doesnt seem to want to pass to anyone either. Being a really dreadful team player. This seems to be a regular occurrence every time him and Robben play together though they dont seem to have a good relationship on the pitch. Two amazing players but two massive egos.

Might lose the league and historically squandered a  lead with an away goal in Europe the competition Emery was hired for. Trapp was fucking shit and its not being talked about enough.Aurier and Kurzawa are awful.

11296203,0,t3_60uwlg,Okay story time.This is the story about how my father ate breakfast with Manuel Neuer.So basically my father has to go on meetings and conferences a lot. Often times he has to travel quite far for these and one time they stayed at a Hotel and it just so happened that there were also quite a few Bayern players present at the time. Well my father isnt es engaged into football as I am so he didnt care about the young and athletic men who were standing right next to him at the buffet. He told me they looked like students. Adding to the blatant obliviousness my father also didnt notice or maybe simply didnt care for how exited his coworcers were about those young men standing in line with them. Probably being annoyed he took his beakfast and went looking for a spot to eat his meal in peace. So he went to a young bloke sitting at a table and asked him if the seat next to him was taken which the young man denied. Well I dont know what Neuer was thinking at the time but he was probably expecting to be asked about football and an autograph. Well it turns out my father wasnt interested in that but would much rather talk about the quality of the food and other trivial stuff like the weather and how curious it was to meet a fellow German.So they sat there and talked about... well stuff. After the dinner my fathers coworkers where amazed how he had the audacity to simply sit next to Manuel Neuer as if it was... a normal person. Well and this is what Manuel Neuer was to my dad. A fellow German enjoying Wurscht Ks und ein Wckle. ,fcbayern,dfcep51,7,t5_2sgxj

11698412,0,t1_dgk0s7n,I agree with you for Robben but I dont think Ribery has the pace that Im talking about. Im talking about an Mbappe Walcott Aubamyang type player not saying we should invest in any of them. Thatd also mean risking both of our wingers in a very physical position and their age wont help them much here. Lewandowski naturally draws players to him because hes such a high profile player. I think that we need a less intimiadating younger or less high profile player to be Lewandowskis strike partner  someone to take some of the pressure from having Lewandowski as our spear head.
