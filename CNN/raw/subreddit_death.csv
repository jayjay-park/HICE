1192268,0,t3_27r5ir,Well since I dont believe in God I would want to know what the afterlife was going to be like and what kind of fate I would be experiencing. Also if it was too bad I would want to know if I could kill myself and cease to exist or if I have to suffer forever. ,death,ci3qyxy,1,t5_2qhe2

2341599,0,t3_2m1zzs,I highly recommend reading this interview of Stanley Kubrick by Playboy heres a snippet...gt Playboy If life is so purposeless do you feel its worth living?gt Kubrick The very meaninglessness of life forces man to create his own meaning. Children of course begin life with an untarnished sense of wonder a capacity to experience total joy at something as simple as the greenness of a leaf but as they grow older the awareness of death and decay begins to impinge on their consciousness and subtly erode their joie de vivre their idealism  and their assumption of immortality. As a child matures he sees death and pain everywhere about him and begins to lose faith in the ultimate goodness of man. But if hes reasonably strong  and lucky  he can emerge from this twilight of the soul into a rebirth of lifes elan. Both because of and in spite of his awareness of the meaninglessness of life he can forge a fresh sense of purpose and affirmation. He may not recapture the same pure sense of wonder he was born with but he can shape something far more enduring and sustaining. The most terrifying fact about the universe is not that it is hostile but that it is indifferent but if we can come to terms with this indifference and accept the challenges of life within the boundaries of death  however mutable man may be able to make them  our existence as a species can have genuine meaning and fulfillment. However vast the darkness we must supply our own light.I found it very comforting. Id suggest reading through this subreddit figure out exactly what you are so afraid of and confront it! Realize that every single person on Earth past present or future has to deal with exactly what youre going through right now.,death,cm14u6h,4,t5_2qhe2

3507722,0,t1_cps3hmo,I agree on your point about people try not to think about it. Death is the dont dare to tread on topic for most people. Ive kind of accepted death I occasionally feel sad and angry but not as often as I used to. Youve probably seen lots of people saying once you accept it you tend to feel better about it. Once you die you wont know which in itself is daunting but you wont have to be afraid. Id be glad to talk if you want to pm me,death,cps3sxy,1,t5_2qhe2
4610812,0,t3_3dkvzi,I sort of understand where youre coming from.For reasons I am not sure of Ive been having an anxiety about the fact that someday I will die or that someday people I love will. It probably got worse when I realized after working abroad that I am very far from the people that I love.It takes time for it to go away. Finding a distraction or having a hobby does. However in the long run if its still there I think seeing a therapist would help. You might be experiencing some kind of anxiety as well and you dont know how to deal with it.,death,ctbrx7p,1,t5_2qhe2

5001689,0,t1_ctl87rv,Believing anything is highly overrated.  Do you believe the police are your friends?  You shouldnt.  Do you believe the world is going to end in Sept ?  You shouldnt.But those eternal questions...they deserve some thought.  You are unlikely to get any proof of an afterlife this is personal.  You need to learn how to proceed without proof whether its death or its some moral principle.,death,cuow3f4,1,t5_2qhe2

6034342,0,t3_3x50je,I ll tell you whats my greatest purpose.I am  have no kids no wife never had a serious relationship and nothing to aspire for in the future.My GOAL is to help my parents and brother as much as i can and live the most peaceful life possible.Family is the only thing you really have in this world. As long as i can be here with them make them feel loved and allow them to love me i will keep on going.The day i have no one to make happy and no one to make me happy i ll just end myself as fast as possible.,death,cyam8uf,1,t5_2qhe2
6045221,0,t3_3y5e4j,I can only offer a little advice having gone through similar thoughts in the past.First I can tell you first hand after having to move in with my parents for a while in my s that my mind started becoming obsessed with similar thoughts about my parents dying. These thoughts lessened to a great extent when I moved out again. There is something about establishing a life of ones own that puts focus on other things. I dont have any kids but I do feel that my siblings who do are very preoccupied with their wellbeing of their children and not so much on our parents. Consider maybe buying an investment property in the future. A property you can fix up. A way to transition from spending all your time at your parents house to spending more time at a place of your own and creating an independent future.Secondly you could likely be your parents age before they pass away. Consider yourself lucky to have the potential of a lot of time with your parents  my parents had my last sibling when they were in their late s  s. Im  and both of them are aging but in relatively good heath. My Dads parents had passed away before he was   but they lived into their s.  Odds are you have a lot of time left wth your parents since they had you when they were younger.Third I think acceptance is key. Acceptance of our parents mortality our own mortality and that there is nothing we can do to completely avoid death. Perhaps the best we can hope for is a long life for our loved ones and ourselves.,death,cyc1a5l,1,t5_2qhe2

8164722,0,t3_4pa537,That is such an odd closing note. Id never consider living shorter but dying stronger. As a weak person I can still enjoy life even if I cant go out for more than an hour. But I guess to each their own...,death,d4y505k,1,t5_2qhe2
8274083,0,t3_4sr0ru,Ive heard about some pretty awfull ways individuals have died. Often torture methodsmurder but sometimes accidents too. Maybe youve seen it but Caitlin Doughty has a video where she tells of the worst death shes heard of and the podcast Last Podcast on the Left has an episode dedicated to worst deaths where the worst one was case in Japan.But for me personally I am mostly scared of drowning burning alive and falling from great heights. Also dying in a car crash because its quite likely and its so sudden but maybe the moment before is long enough for me to think of all I will miss out on and the people I leave behind.,death,d5bthu0,2,t5_2qhe2

10275325,0,t3_5n5f2m,Really well written and thought provoking man. From my point of view and Im not advocating for anyone to see things my way religion and science dont have to be in conflict.The physical world should be run on logic reason and scientific discovery. Religion seeks to teach us how to live and to show that there is more beyond this reality. To me it also teaches that love is the most important part of life tolerance of others views is needed and disagreement on issues is not the same as hate.Good luck with your efforts. I hope that you can overcome this and live your life the way you want to live it. ,death,dc8ri3x,5,t5_2qhe2

After lsd  its like my brain forces me to take other peoples feelings into consideration and see the world from their point of view.It is on acid that I came to the realization of what deatgh really is. How its just the end of lifes book  the end of the life cycle.It made me much more comfortable with the idea that we will all die  and to enjoy life while we live it.,death,dg7g3zv,2,t5_2qhe2
