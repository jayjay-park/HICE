41223,0,t1_cdst831,FYI DHS and DOJ attorneys have very little prosecutorial discretion in the immigration court system.  Once the determination has been made by the appropriate DHS officer the trial attorney pretty much has to take the case to its conclusion short of offering voluntary removal.  Its the way the system was designed to prevent EOIR and the INS have using too much discretion to circumvent immigration policy prior to the  Act.  Its one of the reasons why DHS attorneys hate working there as they just dont have the same authority most prosecutors have.  ,LawFirm,cej4ha9,1,t5_2thsj

Your cases will take double the time they should and you will charge rd the price that is just the reality. As you get more comfortable with cases you and only you can determine what to charge.  I know attorneys in my area that charge k for a DUI and attnys that charge k.  You pay for what you get. I charge about k  k. But I have the experience knowledge and know how to back that up. The K guys I know just plea people out regardless of what is in the police report. No motions no discovery nothing.
