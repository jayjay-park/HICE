11529738,0,t3_64ez37,Sorry to inform you but that information is located in this reddit. It was originally stickied but as the TTS progressed other posts took priority. Also this test is for people that are consistent and always pay attention the R subreddit and the TTS subreddit so if you dont have time because of work or school theres no need for you to participate. Just play the normal client version.,Rainbow6TTS,dg2wbvu,1,t5_3jb2v
