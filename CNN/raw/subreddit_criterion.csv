2496505,0,t3_2o6yq6,I think the classic definition of Classic Films lasts up until the end of the s as a few other posters have stated. Sure there were changes throughout the decades but the end of the Hays Code the decline of the studio system and the rise of New Hollywood really marked a clear divide in the timeline. But enough time has since past that I think the s can safely be included.Id be okay with  being the new cutoff except I grew up in an era where movies from the s such as Back to the Future and Raiders of the Lost Ark were already being treated as classics and I feel like the s arent that far behind. Fight Club LA Confidential and Good Will Hunting are all examples of films heralded as modern day classics... and theyre barely even  years old! Hell even a few s films such as Lord of the Rings The Departed and Up already have the classic moniker attached to them. Are those films the exception to the rule? Or should we wait until a whole decade can be considered classic before putting that label on other films? Personally Im okay waiting  years for something to become officially classic. By that point its become a part of the culture people have grown up on it and weve separated it from the other unimpressive or derivative films of the same time frame.,criterion,cmkfjha,1,t5_2sa39

5490352,0,t3_3q7rv2,Hi GuysGreat podcast. I really have been enjoying your discussions. This is fast becoming one of my favourite podcasts. Thank you for all your work. I was especially happy to hear you discuss the Brood. I have recently gotten a new appreciation for early Cronenberg through Criterion and was really happy you were discussing the new podcast.One piece of constructive criticism is I think it would improve your podcast to let go of the spoiler warnings. A criterion specific podcast on film is really going to appeal to the cinefiles and I suspect most of your listeners are not going to listen to an hour and a half discussion of a movie they have never seen. The tried and true format that many podcasts use is to have a brief general discussion of the film let people know if they should see it then dive into an open spoilery discussion of the film. Especially listening to your podcast of the Brood you spend a great deal of time warning about spoilers saying you cant or wont discuss something at a particular time due to spoilers or even discussing if something is a spoiler. I really feel your podcast should be a discussion of a film by people who have seen it. The spoiler talk just handicaps your discussion. Movie reviews try to get people to rent or see a film in theatres so should be spoilerfree. An indepth discussion of a film on a criterion podcast should be an open discussion similar to reading a great book on a film. Please consider it.Likewise worrying about language seems a bit silly. I dont swear much myself but do we think kids will be listening to this? Does the explicit tag really hurt you in iTunes? I just think not worrying about it will help you play whatever film clips you want in the future.I hope this feedback sounded ok and I apologize for any typos. Like I said I really enjoyed the podcast and despite all the spoiler warnings I felt you really had a great discussion. Thank you!,criterion,cwdfz6f,2,t5_2sa39

A lot of the criticism I hear is that it was meandering and the plot was dull but I mean come on the people making that argument need to look at cinema beyond Hollywood the type of cinema traditions where plot is secondary. Furthermore Boyhoods plot was just about life in all of its unstructured ups and downs. Lastly I just want to comment that Cinema is a time driven medium and that has been Linklaters premise for making movies. At the San Francisco International Film Festival when Boyhood premiered he said that that Sculpting in Time by Tarkovsky and Notes on the Cinematographer by Bresson helped influence him as a filmmaker. When you take into account the Time Model of Tarkovsky with the Bressonian Model and merge them you can kind of see that Boyhood is the result. I think its a great film and am very much looking forward the day it gets announced on criterion. ,criterion,cx84z27,2,t5_2sa39

7114258,0,t3_4d0ijp,I think that the priority of upgrading depends upon your level of obsession with pictureimage quality. Until January of last year I couldnt care less about bluray over DVD quality not that I didnt notice a difference it just didnt matter to me. However once I started collecting blurays and then Criterions I became pretty obsessed with the difference in picture quality and all of a sudden I couldnt settle for less than top quality imagewise and will only buy blurays now. If you arent there yet I wouldnt bother upgrading what you already own and in no way am I saying that in a condescending way some of the biggest cinephiles I know collect DVD only and couldnt care less about the difference in image quality it has no bearing on your love for film. However if you have an HD TV and want to explore bluray I strongly suggest buying blurays especially from Criterion from now on. If you find that you become accustomed to the look and it becomes a priority then upgrade those titles later on down the line.Short answer Yes buy blurays because the quality of the restoration is noticeably better. No dont upgrade your other titles until you feel it out. Except Eraserhead because that bluray transfer looks so good.,criterion,d1msrfw,15,t5_2sa39

See my other comment.I also want more of the forgotten Warner cartoons restored to BluRay. Song of the South and the original Fantasia with the racist centaur would probably be unpleasant but I think they should be preserved. Obviously Disney is never going to partner with Criterion.Belladona of Sadness is supposedly coming to BluRay. I dont care who releases it but I want to see the film.Persepolis has an alright BluRay release. Super cheap as well. Are you hoping for more special features? Plus I dont think its an amazing movie.Triplets of Belleville Im also not a fan of. It intentionally is inspired by Tati but is worse than all of his movies except Parade. The only BluRay for Triplets is region B locked and doesnt have an English audio track or subtitles there is minimal dialog in the film. So it would be nice to have in region A.Waking Life Ive covered in these commentsIt has a delightful German BluRay release. Arrow put it out in the UK and ruined its package design. Theyve taken the beautiful original poster  cover and made it into a me too generic W A KI N GL I F Ecover thats been done many times. Also its region B locked the German one is region free and has a slightly lower bitrate probably not noticable In short I hope Criterion emulates the German release and not the UK release. As best as I could tell the special features of each release are the same.I adore the animation style. Yet as a behindthescenes study of lowbudget filmmaking I want a special feature thats the fulllength live action version of the film. They completed and edited the movie in live action before they ever started animating it.Waltz with Bashir is also on BluRay. Ive only seen clips of it.Satoshi Kon is interesting.

11409108,0,t3_62mswx,Im a  yo male from Indianapolis and Ive been into Criterion since my friend and I had an intro college course on film. I was taking a junior level course as a freshman and I remember an overwhelming feeling of being stranded in a different country using a different language. My friend and I were surrounded by the most pretentious cinephiles who would dismiss Reservoir Dogs and Clockwork Orange but golf clap with upturned heads at BlowUp and The Lady from Shanghai because they were less mainstream. But the class did end up making us think about movies in a different way.Not long after the class my friendwhose movie collection dwarfs mine tenfoldstarted collecting Criterion films to study film more intensely. We fed each others addiction so I started my own little Criterion collection. I stuck to only American films that came out in the past  years. Things that crossed paths with popular culture. This was in .Now....anything and everything. Some of my favorite films are from the silent era. Kurosawa is a film god. Tone poems like the Qatsi trilogy mentally stimulate me. International films dont cause hesitation because I have to read subtitles theyre vibrant complex hilarious heartbreaking and everything in between. The Criterion collection has stimulated my universe.So between  and  Id say my tastes have completely changed. I still think my classmates were snobs ,criterion,dfp7jp0,1,t5_2sa39

11559208,0,t1_dg67i0n,If he said it in the film there might have been some truth to it. But nevertheless it doesnt look like he was relegated to that for the rest or even a significant portion of his life. It looks like the bulk of his films were made after the cultural revolution but he still had several made during the ten year cultural revolution period. Being a filmmaker itself isnt necessarily bourgeois but the content of his film if it was critical of the communist party or socialism could have definitely made it seem that way. Although I dont agree with the partys policies I can certainly understand why there were restrictions on proWestern and procapitalist film as communist states like Russia Cuba China etc. were under perpetual threat from the West as the United States among others were completely committed to overthrowing those governments. The United States even blacklisted some of its entertainers during the same period. Check out Paul Robeson for an extreme example of this. Id start with the documentary Here I Stand followed by Criterions boxset release. Plenty of filmmakers flourished during that time in China as long as they were making movies dedicated to class struggle and overthrowing the elites. After Mao which seems to be the period his work sort of flourished the communist party was only communist in name. They arguably became the most capitalist state in existence after Maos death. Interesting stuff nonetheless. Thanks for the post as I certainly agree with you on the need for some Chinese films in the collection. Given the nations history over the past  years itd actually be really nice to see some stuff from each time period that reflects the sort of developments the nation has undergone. ,criterion,dg68o3o,2,t5_2sa39
