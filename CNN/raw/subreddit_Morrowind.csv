7524,0,t1_ceerzug,Hey I was wondering if you guys were considering fixing some of the grammatical errors in TR books. I know it sounds nitpicky and you guys probably have a lot on your table right now but the most immersionbreaking thing Ive run into in Tamriel Rebuilt is the clumsy sentences inconsistent formatting and grammatical errors in the otherwise really good books. I even ran into a book which still has a outofcontext note attached at the end Rain of Sand. Seriously Im loving this mod so far but theres nothing that stands out as more of a glaring reminder that it isnt professionallycreated content than a poorly constructed sentence in the middle of a wellwritten text. I imagine that fixing everything wouldnt take more than a few hours and if it helps I could even provide a list of texts that need work. I hope this helpful. Ive only just started digging in to TRs content recently and Ive actually had no other problems or complaints.,Morrowind,cefak4i,6,t5_2r9nv

69457,0,t3_1uwg4e,I think most people here will agree with me when I say that the beauty of this game is that there isnt anything you should do its all entirely about what you want to do. You want to make an Orc Mage? Go for it. It will be harder starting out than if you chose a High Elf or a Breton but it doesnt mean it cant be done. The key I guess is to make it your own personal experience. Make your decisions based on impulse and desire rather than optimisation. The one thing I would recommend you do  as will many of the NPCs you meet in game  is to talk to everyone and explore as much as you can because who knows what secrets you will find and what gems you will come across. If youve played Skyrim for example before this the one thing I will point out is that there are no quest markers in this game. If youre going out on a quest pay attention to what the character is telling you as this will literally be the only information thats made available to you  as well as the accompanying journal entry that sums up the conversation quite nicely. But as I said the main thing to do with Morrowind is just have fun experiment explore and do whatever you please  because anything can be done and thats why I love this game so damn much.,Morrowind,cemc4ri,1,t5_2r9nv

767917,0,t3_22xaiy,I am a huge fan of all the Alteration utility spells like waterwalking and so on. Open spells are particularly useful  as soon as you can afford it make a custom pt Open spell to save you a whole bunch of grief.The biggest problem Ive always run into as a mage is magicka limitations. Make sure you build your character right from the start to maximise your magicka  be careful with your race and birthsign in particular. The purists may also object but I found installing a tiny mod which gives you a bit of magicka regen over time to be absurdly helpful towards making a pure mage much more playable right from the start.Something else to be wary of is putting all your magic skills in major and minor. Save at least one school of each attribute the ones you rely on least eg Mysticism for your misc skills otherwise you wont be able to train your magic skills up without overlevelling. Incidentally your competence ranks up with successfully casting spells so something I generally do is make one custom training spell for each school that costs as little as possible and just stand in the Mages Guild and recast over and over again to train up.I would also recommend having a solid backup weapon skill. Something enchanted with invisibility is also useful to have on hand for those oh shit run away moments that tend to occur when youre a squishy mage.,Morrowind,cgrkf9k,1,t5_2r9nv

If your items are confiscated they are not gone they are just moved.  In the nearest Imperial Fort you will find them in a chest marked evidence.

It never lagged much if at all for me on  but the loading times were HORRIBLE. Usually around five minutes and sometimes going into the  minute mark. The rendering distance is extremely low as well. Seriously it felt like it could barely keep up with my tank character that had a speed of I think  tops. It WILL work better on an original XBox shorter loading times being the one thing I can think of but not by very much. In all honesty I would highly recommend saving up for a good gaming PC depending on your situation. Thats what Im doing but even on my crapulous computer I can still run Morrowind with several mods. I dont mean to go all PC MASTER RACE or anything but as someone that played Morrowind Oblivion and Skyrim on XBox along with Fallout  and New Vegas I can honestly say that I MUCH prefer PC.But if youre dead set on getting the XBox version be sure to look around for an old XBox console for it.

The world didnt withstand the slightest scrutiny the writing was terrible the combat still wasnt any good the UI took another step back in usability and the colour palette was drab. All the graphics in the world couldnt save that game from being a hackandslash action game thinly disguised as an RPG.Thats not the say that Morrowind was perfect far from it even but at least it can be forgiven for that because that was a game made by a handful of guys on the verge of bankruptcy. And still it managed to do what is important in an RPG. Skyrim on the other hand had a huge budget dozens of people working on it and still it managed to come up short.

I nixed the swordaxe idea in my build because it didnt really fit and he wants a variety. Since spears help to increase endurance and hes not likely to use heavymedium armor with that type of build using spears for his melee needs makes the most since. If hes following that strength wont even really be a part of the build but he just really wants more strength he can level strengthbased skills to get the bonus on level up.

You guys should do the VassirDidanat Ebony mine quest.Spoilers Please dont read this if youre new to the game.The mine is directly across the river from the shulk egg mine Where you kill the egg poachers right away for the fighters guild. Just head to the Shulk egg mine and go straight across the bridge to the other side of the river and keep going straight. Youll reach the VassirDidanat Ebony Mine. Step inside and then you can immediately leave. Though there is a lot of raw ebony inside the mine which is worth a good amount. Then head to Vivec. Go to the St. Olms plaza and go into the Haunted Manor. Talk to Dram Bero and tell him where the mine was. Do not speak to Nevena Ules before this point or you will not be able to complete the quest. Once you give Dram the mine whereabouts he will ask you what type of weapon you like. Tell him you like Axes and he will give you A Daedric Battle AxeThe damage is  so im assuming its better than what you have now.,Morrowind,ckez596,2,t5_2r9nv

2012670,0,t3_2hsvfq,A rule of thumb is that the lower the cost to learn the spell from a trainer the lower the required skill and magicka to use the spell. So if you wanted to increase your illusion go find a cheap light spell and cast it over and over use potions and rest to recover magicka and repeat. Similarly some of the restoration spells let you do a buff like fortify health mysticisms track X is pretty good alterations feather and jump are usually easy and bound weapons for conjuration. Destruction has some damage attribute or health that you can use too but if you want to practice out of combat you will have to take the advice of uapplesnob. Once you have purchased a spell effect you can use it to create a custom spell from several NPCs an easy start is someone at the Balmora Mages guild. Say you want to practice a lot of alteration so you find Open and Lock you can do so purchasing Ondusis Open Door and Fenricks Doorjam then make two custom spells each pt touch spells and go find a private area with a bunch of containers or doors. Cast the lock spell until you have got all that you want locked then open them up repeat until casting provides very few skill points to check progress open your menu hover over alteration cast two or three times open your menu hover over alteration see if the number in the bar is going up at a decent pace then make new custom spells to have larger numbers. Ideally you will want a spell to be able to be cast several times and have a decent chance at successful casts but I havent ever paid enough attention to know where the sweet spot would be on the cast chance to maximize skill point gain per cast.,Morrowind,ckvq278,2,t5_2r9nv

2105744,0,t3_2j0kor,The huge loading times on Xbox I was actually worried that something was wrong and my game wouldnt work. And it was my first real RPG I dont think Id played much other that RTSs before. And I remember loading it up and just staring open mouthed at the screen reading about Nords and Orcs and Khajit and everything. I remember saving up in Seyda Need doing every single quest I could stealing as much as I could to buy a set of Bonemould armor. And then getting destroyed by some old woman with a dagger in a lighthouse.Oh and I lost my shit when I first went out and saw that elf Tahriel or something come screaming out of the sky. And I clearly remember the whoa shit thats AWESOME moement I had then. I even made a custom enchanted ring later on that recreated his scrolls except with a Slowfall this time Fortify Jump pts s Slowfall pts s.Also reading literlly every word of every FAQ on gamefaqs. About the dropsteal exploit in the customs office. Of hunting Ordinators in Vivec. Of trying to find Kreacher the superrich merchant. Of sneaking into the Vaults of the great houses with glitchy spells and stealing everything. Of that cheap  gold glass dagger in horrid condition you could buy in this one town and buying tons of repair hammers.But the one that stands out the most was later on when I was just jumping about using my ring east of Vivec late at night outrunning cliffracers when I see this massive statue in the middle of a rainstorm the statue of Azura. It just was HUGE. And I freaked out I was maybe ft up in the air and the statue was even higher than I was. And I was sent on the quest to obtain Azuras star.But theres so much more the sight of that green spirit wall thing Ghostgate? Went there for the sweet sweet glass armor. Of going to Solstheim and running to the Skaal village I think at lvl for these three arrows of instant death some pts damage on hit enchantment. Or the freaky mushroomlike cities on the Eastern coast whose names I forget for a summon Golden Saint spell. Or this one tower somewhere which had all the Grandmaster Alchemy equipment stashed at the top.I still havent ever delivered that goddamn package to Caius Cosades though I did steal his Skooma pipe.

3388440,0,t3_2yyq9c, Id definitely recommend getting the boots of blinding speed and putting them on while having  resist magicka because you move much slower in Morrowind than in the other games. Instead of fast travel there are the silt striders boats and mage guild teleport people. You can also use mark and recall spells to teleport back to a place. Money is very easy to come by in this game once you figure it out and its also very useful. You can train for most or all of your levelling and easily pay for it. Levitate is fantastic for getting around. Use the journal for quests. It keeps track of everything NPCs say about a quest or topic and there is nearly always a person to ask to get directions or tell you that one last bit of information to figure out what to do. You just have to look around.If I think of anything else Ill edit it in. Also this page from the UESP is very useful for this sort of situation.,Morrowind,cpeic72,3,t5_2r9nv

3836814,0,t3_34d8fy,The overlap wont help very much. Alchemy will give you access to stockpileable spell effects from potions Enchanting will give you regenerating spell effects from enchanted items also scrolls. Both have things that theyre better at. Enchant can target others while alchemy can only effect you opening up damage absorb and conjuration spells. Alchemy is easier to get into earlygame ultimately cheaper and quicker to the draw with restoration effects. Both are gamebreakingly profitable If you want to use them that way. More over They both train the int stat Making sure youll have plenty of magicka that your skillset needs less than castingcentric mage builds. Dont get me wrong youll need int enough to whip up something to fortify your int and luck for a few seconds. But then youll have access to all you need for either build.The only advice I have for an enchanter You need a spell effect to enchant Then an item. Sort your enchanted items with punctuation so they show up at the top of your enchanted item list Your magic menu is going to clutter like crazy and its hell to scroll around looking for something every couple of seconds during a fight. I like to put  before destruction effects  before conjuration etc etc. Also dont avoid npc training. Enchant is the slowest raising skill and harshly limited at low levels. With just what some basic trainers can get you youll have a lot less enchant failure and a lot more uses out of your enchanted items.,Morrowind,cqtmozn,3,t5_2r9nv

3996273,0,t3_367hr6,The UI is good once you learn how to size the windows and figure out how to pinunpin them. Find a PDF of the manual it describes many things you might not know. For almost everything watch your stamina the green bar. Read books buy maps. Know that the game isnt going to put a big arrow for you to follow you might have to think about the world. Learn transportation. The silt striders are obvious. The mages teleportation is another big one. Boats go from various cities. There is a markrecall spell to get you back to your home base immediately. You can use the intervention spells to cut times in at least half. There is even a map of Vivec you can buy that shows all the cantons and even describes their vertical layout if you get confused. Find a guild find a house find the guy in Balmora that you were told to find for the main quest. Learn these things and the pace can pick up greatly if you want to but also take time to wander slowly and explore. If you really wanna bit of help find a PDF of the paper map the game came with. Some think it takes away from the exploration but the game designers included it with the game. But to the point the game is about learning about the world and slowly letting you gain power in it. It just isnt a game to powerup and move to the next hardest section and such. Maybe it isnt your kind of game.

4144836,0,t3_380iz3,For me its because Morrowind is the greatest game of all time. In my opinion anyways so telling people about it discussing it and helping others get started is like sharing one of the best experiences Ive ever had. I remember being at gamestop while my mother was shopping next door seriously is gamestop like a daycare for latchkey kids? and seeing the cover to the GOTY edition. It caught my eye and after flipping through the manual I begged my mother for it. Got home put the disc into my xbox the original one by the way and being utterly lost. I loved it the world the lore the politics the characters even the mechanics had a certain charm to them. I had never played a game like that before. I made my own destiny and I chose how to accomplish my goals.  That being said the game is far from perfect but it go so many things right that I was able to see past the warts. I guess what Im getting at is that most of the people on this sub are here because they love the game its a very positive aspect of their lives and they want to make sure that things related to it are positive as well.  The only reason the Morrowind community has managed to stay alive is because people have a passion for the game that only a handful of games are lucky enough to create. Ive seen other game subreddits that are practically toxic and not very conducive to discussion. As unihilnovisubsole pointed the difficulty and learning curve has a lot to do with it. When a game is complex and difficult it tends to make people want to cooperate ala Dank Souls. People want to discover and have the best possible journey and helping others is part of that. ,Morrowind,crsq855,2,t5_2r9nv

Thats why I use Morrowind Watercolored the style of the game is the same but it looks prettier at the same time.

4411596,0,t1_csmweaw,Now youre thinking like a true Morrowind player of course you can! Anything you just drop on the ground will stay there forever and you cant kick it around like Oblivion or Skyrim so you wont lose items that way and any house where the owner is dead or just not around is fair game to take up residence in even if youre the one to kill them but be wary about putting items in chests or crates owned by someone else or a faction you dont belong to as this can sometimes transfer ownership of the item to them meaning the guards will take it from you when you turn yourself in. I do believe you can get around this by just dropping the item on the ground and picking it up again though. You can use owned containers but dont let anyone see you taking things out of them or thatll count as stealing too. IIRC containers dont reset like in Oblivion or Skyrim though so ownership issues aside you can pretty much put stuff wherever.,Morrowind,csmx6oa,17,t5_2r9nv

Start fresh with a new RP character use an alternate start character generator and pick Dagon Fel as a place to start with the goal of getting to Seyda Neen to pick up that package to take to Caius.

For example barrels in smuggler caves have rings that will become progressively better at higher levels itll pull from lists with generally better enchanted items.Most monsters are just static theyll be the same no matter what level you come across them except on the overworld. For those the game spawns a monster based on what level youre at. The monsters stats will be the same a blighted Rat will be the same no matter what level or location youre at but youll generally encounter stronger monsters as you level up.,Morrowind,d3scb3y,1,t5_2r9nv

Especially for its weight.Medium armor is far too weak compared to light and weights too little.Heavy armor gets all the enchantments. All of the best light and medium armors have no enchantments. Heavy has enchants on nearly every fucking piece. The Best sets should look like not counting shieldsLight  armor rating.  less than currentMedium  armor rating. what we have nowHeavy  armor rating.

Being fed up you decide to take the guildguide to Sadrith Mora to see what all the fuss is about the Telvanni. You arrive there and before you leave you decide to check the supply chest on your way out only to notice a small common ring somewhere to the right of the chest maybe it fell out... you decide to pick it up...There if you do that you should get expelled in a hopefully nonintrusive way and youll be a stones throw away from Sadrith Mora in case you want to join up with the Telvanni right away.,Morrowind,d5375ew,1,t5_2r9nv

8474397,0,t3_4vqsgp,uMrWillisAltAccount already answered  but there are a few things Id like to add. For magicka regeneration you can wait or sleep and that will regen your magicka. Also there is an item in the game that will help you with your speed problem. EDIT there are multiple items that help with speed but theres one item thats a godsend for that. As a beginner you can play lots of things and still do well. Of course you can do a sword and board fighter using races such as Orcs Redguards Nords Imperials or really any though the ones I mentioned are probably better than the others. I personally think you should try a mage because Morrowind has an amazing magic system with so many great aspects to it and it really allows you to be creative with your spells. As for tips in the game youll want to max out your Endurance asap because how much health you gain per level is based upon your Endurance level meaning quickly maxing it out gets you the most health in the long run.

8515050,0,t3_4wa0cf,Let them post all they want I say. The only reason I purchased morrowind on steam was to be ready for skywind but have since fallen in love with the game again. Being a purist to the point of excluding and treating skywind with derision is foolish. Whenever the faults of morrowind are discusssed the poor animations and questionable combat are always brought up and not just from new players who are clueless but from those of us who have played through the game many times as well. Skywind has the potential to literally address those issues and more. Their artistic vision is superb and looks better than the morrowind designs in most cases thats subjective sure but it is amazing work even you prefer the old look of orcish armor for instance.Skywind is not going to diminish morrowind in any way it will only breath new life into it it got this old player interested again and I cannot be the only one. Skywind is healthy for morrowind it has people talking about morrowind again hell Id wager that the increase in modding for morrowind in the last couple years is likely due to skywind and the impact it is having on people. They are posting here to keep us informed because we by all rights should be the people most interested.

When thinking about them one major thing is simply the videogame industry around them. Even if Skyrim beats Morrowind in several ways I dont see it as equally impressive among games of its time.

9162677,0,t3_55t4j8,With Roerichs permission today for the Daily Shot were taking a look at the city of Markarth from Skyrim  Home of the Nords. One of the biggest cities in the Reach Markarth is a traditional Nordic town with lots of strong Nordic architecture but the skyline is dominated by Elfstone Keep an ancient Direnni ruin thats now used as a palace by King Barda the ruler of Markarth. The city is also home to the College of the Voice originally founded by Tiber Septim and it also has a docks district that provides rivertransport to Karthwasten and Haafingar.Now we recently did an interview with Roerich and Worsas where we talked a lot about the lore of the Reach and their version of Skyrim and as a bonus that interview also includes some of the only videofootage available for the current version of Markarth as well as over  minutes of the various regions of the Reach.If youre interested in learning more about the project or perhaps joining up and helping build up this amazing mod Id recommend checking out Project Tamriel and their forums You can also find a couple of trailers for Skyrim  Home of the Nords including one for Vorndgad Forest and one for the Druadach Highlands here Theres also an early alpha version of the Vorndgad Forest that you can download hereBut seriously if youre at all interested in Skyrim  Home of the Nords please consider joining up and helping out the project. Modding is easy and they need developers in every field especially interiors and questing. If you need tutorials we do have a few video tutorials that can be of help including this one on interior design this one on quest design and this one on dungeon design Now these tutorials arent for SHOTN exactly but if you want to learn how to mod theyll help a lot and Im going to tentatively announce that we do plan on making some SHOTNspecific tutorial videos using the newly released Tamriel Data Files that includes all of the resources found in SHOTN.

9416961,0,t3_59aoeq,A lot of people have this or that issue with Oblivions landscape culture flavor text etc. For me thats not especially a big problem mods can and have ironed out most of those issues. For me game flow needs to be redone. In morrowind the plot railroads you to balmora and then when you finally meet caius cosades he basically tells you to go do side questsfaction quests to establish a cover identity. Even after picking up the main quest it isnt until later I normally feel it around the ilunibi quest that caius stops telling you to work on the cover identity and railroads you into becoming the nerevarine. Oblivion by contrast from tutorial dungeon to endgame basically railroads you through the main quest to the point that if you RP it feels irresponsible to do literally anything other than pursue the main quest. The games tone is so urgent so you just feel bad needlessly doing sidequests or dawdling in towns looking for nonmain quest work. Oblivion could have all it has now  junglelessness fast travel and all  with a reworked plot and flow such that theres a feeling of that cover identity from morrowind and it would be an infinitely more ideal sequel. ,Morrowind,d99nyh9,2,t5_2r9nv

Does that mean people shouldnt be critical of the direction Beth has taken or harp on about how they should improve things? No but I feel my part in that is done. If they ever make a game that completely betrays what I enjoy about their titles Ill just move on. Morrowind is still around when I feel like I wanna be a special snowflake with intellectual taste or some shit.Skywind isnt some Skyrim Neophyte plot to tarnish Morrowinds memory by making it play like a modern Bethesda game. Its a love letter from people that love both games that takes Skyrim and dresses it up as a reimagined Morrowind. The  year olds that will go on Youtube videos and post ths is what morwinds shouldve been like XD are inescapable complaining about that inevitability will only make you upset and accomplish nothing. And quite frankly if someone looks at Morrowind and Skywind and decides they want to experience the content through Skywind thats their business.

11551217,0,t3_64sj8h,Bloodmoon easily. I love the isolated edge of the world feeling wilderness and its always felt like it meshes fairly well with the base game. Tribunal on the other hand is unnaturally separated and Mournhold might as well be in a different plane of existence effectively being entirely cut off from the surrounding world and barring the player from using levitation and the like which is the sort of weak copout that Morrowind usually does an excellent job avoiding but that later ES games revel in. An expansion focusing on an urban area could have been pretty cool but unfortunately Mournhold feels extremely sterile and kinda empty. That you spend most of your time trudging through an endless sewer level doesnt help matters. Also the way that you get unless you apply mods you end up getting attacked by assassins right off the Seyda Neen docks is dumb as hell. Dont get me wrong I still enjoy it more than not but it very much feels like the weak spot when compared to Vvardenfell and Solstheim.,Morrowind,dg5c0tg,2,t5_2r9nv
11568547,0,t1_dg762ql,Ive always enjoyed RPGs and openworld and I enjoyed Skyrima  great deal though not nearly as much as the Witcher series though on my last attempt to play it I felt extremely let down withe the atmosphere and characters.Ill have a look at those links thanks. The other problem Ive had with older games is my processor  its got a lot cores. Would that be a problem in Morrownd?,Morrowind,dg7atm1,3,t5_2r9nv

11629912,0,t1_dge7bc0,I only played it a few weeks ago for the first time my advice is to install the face overhaul thing so people arent potatoes and then avoid the main quest like the plague and youll be fine the quests are actually really fun,Morrowind,dge9hbd,6,t5_2r9nv

11806398,0,t3_68cy4d,The most reliable thing I remember doing back in the day to obtain large quantities of Moon Sugar or easy gold or gems or soul gems or dwemer pieces was to simply raid all the boxes and baskets and trash cans and whatnot around the exterior of Balmora. Its a completely random chance but theres a large number of containers there and its safe to just wait days at a time to reset them.Also the Dren plantation has respawning containers of nothing but Moon Sugar and Skooma. The  crates stacked outside between the two buildings and a bunch more down in the basement of the smaller building with the two orcs. This isnt nearly as safe though. They dont like you taking their shit Dren is part of the main quest sorta kinda and theyre all strong as fuck.,Morrowind,dgyanx2,3,t5_2r9nv
