As far as Sapphire coming down she just couldnt afford the ticket. There were other personal reasons why she couldnt that I wont get into.

So what if a persons from a country you happen to be interested in if you cant get along with them?  Youre certainly not coming at this from a desire to just meet any random person and fall in love.

3176052,0,t3_2whmpx,To be fair doing the peace symbol with your fingers when you pose for photos is pretty standard practice in Japan and it can be hard to fight the habit since most people around you do it.I think theres a fine line between trying to adapt to your host countries culture and trying to become Japanese. If your friend is determined to marry a Japanese man gain citizenship and try to erase all evidence that shes foreign... Well its never going to work since no one will let you forget youre not Japanese.Speaking from experience as a white woman with a Japanese husband and last name its something you have to accept and agree to live with if you want to enjoy living here. I embrace being a foreigner and dont aspire to become Japanese but sometimes it can get annoying. Interestingly enough theres a TV show thats popular right now starring a white lady married to a Japanese man who found the first whiskey company in Japan. Its loosely based on real peopleevents.

I had a decent quality wig and I made my coat from scratch. I didnt actually sew the buttons on to my coat because it was my first time wearing it out it was last minute and I wasnt certain I liked them yet. So I magnetized them to it seemed like a great idea at the time. This hambeast of a girl who was not wearing ANY cosplay was at the event and literally tackled me to the ground. I am tall and strong and I got so freaked out to suddenly be on the floor with a person on top of me. She thought I was being in character by being like what the fuck and shoving her off because she claimed that she was Belarus even though she clearly was in street clothes. I managed to escape somewhat gracefully and shrug it off I had more stuff to deal with and better people to see anyways. But she followed me around from a distance pretending to be Belarus still. When it came time to take a group photo she managed to get right in front of me.She plucked one of the magnets off my coat and ate it.Im pretty sure thats super dangerous to eat?
