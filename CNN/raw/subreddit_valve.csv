So shes solving the coding problem door distraction theres the sort of the CCD frontend problem which is kind of hard and shes like well thats a bitch why dont we just skip that figure out what the protocol is to talk to the brain. And it turns out one of the interesting things its a way more compact representation of information so you know thats gonna happen thats something you guys should be thinking about that your subjective experience of reality is probably going to be driven directly into your brain much sooner than I think most people expect.

4654210,0,t1_ctgwds2,Well maybe not. And as a disclaimer Ive never used one of this new generation VR headsets. But if we follow the logic of each new numbered Half Life needs a qualitative leap its possible. What I mean is that for VR to be meaningful in a game in the way this quantum leap idea suggests it would have to be more intrinsic and less togglable.For example HL wouldnt be the same if you could toggle out the story and the engine. HL wouldnt be the same in a physicsfree version. You could certainly play the and theyd still probably be fun. But they wouldnt be the same and they wouldnt be the gamechangers Valve seems to want and gamers seem to expect. And it feels kinda unValve to also offer a last gen version without the killerapp features that in part necessitated the long wait in the first place.Of course a    dollar set up is kind of a lot to ask someone to pay just to play your latest game. And VR is different than D to D updates. But if you think about it as updating hardware like moving from an old PC to a new one or a PS to a PS its not entirely unreasonable. Plus it seems very Valvey to essentially force everyone to buy a VR headset and be largely responsible for genuinely kickstarting the whole thing.I understand this whole shebang has a lot of seems in it. And thats largely what I criticized the video for. But Im not in any way certain and Im not claiming that if you disagree then you  just dont get it. Really Im just thinking out loud.rant,valve,cth811p,2,t5_2qzqs

Valves business model has shifted into creating community experiences and developing tools for community driven content.  Csgo was originally developed by hidden path. And that ended horribly and valve had to take over development.  They had to fix so many issues with the game since the took over.
