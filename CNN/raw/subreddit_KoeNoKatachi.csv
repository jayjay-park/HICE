11206148,0,t3_5zpq38,I watched it twice on a Monday and Tuesday. Its pretty good for me. Theres gonna be SPOILERS here so for those who do not want to get spoilt dont read further than this.Since this is a  hour plus movie there were tons of scene that were cut out to fit in that movie but it isnt that bad. Its just for those who read the manga you would understand the point. The dark aspect of it isnt that much felt in the movie but it still has that impact thatll make you giggle and sad at some parts. From my point of view the movie is hilarious in a way comparing it to the manga. Take out Nagatsuka for example..Rather than him being the side character his more like the support role which is pretty funny and interesting. Like I mention before a couple of stuffs were left out to fit the duration of the movie but I must say its really not that bad its pretty good for me. Oh and if you wanna know the ending its not the ending that youd imagine it to be. It cuts somewhere around the school festival event. So yeah..,KoeNoKatachi,df27bed,1,t5_34nj3
