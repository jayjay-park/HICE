4260343,0,t3_39r201,I wrote up an ad and listed it in the MW personals section about  years ago and received about  responses from women. It was surprisingly more successful than I thought it would be in that anyone at all responded. Of those responses there was a girl who stood out right away. She was pretty by the images and I really clicked with her just the way she wrote things I felt like I knew a fair amount of her personality right away. I didnt really spend much time getting to know the other responders there was a second one that I put a small amount of effort into getting to know but with the majority of my interest in Bonnie I just didnt really pursue it. So Bonnie and I began exchanging emails and we both agreed wed like to exchange numbers and text. We had really good conversation and within a few days she invited me over for bowls on the porch. Everything fit really well her humor countered mine and vice versa. We just had a really great time with each other on all levels. We ended up sleeping together one night and we connected really well it was amazing for both of us. Things were just rad we were going out on dates and I really thought I could spend forever with her. Then things took a turn. I had some family hardships mother ODd but they brought her back in ER. It ended up getting in the way of a night we planned on spending together and I made the mistake of not calling Bonnie or letting her know what was going on for almost two hours after the time I was meant to arrive. She really seemed slighted more than I felt a person should be given what was going on but I also felt like she had a point that there was a moment where I could have made a quick call to her just let her know. All in all the entire thing got blown out of proportion in a text argument which was horrible. We broke up and ignored each other for about  months. One day she texted me and said shed understand if I didnt reply but she could really use some herb and had no other sources to obtain any. I agreed and we had sex the following night I feel like she probably could have found herb elsewhere and she was just missing the sex as much as I was. We agreed very quickly to maintain an FWB type understanding we both seemed on board with it. That went on for several months things were good. Wed still cuddle sometimes and watch movies it wasnt strictly fuck buddies or anything. I gave a shit about her yanno? Work on her car take out the trash when I was leaving this sort of thing. I guess I believed that was a thing that we could sort of halfway a relationship. I had an interest in learning massage techniques so she was also an awesome body to have on hand. Id go by there more nights than not and give her full body massages rub her feet Id hook it up. I think I just took the passion a little too far for being in what we were calling an FWB situation. Something must have happened because all of a sudden she snapped when I had a little family drama again. She raged at me through text yet again and said this is my routine that I always blow her off when my family is going through some shit. Granted my family is a bit dramatic and often times Im pulled in to mediate or something but I just feel like wait arent we FWBs? Didnt we agree that we were not in a relationship and there really shouldnt be this extreme level of expectations? So the couple times that she blew up like that she gets really angry and I just have no interest in fighting with her so I politely exit the war shes trying to wage. Its been a few months now that we havent talked and if Im being honest I fuckin miss her. I miss her humor she was able to make me laugh a lot. I miss the way her skin tastes her scent. I wish I could have her in my life somehow but we just cant figure out how to make it work right now unfortunately. I think one of us will give in and make contact with each other one of these days Im having a hard time not contacting her. I cant say the entire craigslist experience has been successful on all levels but if youre asking if Ive successfully met someone on craigslist yes I have. She was kinda nuts I think I probably am too. ,craigslist,cs5uyed,3,t5_2qh5k

8224678,0,t1_d55g8bb,Oh damn! I really misread that. My advice still stands just in reverse. Always assume the worst. They think they have an opportunity to sell it to someone else for more money so they give you a sympathyinducing lie so youll hold tight. If their other deal works out they just ignore you going forward. If their other deal doesnt work out they get back in touch in a few days and resume the deal.Very sleazy but thats what a lot of people do. So keep looking and if another deal presents itself go for it. If you hear from them again and they want to sell it and you still want to buy it go for it. You could also try to renegotiate with them at that point because you will have gained a slight bit of leverage. If they come crawling back to you then their other deal didnt work out. You just say something like I really want to come get that bike but I only have original price minus  because I had to spend  on made up expense. That usually works because the seller has now been through so much hassle with the other guy that heshes ready to just get rid of the bike.

8956002,0,t1_d7oc8jn,The cases you present are not apples to apples but here are my answers to them. Thrift store presumably does not make any representation of condition or functionality. So no it would not be fraud.. In most states there is specific legislation that makes a vehicle purchase as is unless otherwise agreed upon in writing. So no it would not be fraud even if they lie to you which they always do.. No you sold the item over eBay in the condition it was truly in. You cannot control the acts of others. So no that would not be fraud. But the seller would file a case with eBays Buyer Protection program. eBay would refund the buyer their money and take it away from you and you would have to take the damages up with the carrier.. No if someone gives you a laser for free then no money has changed hands and therefore you have not been harmed in any way by your reliance on the misrepresentation. So no it would not be fraud.. Depends if the beer truly had  alcohol in it or not. You getting drunk or not is irrelevant. So more info is needed in this case to determine if fraud has occurred.. As long as you dont state that the speakers work or that the Gameboy is in proper working order then no it is not fraud.Fraud is not about buyers remorse. Its about whether a scenario fits within the framework I laid out in my previous comment.OPs wife definitely made a couple mistakes but that does not entitle someone to defraud her which is exactly what happened. OPs wife deserves to be made whole.,craigslist,d7odldk,2,t5_2qh5k
