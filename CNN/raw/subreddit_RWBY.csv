I really hope you stop making assumptions before you read any good fanfiction. You only have yourself to blame if you blatantly ignore all the good and wellrespected stories and choose only to glance at the fap material and decry the entire fanfiction community as writing things so that they can get off.And once you try these things and you still dislike quality writing for some reason then maybe fanfiction or fiction in general just isnt your thing. ,RWBY,cepkqm8,2,t5_2vhg0

1076561,0,t1_chqjmnn,Alone you might be somewhat right although I think Blake still beats out Yang in terms of ability but in the team as a whole Blake actually serves one of the most important roles FastTackle. Blake isnt really supposed to do damage against larger enemies mainly catch up to them harass them so they loose mobility and escape options and keep them there so the heavyhitters can do their jobs. FastTackle is probably one of the most dangerous but also most important jobs in any combat unit as although it places one unit at high risk it ensures the others have an easier time hitting their mark leading to faster KOs.FastTackles are also fairly important in large scale combat as well which EVE Online clearly demonstrates. When a large capital ship or highvalue freighter is out in the open the most important part of any operation to take it down is a FastTackle usually composed of a single small frigate or multiple frigates equipped to jam the targets engines and inflict enough damage to keep shields from recharging. The risk though is that capital ships can destroy small frigates relatively easy so there is quite a bit of risk to the frigates if the larger ships cannot arrive in time.,RWBY,chqnpty,3,t5_2vhg0

1176640,0,t3_21z3cg,This game is probably one of the best fan games I have played yet! The graphics and animation is great! Its really fun and is a great mini game to play if youve got spare time. Its battle system reminds me very much of Kingdom Hearts. Now feedback. I have just started playing this game and have barely gotten passed  waves pathetic I know. Features I wouldnt mind added into this game would be a multiplayer option especially online. Theres many fans of RWBY out there and maybe adding a leaderboard on the most points or kills would be a nice touch it might keep the game going too. Also If there was a more variety of enemies to fight maybe certain boss waves that would make things very interesting and challenging. I know Im asking to much. But Im just suggesting some ideas which I thought would be cool. In all honesty I havent had any bugs with the game yet except for one. You see theres no music playing? Ive looked through the settings and changed the music volume to its highest point. I can hear sound but not the music. Which sucks really because the song in this game is amazing.

1222412,0,t1_ci70he3,Although this would make for an EXTREMELY interesting plot twist! I think its very improbable. Given the way she presents herself fighting for evil would seem to contradict everything she stands for. In my opinion she be more willing to die fighting evil and oppression than to work along side it. Take note at the way she scolds Cardin for his treatment of Velvet and how she responds to his remark against the Faunas in Prof. Ooblecks class. Now compare Cardins acts to Romans attitude to them in ep. . I dont think she would ever knowingly work with a organization like that. I also dont think she could just be working for Cinder either due to how she and her posse see the Faunas as mere pawns in a larger plan. Overall I like the idea but the chances seem pretty slim. She just doesnt seem like that kind of person especially one to betray her whole team.

As far as organized fighting forces go I would have to guess that highly trained private military corporations mercenaries and what I expect to be the organization Penny is affiliated with and contractual bands of huntershuntresses provide the fighting force when needed and fill private security and Grimmcontrol primarily. Large corporations like Schnee Dust would have their own militant security forces made up of military androids similar to those seen in the Black trailer and when the need arises could be supplemented by the PMCsMercsHunterHuntress guilds. Although considering that the White Fang has the ability to field agents comparable and possibly exceeding a hunterhuntress skills Im surprised that the Schnee droids are so weak.,RWBY,cipk4f3,1,t5_2vhg0

Think about it they have supporters literally terrorists... and theyre getting their munitions and now mechs.  If Cinders not trying to pull a Lelouch or even a CC Im totally wrong.  Remember theres only  places to take over and a lot of the good stuffs going to be at the festival.  Cinder may not be the king in this chess game but its obvious they have a plan.  Thats where your theory and mine differ because if they were after this dues ex machina bad news thingperson theyd have more information to go on by now.  Theyre only at phase  and no selfrespecting epic strategist jumps into something without a little information up their sleeves.  Cinders probably there for information then cause a ruckus at the festival then slip out with something awesome that she wants then put the hammer down.

Mix of dust and cable manipulation can alter trajectory of the ballblade when thrown and if ball is thrown will erupt with dust effects.,RWBY,ckc8876,1,t5_2vhg0

1873060,0,t3_2fwtmj,Since the show often brings up the idea of innocence I am inclined to agree with you that Summer likely wanted to shelter Ruby from the Grimm it may very well be that Rubys goal of making the world safe for everyone is a more childlike and naive interpretation of Summers desire to specifically make things safe for Ruby.I doubt that it was a message that Summer was not pleased with being a huntress most of the back story weve heard in regards to Rubys family implies that they are very much about defending others after all Qrow still trained Ruby even after Summers presumed death.

Ive always taken part in supporting the obviously canon ships and I like when the characters are written in a comedic way that insinuates romanticism. But when it comes down to it thats what they are. Characters. There are no repercussions for wanting two of them to fall in love because they arent real people. If the fandom wanted Michael and Arryn to fall in love because of their characters falling in love it would be a different story. I would actively be against that.What Im trying to say is that people are going to try and support fictional relationships because they can do it without consequences and its fun to do.

Stated another way all but the most pedantic of viewers will forgiveliberties with reality as long as the result is wicked sweet or awesome. Thisapplies to the audience in general there will naturally be a differentthreshold for each individual.The Rule Of Cool is another principle that seeks to dispel arguments amongfans over implausibility in fiction. It has been cited by animation directorSteve Loter of   Kim Possible    Clerks The Animated Series mationClerksTheAnimatedSeries    Tarzan  and   American Dragon JakeLong keLong   in response to questions from fans attempting to justify temporarybreaches in logical consistency. It is a complement to  Bellisarios Maxim and the  MSTKMantra  .Of  scientific laws thatthis trope circumvents the  third law of motion is probablythe most frequently revoked with the  squarecube law probably a closesecond. And then theres the Second Law of Thermodynamics. And of course amention has to go to the laws of relativity which prevent us from attaining FasterThanLight Travel and going to a distant planet in just a few hours .Note that you only get to invoke the Rule of Cool if the end product is infact cool. Note also that different opinions on what is cool create  themost arguments  overthis. That being said the Rule of Cool is very subjective. Failure toproperly use this trope can cause  collision damage with walls .Since its subjective it doesnt have to be cool in the sense of Grim reaperon a mountain playing an electric guitar.  The protagonist might not useguns  because itscooler to have them fight vampires with knives and stakes. You might haveMissing Parent Syndrome because it would be weird to have parents with you ona road trip across the country. Basically Rule of Cool works differently forwhichever genre youre writing for.One could argue that there are no instances of this trope being justified norcan there be  after all the entire point is that its about things thatdont make sense but we still gladly accept just because theyre so cool.You will need to refer to  The Utterly and Completely Definitive Guide toCool itiveGuideToCool .A  SubTrope  of Artistic License .

2122881,0,t1_cl9bn56,Actually the problem with Pennys scene is that the vehicle didnt get damaged enough but thats not the point.My point being that explanations for the event are readily available in the setting. Superpowered individuals exists in Remnant if such a thing happened in this world there simply would be any available explanations.OK so tell me how much Crimson Rose weights. Just kidding we dont know just like we dont know the weight of the  vehicle Penny stopped but.My rough estimate for Crimson Roses fully loaded weight is anything from kg to kg depending on how dense the material is. Considering how agile and precise Ruby is with it she has to be strong enough to at least break your ribcage even under lightweight armor.You can go the other way and claim that Crimson is really super light. kg or less. but then it means she does all her damage from sheer strength.I havent seen your math but I doubt it holds water if you thing the physics are consistent in RWBY.I try not to think about it because it detracts from the cool fight scenes but some artistic liberties taken here are really ludicrous Specially RECOIL.Recoil goes from aesthetic shaking to providing short bursts of flight from one scene to the next!But as unrealistic as recoil is in RWBY I dont care.

2246129,0,t1_clpc0nf,I think Zwei is just there for comic relief but hes getting shoehorned into important scenes. Blake has been running the show with Torchwick since the ending to Volume . Interestingly in the QampA Miles said his favorite part of this volume was bringing Zwei in because they wanted to do that for a while.

2248964,0,t3_2kx63i,I definitely started watching this show because the trailers hooked me on the idea of what this show could be... an idea that Volume  very much did not deliver on.  It had its moments Episode  the first rds of the volume  finale but by and large the trailers were still far more interesting than anything the first season gave us.  But while Volume  hasnt been perfect I really cant complain.  I sure hope they iron some things out like this last episode for one but even if this were the best the show were ever going to get Im enjoying it enough that Id definitely keep watching.  The action has been better the plot has been better its coming out at a much better rate...But dont sweat about it.

2253551,0,t1_clq0e01,Best Day Ever had better fights better dialog and better music. And it doesnt have many of the inconsistencies that No Breaks has.No Breaks in contrast just pretends its serious time plus doggy cannon ball. I think you are confusing being all serious face with actual plot development.The plot development in No Break can be summed up in two sentencesRoman puts bombs in the subway to let Grim into Vale. Also theres Raven.Thats it! I agree it does more to advance the plot than other episodes but its not the plot intensive episode you make it out to be.  Just Yangs talk with Blake in episode  Burning the Candle already tells us more than the events in No Breaks.,RWBY,clq9eob,0,t5_2vhg0

2256778,0,t1_clqnnss,Actually it was shorter the animation quality was mostly the same though there was one bit of the finale that was lacking I disagree about the pacing and the investment in characters fates is not completely necessary.

Given the fact that Zwei currently belongs to an experienced Huntsman and potentially had belonged to two experienced Hunttresses Im sure he had been trained to activate and use his Aura.

I guess Mega Manectric works with him too. Ren would be better suited for Mega GalladeLucario and Emerald can take up Mega Sceptile.I would say that Mega Gengar while shiny would be a good for for Roman. His ability is Shadow tag which prevents Ruby from escaping. Or Mega Banette because its ability is Prankster and its face better resembles Romans symbol than Gengars.Velvet is Mega Lopunny for obvious reasons.Cinder can also be suited for Mega Diancie but so does Weiss.,RWBY,cmfxliu,3,t5_2vhg0

She closely resembles the picture Yang showed Junior in the Yellow Trailer. She contacted Yang in a dream. And in Yangs dream when she saw Ravens face her eyes turned red. Yang has every reason to be angry at her mother who abandoned her.Another point Yang told Blake about her mothers mysterious disappearance a few episodes earlier. So Yangs mother is Chekhovs GunNow I want to see a weapon in RWBY called Chekhovs Gun. If you see it its going to kill you.

2937167,0,t1_co1rnoz,Im well aware this will start a Civil War within this thread but honestly good we get the best conclusions. So far the consensus at least in my opinion is that people want more JNPR less Jaune specifically and I couldnt agree more! Jaune has had too much development so they need to put him to the side and develop other characters like...oh...I dont know...perhaps the characters whose team name is the title of the show? Maybe?My biggest issue is that Jaune gets more character development than  of the main characters Jaune is a secondary protagonist at best a dynamic side character at worst but he isnt a main character thats Team RWBY whose names are in the shows title. We know almost nothing about Yang Ruby hardly got ANY development past episode  Weiss has only gotten a single explanation my dad was kind of a jerk for her backstory that and Im prissy. Yet Jaune gets this massive backstory. Jaune. A side character.I hope this isnt because Miles is impartial of focusing the show on Jaune who he voices and Blake who his girlfriend voices and even Neptune who Kerry voices. At least Monty focused almost  on the character that was voiced by him. Dont get me wrong I love Miles as a person he seems SUPER nice hes very uplifting seems fun to talk to and his writing for Red vs Blue was VERY good especially after taking over from someone who wrote the story for  years. But Miles please if you ever see this give Jaune a rest. Focus on Team RWBY. We want development of the ATeam not the BTeam. Please. Yang needs more than to be comic relief. Please.,RWBY,co1yvtu,0,t5_2vhg0
2937267,0,t1_co1vfy2,Exactly. Yang may have a ton of screentime but she definitely has the least characterization out of the main characters. Which reiterates the point that Jaune a secondary protagonist at best dynamic side character at worst gets more character development than  of the characters whose team name is the shows title.

3056742,0,t3_2v5z42,gt The masks are a symbol. Humanity wanted to make monsters out of us so we chose to don the faces of monsters.To me to captures the plight of all the Faunus born people living in Remnant had to experience. It tells the the story of how a people pushed to their limits will embrace a enemy that wants to wipe everybody off the planet whatever it takes to be free. As a symbol of how humanity has chosen to make monsters out of the Faunus members of the White Fang don the faces of actual monsters in the form of Grimm Masks. It screams out the centuries of pain and discrimination they suffered. It portrays the story of how a movement that originally that meant to represent a more moderate group seeking the right to just be treated as regular human beings had radicalized so greatly to clamour for the demands that their goals are to completely eliminate or subjugate humankind overthrowing human rule by destroying their government military and schools collapsing the pillars of human society.It weaves us the story of how the cycle of hatred will simply just continue to spin onwards and will repeat itself.,RWBY,coetur7,3,t5_2vhg0

3063417,0,t3_2v8il9,So this is the way I always thought it COULD be...  I have little to no real reason for believing this other than that I think it could be interesting. I always thought itd be interesting if one of them was gay while the other was not. Specifically if Ren was gay and Nora wasnt and in fact as time has gone on she started to fall for him but he never really felt the same way. The childhood friends thing made sense to me but I thought what if while Nora does dig Ren in that special kind of way. He always thought of her as a best friend and as nothing really else because hes to busy thinking about Jaune... or hes to busy getting mesmerized by Suns ridiculous abs. That all being said... I have nothing to back this up... its just something I thought about.,RWBY,cofiqjm,2,t5_2vhg0

But other than that its just so annoying. But the whole point was that Weiss was really fucked up about the whole thing not just asking herself why am I thinking this and then going on to make out with chicks. In most cases it feels like the author wants to write a character coming to terms with the attraction not necessarily because of sexual orientation maybe just because the character didnt expect to be attracted to someone like that but they just couldnt bother to write more than one line about it.

In episode Rubys cape stopped her from escaping and had it not been for Weiss she would have died. Yangs semblance during the paladin fight was what allows her to take an otherwise incapacitating hit and keep going Weiss lost her weapon in the fight with the boarbatusk and Blake simply missed timing on her attack with the four legged bot in the trailer and was headbutted and in the end she wasnt even the one to kill it.

Choosing a donor based on traits good eyes hair color mothers breast size any genetic diseases . . . has been around for nearly  years well without the obvious choosing a mate by such superficialstringent standards clones are a real viable option that people do with pets already and methods to use laboratory means to stop the spread of genetic diseases are being worked on presently. My thought is that they either pick a donor related to or similar to the nonegg pair of the ship assuming fxf or they make a clone but with a computerized random selection from both sets of DNA. Still a bit of a copout but plausible enough given what is possible in real life. Surrogates so both can still be hunters the whole time or because of the asexual possibly single parent option would also be something interesting to consider depending o when you start the time line.,RWBY,cp02ono,1,t5_2vhg0

3396889,0,t1_cpf9qiw,gt Youre just not letting up on the pain. Good. Pain builds perseverance. At least I hope it will in this case. ...gt Loved every second of this chapter. Especially Nora. Ive imagined that she would go through the stages of grief pretty quickly and I think you captured that pretty well. Its not fully resolved of course but at least shes accepted it.That was actually really hard for me to write I got a bit choked up while writing it. gt Had to chuckle a bit at her hitting Weiss by accident. Poor Weiss. Nora accidentally burned Weisss main outfit up when she hit her so now they all wear alternates nothing important plotwise for that I just prefer their altsgt Loved Nora and Rens backstory too. Its a great plausible explanation for why theyre always together and deepens both of them significantly.Ah I was wondering how yall would like that. Anytime theres a bit of exposition like that I have to be a bit concerned. gt Youre incredibly good at constructing the details of the scenes. It flows so well that I can easily picture every movement and facial expression like it was a movie in my mind which is exactly how I want it to be when I read.I mean I picture this as I would a film so Im trying to communicate this vision that I have in my mind in such a way where Im giving you enough detail to set the scene but to mainly focus on the action and let your mind fill in the rest. Thanks for that though thats probably the best comment anyone has given me.gt The Keep Moving Forward line seems like it was a risk to include. I understand that on one hand it honors Monty and fits in with the scene but on the other it reminds the reader of real events and can take them out of the moment. However I do think it was relatively harmless and worked well for the context used especially upon the second readthrough where it didnt bother me at all.I was so nervous to include that for pretty much the reasons you listed. I just hope it doesnt turn people off of the story. gt And now The today was not a normal day feelings progression  First time  Man aint that the truth.  Second time  God that hits hard. My heart felt that one.  Third time  Dammit man stahp. I feel like Im gonna cry now  That phrase when placed at the end was very powerful. Great way to finish the chapter.I love repetition but I honestly didnt mean to even do that it just sorta... came out? Im glad it ended up as effective as it did though. gt I feel like thats gonna be very important in the future. Sounds like Nora is one to hold a grudge. ...gt Then of course theres the question of why Nora was left as a baby by the Valkyries in the first place.Eh thats more of a mother not wanting her child to grow up a part of the clan and sneaking off to abandon the baby Nora. Not really much there. gt Hmm my gut says this could have something to do with Cinder since shes the only other one with a tattoolike thing on her back that I can think of. Very interesting...Nothing to do with Cinder Ill tell you that right now.gt Getting a little bloated in the head there Nora? Could this drive wedge between her and Ren? Perhaps even create a Divide???Nah thats just how Nora is. Rens cool with that. The chapter title comes in the next part. gt These chapters stand well enough on their own that you can barely tell theyve been split.This one actually works better split in two I think but I would still prefer to have them all as one if I can.  cannot be split so hopefully Ill be back to normal next week. I appreciate the support though thanks for reading and leaving a comment. ,RWBY,cpfgznl,2,t5_2vhg0

3488482,0,t1_cppw1fp,But then it means that you have quite a big problem here RWBY is almost entirely cliche. We have the innocent girl with big dreams the uptight ojou sama the quiet girl with a rough past the party blonde girl who is actually very nice the loveable idiot with big dreams AKA Naruto the genki girl the my popularity makes me lonely girl the quiet guy etc.Like you said Lancaster is too cliche. Then again White Rose and White Knight are at the same level of cliche. Both are dorks who will show the lonely girl what true friendship means and it will lead to love. So honestly the big problem with Iceberg is that its a high school crush that has nothing to hold it apart from both parties being attractive. It will sink itself eventually trust me. Neptune doesnt really care enough and Weiss biggest flaw is that she judges too much based on appearance and first impressions which always turns out to be wrong. Examples are Ruby and Jaune.,RWBY,cppwuhb,2,t5_2vhg0

You cant actively spite anyone who works at a bakery because when you where three you had a traumatic experience with cupcakes dont ask me what that would be its just an exampleNo! You want to know why I despise the White Fang? Its because they are a bunch of liars thieves and murderers!Keep this in mind.A member of the White Fang! Right underneath our noses!Weiss to Blake. She just called her own teamate who she didnt particularly hate beforehand a thief murderer and liar. No consideration on why Blake hid her identity. Also Weiss wonders why they were even looking for her when she ran off. Then she sort of shoves away her racism but I think that was more so for the plot. She has her reasons sure. That doesnt mean she doesnt completely judge someone based on their ears and even insult them because of it.

But this was not always the case. The ancient Space Marine Legions once utilised Volkite Weapons a class of powerful thermal ray weapons whose technology is preImperial in origin and dates back to the Age of Strife These compact weapons possessed considerable killing power surpassing most other armaments of their size. Unfortunately Volkite Weapons of the various types were difficult to manufacture even for the most able of the Mechanicum forges and the demands of the expanding Great Crusade in the late th Millennium swiftly overwhelmed the supply of these relicweapons. Once relatively common within the fledgling Space Marine Legions Volkite Weapons had fallen largely from favour by the time the Horus Heresy began in the early st Millennium and had been superseded by the far more flexible and utilitarian Terran Bolter. A brutally efficient weapon the Bolter fires massreactive bolts at its targets each one a selfpropelled missile which explodes on impact with devastating effectiveness. The fear and awe that Bolter fire creates makes it a perfect weapon for shock troops the hammering thunder of the guns mixing terrifyingly with the dull wet explosions where targeted flesh is blown apart.gtgtInteresting Hurricane Bolter Bolter | Storm Bolter Bolter | Heavy Bolter Bolter | Bolter Ammunition Ammunition Parent commenter can toggle NSFW NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcptzddc oror delete DeletionampmessageBdeletecptzddc.

3529859,0,t3_30o89k,I am one of those Dark Knight BlakexJaune shippers that you were curious about so ill give a crack at explaining. Ill be honest by saying that my ship is seeded in the fanfiction community. In my opinion almost every Dark Knight fic that is more than  chapters long is a good read in one way or another. This is mostly due to the fact that there is literally no base for this ship in the canon therefore the writers have the freedom to create a new relationship from scratch which means that they control the relationship in a way. As far as the charecters themselves they arent exactly opisates but when given a situation where they are forced together blake is forced to be outgoing and not run away two of her biggest problems. Jaune on the other hand is forced to be more couragous and confident without feeling like he is overshadowed by pyrrah. Unfortunatly there needs to be a good event that pushes them together to really have a base for the relationship.,RWBY,cpumm61,2,t5_2vhg0

3540226,0,t1_cpvsker,If youre saying Im the popular kid and can boost peoples social standing I feel youre a bit out there. Just because I enjoy artfics for my ship like everyone else that doesnt mean that the people who create it are now more popular because Im not popular. Im just some average Joe on the internet. I do a bit of stuff yeah but so do other people. Were all on a level playing field here. New people gain popularity every day and the older guys fade away if they dont comment. Take uAdrianblade and uxSPYXEx for example. Adrian started posting fan art and doing is Ensign thingy and now most people know him Id wager. On the other hand Spyxe hasnt commented here for a while and even then it wasnt much beyond people summoning him because of Nora stuff even though he was pretty much the poster child for how insane our subreddit can get. Does that make them popular? Sure if you want to see it that way I guess so. But its fleeting. The new people dont know the old guard because they dont comment anymore. I feel like Im in that old guard. Sure I comment here and there I moderate put out my fic and a few other small things like getting excited when someone puts out PM art or a fic but compared to what I used to do? Nah not even close. There are far more people here that I would label as popular before myself. If people want to create for a ship they enjoy great but you should know that Im not the only person that enjoys PM. ,RWBY,cpvt3x0,5,t5_2vhg0

3589609,0,t1_cq1f2tw,gt Its nice to see a fight scene after being hit with the heavy news of everything that has happened so far. With emotions and tempers rising and overwhelming most of the characters.I want to go ahead and say now that the pace is slowing down. Fewer fight scenesintense moments once we get out of the Prologue arc first  chapters. gt A part of me had thought when reading of the Bullheads dramatic rescue of Team RWBY that something would happen. Regardless of the Giant Grimm mentioned in the story swiped at it threw a heavy object or something similar to that extent would have happened. It would be an interesting Scenario that instead of being rescued they were further stranded in this Snowstorm.Interesting yes but not what I need out of the story right now. Besides were on to the next person. gt The conflicting emotions of Weiss as well was definitely another highlight of this chapter. As we see her struggling with herself onto how to best approach a very delicate and hopeless situation like this but ultimately misjudge as many would have done with no previous experience on dealing with events such as these.Poor Weiss though. She doesnt know what her heart wants. gt Another well written chapter.Thanks! I really appreciate the comment and support ,RWBY,cq1fyn0,1,t5_2vhg0

3805184,0,t1_cqpxzh0,I will try to use the canon have for my fic in a general way thats compatible with actual canon by listing key things.  Note that while I phrase it like fact I am only listing my personal headcanon for my work.  Oh and WALL OF TEXT AHEAD or TLDR for significant damage to be inflicted enough energy must be used to overcome their defense  and in doing so leaving them less or even incapable of healing from the resulting damage.  Alternatively wear them down until they can no longer defend themselves effectively from a fatal or crippling attack.  Use blunt weaponry over edged martial combat over firearms.  Prioritize internal organ damage over limbs or other more superficial injury.First and foremost its not passive.  I imagine that a huntresshuntsmen could be hurt just as easily as any other person if they dont have their guard up.  Similarly they may underestimate the strength needed to block an attack.Second I see aura as both defensive and offensive.  As they attack with certain techniques and use their semblance their aura diminishes.  The same goes for each hit they take the exception being semblances like Yangs that give a little back.Depending upon training elements of their aura and the amount of aura they have the strength of shielding of which I think there are two types and healing can vary.  The two types I see as the basic protection from damage and the active shield that it looks like Ren and Cinder use against the Taijitu and deflecting Rubys shots in VE respectively.  Those with large auras particularly trained with the technique or whose auras more suited to the practice can heal and shield from more.Aura works differently for different types of damage.  I have it that penetrative and edged weaponry are more easily blocked by the preventive shield.  Blunt weaponry and crushing are less easily defended against.  The effectiveness of the shielding is also directly related to how much aura they have left with it behaving erratically such as completely failing to respond when low.  Once damage is dealt it heals differently as well.  Blunt damage heals easiest while severed fibers from a hole or a cut take more time.  Even sickness and fatigue can be assisted by aura but take significantly more effort and aura than physical damage.  Internal injuries are the most difficult  internal organs respond the worst to healing and regeneration followed by the bones while external muscle and fatty tissue heals best.  Severed limbs can be salvaged when reattached but they will not regenerate if lost.  Internal wounds will attempt to heal the longest at a slow rate while external wounds tend to have rapid healing for a comparatively short period of time.  Following this any unhealed damage will remain.All of this takes aura so if a huntresshuntsman is exhausted they will not have the healing or shielding benefits of aura.  Similarly aura can be distributed  they can prioritize some wounds over others.  In doing so the time for aura to be effective against the ignored wounds can pass leaving it incapable of healing even if it would have otherwise healed.  In this way warriors may end up with superficial damage through healing more life threatening damage elsewhere.  For example Weiss scar in my fic exists because she would have been blinded  but prioritized the healing of the eye over the damage of the socket and eyelid.Thats more or less everything for how I have aura work.  edit On second thought lets move the TLDR up top,RWBY,cqq0s88,3,t5_2vhg0

3890760,0,t3_34yowo,So this is slightly off topic... But I read through all the comments in this thread and I figure Id actually recommend some books you might want to try to introduce your kid to T.A. Barrons Lost Years of Merlin series  Merlin the great wizard of King Arthur didnt start out a great wizard.  He started out a young boy bullied and lost and unsure of magical powers he seems to posses.  Eventually he begins gaining control of these powers and goes on a variety of adventures on the mystical island of Fincayra.   book series.  I would personally recommend for anyone old enough to enjoy Harry Potter Eoin Colfers Artemis Fowl series  Artemis Fowl is a criminal mastermind who happens to be a  year old boy.  Defying what the average grown up would lead him to believe he has determined that magic and specifically faeries exist and that he is willing to do anything he can to steal gold from the faeries including kidnapping.   book series.  Easier reading level than Harry Potter.  Definitely lower brow humor at time... but Im a  year old who enjoys rereading them so hey. Anne McCafferys Dragon Riders of Pern series  Pern is a planet far way from Earth that though long ago settled by advance human explorers has a medievalesque nature to it.  Lords and Ladies serve as regional governors ensuring farmlands and craft trades are maintained.  While Dragon Riders take to the skies on the backs of mighty fire breathing dragons to burn thread a weird life form that when it lands tends to destroy all things organic from the sky.  Many many book series.  The first book is a much more difficult read than Harry Potter.  The Harper Hall Trilogy books take place in the Pern world but were written more for children.  Probably a good place to get his feet wet.,RWBY,cqzs43r,1,t5_2vhg0

The Grimm could be far more monstrous and brutal and civilization in general should reflect that mankind is on the edge of being wiped out by these things. So while people arent fearful per se there is a general foreboding feeling in the way people go about their lives. Hunters should also be far more serious and perhaps mention that hunters have an incredibly high mortality rate with most of them not making it to old age. ,RWBY,crjl27u,4,t5_2vhg0

You know how amazing twins are? Trick question everyone knows how amazing twins are. Can you name one group of twins who were bad characters? I dont mean bad as in antagonist I need bad as in lame. Another trick question  you cant.Another thing she has fucking Wolverine claws for weapons. You know whats stronger than Dust? Adamantium thats what. Shes has enough of that stuff on one hand to turn you into chopped celery and she has two hands. Count them two. Thats two more hands than a snake has and we know snakes are masters of CQC.

4484015,0,t3_3cik6l,Honestly Im a little worried we wont get much Ruby again in Volume .  The first two volumes have been centered around Blake which Im fine with but I did go through character fatigue with her last year.  I just want to learn more about the main character and Im worried I wont get what I want.I think Yang could go through a phase next season due to Raven.  There are tons of theories on who our mystery doppelganger is so Ill leave that alone.  Blake could also become moody again and Weiss could become more standoffish due to her company interfering in her life.  I could see Ruby also going through one due to the tournament but Id rather see the other characters have this trait.Overall I can best answer your last question by saying I want the show to match the music.  Id like the music to key us in on character traits themes backstory and foreshadowing.  If the music matched all the characters I think Id be content.As far as things Im worried about Ruby not getting focused as I said above.  Blake and Jaune being the focus again would annoy me.  Raven being Yangs mother wouldnt thrill me as Im more of a fan of them as sisters Penny being just a robot built to have emotions and more romance would annoy me.  Im not a fan of the romance drama in the show.Didnt mention her but Id also like to see more Weiss because the Loneliest of all thing should be touched on more.  Overall more team RWBY with less emphasis on Blake for now.  Key word team RWBY development.Edit Spelling and fixed a wordGod bless,RWBY,csvvivo,3,t5_2vhg0

Also they were ill suited for the deserts in North Africa and the steppes in Russia led to a lot of discomofrt.  The dark colour pattern actually turned out to be pretty easy to spot.  The habit of carrying gear on leather harnesses on the outside because they lacked the same amount of pockets the Allies or Soviets had weighed them down and made retrieving gear unwieldy.

4927483,0,t1_cufmbsj,gtIts subtly sexist.My issue with people claiming small things like this as sexism is that it puts a very negative view on the writers. I dont think that Miles Monty of Kerry are sexist. Sexism is a state of mind. Its the belief that one sex is somehow below the other. This is why intent is so important in discussions like this. If there was no intent for the content to be sexist otherwise stated as no belief that one sex is superior then there was no subjugation of a sex. I dont believe you can call something subtly sexist because the idea that one sex is superior to the other is either there or its not. Here I see no intent to this effect and anything that has been interpreted as sexist is just that an interpretation by the viewers. I believe the articles you linked were reactions that didnt account for the facts and consequently they are labelling the writers negatively and judging the show for something it never meant to say. I do apologize if this sounds rash but thats something I find unacceptable. Now I would like to ask the question if you are implying that subtly sexist has something to do with an unconscious state of mind on the authors behalf andor a societal issue? Because that drastically changes the discussion were having and there is a lot more to be said there.gtIt doesnt matter. She said no and he isnt respecting that.Similarly shes disrespecting him by assuming he conforms to the label shes associated with all other guys that have asked her out money vultures. Now that doesnt make it right. I think Jaunes decision is coming out of a place of wanting to spend time with her not trying to disrespect her. His intention isnt to disobey her wish its just that he wants a shot. Clingy not sexist is the closest thing you could say to that and even in that case there are arguments against. Lastly I get the feeling that this is basically whats going to happen to us. You make valid points for the stance youve taken but I just think your stance is flawed. Im sure you feel the same about me. Truce?,RWBY,cufncnv,2,t5_2vhg0

I got that from watching Pennys expressionsIf there is one thing I can say for sure is that Penny doesnt like Ironwood. Just looking at his face makes her frown.Then there is her anxiety when Ironwood says that the new robots need a human touch. Right after that Penny looks scared like if she wanted to run away from the scene. Call me crazy but I think she thought that Ironwood was referring to her and that he was about to reveal her to the world right in front of Ruby and thats the last thing she wanted.Thats probably why she doesnt like Ironwood. Because he treats her like a thing and since Penny says her father loves her so much maybe he also feels the same way as Penny when he sees Ironwood treating who he considers a daughter like that.,RWBY,cunrkrw,4,t5_2vhg0

I enjoy the character of Shirou a lot  hes the perfect asshole  and I love how Jaunes relationships have developed with everyone around him. Still kinda think his semblance is a little BS but it has some very interesting implications. One Good Turn Deserves Another More Dark Knight more relationship building. Me like.Writing I finally released the ninth chapter of Feel the Burn and boy has it been a doozy to write. Still I think its my best chapter yet! For the uninitiated its a real life AU featuring Freezerburn where Yang is a gym trainer and Weiss is the reluctant trainee After getting burned out on Feel the Burn Ive started writing the next chapter of The Purrfect Day a Pussy Magnet fic that I had originally made for Pussy Magnet Friday. More real world AU this time Blake is an aspiring writer and Pyrrha is a sports medicine student who has a liking for adult fiction  just like what Blake writes. Dunno how soon Ill have the next chapter out but probably by the end of the month. Recently adopted uDekktheODST amp uLeivves cancelled Four Scythes fic a cross between Zeldas Four Swords and RWBY.

5289701,0,t3_3ngftm,I...okay.    s . Runtime is meaningless but so is your argument.      Okay so a story can work with less time but that doesnt mean RWBY has too. Ive said before to compress rwby as is now into more information you commit pacing suicide And even if you cut the gags the show looses something partly that light at the end of the tunnel kind of tone despite the obsessive desire for this show to go full madoka magica thats not a good thing. We dont expect everything now just all the things the writers dont want us to know.      Heres what we know now. That due to years of subjugation several faunus formed the white fang leading for peace and equality however when that failed they turned violent. then enter a mysterious figure who took control of the orginization for their own nefarious purposes. What are they? why? Wanting answers to these questions is like reading the end of a book because you got impatient. WHich is all this is.  . How dare they not tell the story conventionally!    Fractal story telling isnt important its a good tool but its not needed.   . Its not Red vs Blue.      Red vs blue follows an entirely different story structure and exists seperate from RWBY. And if you think RvB ever cut its jokes I dont know where youve been but those are still a central focus.,RWBY,cvntl52,1,t5_2vhg0

5333368,0,t3_3o2bae,Honestly with the footage weve seen Im gonna go with Adam.  I think were already in store for a fight between him and Blake but Weiss would also make a lot of sense along with Yang.  I believe well see a fight between him and Ruby but him fighting all of team RWBY could happen.Mercury is a big possibility as he seems like hell be underestimated throughout the tournament.  A fight with Yang would seem likely and given how the writers have made it a big deal that shes not good against kickers I think shell lose.  Him taking out Jaune and a rematch with Pyrrha would also be interesting.Pretty much every character has the ability to overwhelm their opponents so you can add just about anyone to this list.  Qrow and Winter are probably good candidates.  Whenever the writers create new characters it seems they like to show them in action as well. God bless,RWBY,cvteayw,4,t5_2vhg0

And they would draw really quick sketches of things where theres just a guy throwing an uppercut and his fist is right up in the camera and the entire scene is tilted to make really awesome looking extremely dynamic compositions. Theres one of yang similar to that too And so art with extremely dynamic foreshortened poses is some of my favorites. ,RWBY,cw06ykx,2,t5_2vhg0

More and more important characters died untilwell if youve read the first book or watched the first season you know what Im talking about.ASoIaF also has enough characters that the story can go on without some of themif Sansa dies the Stark story can still be carried on by Arya and Bran and Catelyn and Robb if Tyrion dies the Lannisters can still be carried by Jaime and Tywin and if theyre desperate Cersei if Robert dies the royal role can be carried on by Joffery and Roberts family will continue in not only his children but also his brothers. The story will change but it will still exist.RWBY has done none of that. Weve seen one minor character die. Thats it. The plot has stayed tied to the same core group of charactersmainly RWBY Ozpin and Cinder if we discount the Jaune arcsand killing any of them risks critical plot disruption. Maybe with a few more Volumes of buildup the show will be at the point where main characters can die. I wouldnt be surprised if it never got there though.,RWBY,cwc2xng,2,t5_2vhg0

In that Adam seemed more than willing to kill of Schneeemployed crew members and since theyre Schnee theyre probably not Faunus. If a member of the White Fang and Blakes partner was willing to do such thingsand if what Blake said is true he had been doing so for a whilethen it stands to reason that maybe even if they werent strictly Faunus must live humans must die they or at least Adam  are worryingly okay with killing a group of people just to mess with the Dust supply.Beyond that fact it is just speculation as to whether that is because they were most likely human or whether heand possibly white fang in generaljust loves killin!,RWBY,cwxfnal,3,t5_2vhg0

5780382,0,t1_cxdfd17,Ive argued this point before but Coco likely cant quite get out of dodge quickly while holding her minigun in non purse form so she would have to fold her weapon up and then unfold it again to continue firing while yastu did his knockback. Not to mention I would bet that Merc and Emerald could easily get out of range of said attack and then you have Coco isolated from Yatsu without her weapon at the ready against two people whom are much faster then her.With the tank thing while Remnant definitely is a fantasy world we cant quite expect the same sort of mentality that you get with RPG characters i.e. As long as I have  hp Im okay. If the characters take significant dmg to one area they will be permanently effected so even if Yatsu is much more durable then his teammates hes still human even with aura boosting.Team CFVY losing this fight definitely serves to progress the plot but its far from the only reason it would happen.,RWBY,cxdm01d,1,t5_2vhg0

5871087,0,t3_3vo9ui,Ok so I have a lot of thoughts on the fightFirst I am loving how personal these fights are and the spirit of comradery spelling is hard that comes with them.Second lets talk about the synergy between Neon and Flynt and why they were able to make life hell for Weiss and Yang. Neon and Flynt had perfect synergy with each other as shown in their opening move with Flynt adding extra boost to Neons roller skating for double effect. And with regards to why Yang did so poorly in the early stages I think it is because Yangs fighting style is very high exertion she plants and throws all her weight into her strikes. By contrast Neon is always moving but because shes on skates shes not spending much energy to do so so she can easily chip away at Yang. As for why they ended up losing Yang semblance gt Flynt semblance and Neon chose mobility over stability and she missed a beat at the worst possible time. Third interesting note about semblances when Weiss sacrifices herself to save Yang from Flynts attack she has  aura and he has . She drags him into the fire with her and she emerges with  and him with . This reinforces the point that some people have more aura than others and Weiss apparently is a glass cannon.Now the fun stuff dat Yang eye twitch taunting yang is a dangerous game fact taunting Weiss was dangerous too. Also Flynts killer quartet is giving me serious nostalgia for high school jazz band great character. Favourite part of the episode has to be that last sequence with the v with Yang. ,RWBY,cxp8bt2,25,t5_2vhg0

Ozpin and Qrow are smart but not omniscient. fake pyrrha might not even be going to them its a big tower and all we know is that she was getting in an elevatorLook at the side stories the rest of team RWBY has going. Weiss has her conflict with Papa Schnee. Blake eventually has to confront Adam probably this season. Yang has her quest to find her mother. Ruby has.... absolutely nothing going on. Right now Ruby has basically no importance to the story shes just kinda there making funny quips every now and then.

5871833,0,t1_cxpb9e0,I would love to see that Blake coming full circle from revolutionary to Remnants Guardian. Honestly though I think Rubys purity of heart is the making of a guardian. Remeber only Ruby escaped Ooblecks questioning of her reasons for becoming a huntress in Field Trip. Unlike Blake Yang or Weiss she doesnt need to discover whats really driving her because she already knowsShe wants to save people from the monsters. That sounds like a Guardian to me. As Ozpin said in the opening of Ruby Rose But perhaps victory is in the simpler things that youve long forgotten. Things that require a smaller more honest soul. ,RWBY,cxpbuv7,35,t5_2vhg0

5879472,0,t1_cxq8gqw,Damn. Got me there. I do wonder why Weiss had her rapier but Winter didnt have her backswordsabre. The only explanation I can think of is that Winter and Weiss sembeances have small differences but that feels like a copout.There are a lot of different reasons on why Weiss has all of her dust in Myrtenaster. Dust could be absurdly expensive and Papa Schnee doesnt give her an abundance so she needs to ration it It could be extremely efficient so having more than the cylinders full is overkill It could be extremely volatile and having it on your person is dangerous Ruby made a  foot tall explosion by sneezing with a vial that fits in the palm of your hand or a combination of all three. ,RWBY,cxqbxhp,1,t5_2vhg0

5989771,0,t1_cy4p7bh,Hey dont beat yourself up for typing quite a long response to shitposting. Ive seen some shitposts that make me want to do the same thing. First off Im really sorry if I hurt your feelings. I had no idea you identified so closely to Yang. Personally I identify with Blake the most out of all the characters and because of that I sympathize with her a whole lot. And to be honest I can definitely get the same way when people act how I did towards Blake sometimes not really when theyre overly critical of her but when they dismiss her distressed period in Volume  as being a bitch or emo shit so I feel like you have nothing to apologize for. As I said before I know for a fact that that Yang definitely isnt a sociopath and mainly meant my analysis as a joke due to all the fake Yang vilification thats been floating around for the past week. I just happened to notice that some of her personality traits might align with textbook signs of sociopathy and even then the main reason I know the textbook signs of a sociopath is because of this page And because of that I can see some viewers unfortunately legitimately associating her with such. When it comes to being empathetic I mainly see it as the ability to imagine yourself in someones place and trying to understand why they do the things they do but I guess being able to relate to them also counts as well. And while I definitely would have been softer on Blake than Yang was a part of me is still glad she managed to snap Blake out of it. However there is one thing that annoys me. When Blake stops dancing with Yang and starts dancing with Sun Yang tells Ruby and Weiss I told you shed come even when she made it clear to Blake that she didnt need to go if she didnt want to meaning there would be no clear way for Yang to know that Blake was definitely coming. I know its very unlikely that she actually meant to do this but because of what she said to Ruby and Weiss it makes it feel like she actually manipulated Blake into going by cruelly playing with her emotions. That being said despite how Yang might act towards Blake sometimes as well as the fact that shes honestly my least favorite out of the  girls even I can see that she genuinely cares about Blake. Also I can definitely understand most of Yangs negative personality traits stemming from her difficult childhood and to an extent I do feel empathetic towards her for it. However I personally empathize with Blake a lot more because not only did she have to suffer unfair discrimination towards herself and her Faunas brethren her whole life but unless her parents or other family members are mentioned in some way later on its implied at least in my eyes that The White Fang are the closest thing shes ever had to a family. At the very least while Taiyang shut down emotionally Yang still had Ruby and Qrow even if Qrow was a bit emotionally distant due to his alcoholism and other emotional problems.  And I completely forgot about that part with Velvet back in Volume . Sorry about that and thanks for pointing that out. Finally even I agree that my analysis of her was quite unfair and thank you dearly for expressing your opinion on Yang. Even though you think you overreacted it was still interesting and very fun to read.,RWBY,cy4sg7d,2,t5_2vhg0

6146685,0,t3_3zqhzb,TLDR at the end.Reading through this thread I think I can sum up what everyone is saying and find the common denominator. We want more character development. We want to see the Grimm as real threats.The Breach was bullshit. We want the show to do less telling and more showing. We want better pacing overall. We want more lemon pledge. We want consistent quality in the animation and fight scene choreography. We want better explanations on DustAuraSemblancesMagic  World of Remnants just dont cut it. We want a better understanding on what the characters are actually capable of and their motivations.  We want to see our characters developing on screen not off. We want longer episodes. Oh god yes please. We want Pyrrha to live. Ok maybe thats ones just for me.RWBY Needs A Bigger Budget.Its completely understandable that RWBY is the way it is Rooster Teeth doesnt have the funding a major content producer has and they cant afford to throw money into a project that might fail. RWBY was a gamble to Rooster Teeth and Im glad its paid off. Thats why Vol. and Vol. are the way they are the show couldnt afford to have  minute long episodes and all the world building was rushed we didnt have time to see more of Cinder and set up their backstories they had to focus on what was absolutely necessary to move forward arguable. If RWBY could start over right now knowing how popular it would be Im certain it would be radically different than what we see today in terms of the points listed above. I think that with RWBY being released to Japan we will see another major jump in quality for the next Vol. assuming it does well. The whole concept of Magic in RWBY comes as a surprise giving everything else it shouldnt but more hinting should have been done earlier same goes with a lot of things I would have preferred to see last weeks episode VC  Spoilers Occur some where in Vol. or the start of Vol.. Many people feel like JNPR Ok well just Jaune amp Pyrrha get far more attention than they should given the shows name sake but given what weve learned recently it makes sense and shows that the writers really are planning ahead they just dont have time to show everything they want to. I feel like the shows early Volumes might put people off of watching it in the future if RWBY continues for years. While RWBY is nowhere near as bad RvB has the same problem a lot of people are put off by the quality of the first few seasons which makes complete sense considering is was just guys making a video not a multi million dollar company. and I usually show people the WashingtonCarolina Vs. FelixLocus fight in season  to get people interested. Anyways enough rambling. TLDR RWBYs biggest problem as a show is its budget I think the Rooster Teeth has shown they have the skillstalent to give us the show we dream of they are just limited by timefunding and their earlier work when RWBY was just a huge gamble to them. I believe RWBY will continue its exponential growth in quality well into the next few volumes and we will be seeing less of these problems in future story arcs. ,RWBY,cyobaq2,22,t5_2vhg0

6149728,0,t3_3zsa7m,gt  Yang isnt in jail. Probably the biggest one its pretty huge she isnt locked up like most assumed. Not only that but shes still wearing Ember Celica.  Perhaps shes been confined to quarters.  I cant imagine she isnt getting punished somehow unless Ozpin interceded on her behalf.gtThis could be due to one or two plausible things. The first being that it wasnt as big of a deal as people thought it is a tournament after all and injuries should be expected.  It got her disqualified from the tournament for sure but is breaking a leg really going to get people put in jail? Oh Im sure its still a pretty big deal.  Sure injuries in the tournament are always a possibility but never in an intentionally poorsportsmanlike manner.  I suspect it will be more about this never happens we need to discuss her fate behind closed doors and I swear if someone utters the words just like her mother... I will seriously lose it  gt It may not have been Cinders plan at all to have her jailed instead her focus being on drawing the Grimm near to cause chaos and divert attention.  I think this is the main crux of the plan.  Im not the only one to have said it but the Grimm invasion seems like its meant to be a distraction probably so Cinder can get at Amber to finish the job.,RWBY,cyonrdi,3,t5_2vhg0

Fuckin Savage Qrow.Did anyone else pick up on how after Yang says she saw Raven the music transitions into the same theme that played during No Brakes when Raven rescued Yang. Im also just now realizing that Raven and Qrows themes seem to be near identical the main difference is seemingly instrument choice. Both have a piano but Qrows theme uses a violin Or other string instrument not sure to accompany it while Ravens theme seems to use flutes.I dont see my sister very often.

Pyrrha was alienated by being a champion for most of her youth which while sad was tolerable and comparable to others like Weiss whos youth wasnt all sunshine either.What makes this so devestating was that Pyrrha was starting to have a normal life she had friends who liked Pyrrha not the Invincible girl.

Ruby moved back to suck Yangs neck again drawing a deep moan from the brawler.Ruby please! Yang pleaded her eyes flickering crimson.Oh I wont keep you waiting sis Ruby mischievously whispered into Yangs neck.Yang pulled Ruby toward her her hands clinging and greedily pulling Ruby into her.Suddenly a portal opened behind Ruby and ripped her from Yangs grasp. Raven held the reaper aloft by her belt giving her a stern look before chucking her back into the shifting maroon rift. Raven looked to Yang waving her finger sternly and scolding No! before turning to leave. She stepped back through and the portal closed behind her leaving Yang hot alone and bothered.The hell mom!?

I dont think it will matter if the Vale council says oh dont worry they cleared it with us first. If the people are mad then there will be repercussions against Atlas either way. gtthis aint the Olympics where winning is a big freaking deal.I would disagree here.The Modern Olympic Games were founded in the year  by Baron Pierre de Coubertin who was a French educationist and sought to promote international harmony and understanding through sporting competition. Seems an awful lot like how the Vytal festival tournament is described.The Vytal Festival Tournament was designed to test the strengths of the Kingdoms warriors in a safe and friendly competitive environment a wonderful method in which to ensure that the worlds Huntsmen would never settle for mediocrity but would constantly strive to become the absolute best they could be. I think winning the tournament would be exactly like if not better than winning a gold medal in the Olympics. Pyrrha won  smaller regional tournaments and shes famous in another kingdom and is on cereal boxes. gtBeacon wouldnt have three out of its eight teams be freshman ones and at least one more a sophomore team.Each team individually gets to decide if they want to compete no team is forced to. There were  total finalists meaning there was a total of  teams at the start of the contest. So each kingdom put in  teams we just didnt get to see them all. But at the end of the day I do understand your point and my argument is kind of a moot point since theres nothing to do about it now. ,RWBY,cyx8fzk,1,t5_2vhg0

Sure Im certain some Grimm have gotten through but not like this. At the same time as this fell swoop they lost a chunk of their defenses when Roman and Neo destroyed the airships. Considering that people were willing to go to such a poorlydefended place as Mountain Glenn they had no walls to speak of and basically just some elevation as a natural barrier I think its safe to say that theres been a lot of trust placed in the hands of the Huntsmen in the past. ,RWBY,cz4nfzi,1,t5_2vhg0

A train full of WFcontrolled Paladins crashing into downtown Vale followed by a ton of Grimm immediately afterwards would just pour fuel onto the fire. Particularly with the greater amount of Grimm that would have been attracted due to the broadcast.. But due to RWBY stumbling upon it before they were ready Torchwick started it early in an attempt to salvage it. The fact it failed probably benefited them more in some ways in the end.

6372781,0,t3_42wj8h,I do have some apprehensions about what the remaining three episodes may hold and I do hope that they are able to do something good with that. Grimm This is the second time theyve done the whole Grimm invasion thing so they really need to step up their game from Vs disastrous finale. Make them an actual threat and not a punchline to a literal kick in the balls.Maidens Make the Maidens impressive Ive found what little weve seen to be underwhelming and if we do see a display of Maiden powers it needs to be something that blows every display of power be it semblance dust or aura out of the water.Cinder Im really hoping that Cinder does something that makes me view her someone I want to see on screen I want to see every other villain in the series but her. Do something that will at least make me interested in what shes doing.SSSN Justify them. Do something with that that will make them seem worth it. Theyve been more or less pointless since last V despite having prominent shots in both openings and the crew saying they would be important. My expectations in this case are low since I highly doubt that Sage and Scarlet will even get proper introductions and instead be more like they were just kind of there the whole time.,RWBY,cze0juo,2,t5_2vhg0

I also follow the Christian themes values and symbolism found in the show.The story is over  words and while technically not finished Chapter  is the conclusion to the battle for the City of Valev during the events of Breach.

6495576,0,t3_44m53j,Okay onto the positives.Ruby vs Neo and Roman was awesome and not just as a fight. Neo was beaten in a way that makes sense and Romans cry of shock really sold their bond. I look forward to Neos reaction to finding out about his death and it would be really good time to give Neo her first words. Romans speech was great and I liked his death came at the hands of the Grimm since before I was kinda wonder why it seemed like only heroes were attacked by them. I know a lot of people are sorry to see him go but I dont really know if he can come back. This is a devastating attack and for him to go back to just stealing dust wouldnt work. He had gone to far and kinda had to be killed.Still holding out for a pacific rim final scene though.Although not perfect I still really like the Blake and Adam confrontation. It really sold their previous bond. Despite his extremes and slightly shaky VA Adam makes sense and for the first time seems worthy of leader of the WF reminding me a lot of Magento. Blake should have put up more of a fight shes a huntress not a damsel but Ill forgive it since just facing Adam goes against a lot of her nature.Also did Blake clone Yang as well? Surly Adam would have seem Yang move had it just been Blakes normal semblance. Ive gone back and forth on Yangs dismemberment. I like that it happened and think its a good step in Yangs development. She has always had a tendency to act without thinking since she has never really faced consequences for her actions. She leaps without looking and this time it really cost her. I look forward to seeing a slightly more unsure Yang for a little while at least. This season has been very humbling for her with even her victories being hollow and short lived.And although Ive seen complaints that Pyrrhas struggle was now pointless I still think she will be the Maiden. She got some of Ambers Aura before Cinder interrupted and I think this will push her to the top of the list one Cinder is killed. I also think that she will get Jaune to safety and then go back to help Ozpin.Ruby is also very close to Qrow Glynda and Ironwood so I think she will take part in the Cinder Brawl since a fight with CinderRuby has been teased since they met. Also are Mercury and Emerald just not doing anything else this season? Yangs down for the count so her rematch is pushed back. Emerald didnt seem like she wanted a fight while Weiss seems exhausted. Are we just done with them then.,RWBY,czr6vbd,4,t5_2vhg0
6495634,0,t1_czr6shx,I rewatched the Black Trailer. I definitely Feel Adams Semblance somehow involves his blade and slicing. He used it on the Spider Mech and oneshotted it when multiple hits did nothing. Although it does look like it needs time to charge. which he probably did when Yang was still calling out to Blake. So it probably could but needs time to charge and actually has to make contact,RWBY,czr7333,1,t5_2vhg0

6496142,0,t3_44mq1c,I must admit If I had heard that the maiden powers transfer didnt happen before seeing episode  I would have been extremely mad mad as in I would have gone all the way to Austin to choke Miles and Kerry because it has so much potential for plot and character development multiple personalities Arkos etc.But having watched episode  I will admit Im not even mad. While yes it does need to be acknowledged that a great source of potential has been lost the amount of character and plot development we got from the latest episode makes up for the most of it.The fight between Adam and Blake is exactly what I wanted and more and we also got to see more from Torchwick hes no longer generic main baggy  but someone who actually has motives and reasons for what hes doing sure they didnt go into amazing depth about it but its better than none at all which unfortunately I cant say for the  rest of the villians excluding Adam.I am slightly annoyed that the transfer didnt happen but the amount of things that happened in episode  make up for it.

6533555,0,t3_453cja,This is basically an abridged version of my comment from the episode discussion thread butgtFrom the Facebook QampA Does Roman have a Semblance or Aura of any kind?gtGray winkgtKerry wink wink Roman is alive. I predict a button scene after the finale credits where Roman brushes disintegrating Grimm off his coat he got swallowed whole and Ruby killed it immediately and see crew reactions above and no way is he dead  brushes disintegrating Grimm off his coat and says Man! Every time I get this thing cleaned! He showed too much of himself in that monologue to just get BaneintheDarkKnightRisesd. I love the fear in every line. He cant be dead because Gray is my favourite VA and Roman is my favourite character that he plays. So there. Volume  Episode  will see people talking about how Yangs been gone for weeksmonths having gotten a robot arm and gone searching for Raven but therell be only a hint of this in the finale if anything at all. Also I think Cinder is working forwith Raven and thats the person she was talking about in her jab at Ozpins arrogance. Thats how she knew how to find Yang on the train back in V and thats why Neo fucked off immediately. Also the portal is the same as with the Grimm bug the opening of every volume etc. This is to my knowledge the first time weve seen Ozpin hold his cane like its not a cane. Like its a weapon. There is going to be a hell of a fight here but Cinder will gain the upper hand and when it seems like all is lost  Ozpin will freeze her in time but will need to stay there for the rest of his life to hold the seal in place and everyone will recognize that this is not a permanent solution. This also opens up the potential for a classic unholyalliance arc later when some much much worse villain comes up in future volumes and they have to unfreeze Cinder to defeat it. Alternatively to secure the finality of Cinders defeat via timestop Ozpin will freeze her in time and himself as well ensuring that it can never be undone. If Blake is going to upgrade her weapon after all which I believe was originally slated for Volume  shell have plenty of time while shes in the hospital walking off that stab wound...! But again I think this will happen next volume not in the finale. Ooh another good punishment for Cinder would be for her to think shes won only for someone to kill her because she was seeing an illusion created by a remorseful Emerald. But as poetically just as that would be I dont see Em turning that quickly. There may be another hint at it like there was on the rooftop but thats all. Pyrrha realizes that she would have regretted it if shed gone through with the maiden procedure and she never should have  and thats when Jaune kisses her. For real though a little Arkos would be nice...!Overall though this sums it up pretty well.,RWBY,czv4e6h,3,t5_2vhg0

6539667,0,t1_czvqyc8,I get what youre coming from but I just cant agree to that idea. I would agree if BB shippers would appear and flood completely unrelated threads but I dont think they do. At least where Ive seen them more prominently is in stuff refered to this season finale. Predictions wishlist general discussion. And I think its totally okay since weve had a lot of BB teasing lately. Whos to say nothing could happen in the season finale?Now now this is coming from someone who likes Bumblebee but doesnt believe itll happen in this volume. I think that if it happens at all it will take several volumes and maybe even happen near the series finale. But saying Guys accept that it wont happen now its... unfair I think. As an opinion its perfect Its what I believe. But I dont think it could be used as an argument for keeping the BB comments out of the season finale discussion threads.,RWBY,czvr6lz,-1,t5_2vhg0

If that was the case I think itd be cool to make the scar crimson not only the same colour as Adams motif and Semblance but also the same colour her eyes go when she becomes angry.

6567058,0,t1_czyl0hw,Im actually a bit frustrated at how Pyrrha went out now that Ive thought about it a bit more. Like it really was completely pointless. She accomplished absolutely nothing but acting as the catalyst for a Ruby character development. Which is fine Ruby needs character development. But ultimately Pyrrhas death was rather pointless she was dumb enough to think she could accomplish anything against someone whom she believes just defeated Ozpin. After Oz told her that she would only be in the way. Pyrrhas brave but not a fucking idiot. It just seems like the writers needed someone to die so that Ruby could activate her silver eye mybrand ability. I think the doom and gloom would have seriously benefited from a significant ray of hope scene at the end of the episodecredits. Instead we get Grimm lady monologue and Qrow turning into a Crow.  ,RWBY,czyl6p1,2,t5_2vhg0

I refuse to believe that on a team full of Godlike OPness like that his semblance was just turn into a single fucking bird. If its straight up shapeshifting fine awesome if he can turn into a swarm of birds fine he could probably do something cool with that. But turning into one bird is way to specific and useless in combat of a power considering how powerful Qrow supposedly is.The only way Ill accept that being his semblance is if its a specific character point for him that he cant rely on his semblance in combat so instead he just pushed himself to be the strongest fastest guy around and beat everyone else with nothing but Aura and weapon skill.ampnbspand if its magic then Qrow is a straight up Druid...

6580604,0,t3_45t86f,Actually I think she may have hitched a ride with Ruby somehow on her scroll or something as sort of a Im always with you type thing and that was her plan all along.  Im sure she has a backup somewhere in Atlas who probably doesnt have the exact memories but may have the same personality quirks that Ruby will have to fill in later.  We havent seen a lot of Penny scenes so oddly enough her . version could probably be up to date in a few minutes especially if shes around Ruby enough.  Also Penny . and . meeting sounds amazing to me.For some reason Im getting a vibe that the dark ending that we saw to Volume  isnt as dark as we may think and that many of the characters are going to go through reversals next volume which would obviously include Penny.  Im hoping and actually starting to think that RWBY might not actually be as dark as were being led to believe...Edit Fixed sentence God bless,RWBY,czzzl2h,2,t5_2vhg0

Still uploading there are another half a dozen chapters left. I think once my OC fic catches up to the show Ill go back to working on it.Finally Ive written the outline for a rather long Baked Alaska fic where Neo is the one to pull Yang out of her depression. Its trash but its my trash. And as soon as I finish up my other two projects and get rid of my last shred of dignity Ill start writing it.Reading Ladybug Diary bu ushowmeyourfury.

Monty had plans for when Ruby was an adult but it may be he wanted to go even further into the future of Remnant. If thats the case then there is no ending for RWBY as a show but as for RWBY the team there may be a planned end for them. Of course this is speculation.

6654840,0,t1_d07mvr6,I am so excited to see what happens to Neo. Recently after reflecting on the show I realized shes one of my favorite characters just because shes good at fighting she is really mysterious and for some reason the fact that she never talks makes her seem unique to me. Theres so much ambiguity about her like her eye colors her semblance stuff like that. Its also cool and funny how shes like  feet tall. I dont think she died if she just held on to her umbrella after she flew off she would have landed eventually and she could handle herself based on what weve seen.But imagine what will come of the character when she actually has an emotional vendetta against someone and isnt just following orders from Tortchwick. The way he says Neo!  when she flew off made it seem like there was more to the two than just Neo being a henchman. It seemed like they were actually friends. It also helps that she was the one who set Tortchwick free as far as I know Cinder didnt even care about Tortchwick by that point. I could totally imagine Neo expressing to Cinder that she was going to free Tortchwick even if he wasnt important to the plan. Then Cinder would be annoyed but she would still allow it.Im fine with Neo being used as a device to bring the two sisters back together as long as they make her cool.,RWBY,d07o2d9,3,t5_2vhg0

She may or may not declare her love for Ruby then.Alternatively Penny will get Shockwaved and start to work towards her own version of Dark Cybertron Dark Remnant? but at the cost of pretty much everything else forcing the heroes and villains to stop her. Eventually Ruby faces off Pennywave and manages to get her to regain her emotions and morality leading Penny to be horrified at what she did and willingly allows Ruby to kill her in order to stop her plan from succeeding.Alternatively alternatively Penny gets Gray Foxd and is in constant agony and hunts down Ruby just so that she could put an end to her. She either dies for good freed from her suffering and giving Ruby one last Thank you or Ruby somehow manages to fix Penny up and stop whatever is ailing her.Beacon will eventually be cleared of Grimm and rebuilt.

And as for scythe blades Im not sure Id do that. Again because if you fired and lost your grip you could send the scythe portion right into a limb or your torso. That could be at best a cut that needed  stitches. At worst the loss of a limb or a abdomen wound in one of your gut organs.

6747002,0,t1_d0h72pw, Love triggers wonderful endorphin and other chemical reactions in our body which we experience as joy. Our love for others often can trigger this joy as can the receiving of love from our self or from another. The joy of love acts as a powerful reinforcer of the behaviors of love and to the love relationship itself thus encouraging repeated healthy behaviors which help a relationship to last.  Sociobiologists have hypothesized that this reward function of love may be the most important survival mechanism higher life forms have.  No other factor operates to connect protect nurture heal and then rewards us for doing so.  As it was once said And the greatest of these is love. ,RWBY,d0h735t,32,t5_2vhg0

Similarly we dont get to see Ruby and Blake interact either in fact we didnt even get to see winter and yang interact which is a real let down given the whole older sister connection.Hopefully the upcoming volumes will change that especially if RNJR stop at Vale.,RWBY,d0ly7ll,5,t5_2vhg0
6790837,0,t1_d0lycsl,The other thing in addition the short episodes is that Ruby and Blake dont seem like two people who would hang out that much. Sure they work together fine was a team but Blake is mellow and shy and Rubys kind of the opposite. I mean Blake and Weiss interacted a lot because they had some serious shit to work out Yang and Blake interacted a lot but that was because Yang needed to help her partner and even it was hard for Yang to actually get Blake to talk to her about that stuff.I see the relationship between Ruby and Blake as something that will probably eventually happen but in due time.,RWBY,d0m137i,2,t5_2vhg0

6794011,0,t3_48rz97, Hunters are a surgical precision tool. Massive armies and Dust nukes will kill Grimm just fine but the side effects are equally big ranging from the sheer damage heavy munitions cause to just the psychological factor. Instead of faceless masses digging in you have a few superheroes pop by reduce the Grimm into tiny ribbons and then have some tea while chatting about the weather.Not to mention how specific superpowers could be immensely useful someone with say healing would be invaluable in a harsh environment. This was mentioned in a WoR they pick up contracts and people pay them for killing Grimm. By and large they are separate from the governments but as Atlas shows its not a rule you probably could affiliate with whatever you want after graduating. Aura is your soul corporealized. Semblances healing the passive and active barriers and all other nonDust magic feats Hunters are capable of doing are founded on Aura.Semblance is the power unique to the individual. Everyone gets one although you most likely need an unlocked Aura to use yours.Dust is primarily that although the more exotic forms like Gravity can be used for all sorts of things Weiss uses presumably Lightning dust to create her Haste glyphs. Basically element in a bottle. Fire Dust can be used just like gunpowder since it blows up easily but with the knowhow you could probably make it into a fireball a furnace a source of lighting or a blowtorch. Without Aura Hunters are just humans with training in unwieldy weapons. Like I said in point  theres a reason why Hunters are trained so theres no real equivalency between them and cannon fodder. Just having either at ones disposal isnt optimal.,RWBY,d0me361,2,t5_2vhg0

6887637,0,t3_4a2pb9,I could go into a detailed exposition about why Oobleck never asked Rubes that question or how given her character so far Ruby getting corrupted wouldnt really be good storytelling. But the others have already touched on the most important points. Id be happy to go into systematic details if you want though.Ultimately what Ill say is this Rubys the one mistake of Ozpins that will atone for all his others. His absolute faith in her is not misplaced. As an addendum despite other superficial indicatives the entirety of Ozs behaviour shows that he actually didnt believe in Pyrrha as much. Certainly nowhere near as much as he does in Ruby. Pyrrha was the most logical choice at the time  hardly made by him though it was probably decided collectively by the Ozluminati.,RWBY,d0x1456,1,t5_2vhg0

And I get the feeling that its but a taste of what Blake has planned for Adam. If I had to guess I think the Blake in this story left Yang to protect her. And then lost and confused as to what to do next she decided on a new goal. If she couldnt be there for Yang then she would get justice for her. Starting with the one who set up the illusion that framed her. Im guessing next is Mercury. Then she comes for Adam.Obviously shes smart enough to realize that taking them in straight fight isnt wise. So shes ambushing them. Taking them off guard. Setting up the entire situations to be as favorable as possible. And she treats each target as practice for the next. Honing her skills. So that she can be ready to take on him.,RWBY,d0xgct9,3,t5_2vhg0

6942867,0,t3_4ar1a1,Yang While Blake leaving and abandonment certainly plays a large role in her current depression Id hesitate in making it the primary factor. Yang has been through a lot in a short period of time. First she was tricked into breaking mercs leg which turned out to be robotic and the entire world thinks she is violent and dangerous. She was already pretty shaken up over just that. Then she loses her arm her best friend abandons her and she learns that two of her friends are dead and her school is destroyed. I dont think you can single out any one thing from that and say its the cause of her depression.Qrow Ive always taken that line from the poem to just be hinting at part of the mythological basis for Qrows character. All the characters have some similar basis and many of them have related semblances. If anything Id say that poem being there was hinting at his semblance rather than it being a hint at any kind of magic but really its neither.

7009999,0,t1_d1auj2t,well Monty from what ive read had already outlined the virst like  or  volumes worth of RWBY. I personally think if he was gonna perma kill a character as important as Phyrra it would have been later on....like let her somehow acquire the full power of a maiden then still get defeated by a nonmaiden character to show how BA said villain was.....totally spitballing but the main point is with how Ozpin gtfod in some unknown way and the manner we saw Pyhrra go I feel honestly some plot device is gonna be used that she isnt gone. It was traumatic and violent but didnt feel permanent for me...idk... i got a feelin.   Penny....we can rebuild her....we have the technology same for Yangs eventual likely mech arm....

Subtle things like altered speech patterns and tone. Maybe he gets a pep talk from the team and then youll see him gradually shift again but not as a focus point just in how he acts while the other characters are getting some much needed development and as the world moves on around them.Edit Also dont forget that Jaune and the team have already had some time to mourn.

7032790,0,t3_4bv4q0,LAST WEEKS POSTWRITINGGood one. Lifes been weird this week.HELPING WITHWhen Allied Together by uMichael  Volume  fic following Team RNJR. Each chapter is told from the perspective of one of the characters. Clever feelsy and with canonfaithful characters to boot.HARP by TheHfulMs  Alternate timeline OC fic featuring a rebellious rich kid a curious warrior a brotherly miner and a stern orphan. The characters are my favorite part of this fic which is a good sign given its an OC fic.FOLLOWINGResurgence by Kraven Ergeist   Kraven is certainly making a name for themselves with this Volume  fic. Rubys off with JNPR Weiss is stuck doing Peace Corps sort of work in Atlas Blake is scavenging in whats left of Vale and Yangs moping around on Patch  but thats not at all a permanent state of affairs. Seems to be laying track for Lancaster and Bumblebee but nothing majorly shippy has happened yet as this work favors action and suspense.The Physics of Friendship by uTokyoFoxtrot  OC fic featuring a team a year or two younger than RWBY. Hasnt gotten terribly far plotwise due to the short chapters but the sound style holds promise and the banter between the characters is rather entertaining.From the Remains by uDantesInferno  Volume  fic. Yang gets a nice new robot arm that comes complete with Pennys AI and she makes great use of it in her bid to reunite Team RWBY. Cycles between feels action and sweet gratification.Room  by Legion published by uNobleMETA  One wild ride of a college RL AU in which RWBY and JNPR somehow end up sharing an eightperson dorm. Equal parts ridiculous humor and adorable shipping  I think Ive seen Bumblebee White Rose Renora Scarlet Knight and a little bit of North Pole  although its not incapable of taking a turn for the dramatic. Or apparently the lewd.The Girl Made of Marble by usodnam  Medieval AU fic. Game hunter Ruby happens across an underground temple behind a stone statue but that statue isnt particularly still. Im a fan of medievalhistorical AUs so Im definitely keeping an eye on this one.A World of Bloody Evolution by uRedrumSprinkles  Longrunning WarhammerK crossover fic. Yang finds herself stuck on an alien world with a different set of rules fortunately shes something of a natural at the game. Dark brutal and even a little gory at times but theres enough comic relief to keep it entertaining. Definitely a gripping read with enough worldbuilding that youll likely understand whats going on even without K experience.Spectrum by SuperSaiyanCyndaquil  Alternate timeline in which Jaunes sisters control seven artifact weapons and Jaune has been groomed such that his sole purpose in life is destroying these weapons in case they ever come to life and possess their wielders. Packed with action and drama. Appears to ship Dragon Slayer but it catches late burns slowly and encounters a little interference.For the Record by James Locklear  Jaune perfects his style of fighting but still cant win any duels and Blake and Pyrrha take it upon themselves to restore his confidence by figuring out why. Mostly action and drama but with a little romance here and there. Seems to be an Arkos vs. Black Knight triangle going on.Premium Well  Redux by DinasEmrys  Godtier postgraduation AU. After dealing with Adam Cinder and graduation Team RWBY faces both a new enemy and their growing affections for each other. A dramatic adventure with plenty of romance and more than a little smut but only on the Archive of Our Own edition. Ships White Rose and Bumblebee.Blood and Ink by showmeyourfury  RL AU in which florist Ruby sets up shop across the street from tattooist and crime lord Cinder who immediately takes a liking to her. Mostly creepy occasionally violent but thats mostly due to an extremely onpoint Cinder. Ships Falling Petals.By My Shoulder I Protect Thee by uLC  In which Jaune is slightly but noticeably more competent Crocea Mors gives him video flashbacks of his ancestors lives and he must use these flashbacks to deal with a powerful new strain of Grimm. Features action drama and more than a little mystery. Ships Arkos but at a slow burn  dont worry Jaune isnt that much more competent.RWBY Grand Prix by ujws  s Formula One AU fic in which Yang and Weiss are drivers from wellknown families and Ruby and Blake act as their mechanics. Dont worry if you dont follow motorsports  the informations presented such that youll learn everything you need to know as you read and the two worlds of RWBY and Formula  are overlaid almost seamlessly. This fics done but keep an eye out for the sequel.One Good Turn Deserves Another by Coeur AlAran  Highly acclaimed alternate timeline fic in which Jaune saves Blakes life at great risk to his own paving the way for some superslowburn Black Knight. Alternates between scenes of war and scenes of school life but in typical Coeur fashion both are strong.Hot Cold and Everything in Between by Juwpiter  High school AU fic in which Yang tries to rescue Weiss from the designs of her father. Another fic that toys with emotions sometimes pleasantly sometimes cruelly but always enjoyably. Ships Freezerburn and Ladybug.Roses of the Reaper by uChallos  In which Ruby gets ported back in time to when Team STRQ still attended Beacon with the mission of saving her mother. And the world I guess. Thats pretty important too. The best description I can give for the style is something like Hitchhikers Guide but with a discernible plot.SOME FAVORITES highly recommended for new readersInch by uNarutochaos published by uGodEmperorPenguin  Godtier untoldscenes fic in which Jaune manages to break down the glacial wall that Weiss erected to block him out and life takes them on a wild ride from there. Inch fastforwards and rewinds constantly but in doing so it poses questions answers them then throws curveballs that pose more questions creating a gripping and satisfying work of art all the while. While the time skips are its defining characteristic its certainly not its only one but Ive already written at length about that. Ships White Knight in a realistic canonically faithful and likely relatable manner.Remnants Reclaimer by uHystericalCHijinks  Highly acclaimed...uh...I guess its a timeskip fic? In an effort to escape Cinders final gambit a warhardened Ruby Rose hits  miles per hour and ends up back in her freshman dorm with her team including her younger self. Often violent sometimes bawdy occasionally completely adorable this fic has just the right amount of everything and it portrays the world of Remnant and its characters beautifully. If you havent read this pick it up now and perhaps youll be caught up in time for the soontorelease exciting conclusion.,RWBY,d1disk6,2,t5_2vhg0

7035711,0,t3_4bzl1c,Ive been wanting to be an animator for RWBY ever since it started with the Red trailer. I want to be an animator for Rooster Teeth in general. I wont be satisfied with any other job. I know there are companies and studios with a similar environment and people like Rooster Teeth but there is something about them that compels me from wanting to go anywhere else. Sure I will work for other companies should I get hired aside from them and maybe my mind will change in the future but currently my dream job is to be with them.Ive explained my dreams to my family and only my mother believes I can do it. Everyone else has discouraged me mainly because I dropped out of college so that behind my passion is what drives me even further to be an animator at Rooster Teeth. However I want to be hired because of my skills. I dont want to go if they dont think Im good enough. I want to actually earn my place there.Its the one place where I know I will be inspiring thousands of other people in the world and making so many people happy if Im able to contribute my future skills even if they dont know who I am. I want to help spread the inspiration RWBY has given me by actually working on the show.And it sucks living in Pennsylvania. Why should they hire a guy who lives hundreds of miles away from them? Just one person with this dream that hundreds of others share? Why do I deserve this dream more than the others? Itd be more convenient to hire someone locally like Dillon was. He deserves it greatly just look at the beautiful animations he did for RWBY in volume .Thoughts like that tend to get at me but I suppose not giving up is what will make me successful. Every step forward I take is a step forward someone else isnt making. And working at Rooster Teeth isnt something I want for fame or money or anything like that. I dont care if Im homeless the entire time I want to be there purely for the passion and inspiration it will bring to others.My dreams go beyond simply working there. Once I achieve that goal I have other goals I want to accomplish afterwards but for now Ill stay small.Sorry for rambling but this is something very serious to me. Ever since Monty passed away Ive been trying to gain even an ounce of his resolve and Ive been struggling. Making posts like these makes me feel better even if others just skim over it.,RWBY,d1dur7q,8,t5_2vhg0

I want to be feared. I want to be powerful. Mercury is Pride No quote needed. Just look at that smirk Neo is Gluttony I mean shes based on Ice Cream... Emerald is Envy Green with and also I feel as though she is going to become envious of the heroes at some point down the line Salem is Wrath This one is just speculation but it seems as though shes going to be the big bad enemy so it fits well.These could also be switched around so that Cinder is Lust for power Adam is Envy Desires the freedom that humans have.

7052913,0,t3_4c6ckj,Its a really good artwork but...it just feels too clean too easy you know?  Like I get it people hate Adam because hes a douche who abused one of the main girls and crippled another. So they want him to suffer preferably by Yang or Blakes hands.  But I REALLY hope it wont go down like how it is showed here or some other pics I saw him suddenly being defeated without a problem. The whole reason for that scene other than setting up Blake and Yang for RWBY splitup and their character arcs was to show how powerful Adam is.

Recently Ive been on a Roosterteeth high  months or so where Ive been watching the crap out of everything including basically all of the shorts and definitely all of the RTAAs as well as rewatching many of them because I ran out. I stayed away from RWBY even while I was aware of it for at least  years Ive been a rooster teeth fan for much longer because I just thought that anime wasnt for me. I decided to give it a try and finished watching it yesterday. Took  days overall. Immediately subscribed to this subreddit.I dont exactly remember what pushed me to watch this but it couldve been the tribute to Monty Oum.I really appreciate his work now.I miss him.,RWBY,d1gs07v,1,t5_2vhg0

They are just more fun to use. I always think its more fun to go v with trusty  staff than say a kendo shinai. My kendo friends disagree but they are wrong.That alone makes Sun one of my favorite characters in term of fighting style and I really want to see more because theres only been one really good fight where I feel like the full potential of using a staff has been shown off.Also Gunchucks we need more of that too for obvious reasons.,RWBY,d1gz6uy,5,t5_2vhg0

7086982,0,t1_d1jg7tw,That RubyJaune thing sounds strange the way u describe it atleast the ending it has the all that for nothing feeling D If u wanna go that route atleast let her have feelings for him in the end. But just to keep akward situations like that at bay lets go with a good platonic friendship for  Volumes and maybe then we can have abit romance which I wouldnt mind at allAtlas is just the Kindom we heard the most of but seen almost nothing same for the rest ofc uhhh the excitement!Im still thinking who else is still in vale. Glynda is there but they never interacted onscreen same goes for Junior and his goons. Atleast she met Neo who could replace the role of Roman in ur theory if only she would talk more.Besides Sun or Yang who are already unlikely I just can think of some kind of deserted White Fang member whos not introduced yet. Hm wait do u know where Team CFVY went? Atleast she talked to Velvet sometime in V... Boy I have no clue xD for me Sun seems the most likely he clearly showed concern towards her in Vwhat do u think? not considering presumably dead CharactersOfc till now he was alone in his situation but seeing his normally so strong daughter depressed in bed must trigger smth in him. If not he isnt that much of a better father then Raven was a mother.Yeah someone sure who do u think of if not Tai?

I dont see summer or Ruby being sad about Adams death so if either of them are the moon it still sounds like they watch themselves and their family member die.Yeah the Ozpin thing... I really have no justification in the form of actual proof. It just always felt like that too me because the moon watches from far away and high above aloof. That just reminds me how Oz watches them and plans from on top of his tower not only literally high above them but also socially as headmaster and abilitywise. The best comparison I can think of to show howwhy this aloof watching is linked to the moon for me is with the man on the moon in  Disneys The Rise of The Guardians. He is obviously tied to the moon and he plays a nearly identically role as Ozpin he organizes the guardians leads them without taking much direct action himself and chooses to guardians when it is needed for new threats like how Ozpin chose Pyrrha.,RWBY,d1u5ywe,2,t5_2vhg0

Shed want to wear the suits to look stylish but grumbles when she has to wear the correct uniform.Okay since were on a Ruby amp Torckwick roll here Not Rosewick have another basic idea. Qrow and Roman swap roles in the story. This could also work as an addition to the idea above of Roman training Ruby.

7223929,0,t3_4ead1q,Weiss and Jaune are really opposites in a lot of senses. Due to factors growing up they suffer from complexes in response Weiss is haughty and condescending while Jaune is selfdeprecating and unsure. They both have a sort of familial pressure and deal with it in contrasting ways. Weiss by rejecting it and Jaune by trying to fit into it. At their core they are both generally good people and want to change the world for the better despite prejudices but Weiss is cold and selective of who she interacts with unless she feels she can use them. Jaune on the other hand is awkward but well meaning and kind. Weiss is always measuring consciously keeping track of herself and abilties thinking before acting. Jaune is instinctive offering a hand without a second thought his semblance activating automatically maneuvering his allies on the battle field within moments of meeting them.  ,RWBY,d1zb1t4,1,t5_2vhg0

The entire maiden powers thing is dumb but the idea that technology could transfer those powers and that both those concepts were introduced within five minutes of each other with no actual hints beforehand tells me that it was shoehorned in to make Pyrrha die.

I think Blake will attempt to ambush Adam put up a good fight but be unsuccessful. At that point shed see that she would have to take the risk by getting friends involved even though her lonewolf approach was done to keep her friends out of the conflict to begin with. And her struggle against Adam and the WF both alone and eventually alongside her allies will provide bucketloads of character development. Its just that right now she doesnt want to risk getting her friends involved. And from that she has a desperate desire to eliminate the threat by challenging Adam despite the obvious risks.

I absolutely believe Penny is a person but you take away the soul and shes just scrap metal which is just like if you take away a persons soul they are just fleshy meat. I probably should have made it more clear I do agree that Pyrrhas headpiece remaining is probably just symbolism and has nothing to do with her coming back. I was just making the claim that we know Auras and therefore souls dont follow normal rules all the time. If you can transfer Aura from person to person and can somehow generate or transfer aura to a constructed device then whose to say you cant put it in an inert object? gtPyrrha wouldnt know to store herself cinder wouldnt want toPyrrha probably wouldnt have a say in the matter and who knows Cinders motivations and future goals? Cinder placed Pyrrha on a list for a reason if it was just people to fuck with then why wasnt Yang on it too? maybe she was Why did Pyrrha have the red bubbles leave her chest when Cinder shot her yet Amber didnt? Why did Cinder bother burning her at all? I dont have any answers and it might be a long time before we get some if we get them at all but there is a ton of room for speculation and its hard to say anything definitive on the matter. ,RWBY,d21wgw3,2,t5_2vhg0

7262121,0,t1_d23mya2,What has basically happened is that Federal Student Loans being tailored so that students are immune to interest and other nonsense for the duration of their education allowed universities to pump up their tuition costs with the new influx of them sweet dollarydoos students now had access to. An associated problem is that the interest rates on these massive loans are ridiculous and are leading to inescapable debt for a ton of students. Additionally universities have gotten less and less state funding as of late and not enough Federal funding to make up for it. Schools also spend exorbitant amounts of money on massive bureaus of administrators on things that have nothing to do with education on the salaries of professors and on other things that attract students. Universities also tend to invest massively disproportionate amounts of money into singular toprate students in order to make the universities look better. Private schools have lost a lot of subsidies as time has gone by. I mean if you compare the cost of college today to that of like  its absurd. The yearly cost then was like  of the average household income and now  in many cases  the cost is  at some public schools to  at some private schools and many public schools if you are an outofstate student.And to make matters even more ridiculous a ton of the shit we teach in undergrad could and really should be taught in high school.,RWBY,d23nhic,1,t5_2vhg0

7305155,0,t3_4fg3hu,I think all the deaths so far should be kept but possibly with the exception of Penny.Pyrrha dying was such a massive event that bringing her back in any way would sort of invalidate the entire finale. Although it could be cool if she returned as a ghost or something but only for a little while I feel that she should stay dead. It gives the rest of RWBYJNPR an opportunity to have some great character development.Id like Torchwick to stay dead because this opens up a lot of character development for Neo who has been a really mysterious character so far. Id personally like to see Neo have some more character development here because she has potential.On the off chance that Penny does come back Id like it to be at the cost of a complete memory wipe. Same body same weapons but she remembers nothing at all. Or maybe partial memories but shes restricted to a digital form with no physical body.,RWBY,d28jp9h,2,t5_2vhg0

7335107,0,t1_d2bmi8i,gtno too many bee postsWhat a amazingly devastating attack on easily the most widespread and vocal ship. Clearly these comments are offensive and should be removed because they personally attack all the bees. Clearly anyone complaining about the overwhelming amount of Bee stuff should be silenced. I told you all to report and document things like harassment. Harassment did not show up in the reports probably more than once. Things that break the rules should be reported. Harassment should be reported. Not just anything antibees.gtAdd in the large amount of actual hate and harassment Bees got on Bee related postsIn no way am I endorsing this hate but theres a certain amount of fault when certain bees act the way they do elsewhere. Bees that Ive seen championing no just leave us alone we dont bother anyone. People get annoyed this is the response. If you want a safe haven free from criticism or backlash this isnt going to be it especially when certain members of the hive continue to do the things that bother people. And when your definition of harassment includes pretty much anything youre going to see a high amount of it. I linked our definition of it on the subreddit twice.gtIts not like the resentment felt for all those posts that you never saw just goes away people are gonna be more sensitive because theyre so used to being harassed. The resentment has a source too. All the arguing about whether or not bees were canon? When some bees went around zealously picking fights with anyone who brought doubt up about it being canon? You mean that twoway street that was pretty much a direct result from all that? You mean that thing that you can still occasionally find on the subreddit? Even if right now you subtract antibees from probees bees still have an enormous lead in shipping real estate. Its like David vs Goliath.  Bees vs Every Other Ship is still probably still a win for BB support too. Should I start documenting all the annoying things done in the name of the hive? No because it doesnt break any rules. Sure I find it annoying but Im not going to the other mods asking for the OK to remove it because it doesnt break rules. And even morally I wouldnt say silencing it is the right call. Neither does almost any of this harassment. The community can sort itself out with downvoting and discussion which has happened on that comment youre probably referring to gtBut if you want to deflect any calls to action by saying that anything is fair game for derision and harassment fine. Theres  mods. Im not the only one approving those comments and reported posts either. What youre calling for is mods endorsing and protecting your OTP. This subreddit is not a safe space for anyones OTP.If it breaks rules well remove it. ,RWBY,d2by92o,6,t5_2vhg0

7353007,0,t1_d2dyidb,Jaune woke up to the sensation of tingly mildly stinging buttocks.  What happened last night...? He looks around noticing the rest of team JNPR in wild disarray. Nora is draped over Ren and Pyrrha is half hanging out the window.  Nobody else is conscious.  He briefly remembers something about celebrating their victory over the White Fang but a sharp burst of pain from his now manifesting hangover convinced him to give it a rest.  The stinging grows persistent and Jaune reluctantly limps into the bathroom to use the mirror.  Carefully and quietly locking the door he drops his jeans and turns around.  Splotches of red and bronze immediately caught his eye.  Emblazoned on his left buttock for all eternity were the words  Jaune Arc  property of Pyrrha Nikos.  On his right  Pyrrha Nikos  property of Jaune Arc .Both were written in red and outlined in bronze in an elegant flowing script.  Very familiar flowing script.    The quiet of the first year dorms was abruptly shattered at eight in the morning on a Sunday.  PYRRHAAAAAAA!

And its great because we see some of that rub off on Weiss. Another cute moment is when Weiss asks Ruby how she takes her coffee and disappears for  seconds and reappears with her coffee not because it was a gag but because it shows us that Weiss and ruby take their coffee the same and that they have more in common than they thought. Weiss gave Ruby her own coffeeMy gripes? NONE OF IT MATTERS! WEISS IS STILL A TERRIBLE PERSON TEAM MATE NEXT EPISODE.

7436676,0,t1_d2nhvq1,I wouldnt say so. Shes robotic so the rules are different for her. If what they were saying with Amber and Pyrrha is true then memories and personality are likely contained within the soul in the RWBYverse otherwise there wouldnt be much risk of a change in Pyrrha. If thats true and there is a specific component that houses her soul then its entirely reasonable that she can be rebuilt.I also dont see how thats an asspull. Its kind of standard fare for robots to have some sort of core for where their energy is either stored or produced. For Penny I believe that her core is where her soul is housed and her aura is generated. To expand upon this I also think her entire body is powered by her aura instead of electricity or dust which would somewhat explain why its so shitty at defense since its constantly being taxed.,RWBY,d2ni39s,3,t5_2vhg0

7446427,0,t3_4h82ga,The set up of teams of four combined with four positions for super powered women seems a little conspicuous and the connections are already kind of around. Summer being Rubys mother can hardly be deemed accidental in a story where Maidens will play a large role. In addition Ruby releasing rose petals something that blooms in summer... Kind of how Ruby is tied to Summer through her mother I find it hard to believe that Weiss having a sister named Winter isnt something to notice. Additionally her last name is snow shes obviously themed around ice and winter... Blakes trailer takes place in forever fall. Shes a character that had to go through a metaphorical death and rebirth by leaving the White Fang and becoming a huntress in training. Shes also followed by her own beast Adam much as how Fall is followed by winter the representative of death.Side note Weiss will be the one to kill Adam not Blake.And Yangs foremost quality is her nurturing personality. We see it with Ruby pushing her to make new friends avoiding becoming her partner according to fridge logic and Blake with burning the candle. Side note  Yang will be the one to bring Weiss out from her fathers shadow.This is your local potato news station.

White trailer is also canon and the thing existed  thats proven by the summon Weiss summoned at the end. That scar and the way she doesnt care about hiding it also implies that its not something shes ashamed of.

7481415,0,t1_d2sknjf,I disagree to be honest. I really feel like they did nothing with Pyrrha. I know a lot of people loved it but I just dont get it. She just dies and its why I am firmly in favor of bringing her back in some form. The potential for corrupt Pyrrha is so much greater than dead Pyrrha and it would validate a lot of my problems with volume .Ruby had already lost Penny who she was far closer with. I really dont think they will have time to develop Jaune and Ren all that much and in any case they didnt need her death to do that.It really only affects Jaune but in my eyes Pyrrha was a far more interesting character than he could ever hope to be so its rather unsatisfying. And the story is now at the stage where any hero character could potentially just pull some magic out of nowhere to win a fight. Cinder cannot be defeated by ordinary means apart from maybe catching her alone. Im happy that you and the vast majority like the new direction but to me it was strongest before they killed Pyrrha split up the cast and introduced power ups. Hopefully season  will change my mind.,RWBY,d2slf8q,1,t5_2vhg0

7513996,0,t1_d2waavn,gtAnd it was boring then. That type of magic sucks since it takes all the skill and fun away from the fights. that was boring and lazy story boarding. i think RT was like ok how do we get rid of cinder kevin and resolve the situation  so we can go to the next scene? and everyone was like insta powerup......... we will figure out the details later when we write season . i mean i cant be the only one who was like why are you leaving so much critical shit that happened this season to be possibly explained in volume ?.its like the raven dream yang had at the end of season . its just to hype people instead of putting that scene in another place within the season.gtJaunes semblance actually has been foreshadowed and shown far more than Ozpin mentioning that Ruby has silver eyes. good point.foreshadowing is when you give meaning to the thing you want to use as foreshadowing. to put this in perspective you know that naruto has a special power in him and he will use it later on because it is stated from the start that he has a demon in him. the author of naruto used the demon as a tool to foreshadow narutos hidden strength later on and possibly him becoming the demon in the future. it was clear as to what is being foreshadowed here. but with ruby what was foreshadowed was only her eyes being special. on the other hand her eyes being powerful was not particularly foreshadowed because silver eyes could have meant anything from laser beams to her being a princess from a lost race or her being an experiment.that is why when i saw her eye power i wasnt just surprised i was like warriors? laser beams? freeze grimm? what?.but with jaune you know he has a powerful semblance because even though you see it it is made clear afterwards that the author wanted to keep his semblance a secret to jaune and everyone around him including the audience. therefore even if you dont like the whole OP power out of the nowhere you can still say that it was foreshadowed it would be OP.on the other hand i have this really huge feeling that monty planed to use jaunes semblance as a way to make him badass because characters being as weak as jaune are characters that have this one moment to shine thing where basically they make up to their uselessness because of how OP their hidden power is and then you never see that power used again or it is never developed beyond that where the character is irrelevant after it.you dont see ruby develop her semblance to be powerful over time or jaune discovering his semblance being really weak but masters it where he becomes really tough opponent over time because of the way he uses it.right now i know ruby will be a maiden one day in addition to her preexisting silver eyes powerup which is just................. a really lazy excuse to make your character stronger.,RWBY,d2way7x,7,t5_2vhg0

7589521,0,t1_d34rl8c,I think its telling that Sheena wasnt officially involved with RWBY. She was never credited nor hired. What it seems like is rather than Monty having full creative control which for any production where youre not in charge is impossible the idea was the Monty produce these great yet raw ideas. Then the Roosterteeth team molded and shaped it to be something thats consumer friendlywhat makes the most money. So in that context it makes sense why Sheena and Shane werent put in charge. They already had Montys ideas and like you said the two would have only been an extra obstacle of resistance. ,RWBY,d34w3if,14,t5_2vhg0

Plot lines get cut and changed all the time in writing. And they should.With Pyrrha vs. Cinder having Pyrrha holding her own to the point that she mightve won... wouldve been weird. Cinders in the big leagues fullymaidenpowered and Pyrrha is . Making her a little less perfect was a good call. Jaune causing the death wasnt necessary and we got an equally emotional moment with her sending him away and going to what she knew would probably be her death.Yang putting up more of a fight against Adam was probably cut for time which Im fine with because the pacing was on point throughout all of those last few episodes.,RWBY,d34yi8t,12,t5_2vhg0

7612251,0,t1_d37fkqv,i can not address what you said about yang pyrrha and the rest of the cuts and changes because as you said its speculation and i said in my previous post that fan speculation is niether an argument for or against RTs decisions. however i disagree on the rest of your post because what gave angry twitter and tumblr users fuel was not the changes made. it was the treatment of shanesheena and the reasoning behind those changescuts from shanes perspective. RT giving an explanation or a reasoning from their side on the changes should give these social media people two sides of the story instead of just having one. as for shane not being stable i also disagree on that. it took him several months to write that letter and release it. while he does mention positions in RT he never mentions names in a negative manner. he does not spoil anything except for raven vs jnpr foreshadowing something that we have no idea what it was supposed to foreshadow. even then he only said that as an example of why he thought montys wife knew more about rwby than RT. and even with that he still does not spoil what that foreshadowing was supposed to be even if that scene doesnt exist anymore. same goes for Pyrrhas death triggering a development in jaune. he does not spoil what that development was supposed to be as it might it be a change in his character which RT confirmed will happen to jaune in the BD commentary or maybe a  hidden power or semblance or whatever. what we see in the letter are his feelings clearly showing when talking about the changes or cuts made which. his own thoughts on them. even then doesnt expand much on the scenes because he just wabted to use them as examples. therefore i think shane is very stable considering the treatment he got as someone else could have done something worse in his situation spoilers wise. ,RWBY,d37h1lh,2,t5_2vhg0

The problem to me is not that Jaune has in an infatuation its that his infatuation gets us nowhere. Like you said its typical. Why do we even need to see it? It doesnt add to the story and in a show like RWBY whos original episodes were like seven minutes you dont really have time to spend on stuff like that.Jaune not being an amazing tactician doesnt make him poorlywritten but the way they tried to make him into one is. We can see by the Volume  fight hes improved when it comes to strategy but the only other place we see him displaying any skill in tactics is that first fight with the Death Stalker and thats just not an impressive display. If battle strategy is Jaunes strong suit and a lot of people make the argument that it is then show me.And I absolutely dont think hes poorly written because he took up time I just think they spent the time poorly. Pyrrha and Jaune never discussed anything of real consequence when I think their rooftop chats could have been a great springboard for other conversations that furthered the overall plot. But where did it take us? Back to Jaunes infatuation.Were all entitled to our opinions and mine are no more or less valid than anyone elses but I felt the need to defend some of my points.

Did I deny that she can support her team? No. I only said that its not the only thing shes good at.The whole Weiss skillset and abilities rely on fighting in close range. When Weiss fights the armor  she fights at close range. When she protects Ruby for the first time  she comes into melee range. When she freezes Nevermore to enable Ruby Launcher attack  she comes into melee range. When she disables mechs sensor  she does it with her rapier. When she fights Grimm with the team or goes against Banesaw  all happens at close range. Shes versatile and she can do a good job of supporting the team but she can do a lot by fighting by herself as well. And she can combine both.,RWBY,d3kfbor,1,t5_2vhg0

That fight in general is lazily done but they really needed to put more work into Yangs section.However Neo I think works. Neo is Insulting Yangs strength and power which is also something that Yang has great pride in. However unlike Neon she isnt just saying Yang is a bad fighter she is proving it. She effortlessly plays with Yang and Yang doesnt land a hit. That makes sends to me that Yang would get mad because its a high stakes situation anyway. As for Blake her anger isnt the issue its the fact she lets it control her. The others wouldnt have dived in head first I dont think even though they would have been angry as well.

7900209,0,t3_4nem90,Previous posts                           WRITING    Physics of Friendship  A new schoolyear and with it new students. Team FYSX is one of several new huntsmen teams to form. Will they rise to the challenge of Beacon Academys curriculum or will they buckle under the immense pressure? Only time will tell...  Chapter  delivered! Lewd buzzing and a mountain of schoolwork within! Past is Present  Returning from one of their classes Team STRQ star pupils of Beacon Academy find a small red velvet box that will take them on the adventure of a lifetime.  A timetravel story inspired by an entry I made in the Whose Line Is It Saturday thread for March . Chapter  done! Yang being cheeky Ruby teaching Qrow some moves a surprise guest... this chapter has it all.   READING   The Ladybug Diary  Today I met a girl. Her name is Blake.  Im not generally into any RWBY shippings other than Bumblebee and Arkos but damn if this sweetsour little ditty makes me root for our little adorkable Rhubarb.   Pages  Yang Xiao Long is an expert at flirting with girls  tall ones short ones princesses or thieves...it made no difference to her. But when she stumbles into Pages a tiny bookstore shes never even noticed before she might as well have entered an alternate dimension.  Normally suave Yang has her brain quit on her every time she meets one very special girl. CringeRomCom at its finest.     Lonely Together  Blake makes an unexpected friend at Weiss party and Ruby ends up both giving and receiving the greatest gift of all when she makes a good impression on the birthday girl.  Cute Bumblebee and WhiteRose moments galore.   Blake What Do Your Faunus Eyes See?  A really long fluffy fic aboard the Bumbleby ship. A little smutty in later chapters but entirely cute dorkiness all the way through.  Two friends come out of the closet and doesnt get together immediately? A fresh view on the classic comingout story.   Prove me wrong  A series of related short chapters in chronological order of Blake and Yangs relationship as they grow closer together. Concentrated Bumblebee fluff set in canon.  Loved every moment of this. And yes it covers that episode as well.   Lovestruck  Yang finds herself the recipient of several love notes. Now she just has to figure out whos sending them...   This fic is just cute all over. Who could the mystery person possibly be? P   Its Your Blood Thats Red Like Roses  Yang wakes up one night to the sound of Ruby crying. Can she help her little sister come to terms with whatever is troubling her? Short oneshot exploring the background of the sisters inspired by RWBYs amazing soundtrack.  Beautiful story of a big sisters desire to keep her kid sister safe. I did make the mistake of stumbling upon it at work and almost paid the price for it   Remnants Reclaimer  Ruby finds herself facing her end. As she pushes her semblance to new heights the world breaks. In one fluid crystallising moment everything changes. A  year old Ruby Rose one of the deadliest hunters on Remnant spills out of the void and into the dorm of team RWBY including a  year old version of herself. A hunter in a world of unknowing prey.  Ive read through this awesome fic six times nowuHystericalCHijinks all  chapters of it. Cant wait for the next chapter!,RWBY,d442334,2,t5_2vhg0
7900843,0,t1_d4438u5,To be fair to you its probably pretty easy to come to that conclusion given the ending and the nature of most fanfics.  Also you might have read it before some kind soul told me to check the completed field in the story properties.My goal was to write events that would be a decently plausible continuation of the actual show.  Sadly theres just too many unknowns about Weisss situation for me to comfortably write about so I pretty much had to leave things alone when it came to her.The ending is to be continuedesque because things will continue just not recorded by me.  If that makes any sense.Aside from that I think you definitely have a point with the countdown thoughts.

7949391,0,t3_4o4fdm,  Blake at first was one of my favorite characters when I first started watching the show but overtime as I  rewatched the show I began to realize that Blake never grew as a character.  from Blakes first debut to episode   she has never actually changed as a person no matter how much screen time she took up or how much we focused on the White Fang she never progressed as a character.   Now this wouldnt bother me so much since Weiss is technically the only one who actually had any development in Team RWBY except we focus on Blakes problems for the rest of Vol. and the entirety of Vol. and throughout the whole of Vol. all of Team RWBY and Sun are doing everything in their power to help her with the White Fang problem yet Blake never grows as a character or a teammate.  She still remains the same old Blake from Vol. to Vol.. Looking back it felt like Blake was only there so we could learn more about the other members of RWBY.  My biggest issue with Blake is the fact that her actual flaw is never addressed in the story  Blake problem is that she refuses to learn from her past mistakes and instead chooses to rush blindly into things without thinking them through and when things get to rough she runs away rinse and repeat without ever dealing with the consequences of her actions. we spend so much time focusing on her dealing with her White Fang subplot that in the grand scheme of things goes nowhere and so she never changes. ,RWBY,d49l4se,4,t5_2vhg0

If anything my bet is that he either escapes death at the last moment like I said last time Cinder is about to burn him asks him if he believes in destiny he laughs and says he doesnt as Ruby rescues him or I see him dying but coming back in future volumes saying that he survived.,RWBY,d4asg3i,2,t5_2vhg0

8042428,0,t1_d4jr91s,She says she despises the WF and that she doesnt trust faunus because theyve been at war with her family for years. She assumes that because Sun appeared to be a criminal he is but regardless and that meant he and other faunus would join the WF. And she has the gall to play the victim when her familys company is built on the bodies of faunus workers. While it is true that Weiss never claims the violence is justified but she never says it isnt and she also never shows any sympathy for victims or remorse for what her family has done. Blake never refuses to accept that the White Fang is involved in anything. Blake doesnt assume Weiss hates all faunus because shes a Schnee. She believes Weiss is discriminatory based off very clearly having disdain for faunus and finding all faunus untrustworthy regardless of whether or not they are WF. The argument very clearly started when Weiss repeated referred to Sun with derogatory terms and Blake told her to stop because hey hes a person. Weiss says that because Sun is clearly a criminal he and all the other faunus would join up with the White Fang. Blake shoots back that Weiss thinks that because hes a faunus Weiss automatically groups him with radical extremists. Weiss than says that Blake also claims that the WF is a terrorist group and things start going south from there. Blake never refuses to believe that the WF are involved in criminal activities. She refuses to believe that they would be working with humans but in response to whether or not they were stealing the dust she already knew deep down. Weiss doesnt side with Cardin but she doesnt say anything. Weisss reaction isnt even shown but its more than likely that she wasnt even paying attention.Also Id like to clarify that Weiss never accepts Blake onscreen nor does she ever apologize to Blake. Saying you dont care about someones past and rejecting their identity as a race? which need I remind everyone is a very important part of Blake as a person is not acceptance. Weiss willfully ignores aspects of Blakes personality because she doesnt want to accept it and refuses to apologize to Blake despite the fact the Blake apologized to her when she didnt have to.But Weiss also never says she specifically wants to help faunus or feels bad about how the SDC has treated them. Weiss very clearly states that her familys name is her goal. Which can basically mean that all shes concerned about is her familys image. As of recently the SDC has rightfully garnered a reputation of having poor work conditions and controversial business partners. Weiss merely says she wants to change that she wants to change how people see the SDC. which she is going about all wrong. for all we know that could have nothing to actually do with how the company operates. Maybe shes just going to get a really good PR team.The only reason Weiss can no longer be claimed to be a racist is because after volume  it is simply never mentioned again. The fact the Weiss from Vol  onwards hardly resembles her V counterpart is just the less savory aspects of a character being dropped to make a character more likeable. Despite the subject matter and one of the main characters any actual complexity of the issue is buried for a oh they made up and are happy ending when in reality it should have never gone that way. ,RWBY,d4k1m45,2,t5_2vhg0

Its strange to be so specific but honestly its like calling a thief and serial killer.

Also Rooster Teeth has a history of reviving fan favorites even when their show switch from comedy sketches to a complete overarching and somewhat dark story like RvB. Also due to this timeskip one of the major points against bringing back characters is now invalid.

8164379,0,t1_d4y1op4,Yeah but thats so boring. That just seems like a way to get her out of the story without actually having to deal with redemption. I want to see Emerald trying to wrestle with guilt with what she had done and struggle if she ever can make up for what she did. That would be far more rewarding for her character as well as doing wonders for Ruby. Ruby is stuck on good and evil. Emerald doesnt fit that mould. She did terrible things but is not herself evil. An actual Emerald redemption forces Ruby to confront this.Plus Penny was a robot and Emerald was aware of that fact. We know she had a soul Emerald did not. Her other crimes are worse and even the Fall of Vale its seems to me like thats not something Emerald really appreciated the gravity of. She isnt evil like Cinder or Mercury. She is someone who was recruited to a cause by someone who she both feared and admired possibly loved. She has been bested and moulded to what Cinder wants her to be so I dont think she is beyond redemption. ,RWBY,d4y3gbv,3,t5_2vhg0

8226112,0,t1_d55snuu,The one thing couldve affected Yangs direction once she was in the air really is wind resistance and wind speed. A couple of things I looked at were first up how long she was in the air  seconds. It took . of those seconds to leave the room and the room is at a guess  metres tall.This means Yang travelled up at a velocity of ms according to math. Coming down she more then likely reached terminal velocity ms Hot damn!. More math says that at those speeds  of her travel was going down the other  was going up. Some more math calculates her max height was probably around m from where she started but add in the fact that we know Beacon is on some kind of cliffs and is about m above sea level probably more bump that up to m in the air. Lets say that wind resistance probably slowed her down and she reached only mThat would leave her . seconds on the way down to get her bearings. A short amount of time but speaking as someone who has been skydiving enough time to think about what is happening. Yang was most likely able to adjust her angle on the way down in order to land back in the same building she came from. Easiest way to do that? Aim straight down. At that speed the wind speed around her wouldnt have been able to push her off course by much. To sum up wind speeds in the air wouldve pushed her straight up while coming back down she wouldve been moving too fast for them to matter. Her trajectory wouldve been all done to where she wanted to land further supported by she is clearly conscious upon landing.Hope youre satisfied by my shitty science P,RWBY,d55tjj2,6,t5_2vhg0

8434403,0,t3_4v512t,gt I have nothing against LGBT but why does this community seem to have more samegender ships? You tend to find tentacles and malefemale stuff in other communities.This is mainly due to history and then demographics.Essentially when RWBY first started there was only the two main guy characters and  girls for  and a half months. So as shipping of main characters and the main ships tend to start early and then solidify themselves when it was bloody obvious who the  guys were going to end up with everyone shipped the four remaining girls RWBY together. Add in the partnerships and it becomes obvious what the main and most popular ships would be.Of course this wouldnt have held completely if it wasnt for the demographics of who watch the show and roosterteeth as a whole. Mainly liberal minding  year old guys. Guys who are completely okay with samegender read lesbian ships as they are with straight ships.This also however lead to a lot of LGBT people and girls to start liking the show as well. After all the main leads are mostly girls and half of them are shipped together with each other!It essentially caused a feedback loop and so now the community pretty much ships exclusivley lesbian ships first with the ocasional straight ship thrown in. Nights Watch ftw!gt Alright. Ive just realized the... Weird nature of the RWBY community. Here everyone just seems so laid back and relaxed. Everything gets upvoted to heaven. Why?This is due to the two reasons above as well.With the demographics of people who watch the show and the fact that the members of RWBY are all shipped together and then the ever expanding list of side characters as well it lead to people wanting to be able to ship their own ships in this community in peace. This lead to the community as a whole agreeing that all ships are allowed and should be left in peace and to not be a dick to people over what they ship. A sort of you scratch my back Ill scratch yours situation. This then lead to the community self policing this mantra which is why most of the downvoted comments will be people going against it and upvoting people who do and leads to the laid back attitude we have.It is also why fanart dominates the sub. As the community makes a shit ton of fan art for its favourite ships and characters and the people who ship them or like the character then upvote it because theyre happy to see it. It also helps that the community has a lot of amazing artists as well.It also is do to the fact that it is readily obvious that RWBY is continually only getting better and better through its missteps and the community is generally optimistic and happy over where the show is going.Edit This is also due to the fact that a lot of the leaders of different ships on the sub are mods. From the Queen Bee herself to the leader of the ladybug fleet.,RWBY,d5vu8te,16,t5_2vhg0

8445905,0,t3_4vbck6,Sort of? Like I legit dont expect White Rose to ever happen in any case. The CRWBY is fairly open about not thinking White Rose is a good pairing while thinking Bumblebee is a good one so Id expect Bumblebee to have a high chance of happening and White Rose to have virtually no chance of happening on that basis alone.Aside from that though Arkos happened if briefly and everyone and their dog is anticipating Renora now. No one finds it unbelievable that the entirety of JNPR would have intrateam romances. A whole lot of people find it perfectly believable that there was a love square in Team STRQ back in the day too whether in the form of both Summer and Raven being into Taiyang and him being into the both of them at some point and Qrow being into Summer or in the form of Yang being Raven and Taiyangs lovechild and Ruby being Summer and Qrows lovechild though Im pretty sure Ruby is not Qrows kid myself.Of course this is all ignoring the pound gorilla in the room. The part that makes people antsy isnt the part about all of them ending up in intrateam romances per se. Its that even in  a whole lot of people are still like Ive come to terms with gay people existing and being gay or bi in theory but I dont like it when gay relationships take up space where I can see them. To the point that a lot of people are openly disturbed or even outright disgusted by the thought of even one intraRWBY romance happening because thatd mean a relationship thats gay is taking up space and that it cant be made to go away by having one of the characters put on a bus or killed off like every other shows lesbian characters.That said I dont think White Rose is a good pairing or that it has any foreshadowing while I think both are true of Bumblebee there are multiple instances of romance tropes and parallels to other relationships that are or were romantic already set up and just waiting to be picked up on the other end where Bumblebee is concerned. I wouldnt even mind Lancaster Iceberg or White Knight caveat on the last one that Weiss and Jaune spend time as friends first and Weiss is the one to make the move for a relationship upgrade ideally in the endgame for Ruby or Weiss as long as I get my bloody Bumblebee.Id say that Bumblebee combined with either or both of Ruby or Weiss probably Weiss ending up in a reasonably wellwritten and developed relationship with a nice boy in the recurring supporting cast would make for a fairly balanced team. Lancaster would probably be the easiest one to develop since White Knight has the issue of Jaune being a douche to Weiss in the first volume and a half and Iceberg has the issue of Neptune being a douche in general but well character development is a thing in this show.,RWBY,d5x9xx4,3,t5_2vhg0

8481201,0,t1_d61gaup,Thats how stories work though. Theres always some stuff has to be inferred you cant go about describing every single last detail its just a matter of how much you leave inferred. Reading books always requires a bit of imagination which is built off of inference of the text.Specific to the phase jump if theyre in some system they call for a phase jump then suddenly theyre in another system and they see enemy pirates its not hard for anyone to connect the dots that its some sort of transportation device. The specifics for how it works arent important until the plot says that its important which is when theres radioactive interference and that can be handled either when it first matters or alluded to or with something thats like....gtHow are the radiation levels?gt Fine no interference with the jump computers.,RWBY,d61ozrs,2,t5_2vhg0

8534138,0,t1_d68bhs0,I mean thatd be good but not really my ideal. My ideal would be for her to fight Mercury in the future and lose but only after shes recovered and has some significant other victories under her belt with her realizing just how much Merc was holding back. Then she fights him again but this fight she wins by showing an improvement in strategizing and channeling her anger better. I dont think the fight with Adam should be the fight to show her conquering her rage. I think that one should be a battle of convictions. Sure show her having grown a lot smarter as a fighter but I also really want to see her straight up shatter Moonslice. Think about it. Towards the end of the fight Adam charges for his slice while Yang is in motion the scene turns into red and black silhouettes like the first fight and blade and fist meet. The meeting clash pauses for a fraction of a second before the silhouette effect shatters like a picture frame and her punch shatters his sword going on and shattering his mask. A direct clash of convictions with Yangs proving stronger than Adams genocidal madness. But frankly I dont think there should just be one more fight with Adam. Hes a major influence on  of the main four girls now. Ideally he should have multiple clashes with Blake Yang and both of them at the same time in the future. Each time showing more growth on the part of the girls. They keep getting better escaping or driving him off on their own merits. Ive come around to the belief that my idealized fight with Adam shouldnt actually be the final one. I think that he should escape then and come back with something to give him an edge. Then Blake and Yang take him on together with Yang breaking the sword and Blake dealing the killing blow. ,RWBY,d68bzjx,3,t5_2vhg0

8656414,0,t1_d6nn6lu,I guess it depends on how V develops them. I still see Jaune as awkward and oblivious and while we see Ruby overcoming her shyness becoming friends with Emerald for example that whole scene on the fairgrounds is adorable I dont see that shes developed much more than that socially. They both come off as total goofballs to me unless theyre in a fight. Thats where Jaune really shines and same with Rubes. Theyre both at their best when killing Grimm. Maybe in V well see how Ruby has changed after everything she went through but the poor girl hasnt had much character development as of yet. I want the RNJR escapades to show her maturingdeveloping as a person and Jaune maturing emotionally. I mean we know Ruby wont be the same but we dont know how shes changed yet. I should probably get around to watching Legend of Korra but I heard it has a love triangle subplot for a lot of the show and that kind of turns me off from it. ,RWBY,d6no0p3,2,t5_2vhg0

Thats a fact because I was involved in several of those arguments.gt its different than having a character demonstrate appear to demonstrate an ability that he doesnt have. I dont get what is the difference between the two. Yang meets Raven which can be interpreted as well Yang meeting Raven. Or it could be something else.Qrow seems to turn into a crow offscreen which can be interpreted as him turning into a crow. Or it could be something else.gtYes Ravens scene gives us questions but Qrows scenes doesnt.It gives the question what exactly is Qrows Semblance.

Casting directly beneath Cinder will cause her launch into the air to reach higher ground. This ability has very short cooldown and consumes charges that are built up over time.Ability  Shard Wave Launches a cluster of glass shards to deal light damage and reduce enemy movement speed. Affects all enemies in its path.Ultimate Maidens Wrath Unleashes the fall maidens power causing fire to rain down in a wide AOE around the target location dealing damage over time to all enemies in range.Summary Cinder has below average health and very little viability in close quarters but excels at controlling terrain at long range. Her eruption can be used defensively to force enemies to give up a chase or offensively to keep them boxed in and secure an allied kill. Players should ensure maximum effect for her Ult by first slowing enemies and placing geysers tactically to cut off escape routes.,RWBY,d6rbyy7,12,t5_2vhg0

Or if shes simply in limbo with there being ENOUGH evidence of her being there.Im not lifeless hehehe as Im open to her coming back with proper explanation. The design is great though many other Evil AU Ive seen of characters are simply Grimm themed.,RWBY,d6zjy8w,4,t5_2vhg0
8754082,0,t1_d6znmuo,Thanks and Im glad to see you liked my interpretation of Tai. I was afraid that people who read this fic would find him unlikable for using his team then abandoning them when it was time to graduate. It was one of the reasons I made the character of Jauques Jaunes father the way he was. At first I wanted them to be identical twins who were sent to Beacon by a demanding father that pushed them to be hunters and constantly demeaned Tai and praised Jaques skills.  Think Stanley and Stanford Pines of Gravity Falls. It would eventually lead to the twins having a falling out that both of the twins would come to regret and would influence how they raised their kids. It would be an explanation for why Tai didnt initially want Ruby or Yang to be huntresses and why Jaune wasnt trained at all. But I realized that it would detract from the Team STRQ aspect of the story and would really become a backstory for Jaune and his family in the process. So I instead went with Jaques being Tais first and genuine friend and one of his redeeming qualities. I also debated whether to include the reference of Tai stealing a weapon off of a dead hunter in a dark twist to how Jaune got his weapon as it would seem a very slimy thing for Tai to do. So I had him self justify it with his poor background and ambitions for a better life. Again Im glad my interpretation of Tai was to your liking.,RWBY,d6zx1v9,2,t5_2vhg0

Shes been one of my favorite characters since the Yellow Trailer but by the end of Volume  she just stopped feeling like Yang at some point.  Theres just a lot surrounding her that I dislike at the moment and feel rather disconnected to RWBY at the moment so constantly being reminded of it just gets old.  Hoping she and RWBY returns shining brighter than ever but Im kinda having my doubts at the moment and really wish the writers would give us a show of good faith as it were...God bless,RWBY,d7ls9mt,1,t5_2vhg0

I like his comedic moments but realize that he could have been the Sokka of RWBY and Im left feeling robbed. I remember his moment of selfawareness back on the rooftop and imagine what could have been. I look at his relationships with other characters and see a few connections stronger than the others and now one of them is gone. I think about how a sizeable chunk of the fanbase hates him on sight and how that so easily could have been avoided.Understandably production is a nightmare. And things need to be tweaked and sometimes people have ideas that turn out not to be that great. And no matter how much you may want it you cant change things that have already transpired so I am content with Jaune as he is not great but pretty ok.,RWBY,d7ndku9,2,t5_2vhg0

Ruby could throw herself at Grimm and when dying her OPPlsNerf powers just power up and oneshot everything.

Her powers that stoned one of the strongest Grimm one so ancient it was stuck in a mountain and made a Maiden  someone who beat Ozpin fleedie.

From that discussion I thought it was settled they basically constitute as a wing of a futureAU and that art just of the two of them umbrellaed under being extensions of the main charactersprotagonists as theyre supposedly their children but that any step beyond just them two is outright OC. Think the argument was settled that it doesnt necessarily interfere with the canon given the complient but future AU its set in and so in comparison to some AUs that outright alter characters nearly beyond recognition it was closer and therefore within fair use?  Extending beyond Li amp Mei would be straying into OC territory.  The reason I remember is it was at the end of a spree of RWBYwiththeirkids fanarts that introduced them but rose to challenge on a fanart post that was just them no parents and you ultimately okayed that post,RWBY,d7ygdsu,2,t5_2vhg0

9044259,0,t3_5443nh,I loved the use of  I think its a sitar?  to be honest. It may not have made sense in the context of RWBY but for the trailer I loved it! It was upbeat unusual and a bold choice. I respectfully disagree about it lacking identity  I think it stands out far sharply with how different it is from anything weve heard in RWBY. I agree that they kinda snubbed it in the way that its Rubys trailer and it was supposed to be her song but as you said this is what introduced many to RWBY. They had to get the general feel of each girl across in one trailer while maintaining a distinct focus on Ruby. I think RLR Pt. II does a much better job of being a theme for her but this song did introduce her theme motif. Id give it a much higher rating but I respect your opinion.  To each his own.,RWBY,d7yz480,4,t5_2vhg0

Lets be real here everyone is so keen to shit on Poser like all it can ever to do is cobble together clumsy looking garbage...  but its Poser that got us here. Not Maya. Its poser that got this series its millions of views  subreddit followers thousands of tumblrs huge panels at some of the biggest international industry events every year partnerships with colossal companies to distribute to Japan and the Asian market. The first time that feat has ever been achieved by a Western production.  And all that having built it up from scratch on an initially tiny team for parts of Vol  something like  people worked on RWBY that had no prior experience in this industry. Theyve spent  years learning this method working on it improving it leaps and bounds. This isnt Factory default Poser theyve customised it and built it up and made tools unique to them to do exactly what they want to do what RWBY needs them to do. Theyve had time to figure out how to make something beautiful out of this outdated garbage.  ampnbsp  That is not a feat which you can attribute to good luck and it is one that is so integral to the product that you cannot make the argument that it was carried by all of the other strong points covering for it.

This time with  less filler!Okay so my week has been a lot of shit this week. I suppose Ill start with the bad parts. My Mother was  months pregnant with my now former stepfather but after an accident involving my mom and the youngest stepcunt the fetus was tragically killed. I looked forward to caring for the baby only for it to leave so quickly. So my family is just back to my mother and I. . You guys remember the ex who stabbed me? Well I reluctantly decided to go and see if she was getting the mental help she needs. After scheduling a supervised visit we sat down and talked. She actually said she felt remorse for what she did and was hoping I would forgive her she felt like she lost control over herself and something else was taking over. I accepted shook her hand and left. Im glad that she seems to getting her head back on straight.Now that the things that have negative connotations are out the way now lets get onto the good parts of my week! . I was offered scholarships not from  university not from . But from  different universities! I was so ecstatic I received one from UC Davis UC Berkeley and UC Irvine. If you didnt know UC stands for University of California. . This one can either be good or bad depending on your views. But basically my girlfriend and I are really close and loveydovey were pretty much inseparable. This week another girl came up to me and asked to speak to me. She wanted to tell me how she felt about me and said she had a really big crush on me. So naturally I accepted her feelings but told her I have a girlfriend. When I told my girlfriend this she simply remarked Well she is pretty cute. I wouldnt mind sharing with her So yeah weve all been getting along quite well.So there thats my week.

9159171,0,t3_55r2bo,Well yeah this was already explained in S and one of the reasons why my opinion of team Rwby as a whole kind of took a downturn fast. Out of the four WBY all seemed really wishy washy on why they wanted to be huntresses in the first place. The only one that had their reasoning straight with no regrets was Ruby. Whose reasoning was simply to become a hero and fight Grimm.Now thats not to say Rubys reasoning wont be challenged down the line. Roman has already begun that process explaining that a hero is only known as such through sacrifice and most of the times through death. I expect this desire to change slowly over time and Jaune will probably be used as a foil for the process but thats   a later discussion.But yes out of the  Ruby is clearly enjoying herself. Everyone else is trapped forced to do some deep reflection.....again.,RWBY,d8czqhq,16,t5_2vhg0

9161263,0,t3_55oz9m,I see where people come from when it comes to the fight choreography. But at the same time i dont fully judge this as how itll be represented during the show. This style of combat where the choreography is the whole purpose of the video Monty was a master of. So asking them to hit those heights is asking a lot. But i think when they can choreograph based around a narrative i think itll be much more suited. The speed semblence makes sense for Ruby so i have no issues with that shes just increased her skill with using it. When it comes to the actual animation and art style it is a level above. Much higher quality actual facial expressions during fighting and a lot more attention to detail the scratches on crescent rose. Its just a huge step up in quality.Any info on episode length and if itll be similar to volume ?,RWBY,d8d9a1f,1,t5_2vhg0

And more than just the ship itself I saw it as a sign of Russel getting over Violethis past life and moving on which the end of Chapter  really shows Ill see you again one day but until then Im going to be happy.Just for discussions sake do you think there still could have been a Russel recovery plot without the romance with Yang or would you have preferred if that thread was left out entirely?

9169783,0,t1_d8e8dtx,Theyre funny lines but if its going to jump around like that then the scene would have been better done imo just by starting with the Landing Strategy line. Its a more high energy opening and if youre relying on readers knowledge about whats happening already then it just flows better. In fact if you dont want to rely on readers knowledge then you can even start with that line and then explain whats happening afterwards and it still sets up for a higher energy opening.That make sense?I do sorta think that we are kind of going in circles a bit though.,RWBY,d8ec6uq,1,t5_2vhg0

Lets take the short lived controversy with Witcher  for example. People mainly tumblr threw a fit about the lack of diversity in Witcher  a fantasy game based on Eastern European culture made by a game company in Poland. Sorry for the lack of political correctness in the next part but there isnt a whole lot of art depicting other skin colors than White in medieval Eastern European culture. So having a person of a different color would be really out of place in Witcher s setting. Its no different than Africa not having a lot of historical art with people with white skin. Not a whole lot of white people hanging out in Africa at the time. So there is a time and a place for diversity. I have no issues at all with it but if it becomes forced it becomes painfully obvious and can be off putting even to people it was meant for. Another good example of this is the recent Star Trek movie making Sulu a character known to be straight originally gay in the remake. George Takei a gay man himself and the previous actor who brought the character to life on screen even had an issue with this. Marvel recently changed Iceman to being Gay as well. This didnt go over well with the LGBT community either because a character that had been happily straight his entire life suddenly decided he was gay. This goes against the idea that people are born homosexual and not choosing to be. So once again a situation where it was Forced didnt go over well even with those it was meant for.This doesnt mean it cant happen for RWBY. With the way everything is right now they could introduce a LGBT character or make one LGBT without it feeling forced. But if we suddenly got Yang and Blake kissing and having a make out session this season that would be forced as there would of been no build up and would be extremely sudden. So no one is blaming people for wanting representation. There is no problem with that at all. Everyone wants a character they can relate to but at the same time dont pressure someone into shoehorning it in because at that point it does nothing for the show but harm it. Which is where tumblr always goes wrong and that is what he meant by much representation. Not you or the ones who want someone they can relate to but the ones that are shoving it down everyones throats like pumpkin spiced everything during NovemberOctober.,RWBY,d8lhkqy,29,t5_2vhg0

9276256,0,t1_d8rm0qj,My specialty was quite narrow and most of what I was known for is completely irrelevant to most? fanfiction. My point was merely to emphasize the need to always have second editor no matter how well youve got the technical stuff covered on your own.gt My main concern is when the author and the beta reader reach an impaseSet expectations. Communicate.The very nature of creative writing means that there is no single right way to do things. Better after all is highly subjective so all each party can do is lay out the reasons supporting their opinion. And since this is fanfiction youre really writing for yourself. You write what you want. An editors role is to help you achieve your vision. You may find that youll have to agree to disagree but as long as the author takes responsibility for the work as a whole the editor should defer.If you find yourself butting heads thats probably indicative of a communicationpersonality problem not a problem inherent to the authoreditor dynamic. A suggestion for change is not an attack on the writing nor is an author supposed to rubber stamp every suggestion made. And not all people are always going to get along. But for something fairly casual like fanfiction there shouldnt be too much pressure. Remember the point is to have fun.Heres some excerpts from some communications with a fic author whose work Ive offered to betaFor the friends who are more lackadaisical about the technical aspects of writing I simply offer to catch stuff thats categorically wrong errant apostrophes typos missing words homophone confusion. Then I move on to stuff thats isnt wrong per se but not quite right either. Things like words repeated in short succession that doesnt appear to be intentional repetitionparallel structure etc. fall into this category. Ill ask about intended meaning underlying logic point out where the wording might lead readers to expect something the author doesnt intend. This is where I make suggestions about punctuation that can make reading smoother.Then I get into more technical quibbly stuff that most casual readers will never care about Tattoos usually dont leave raised lines and scar tissue can be hypertrophic atrophic or keloidand different factors can influence the frequency of each type. A chokehold can either cut off air or blood and the effects are quite different. Sport bikes motorcycles are fairly tall and someone whos   probably wouldnt be able to ride one comfortably unless it were modded. But authors know that they can tell me to back offartistic license is broader in creative writing than it is in nonfiction.That should give you an idea of what an editor can do. Its up to you to make appropriate requests for what your editor should focus on and what they should be willing to ignore.gt Just to clarify you want a draft of the first chapter or one with the entire story?A chapter should be sufficient for this experiment.,RWBY,d8rtya7,6,t5_2vhg0

Ecchi In western fandom its used for pervy or playfully sexual shows that dont show anything explicit. In Japan its a way of saying pervert and slang for sex. What western fans call ecchi Japan calls oiroke basically meaning sexy.Shoujo Ai Western fans tend to use this label for manga or anime that focus on stories where love between girls are the focus but things are more sisterly nonsexual or a lesbian relationship is only implied. In Japan it means a pedophile who likes little girls. Shoujo Young Girl Ai Love Japan calls any animemanga with lesbians implied or otherwise yuri.Which means lilyHentai Western fans say this means porn. Japan uses it as another word for pervert Watch some anime and youre bound to hear Baka hentai! Japan may call certain things HGames or Hmanga but never Hentai.

9366574,0,t3_58tfif, So its looking like Cinder is now mute because of Ruby and that E  M are still with her.  Holy shit I love Salams VA as well.  CINDER KILLED OZPIN HOLY FUCKING SHIT Looking like Cinder was also weakened by the fact she became the Fall Maiden and when Ruby laid the smackethdown on her candy ass. Generals enderestimates Ruby but Salam wants her.  New animation style is gorgeous Monty would have loved seeing what theyve done with this series. Looking like maybe Jaune doesnt get his new outfit right away since hes wearing the same clothes from before. Jaune seems to be stepping up to the plate as leader as well not as useless so far. Ren is and looks like a total BAMF. Same for Nora who is still as goofy as ever. Ruby with the new ammo too Scratch that Jaune still sucks and now has no weapon because hes the Strategist  THE STONE GRIMM CAN USE TREES AS ARMS. NOBODY IS SAFE BIG MISTAKE BIG FLUFFY BUNNY  Jaunes new weapons...theyre made from Pyrrhas gear.  Jaunes new armor looks good similar to his original set. Overall I enjoyed the first episode and the animation was gorgeous. Jaune seems to be the defacto leader of the group and despite still not finding his semblance he seems to be growing up even if the love of his life is gone he wants to continue fighting so that this wont happen again.It would seem as though Salams next target is the Spring MaidenWonder what happened with Summer and Winter but will deal with Ruby first. Cinder seems like shes been reduced to being Salams lackey although thats more due to the fact she cant risk the new Fall Maiden dying before she can be used. Stars. ,RWBY,d93a3on,2,t5_2vhg0
9366614,0,t3_58ug2o,EDIT was finally able to watch it. And it was obvious from when they first showed it off at RTX but OH MY GOD ITS BEAUTIFUL. The lighting is gonna take some getting used to the action scenes dont flow as well as the previous volumes the facial expressions are great the character relations of team RNJR RANGER IS COOLER always make me smile and so far weve had a tender moment with Jaunes new armor. Though I dont know how I feel if they really melted down Pyrrhas armor for that but I guess its much better to put it to good use in her memory instead of tossing it away.Possession type Grimm are fucking wizard as hell. Who was farm boy? Maybe hes a wizard. AND AGAIN IT ALL LOOKS GORGEOUS.Also someone please dub over the beginning scene with stuff from The Council of Doom or ATHF.Cinder Uh what did you make this time boss?Salem CORN!Cinder Corn?murder corn noisesThese are my initial reactions and I dont know if Ill be doing a deep analysis Im just gonna go ahead and stew in this feeling the glow you get from a new RWBY episode.I CANT HEAR YOU GUYS OVER THE SOUND OF ME SLAMMING MY DICK AGAINST THE REFRESH KEY WHAT WAS THAT THING ROOSTERTEETH SAID ABOUT DOING THAT?Its not a RWBY premier until the servers catch on fire first.

He possibly failed in his first attempt to stop Salem and since then kept on becoming young.

In open warfare he normally uses it on his opponents and causes them to get targeted and attacked by Grimm. However there have been reports of him using it on his own troops and forcing them into a swarm of Grimm as if the soldier was cannon fodder.His weapon is...

If anything it could spark a war with the other Kingdoms assuming that Atlas are deliberately cutting off their Dust supply to weaken them.

Even discounting the attempted resurrection Id say Cinder is more likely to work for or become the head of a third party organisation when Salem finds out Ozpins still alive assuming she even gets to live after that point.Any attempted redemption that does happen will probably be very skewed in nature.

9537316,0,t1_d9onlo9,My take is that its because were in it for the stories. Ruby and Weiss make pretty nice cutesy stories where tenacity and excitement of one whittles down the emotional defenses of the other. Thats a scenario that can be pretty decent if written well. Doesnt mean theyre realistic but theyre nice and fluffy. Then two of my favourite crackships Torchwitch Roman X Glynda and Fallen Qrows Qrow X Cinder They make absolutely no sense in canon. But the stories you could write that contain the circumstances to make these pairings happen could be absolutely amazing. Therefore shipping. And while I agree that some people tend to react too strongly when it comes to their ships I also would recommend that for such discussion you write a more neutrally written opening post in the first place. You literally demeaned shipping which is important to some folks here and made a call out to one of the most popular ships there is and demeaned it as well. Yes that was supplied with reasoning but the way you phrased it was what was negatively provoking. That you get emotional reactions to that which also go over the top should come as no surprise. That doesnt excuse it but it shows you what you could have done to avoid the situation and get a result more closely to what you wanted which I hope was a serious discussion about the merits of shipping.,RWBY,d9oo8j9,3,t5_2vhg0

Whether or not he was  on something hes never hesitated to throw himself into something because of how it could end up. Just look at when he met Blake almost complete stranger wants to look for terrorists? Sure why not. Then asking Blake to the dance he wasnt full confidence then but he still just went in and asked. Helping RWBY investigate without any real knowledge on the subject. Yeah Ill bring my friend who is even less involved too.While I can understand wanting to show Sun may not be as confident as he may seem having him show hesitation in revealing himself or in how he interacts with Blake would have been better.

JNRR have Tyrian and potentially Raven.Yang has her own demons to fight but I hope she gets something more visceral to fight before the end of the volume. Even if its just a big Ursa in the woods. And she fights it without her metal arm. ,RWBY,dawzy1p,7,t5_2vhg0

9977295,0,t1_db7xya7,I appreciate your reply. Those are some pretty valid points I can see how stressing the aloofness of the most powerful kingdom and how it affects Weiss would be important to her storyarc. I suppose I just feel they couldve handled it better. My primary beef is that they have such a limited amount of time they cant afford to waste a single minute yet they continue to do so repeatedly. Especially when it comes to the forced and unnatural exposition... Which is where my main concern where validating the ignorance of the Atlas nobles stems from as well. Ill agree that we didnt know for sure but using an entire scene to stress something that we were pretty sure we already knew was a waste of valuable time. Personally I wouldve used this as an opportunity to explore the personality of characters we dont know very well. Hell this wouldve been the perfect time to introduce Weiss mom or if shes not around tell us what shes doing. Instead of having a pointless conversation with notNeptune she couldve been talking to her mom. She couldve expressed her frustration about the situation with a single line of dialogue then the way her mom reacts would tell us more about Weiss than her tantrum ever would. Not to mention it would be way more interesting. ,RWBY,db82icu,1,t5_2vhg0

10010759,0,t3_5j0sxi,Alright number  it is.There were times that Blake wasnt sure why she put up with Yang. Okay sure she loved her. She brought out the best in her she made her feel like there was nothing in the world she couldnt accomplish blah blah blah.But there were times when she was just seriously infuriating.And thats the game! the boisterous blonde cried out victoriously as the figure on her screen detonated the bomb on Blakes side of the field. Hey dont get me wrong for an amateur you did pretty good. Still you could hardly be expected to beat a pro like me.The two were lounging on their couch Blake lying with her legs in Yangs lap both of them with their scrolls on some game Yang had become obsessed with over the last week. Blake had never been one for video games but shed finally caved and started trying to learn when it became clear that it was all Yang was interested in talking about. And because she loved her. For some reason.Does that mean I can stop playing now? Blake asked not even bothering to conceal her frustration.What? No way! We gotta go best out of five at least maybe even seven! Blake groaned. Why? Youre just going to beat me again.You dont know that Yang said with a wink. Maybe Ill really screw up or something or youll achieve this like video game zen and get super good in round three. You never know! She was looking at her with wide eager eyes beaming that big stupid grin at her.Blake sighed. Fine but if I win the next one we have to do what I want next.Deal! Yang said brimming with confidence. You are so going down Belladonna!Blake felt bad about what she did next she really did. A little bit. In a notreallyatall sort of way. Blake liked to read and she loved to learn and so shed managed to tolerate Yangs obsession by going on a few online forums and reading up about this newest sensation. Well as it turned out the game wasnt perfect. And if you knew what you were doing there was a little trick that made you clip through walls while holding the bomb. The round lasted less than ten seconds with Yang staring at the big neon GAME OVER YOU LOSE flashing before her eyes.Wait but how did you...I mean...what? She glared at her partner where she was lounging. Did you hustle me!?Blake smiled a lazy smile closing her scroll. Would I ever do that to you darling? she asked in a voice dripping with innocence. The corners of Yangs mouth twitched. In a heartbeat she said with a playful growl. Blake rolled her eyes and opened her scroll again. Fine she said. Double or nothing then. If I win you take me out to dinner. Somewhere very nice. With a lot of seafood.Game on Yang said gluing her eyes to her device.The restaurant Blake had chosen overlooked the ocean. They sat outside enjoying the gentle breeze and the clear starry sky overhead. Blake accepted another morsel of exquisitely seared tuna from the end of Yangs fork as she breathed in the salty sea air.Youre gloating way too much Yang said.Youre the one who kept doubling down she argued. Besides Ive wanted an excuse for us to dress up for ages. They both wore the nicest dresses they had in their closets Yangs a sparkling yellow evening gown that fell to her ankles and left one shoulder bare while Blakes was a slinky black silk number that shed only bought because Yang had insisted she counted it as her birthday present last year. They were overdressed even by the standard of the restaurant they were frequenting but Blake was having the time of her life.I suppose it is nice Yang admitted pushing the remains of her food around her plate. Maybe I should lose to you more often.Blake smirked at her. Like you would have a choice. She motioned to her plate and Yang rolled her eyes feeding her another bite of tuna. Suddenly both of their scrolls beeped. The girls pulled them out at the same time reading the alert message that popped up.UPDATE AVAILABLE it read. As Blake scrolled through the update she realized it was for the game theyd been playing earlier. At the bottom of the page it read Fixed problem with bomb wielder clipping through walls.Blake fled the establishment giggling madly as she headed back to their car her heels gripped tightly in one hand. She yanked on the door and realized too late that Yang had the keys in her purse.Her girlfriend emerged a few minutes later apparently having hastily dealt with their check. She was grinning fire in her eyes. Blake Belladonna! She cried and pushed her up against the car grinning broadly. You cheating little Blake cut her off kissing her hastily. Yang pulled away. Dont think youre going to umph Blake kissed her again wrapping her arms around her neck and holding her close.

10076016,0,t3_5k2pvx,I had two dreams the first one was really kinda happy despite the sad reality of it. A while after team RWBYs eventual deaths Ruby Weiss Blake and Yang were promoted by God itself to what he believed was the most important position in all of heaven beyond defending it from the forces of hell or judging souls or anything like that. It was watching over The Grand Playground a section of Heaven dedicated to all children who passed before their time regardless of their upbringing whether they be street urchins or otherwise well taken care of rich children like Weiss had been. They laughed and played with the children comforting them when they cried and generally taking care of them for eternity. I remember this playground had a lot of references to childrens shows movies and literature like Caillou Thomas the Train Engine and the Dinos from The Land Before Time series lived near a colossal waterfall. I remember one child had started crying while they were being put to bed inside a massive tree house that existed at the dead cent of the canyon and Ruby rushed over and asked what was wrong and the kid started bawling about how shed never get to see her mom dad or her cat Sparky again. And Ruby said to her whilst stroking her head as a mother would Shhh. Shh. Youll see them again. When their time is over theyll come and you can see each other again. You mustnt cry children say your prayers before you sleep. Amen children.The other dream I had I dont remember so well even though it was more recent within the last week or so. All I remember was a flash of red then white and then a scream it said either Ruby or Weiss I dont remember which and then I was awake. It must have been so horrible I dont cry often as it is and Ive never even come close to waking up in tears even with my worst nightmares I was nearly bawling. Ive also never been woken up by a dream it was literally color flash scream my celling fan in about as much time as it took you to read that. Fair warning this is probably gonna be taken down because to quote a mod Submissions on rRWBY should be more than tangentially related to the show and the mod team has unanimously ruled that usuallyincoherent dreamposts should not be posted.,RWBY,dbkxcsy,2,t5_2vhg0

10088129,0,t3_5ka5ou,Thats because Blakes and Yangs havent started facing the issues of their arcs yet. Weiss has become sick of her environment and so has decided to take action and lash out at others. The latest episode sees her reaping the repercussions of that. Whilst Ruby has been avoiding her issues and been pressing on blindly into danger. The latest episode again shows her dealing with the consequences her brazen act of bravado has pushed them headlong into a situation she couldnt handle and has gotten Uncle Qrow hurt saving her.Compare that to Blake who has only just gotten to Menagerie and started to see how ignorant the Faunus community is to the happenings in the world. She has yet to face challenge and problems because of that ignorance yet. Shes had nothing to overcome.Whilst Yang has had seen a challenge to overcome through her trepidation about putting on her arm it is not the main problem she will be overcoming this arc. Shes already put the arm on yet shes been shown to be afraid to. Yang only put the arm on because she overheard that she is holding her father back and feels guilty. She hasnt overcome an adversity yet merely pretended she has. The consequences of trying to run whilst she cant even crawl properly yet is what her arc is truly going to be about.,RWBY,dbmi121,71,t5_2vhg0

Love it.Weiss in armor is something I need to happen in the show especially like this. Im not really a fan of her outfits so far I mean she looks good but a dress will always seem boring compared to what the rest of the characters are wearing. Something like this with the tattered skirt beneath the armor I dunno it just works for her in my mind.Yang with a cowboy hat is always a favorite the general western aesthetic to the rest of her clothing is a good look for her too. Her buttcape reminds me of The Man With No Names poncho for some reason.Ruby looks pretty close to her canon outfit or a blend of the ones shes had.

The problem is that Aura was a convenient plot armor and Ruby probably put too much trust in its ability to protect her from harm. Also she should have already learnt by now to be more careful some of her closest ones died or were terribly injured so she definitely knows how dangerous the villains are. It makes no sense for her to rush into a fight without no Aura. And she could pay a terrible price for her stupidity.,RWBY,dbq72n8,9,t5_2vhg0

In this chapter a few things happen that I really hope people were expecting with intrateam relations. Miracles of Ancient Wonder AoSummary A maiden stood on the edge of an unfamiliar battlefield which demanded skills she had never learned. She walked through an age of strife wielding Fate as her weapon and leaving a trail of rose petals in her wake. So begins the journey of Ruby Rose Chosen of Battles  A RWBYExalted crossover.ReadingThe Patchwork ProdigySummary After the tragic events of Breach team RWBY was left recovering in the hospital but with the Vytal Festival Tournament drawing near their young leader must get back on her badly injured feet to prepare them both physically and mentally for a long road paved in uncovered secrets and painful memories.

10160866,0,t3_5lfpeu,gtgtI honestly do not understand why people are giving it so much flak especially considering its implications to the entire meaning of the show.gtgttldr The religion in Remnant is basically what RWBY has always been about since day freaking one the relics could have some really badass looks origins and tiein abilities if they pertain to the four Symbols and Huntsmen are magical dust loving monks with guns that fight demons.I will get straight to the point I think the question isnt what the implication is to the meaning of the show. rather the question is what narrative and message Crwby going for in relation to the subject Religion.At this rate it seems that not only will they draw influence but will also explore it through moral glass.People assumed that such topic wouldnt be touch upon I dont know if this was implied by Crwby or people assumed it anyway until v occurred. But now this is a heavily plot intricate topic it is not just good vs evil between two individual...rather it is now the matter of belief and non belief. Sort of like Dragon Age you can pretty much tell at this point how the narrative sees the concept of religion in inquisition.Thats my take on it anyway.,RWBY,dbvsh38,3,t5_2vhg0
10162007,0,t1_dbvvzfz,Unfortunately I dont have any direct quotes at hand however Im sure someone does but I can link the RWBY Music RTX  Panel where they discussed some of this.  Its on YouTube but not RTs official channel so Im not sure if I canshould link it.I know you cant use this as I dont have official linksquotes but from my understanding Monty worked heavily with Jeff on every song until the time of his passing except for the original Red Like Roses.  Jeff has about as much knowledge of the characters and future events as the writers themselves and while not every word of the song is canon it is inspiredbased off canon.  For example I believe it was RTX  that Jeff and Lindsay discussed Red Like Roses Part  and that while it might not be word for word canon Rubys raw emotion about her mother is.  Romanticized canon I suppose.Sorry I cant be of much help I just thought it would be something useful and might cut done on debates.  I of course would never expectask anyone else to go digging for linksquotes and given how passionate this community is Im positive someone will have links.Yeah having a faq for Ravens semblance wouldnt be a bad idea and maybe something about crows being a Monty motif wouldnt be a bad idea either given how many threads there have been about them and possibly mention that Qrows character was created long before RWBY for added weight.

10162681,0,t1_dbvlnpb,gtOzpin offered an illusion of choice. While Qrow didnt know the girl Ozpin did and knew Pyrrha wasnt going to refuse because Pyrrha was a selfless person by default. The moment Ozpin revealed that if she refused someone else was going to receive the maiden burden it was done.Ozpins knowledge of Pyrrhas decisions does not itself invalidate Phyrrhas decisions. Pyrrha had decisions to make and she made them. Id be more than a little ticked if someone deprived me of trying to make a heroic sacrifice just because they believed that Id be forced to do so on account of my character.Its hardly blatant manipulation when you make conscious choices towards the same outcome.Now Ozpin did intentionally harm Pyrrha by throwing the world on her shoulders that early sure and as you can see he is pretty penitent about the whole thing. Nonetheless she was chosen in part because she makes conscious choices towards the kind of outcome they were looking for. If there was one thing that Ozpin is not guilty of it is forcing her to become the fall maiden.I agree it was a foregone conclusion and that the resulting stress contributed to her death. It was not however for lack of choice.,RWBY,dbvzvkc,1,t5_2vhg0

10171001,0,t1_dbwnk64,Well my point is that she doesnt have to face the consequences. The show doesnt exactly acknowledge that either. I mean there is an opportunity now but judging by the previous episode Im not sure the show would call out Ruby for fucking up this time. I dont know  it never does. Ruby does stupid things but she gets away with it. Ruby acted like an idiot in the first season and Weiss called it out? Nah Weiss is just a bitch and she completely wrong and she should feel sorry for calling her out. Well to be honest thats mostly the community reaction  the show does somewhat make a point that both characters had their mistakes but then we have things like fighting Neo and Torchwick alone and getting away with it due to pure luck and stuff like that. Mountain Glenn thing... actually she tried to alert her team but the scroll didnt work and stuff. She actually acted rather smart there  she found out where do the WF goons go and tried to get back to the team but then she literally fell into a plot hole. gtlt Seriously the circumstances that led her to get captured are so bizarre that I dont even know what to say. So when shes acting somewhat smart  shes getting captured when she plays a hero  she gets away with it.,RWBY,dbwxt5s,5,t5_2vhg0

With Sun being the only other contributor to the pattern the difference is obvious.For example Sun says Its easy I do it all the time and Weiss interpretation look into girls rooms subverts the stereotyping joke I climb trees.And before he throws the banana at the police he replies to you nogood stowaway by saying Im a great stowaway establishing him as trickster. This makes his choice of harmless object to throw at police silly and fun.Even when he throws another banana at Torchwick it is a call back to the previous incident.

I have even thanked...can you believe it ? thanked AND apologized a friend who I got into trouble unintentionally. Its a long story which didnt involve any murderous exes...but still....I recognized and respected their friendship towards me despite the shit I got them into....and nope still no romance.Gee darn it.

10213337,0,t1_dc1qag9,sigh...let me reiterate....for Jaune...not for Warren....for Jaune ...Qrow is a punching bag a substitute for the Ozluminati. he is the face of the system that forced Pyrrha to shoulder the world and the responsibilities of being a maiden. Jaune sees Qrow making excuses...and feels that he merely stayed out of the way didnt travel with them because he wanted Tyrian to be lured out  where he could confront him.Is Jaune justified in thinking that way? yes. Is Jaune correct in thinking that way? Not entirely correct...there likely are things that he has no knowledge of  so he bases his assumptions on what he knows. That is all I am saying.

There are none in Volume  and  in Volume  so its still a ways off but its interesting to hear your predictions and I think I speak for others when I say itd be interesting to hear your theories when you make it to that point.    ,RWBY,dc1v8d3,5,t5_2vhg0
10215401,0,t1_dc1yccf,true....however  they arent. They are huntersintraining. Recruits. Children. They arent veterans of battles  nor are they hardened soldiers....they are teenagers who have been thrust into precarious situations. Pyrrha had not even begun to live before she was essentially sentenced to death. They werent even sure if the maiden transfer would work yet they went ahead with it anyway. Jaune is simply reacting to it as another teenager would. People must try and keep that in mind...he isnt a veteran huntersoldier...hes just a kid who is in too deep and saw a person who he looked up to....who believed in him...who loved in him...walk to her death...and die. Its trying and traumatic. ,RWBY,dc1z1ze,27,t5_2vhg0

10244526,0,t1_dc53yb7,OK? Im not sure i really got all of that but in the end I believe most people would still say that the leader is more important than any individual Soldier. Also a tie means that you both came out equally which a good negotiator makes sure never happens therefore he has won.My point which still stands is that regardless of how strong you are your worth is generally not determined as an individual by pure combat prowess. It is both in fiction and reality more dependent on your mind and your ability to deal with others. Also you hate on priests and bards though apparently not as much  but without their healing the warrior is always dying. So how is a warrior relying on others for buffs and heals to survive a DPS any different from a bards relying on a warrior to soak up damage?I realize this is becoming more of an argument than either of us intended but as someone who usually plays support I get pissed when tanks and DPSs dont appreciate how hard it is to take care of them,RWBY,dc59vf4,1,t5_2vhg0

With Blake she can use shadows to create an afterimage of herself that can trick enemies and use as a springboard later on she can create a full shadow clone.PS Also you seem irked with Ruby having a complicated semblance but not with Weiss glyphs and pseudosummoning necromancy?,RWBY,dca8242,1,t5_2vhg0

Yet no one would really be able to immediately recognize them or their names just because they were either once royalty or descendants of royalty. The descendant of the Italian royal family runs a food truck in California and he was picked up as a story only because his Italian food truck is named with the title he would have had if the royal family was still in power.

As a story writer myself I know when you leave story elements open and then put something else out there that seems to fit people will put them together. We got a named important sword using character from a Great War who was well known at the time.Earlier on we know Jaune had an important sword using ancestor in the Great War whom was apparently very well known. So Id say its less jumping the gun and more a case of Well if the shoe fits kinda deal. Personally I dont think the King was Jaunes direct ancestor maybe some relation like Jaunes greatgrandfather was his nephew or something but they could be close relatives or completely unrelated.

10407831,0,t3_5p1wme,Its basically died down a bit at least on the subreddit for now. I cant speak for tumblr or other parts of the fandomBut at least initially when we saw the opening Sun got a lot of very much undeserved hate from a small but loud portion of Bumblebee shippers. Hes getting in the way see?But once he actually made an appearance in the show theres some legitimate criticism over him apparently stalking Blake for what initially seemed like an excessive amount of time depends on how long he was actually following her before V but we have no way of knowing.Add on top of that the fact that he really hasnt developed as a character at all since he was introduced in V and he seems to have been reduced to pure comedic relief now.Throw onto the pile his interrupting Blakes moment with her Dad even if he had a good reason and you get more negative feelings heading his way from some people and a lot of people defending his decision to barge in who are justifiable upset with Blake slapping Sun as well.I suspect a lot of the defend Sun stuff youve been seeing comes from people who interact with other parts of the fandom because I havent seen any real hate for Sun here and I practically live in new.Personally Im disappointed with whats been done with Sun this Volume.,RWBY,dcnsn9l,19,t5_2vhg0
10407840,0,t3_5p1pqm,Writing Put out some Sincerest Regards that didnt garner much attention. Considering retiring it early  its harder than I thought and my time could be spent more productively on other more interestingpopular things.Also considering deleting Accelerant since if Im honest its never getting continued and I dont see the reason to keep it up and give readers false hope.I also uploaded some Ladybug Diary but am apprehensive of continuing soon. It should not come as a surprise to anyone who is familiar with the ongoing plot of TLD that the chapter where Blake and Ruby get intimate is fast approaching but I have no real idea of how to write it. Perhaps this is a shock to some but I am not a teenage lesbian nor do I have any experience having lesbian sex. This has been a source of trepidation since the early February chapters confusingly published in MarchApril last year which has probably been obvious from the way I have approached the subject. I want the retelling of the scene to have the gravity and intimacy that is implicit with the act and have it told accurately from the correct perspective i.e. the recipients but avoid cliches and straying too closely to pornography. Some of it I think I could fake but the rest... I dont know whats appropriate for young nervous lesbians to do their first time having sex and I definitely dont know how it feels.So anyway yeah thats whats going on with TLD.

Ive been writing Tawny since  its been a blast to create this new future AU and Ill always love it. But over the years Ive noticed the early chapters containing flaws with time and experience Ive come to realize that I think some of the earlier chapters need to be rewritten. This could be from changes in canon to my poor grammar and punctuation skills Id like to ask one or more of you guys for some help in rewriting some of the earlier chapters and offering me suggestions and ideas. Ive had the general concept of the story down for a long time and I feel like Im dragging it out WAY to long I think once I have a proofreader and somebody I can talk to about the story I feel I can make something out of this.  Id really love it if we could work together on this  you shall of course receive credit! And than after that Ill be writing chapter  of Everyday Life with a Monster Girl Huntress which so far is going well.

10466710,0,t1_dcuhkli,Yep but I mean having team RWBY always around JNPR kinda insinuates that. I agree with you on that though.Jaune was probably comforted by all of em. Weve seen Rens bro hug with Jaune Ruby saying everything will be good  times and Nora would definitely comfort Jaune in the well get behind this conspiracy kinda thing. Not seeing their reactions to Pyrrhas death kinda bugged me too but I realise we can probably assume how well it went or well get a flashback in the future.I do agree that Romans words should be triggered eventually but u dont think Shione was appropriate for it. In fact I want Romans words to echo along with flashbacks to the battle of Beacon somewhat like this I hoped itd have happened during the Tyrian fight but I guess not. One thing which need to see more of in Ruby is a look into her psyche. Perhaps in a scene where she just breaks down or a inner monologue something.

Honestly though Im not kidding when I dont know which is the reason Im reading the fic anymore.... and also rereading.... and also rerereading.... damit I may have a problem but its a bee problem so I dont care for the incredible ahem intense stuff or the genuine emotional plot... and the two are rarely mutually exclusive which is doubly awesome!  Its something soooooo rare to see in fanfics for writing on mature topics like those to be so good and so realbelievable and not forced or clumsy. That you are also awesome with a sketch pad too? Totally unfair. Never stop what youre doing!  Easily fast become one of the best content awesomeers in the fandom especially for bumblebee both SFW funny as fuck comics and tumblr generally and... errr...

Stuff like that is incredibly hard to work through and past and from a purely narrative standpoint even though I hate seeing her in pain for so long Im honestly glad its taken this long for her to seem to fully heal as its more realistic I personally tookam taking years to work past my own depression and runaway instincts and its probably why I identify so strongly with Blake and want to see her succeed so badly.,RWBY,dd2myhm,8,t5_2vhg0

The whole transition from his wailing on the floor to his halfassed sobbing attacks on the Grimm slowly becoming more and more wrathful until hes eventually back to his manic bloodlusted self was intense. And Cinders reaction as well cant wait to see what happens with the Evil League of Evil.

10546442,0,t3_5r0xe7,Im just curious about how the intro scene with Blake fighting Adam in the desert doesnt look like its gonna happen this Volume. Normally Id be OK with this if it werent for the fact that every other scene in the intro happened. And there isnt enough time to reintroduce Adam and have a fight with him when we already have the fight between RNJR and Nuckles.But the Who is phone? issue. From what I gathered Suns phone is with Ilia Ilias phone was never brought into question and Ghiras phone has the WF folder in it. I guess as exWhite Fang leader he still has access to the database. And seeing as it looks like Blake and Sun are gonna be hanging out in Menagerie for a while longer well probably see more Ilia in the future.Which I am perfectly OK with.,RWBY,dd3k2as,2,t5_2vhg0

10589346,0,t3_5rk2cj,VE is the first Ive watched go live and I binged through everything else just last week.The show immediately got me. Main reason probably is I just enjoy female protagonists a lot in stories and RWBY does a great job at that.Even though there are some wonky animations from time to time especially the first couple of Volumes the fights are incredibly well choreographed. Heck other action oriented shows could learn a thing or two from RWBY.I really like most of the characters and I also like how they are trying to keep it simple with their psychology so more people less into series can follow. Im very interested in the setting I generally love when stories go from small scale groups with their daily activities to full grand scale epics. That probably comes from Gurren Lagann which I read was a great inspiration.Lastly for the writing except some minor hiccups here and there that I dont really agree with I love how untheatrical it sounds it doesnt try to be too serious or too funny or overly dramatic. Best example Ive got is papa Belladonna noticing the way Blakes dressed and commenting on it. Most shows dont ever bring up the subject because fashion but here you should obviously expect otherwise.All in all great show intrigued to know where its going and hoping it doesnt pull a Game of Thrones.

After all they may not be there in body but those closest to you are always there in spirit. Besides with Nora Jaune and Ren there to make Ruby feel better what could possibly go wrong? January  Moncon Submission SynopsisReview Its Rubys birthday and everyone seems to want to do something for her no matter where they are. Interesting story  uDeamonHunter actually PMd me and asked for feedback on grammar and plot structure which I gave him a lot of so I hope to see him improve in the future. That being said the general plot for this story is very good but the execution is rather lacking and it is littered with grammatical errors. Written by  uDeamonHunter.From Beyond by Coeur AlAranPublished  Updated Status CompleteLength  Words  ChaptersFavorites  Follows  Reviews  Summary Seeing that young man die in initiation was horrifying for her. Even with all her time in the White Fang she hadnt expected to see such an idealistic man as Jaune Arc die like that. It should have been nothing more than a tragedy... Instead shes now stuck with the lingering spirit of this guy following her around and no one else can hear or see him in any way. Jaune x Blake SynopsisReview Jaune dies to initiation and comes back as a ghost. Blake is the only one who can see him. General tomfoolery and romance happen. This was one of my favorite stories while it was updating which happened every sunday. Each chapter is very short which has its plusses and minuses on the one hand yay guarenteed updates and things happening! On the other hand the shortness could be very detrimental at points both due to the propensity of short chapters causing cliffhangers which arent too fun when they happen almost every week and the lack of detail with some events or how they changed in canon which left readers filling in gaps. The plot is solid and covers volumes  with no intention of continuing further and it ends at a nice point that wraps up almost everything to a satisfactory conclusion. The story is also just really funny. Its also somehow ballooned to k words which is... a lot more than I thought it was when I started writing the review but due to the short chapter lengths it should feel like a rather fast read. Some of the characters do feel a bit onedimensional at times but even with that its a very good story and well worth the read so... go read it.Please Give Me Wings by uLadyBugsSummary After having completed her training as an Angel Cadet Yang Xiao Long is finally graduating. MonCon January SynopsisReview Yang is graduating from Archangel Academy. Story is fine theres been a vast increase in the quality of the writing from the last MonCon entry. I disagree with the interspersing of the graduation celebration and of the exam I dont think that it flowed very well for a multitude of reasons. Im also not the biggest fan of using storyoffshoot oneshots for contests like this as Ive said before as then theyre not really oneshots and require more from the reader in order to fully understand everything thats going on.What are the odds? by UnjaxPublished Status CompleteLength  WordsFavorites  Follows  Reviews  Summary Weiss and Ruby got kidnapped.

Could he really be a member of that family? Its down to her to find out. SynopsisReview This story is... not very good. It was written between volumes  amp  so it gets some things just wrong Qrow is Yangs dad and name is Qrow Xiao Long but I cant really fault it for that since well none of the information was known at the time. Its got a lot of other issues though. It starts off as basically a canon rehash goes into a weird Vytal Tournament that sorta loses the idea of the story in the first place then does a setup for a sequel that I dont really want to read. Basically Pyrrha is a secret agent that isnt really so secret since everyone knows who she is and she has to track down Jaune because hes an Arc the importance of which is never explained even though everyone seems to know. But her actually being a secret agent isnt relevant for most of th foreshadowing at all. I read the story like... really quickly and Im not sure why I did exactly but I dont actually recommend it so Im not sure why Im writing out it now except to rant I guess?Blake Belladonna and Ilia Amitola The Celebration Girls by SniphlesPublished Status CompleteLength  WordsFavorites  Follows  Reviews  Summary During her White Fang days Blake and Ilia were the best of friends.

SynopsisReview Blake and Ilia are the celebration girls here to spread cheer amongst all of the Faunus of the White Fang! No one seems to want to celebrate with them though... The entire thing read like a childrens tale which was rather nice. The formatting was kind of messed up though but the story was still very enjoyable but definitely a childrens tale complete with the aesop at the end. Written by  uSniphles.Enjoy reading!

He cries softly while holding his tail firmly in his hands whispering sorry over and over.He chokes through his tears and starts to read the note.Dear Tyrian I did not want to say those things but I felt it was best to build you up stronger.  I hope one day you can find it in your heart to forgive me for as you know you mean the world to me and losing your love is something I cannot imagine...

10633434,0,t3_5s1sik,It was better than Volumes  and  but thats really not saying too much. The biggest problem that RWBY had and will continue to have is that its a BLOATED show. How many new characters have we been introduced to in this season alone several of which have never even been alluded to? Like that Illia girl. A person who apparently has a ton of history with Blake comes out of nowhere and were apparently supposed to care about her? Then theres that asshole who flirts with Weiss that we spend several minutes with and even get to know the name of who is completely and utterly unimportant. How about that ship crew that only appears for an episode?  So many characters get added and fleshed out when they still need to flesh out our main characters. Ruby until the last parts of episode  was literally the same character. Shes the most boring character in the show and thats a problem when shes the main character. Lindseys ever higher pitched voice acting doesnt help either. Yangs arc takes place way too fast. Went from Punished Venom Yang to alright in just a few scenes. She desperately needed more screentime. Blakes arc was repetitive. Just her going Go away Sun  and brooding about being alone for an entire arc. Weiss was probably the most well done arc but it was by far the most predictable. Then we get Nora and Ren getting more development than anyone else in the volume including team RWBY and while its great that they got development one has to wonder why they dedicated an entire episode to their backstory. I will say this volume has a bit more writing nuance than the others and it definitely feels more natural than their attempts at a  Book  Harry PotterSoL anime story but boy is it just a bunch of setup with barely any payoff. I mean I know some seasons have to have more impact than others but nothing about this season stood out for me other than Ironwood being best boy.    Also having no Neo is a travesty and this season a shit without her. ,RWBY,ddcraog,2,t5_2vhg0

10718707,0,t1_ddk7c57,Having Ozpin in him and knowing Ozpins power level is the crux of the issues. I dont see how Jaune would be remotely happy with having Ozpin involved. Think about it the man fucked up massively. His organisation fell to pieces his tower fell he dragged students into his shadow war and then sent them sent her out to die against somebody who he knew they had no chance against. And now hes back. He used magic to save his own undeserving skin and hijack somebody elses brain. Nothing for the one Jaune cared about nothing for the one he sent out into the cold to die.Add to that Oz is a professor and from everything weve seen emotionally detached from it all. Hes exactly the wrong person to talk to Jaune about this hell hes the person that Jaunes going to blame for all this. To be honest though the closest thing to a good person to explain this to Jaune would be Goodwitch and shes not exactly in the picture right now. Id agree if Ozpin was kept hidden if not for two things. The first Oscars got the cane. Thats blatantly Ozpins. Secondly Ozpin lying to them again? Hiding in somebody elses brain and manipulating them from the shadows? Sure.

To become The One With a Body Count. She survives and becomes the single thing she feared more than death alone.Its still in the early chapters but for any Arkos fans this is definitely something to keep an eye on. Not This Time Fate by  Coeur AlAran When Jaune woke up back in his house with his sisters and family all he could do was sigh. Every time he died he was forced to start over again and this was what... the one thousandth time? More? If it doesnt matter how hard he tries doesnt matter how much he fights. Then maybe its time to just kick back and enjoy himself. Fate can find someone else to be its whipping boy. This is probably my personal favorite fan fic. It takes old and tired tropes that have been beaten to death a dozen times over and breathes fresh life into them. Honestly anything by Coeur is worth a look. Im not a fan of the Dark Knight Jaune x Blake ship but Coeur does it very well. Resurgence by Kraven Ergeist The strongest are those who can get back up with the bitter taste of defeat still fresh in their mouths. Ruby and her new team are trying to save as many as they can while they wait for Cinders next move. But Cinder has a new weapon in store for the huntsmen in training. And this weapon wears a familiar face... While not as well written as Coeurs works this fan fic is fairly fast paced filled with action twists and turns that will keep you guessing. Its also very long despite relatively short chapter lengths. Definitely worth giving a shot. And The Rest Is by EXNativo A shortage of coffee at Beacon means Doctor Oobleck has to teach a class without the help of his precious caffeine. History is always interesting and perhaps for the first time the history teacher will be too. This is a hilarious fic. Plain and simple. Remnant by  Fell The Tempest The Schnee family possesses a special trait the ability to summon familiars into battle. Weiss was convinced she was the exception... that is until the Battle for Beacon. If youre a fan of the Fate series FateStay Night FateZero this is a good crossover fic. The first couple of chapters are fantastic but the later ones have dragged on a bit. Hopefully it picks up again. ,RWBY,ddm9yc4,1,t5_2vhg0

10729457,0,t1_ddmg8om,gtwatching Vol  unbroken marathon....and its not bad at all    I think thats part of the issue. It isnt parce the focal point of this analysis but the pacing watching it from week to week is less then okay while binge watching it makes it seems like nothing was wrongor at least not enough wrong to make a fuss about.    Going forward they need to focus more on the fact that we are getting episodes once a week  WOR weeks Weeks that may be off. Keep in mind that Yang had a stretch of  days between appearances Watching it as a one off it is a lot less apparent but not seeing a titular character for a month and a half is frustrating.,RWBY,ddmnw5c,23,t5_2vhg0

10733948,0,t3_5th3xe,So I disagree with pretty much every single thing on this post in both broad and specific manner. Lets go in order. Wall of text warning.Ruby Rose  A character drowned by white noiseOP takes issue with Rubys storyline in this volume because of lack of direct characterization. Heshe decries the lack of immediate and direct addressing of Rubys emotional issues without ever considering if it was deliberate. I would have though its pretty obvious by now how CRWBY want to treat Ruby. Watch her throughout Volumes  and . This bubbly happygolucky girl who likes cookies. Who NEVER talks about her past. Who is so afraid of telling people that shes afraid or uncertain that she finds her only real outlet is her dead mothers grave. Note that we had a song about Rubys relationship with her mother that was never addressed again. I know a lot of people probably got somewhat frustrated with Rubys character and general lack of maturity around the end of Volume . Even now she still sometimes acts like someone far younger than her and yet shes so emotionally closed off that even as viewers we dont get access to her thoughts.And how does that continue in Volume ? In the first fight of the show she still displays some of the rashness from earlier volumes. She shoots a fire dust round into the gheists tree trunk. But she learns. When she fights against Tyrian she shoots an electrically charged round into Nora but from an angle that looks like she just missed so Tyrian wasnt expecting it. When Qrow joins the fight she approaches from the opposite angle to stay out of his way even though her attempting to help at all could be construed as rash. And in the final fight against the Nuckelavee we finally saw her truly as part of the RNJR for the first time. It isnt just fight scenes though. Think about her hysteria on seeing Jaunes hoodie. I dont know if she immediately made the connection between Jaune wearing a Pumpkin Pete shirt and Pyrrhas face being on the cereal boxes but either way she simply didnt know how to respond. Think about her nightmares. When Yang had a nightmare we saw exactly what happened that scene with Adam slowly approaching her and her weapons being taken away. But Ruby? We dont even know what she was dreaming about other than Pyrrha screaming Jaune! Think about Jaunes training video. Remember Volume  Ruby in the Jaundice arc? She just walked outside sat him down and told him to man up and be a leader. That kick in the ass was exactly what he needed. But seeing him this time? She wasnt sure anymore. She considered helping him you can see from her just standing there watching but decided against it because she doesnt know how to deal with emotions. She cracks once. In Kuroyuri when Jaune and her have the very discussion that OP complained about. And then finally at the end of the volume she opens up. In her letter to Yang for the first time in the entire show she really talks about herself. She looks inside and actually faces herself.This is Rubys character development. CRWBY never intended to shove her into our faces. Shes often seen as the mainest of the main characters of the show but we always see her through the lenses of other peoples eyes because thats the only way she can see herself. This has nothing to do with white noise. Until Kuroyuri Ruby was very clearly the focus of this storyline. I think if anything people should be complaining about Jaunes treatment given that his entire initial show of weakness because of Pyrrha was simply foil for Ruby and all he really got after that was his dislike of Qrow. But Volume  finally gave Ruby the first step towards healing herself facing her demons. This contrasts with Yang who is discussed last. In my view her character development and resolution was the secondbest handled of the volume.Weiss Schnee  The star of Volume Well Yang was the star. But well ignore this for a second.I am genuinely shocked that Weiss is the one OP selected as being shafted on screen time and I feel this might be because OP is confusing coherency with simplicity. Dont get me wrong Weiss genuinely has a good story. I think RNJRs writing was better but there was so much more to that one its kind of hard to compare. But over the course of the volume Weiss entire story culminates into a single decision leave her family and go to Mistral. Thats literally it.I love its beginning honestly. You really have to go back to Volume  and see how Weiss acts towards Ruby  and her team in general  to see how it all fits in. Weiss grew so much in the first three volumes but in the end Battle of Beacon took its toll and as soon as her father reentered her life she just fell back into the routine. A lot of people will probably dislike me for saying this but honestly throughout the first half of the volume Weiss was basically a doormat. She grew up in a family with an abusive adultering father. You notice that her mother is mentioned a grand total of once and never shows up again even at the concert? I really wonder what their relationship is like given that according to Whitley Weiss spent all day in her room most of the time so she never even tried to find her mother. The dynamic of the family is pretty clear and you can see the reflection of that in how Weiss acted the first time she was separated from them.Then comes the concert. Weiss basically sees insults hurled at her and her friends and accidentally throws a Boarbatusk thanks Port at someone. Her fathers subsequent decision to lock her inside the Schnee mansion really sets in motion her decision to leave. Alone in her room with nothing to lose she is finally able to summon at will and with the help of Klein she departs for Mistral in search of Winter. Little does she know shes going to find the rest of RWBY there.In my eyes this storyline is utterly complete. I cannot even imagine another scene that would have helped advance smooth or otherwise positively shape Weiss story. I dont have anything more to say here.Blake Belladonna  Walking in circles through old pathsAgain just like Ruby. Blakes running away from her problems is part of her character. Its her semblance. She literally even says that straight to the camera. OP points out that its similar to The Stray. Yeah no shit! Exactly what parts of the first three volumes gave you the idea that that changed? Blake still has the exact same obsession with Faunus inequality shes had for the entire show. She ran away in The Stray as OP mentioned her friends find her and bail her out. The entire first half of volume  is immediate evidence that nothing internally changed with her. She didnt learn to go to her team despite her promise with Weiss. She finds a problem and obsesses over it until it runs ragged and her team basically have to sit her down and shout at her until she opens up about it. And then what happens? Maybe she gets an idea she doesnt have to run away so much anymore. Battle of Beacon happens and she decides not to run away. She faces Adam to try to save the life of a human. And Yang loses her arm for it.Blake did not learn not to run away. You know what Blake learned? She ran away from her problems twice over the course of the show and nobody got hurt except bad guys. Then the one time she decides to face her past her partner almost dies. Blake was taught that running away is the right thing to do. She believes her problems the same ones she obsesses over and can never let go will only plague everyone around her. Sun and her even specifically talk about this. Its these things that make me really question your diagrams are pretty and all but did you even try properly analyzing before you wrote your rant? From Blakes perspective Volume  was the same as Volume  only at such a superficial generalized level that its hard even to put it into words. And if you think shes done shes healed shes finished with running away boy have I got news for you. You think that Suns words are going to help her more than Yangs? Now she has two cases of trying to run to her problems instead of away from them and people getting hurt. This is why I consider Blakes storyline to be the least well written. It doesnt close or satisfy or show any dramatic character development the same way the other three girls get. Theres plenty more Blake angst thats going to be had in future volumes you had better believe it.Yang Xiao Long  The pointless screentimeNow this one is just downright insulting.I think the big reason why OPs analysis of Yangs storyline is so distinct from reality is that Yang does not have PTSD. Shes a  or  year old girl who grew up fighting literally her entire life who suffered through having to take care of her younger sister for an extended period of time after their mother died who got the wrong end of a fight. I dont know why people have this idea. It seems to come from two things her one nightmare about Adam and her freakout at the sound of the glass dropping. Did you notice a little something that was zoomed in on after her freakout? She slammed her fist on the table and went through it. If that was supposed to be PTSD that was the worst writing Ive seen in a while and most CERTAINLY not perfect setup and perfect trigger. Yang had depression not PTSD and I believe acknowledging that instantly nullifies literally every complaint OP has about this.Lets look at this from the perspective of someone with depression. First we see the initiation. She loses her arm and as someone with lifelong abandonment issues her partner abandoned her. She considers herself a burden and descends into selfhate. She has nightmares about Adam and when she drops a glass and gets a flashback from the noise she is frustrated with losing control of herself. ,RWBY,ddn4k2a,9,t5_2vhg0

An example would be with the chest plate try to split it up into parts that would lock or seal well with each other that still allows it to adjust slightly to your movements. Of course you would still need to design it but in all it cant be too difficult to construct something nonmechanical in nature in a CAD program. Same story with the sword as well just makes sure it fits seamlessly together for a good fit.As for the shield I would recommend getting some engineering buddies to help you with that probably someone older who is more accustomed to spring loads. I can see the shield working pretty reliably on those but again up to you on what you want to do. Otherwise Im not as knowledgeable on what material you should be making it out of or for what sizes work for you but I bet there are some people with much more experience on rcosplay that can help you out if you are really serious about doing it.,RWBY,de4yh88,2,t5_2vhg0

Itd make certain characters suddenly gay or lesbian if all their canon crushes are still things but that doesnt matter at all.Personally itd be refreshing if several existing female characters were male with no changes to their personality just to diversify the cast a little and also stand up for men who act feminine. But more or less the same thing could be said for doing it the other way round.I dont think gender really comes into why this show works.,RWBY,dedo8ag,2,t5_2vhg0

After he gets to know her and learn of her past he finds out that she has real problems that he wants to help her with while also finding her goals of faunus equality pretty laudable. Plus the show doesnt show it but its implied the two spend a lot more time together than we see since she knows about Neptunes fear of water. Something she probably learned from Sun. Mostly goes the same for Yang the two spend more time together than what we are shown. Yang seems to be naturally protective of her friends and people she cares for as shown with Ruby. Although yeah your point of them being one sided is true. I dont think Blake has helped either one of them work through their own problems if anything Blake just exacerbated Yangs abandonment issues by running.  Solar Flare Or whatever SunXYang is called actually seems a bit more plausible and could lead to growth for both of them Since Suns inability to abandon people and his tendency to always help someone he cares for would help Yang get through her issues with her mom. ,RWBY,derqhu4,3,t5_2vhg0

For exampleThe maidensSErelics are all concepts Im fine with but that I feel were poorly set up for and that the audience was poorly prepared for. Silver eyes in particular managed a trifecta managing to simultaneously feel like an asspull deus ex machina and introduced the Chosen One trope to the series. The first two could have been alleviated by some extra foreshadowing and build up. But the last one is the more troubling one. I have no problem with the trope like many in this subreddit seem to but feel that it should at least be clear that its in use as soon as possible to avoid misleading the audience. This show began with  protagonist so we were given no reason to suspect any of them would be particularly chosen beyond Ruby being  years younger. Compare that to Harry Potter the poster boy for the trope which had the very first chapter tell us hes the boy who lived.Also Team SSSN and CFVY are fine characters and have some relevance to the plot but the show often overshadowsundermines that by using them for cheap gags and fanservice.,RWBY,desui8j,4,t5_2vhg0

11240930,0,t3_60fumu,On the one hand  it adds an unusual concept and considers what would happen to the team dynamic if the foursome were really really close.  I dont really recall very many polyamory fics that explore how relations would work outside private quarters so this one is good in that regard.  Not to mention the conflict involved in the initial setup of the realtionship in general.    On the other hand  While the work is endearing... like the headsman tripping but still getting the axe in the right spot the story can be clumsy in its execution.    The way Ghria and Kali were mentioned... well its blatant shoe horning.  But it also signals where the author is intending on going with the story.  Basically the plan seems to be to parallel the main canon but with this new addition of the plot.    Its kinda odd that my main thought to describe the fic would be RWBY  the intimacy of a Steven Universe fusion without the body and mind combining.  And considering the most recent chapter that might be where the author is going.    While I can recommend this the recommendation does come with a huge disclaimer.  Similar to the main show its taken a couple of years to develop the plot this far...    ...and while Im morbidly curious to see this authors take on the Volume  separation it might take awhile for them to get there.,RWBY,df655r5,5,t5_2vhg0

While he has two scenes where hes more prominent in Shion Village and in Oniyuri the rest of his screentime was more used as a commenter. Its only starting from chapter  Ren takes prominence in the story leaving Jaune et Ruby with Nora his flashbacks in Kuroyuri and the fight with the Knuckelavee.

11466803,0,t1_dfvqnbn,Hmmm... Looking back at the fight Pyrrha was really out of her game. You are right about Penny most likely beating her in that situation. The thing about the lasers however is that it takes a long time to charge up the big laser. Theres no way that Pyrrha would ever let Penny charge it up in time or have it hit her. The small lasers were used against her and they werent that useful I still think magnetism trumps Pennys lasers heavily really especially since the metal swords are the vector for lasers. Regarding her fight against Cinder she could have kissed Jaune because she wasnt sure if she would win. But Im pretty sure she WANTED to win. She wouldnt have tried so hard otherwise. The thing about her fighting Cinder to delay her thing which bothers me is this What did she want to delay Cinder for? Was she waiting for the huntresses and huntsman to arrive and save the day or was she slowing Cinder down? Why did she want to slow Cinder down when she knows shes not gonna be able to do much fights are usually really short she wouldnt have been able to slow her down for more than  minutes? To me it makes much more sense that Pyrrha believed she had the POSSIBILITY of winning but she wasnt sure. The problem with that is Pyrrha should know she isnt stronger than Ozpin and there was no way she was going to win. ,RWBY,dfvr7lv,3,t5_2vhg0

11552147,0,t1_dg5dj27,Yeah. Qrow being decommissioned to me felt like just a plot device to remove him from RNJR to stop him from winning all their battles for them and to add a bit more urgency to their pace which they sorely lacked as they didnt even know Tyrian was behind them.While his injury did stop their hike from being a merry adventure romp through the countryside it didnt really have any more weight than if Qrow had up and left as a bird to go find something give up and return at the end.For me Yangs arm had the potential to be big and really affecting her character but then we cut away from her and one month later she was armed and ready with basically only a song to describe her return and defeating her depression So while it wouldnt be the most immersive thing I would have enjoyed seeing a bit more of Yang while depressed every few episodes to show how shes adapting to it all.As for Cinder and Sun I never felt that Sun was in danger it wasnt set up like a character death and as you said most of the deaths and injuries were telegraphed long before. With Cinder while her injury and her muteness was a bit shocking to me I didnt really care about her regaining her powers what was more interesting to me was her interactions with the other members of Salems evil club of evil particularly Watts and Tyrian.,RWBY,dg5ftp3,2,t5_2vhg0

11615369,0,t1_dgaju8u,I have mentioned this in a previous comment but an earthling would never obtain the physical strength and power in characters such as Yang and Nora. Aura would theoretically weaken or interfere with these characters natural strength actually and by using calculus to find its limits of the electrodynamical system created by aura or being aura I have found that a naturally strong by Earth standards person wouldnt have anywhere near the natural strength of those characters as two nonphysics related problems occur Their natural strength is far inferior to that of these characters and the limit of the humans augmented strength assuming that they had the maximum aura in their weak compared to the Remnentian characters and not durable at all bodies is still incredibly inferior to the Remnentians. So yes the field may potentially make humans physically stronger and more durable the natural strength of characters like Yang and Nora are far superior than what Earthlings will ever reach and therefore we can never reach those levels.,RWBY,dgcm1vj,2,t5_2vhg0

11628231,0,t1_dgdwsfi,gt Penny died and since then Ruby hasnt mentioned herTo whom would she talk about Penny? gtPyrrha died and Ruby got a power upAnd nightmares. And a target on her back.gtHer team disbanded and she just got a new one immediately.So? She still misses her friends and wish to get them back.gtHer sister lost her arm Ruby tried to get comforted and then leftSee Jaunes training alone at night and just puts it aside.Theyre problems she cant deal with by throwing her scythe at. So yeah that counts as struggling.By the way its not like she left immediatly. Times passed before she left weeks or even month she talked to her about her plan of going to Haven Yang said it was crazy and in retrospect Ruby agrees she let a note explaining her actions and sent letters along her journey to keep her informed on how she was doing. She didnt really pulled a Raven on her sister.gtSure she doesnt win fights but she rarely loses them as something is always there to bail her out. So does the other girls in team RWBY except Yang once. Every time someone show up to bail them out the guy trying to kill them just decides not to or with Weiss sudden summoning.I wouldnt say she doesnt deal with the consequences. Sure I agree Ruby doesnt get as much development as the others in Volume  and it would be nice if she got more. But I wouldnt say she hasnt developped at all. Shes still generally upbeat but a lot more toned down than she used to be. Shes become more reckless. Penny and Pyrrhas death does weight her down why do you mean she crossed the line for the people we already lost in her letter? During Volume  all the girls have to deal with their problem evoked in V Weiss and her family Blake and her tendency to run away Yang and her lack of goal. Ruby was exactly where she was meant to be out there slaying monster trying to make the world better. So thats exactly what she was trying to do in Volume  except with her optimism getting slapped in the face with each destroyed village they encountered her uncle getting poisoned because of her secrets being revealed and worse than she thought and Ren and Nora going AWOL.,RWBY,dge2m9q,6,t5_2vhg0

11632720,0,t1_dgejp35,I believe realizing that you need forgiveness in the first place means youre repenting or having a change of mind.  When Jesus was brought a woman caught in adultery He said to her Neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more.  He never told her to make an attempt to stop sinning.  He forgave her showed that He loved her and that gave her the power to sin no more.  If its man trying to overcome sin then Christ has no part of it but if we leave sin to Christ then we overcome sin with Him.  Romans  For sin shall not have dominion over you for ye are not under the law but under grace.  I may be a sinner in the flesh but I dont have to try to overcome sin it has no business with me spiritually.I know thats what you believed friend about Gods forgiveness.  Its just how that was worded it had me a little troubled.  Its safe to say Nebuchadnezzar was once one of the most evil men to walk the face of the earth and Saul before he became Paul could probably make a similar claim.  We can point at all their evil acts all we want at the end of the day they worshiped God and begged for forgiveness.  Many people today sadly go around thinking they dont deserve forgiveness or even happiness but none of us truly deserve it.  Its a free gift to everyone.God bless,RWBY,dgekxrs,2,t5_2vhg0

11676169,0,t3_66ddrz,Honestly no. Im aware that is an unpopular opinion but I think there has been a decent amount of subtlety to her development. Compare Ruby in VE and Ruby in VE and they are very different characters. Shes gained confidence as well as doubts. Shes begun to realize the world is a much harsher place but she still maintains her optimism.I think a lot of people want Ruby to have some kind of breakdown or some big dramatic moment where she loses all hope but honestly I just dont see it happening. I wouldnt be mad if it happens but I think it makes more sense for it to never happen and I think the story is better that way.Not every character arc needs to be dramatic. Honestly they could cut back on the drama in other ones especially Blakes. Thats what I loved about Yangs V arc it was never overstated it was handled with finesse. Weiss and Blakes were a bit more hamfisted. Rubys is gradual and subtle. Its her personality adjusting to the harsh world she has found herself in and growing into her larger role. Maybe people have a problem with Rubys optimism because they are not optimists themselves. They think that an optimist character in a world like RWBY needs to be broken down and have a crisis of identity and purpose at least once. But stories are not cookie cutter and those things are not always necessary. A character who never loses their way is not necessarily a Mary Sue and Ruby certainly is not either.,RWBY,dgjidk9,1,t5_2vhg0

11765549,0,t3_67w2s4,Well each attack name in the show is based on ship names that us fans created so it would be called Enabler. The main reason they didnt do such an attack in the show most likely is because they didnt want to imply incest by even acknowledging the ship.So Enabler would be my answer.

11772601,0,t1_dgug5c3,I am really looking forward to seeing the numbers. yknow? I can already predict. If WR comes up against Spice Cream...the victory will be like  against ..at max because the honest fact is Spice Cream is just a tool for the people who feel threatened by the two Ruby ships Lancaster and RG. Weiss hasnt interacted with Ruby this volume while Jaune has. and shared many moments. Oscar is probably going to interact in the next one. that fact has them feeling all threatened. and well knocking the ships out from teh contest gives them ....validation I guess? dunno. At any rate....I want to see this unfold. This looks promising. ,RWBY,dguggub,4,t5_2vhg0
