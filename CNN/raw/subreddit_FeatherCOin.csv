851755,0,t3_23veks,Sorry to hear about your having trouble with our network. Have you updated to the latest ... client?We are about to go through a hard fork so it is very important that you are on the latest version.There are several DNS seeds that the client should connect to on start to connect to the rest of the network. The names of the seeds are as follows.    dnsseed.feathercoin.com    dnsseed.btcltcftc.com    dnsseed.alltheco.inIt might be worth checking if these properly resolve on the server. There are running nodes on the DNS seeds so I would suggest adding their IP addresses to the feathercoin.conf file in the Feathercoin data directory. Please add the following to the conf file.    addnode...    addnode...    addnode...If this does not help resolve your issue then feel free to give me a shout on Skype my username is peter.bushnell,FeatherCOin,ch13l3f,1,t5_2wzao
