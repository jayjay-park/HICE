Water off a ducks back right? joanwaters AMAZING CONCEPT I am gagged beyond words! Giving good head face as always. Slaying these hoes FOR REAL THO. Gemini DAT VULNERABILITY. Youre bringing so much energy this time which has been one of the main critiques youve been getting here for the last few weeks. I like it  but I was also a big fan the aloof cold ass bitch vibes of your previous lip syncs. ShuttUp Another vulnerable performance! Im not a massive fan of this song but the emotion you brought to the sync captures its essence perfectly. zoomyx I like your concept and the sync itself was great! FIERCE!HarperValley Alaska is my favourite queen of all time I love your Alaska eye makeup and props to ya mama for the NAILS! The shade was everything. My favourite of the week! I just wish you kinda smudged your makeup around at the end. dOr I looove Sky Ferreira so a big toot for the song choice! In fact  I always like your song choices.

You are super enthusiastic and its nice to see.It Takes Two was great! The camera effect was used brilliantly and I really liked the energy. Nice job!Be careful with overusing effects. It was really hard to watch Cold Hearted because of how many of you there were. It took away from the performance.Also keep in mind for the competition that your intro and outro can be used more effectively  They can tell part of the story of your video rather than just be selfpromotion for your Youtube channel.,LSFYL,cnwsp5o,4,t5_2yefl

I will even guard it against the ravages of weather and damage as I will ever guard my legs my arms my eyes and my heart against damage. I will keep my penis clean and ready.

4220945,0,t1_cs1da5r,RavenNight Another video I helped with so this may be shorter than the others. The loose strap on your dress is a... little distracting but its real great to see you bust it out with something that has a lot of soul. A minor concern is the possibility that its a little simple as far as a synch goes but I enjoy the soul in it.thelettergii I dont remember No Light looking like thisBut no I really like this and Im kind of glad that I knew nothing about this one until I saw it. Its asthetically really strong and its a real strong synch from you. Youve got a real strong sense of visuals and how they work a good deal of the time and its always a delight to watch you.Skarlet Vainn I think emotionally youre a little... off??? Like some parts of this seem real intense when they dont need to be and some parts seem a little... Angrier than they should be? Keeping something energetic doesnt mean going over the top with your emotions it just means keeping a strong consistent energy throughout the video. The angle is a little... weird too unless you wanted to constantly look down the entire video as part of an executive artistic choice then I guess thats... fine. Also what is that on your head did you run out of turf when making the top but you still wanted to add a hood to the outfit?kioseth I like this somehow despite the fact that I find Iggy Azelia to be the number one song ruiner in the industry. Youve got a lot of attitude and sass and I appreciate it although you seem a little more dead during parts of the song. Still considering its like your first lipsynch video I think this is a real strong entry although I would have liked to see you play more with the song sometimes. That said I would have loved to see like... Some boob. A little bit of boob. Where boob? Why no boob?Calypso Overkill Im... Im not sure how I feel about this. Youre kind of all over the place as far as your actions go with some sharp variations in the the same moments of inflection. Im explaining it bad but the chorus is a good example of what Im talking about where you go in strong as fuck and in your face and go back with a real subdued oh oh oh oh which would have been... way funnier if you had turned back the first part by a lot especially since Marina does it in the same sort of voice. If the goals to be shocking then hellacious but shocking doesnt always mean good. Look at Alexs audition from last yeargirlswhatsmyweakness My first thought when you first went on camera was youre trying face paint again? After last year? but I actually liked what you did with it a bit as opposed to slapping on green and calling it a day. Its not a real strong choice for an introductory song specially since you were real funny in your audition but its also a low key song itself that doesnt really lend itself to dynamic performances. I like the idea but it could have been executed a little better. It doesnt really leave me feeling all YEAH THAT WAS HELLA or wow that I get from a real well done sad video it just leaves me in that sort of state of OK werk you get after a sad video that isnt super moving but is still upsetting.Rhonda Civic Rhonda I love watching you because I literally never have an idea what youre going to do. Granted wildcards tend to vary in quality which is kind of what happened here. Youre real into the song but... Concept wise telling a banana to go fuck itself while wearing a loud suit isnt your strongest idea. Granted its not helped by the camera being a little low on you but its kind of the case of your last audition where it wasnt that bad it was just real lowkey compared to other videos.rawkhawke Oh Rawk. The video ended up taking fucking forever and a half to load because my internet shat out but I got real excited that it looked like you were about to do Whats Going On a la Fabulous Super Powers but the end result was just kind of... not entirely there for me. The sounds off a little bit and considering the absolute goofiness of the source material you need to sell it a little bit more. I think itd probably be easier to move around if you werent sitting in a bed because that frees up a lot of movement for you.BitchEva Ughhhhh two videos from people I love in a row that arent as strong as they could be. I think Tell it To My Heart wasnt the best choice because its a real s dancey song and you like wearing a shawl and judging others for being heathens. Youve got the necessary amount of diva required for this song but aside from that you just take it way too small. I wanna see you busting out some dancing lasha tumbai shit out when doing songs like this.superwonkyeyelash Well... Your mouth is moving along with the words but your face is kind of emotionally void and the portrait is a... Real weird choice. Idk this is just real flat Im not really interested in this video and it feeels longer than it is a little bit. Do you have someone holding the camera? Do they know how to hold a camera? Cause you keep moving out of frame so the camera person should be on top of that.alexlopez Werk.mtd I absolutely love your attitude in this its fucking perfect. Youre hitting everything perfectly and theres like... Its not something real concept heavy but its just fantastic to watch in motion. Like my barometer for describing shit as being fierce is would this person be able to slap you in the face during this and would you be totally cool with it and I would absolutely say yes to both of those.People this man teaches children.KyleVisage This is a real over the top concept that is kind of... A lot calmer than it should be. Youve got the good girl part down but the rest is a lot more subdued than it should be specially with the background music during some parts of the song. Also why are you wearing a fuckin... half wig chopped to shit as a full hairpiece? Theres also camera height issues making this weird but Id say thats relatively low on my list of complaints.River I like the idea of this but the strobe... Its real distracting. It was good for the first part before the rest of the song started and Id really like it if it was just to fill space but its kind of... distracting from the rest of the synch. This is cute and you perform this pretty well but the strobe is a consistent thing that kind of brings down the videos quality. Still this isnt necessarily bad and youre a good performer so Id still love to see more of you whether its in the competition or in the carrion threads.Alex Spears OverlaySheba Maneater OverlayBilly Darling I love this. Idk if its the camera quality or the overlay got a little messed up when putting it together but your mouth seems to be off a bit. Still I love the amount of energy youve got in this and youve got the right energy for the different scenes you did which is hard when youre doing a lot of spoken word together in one mix. Juju killed me but most of the mix did. Its kind of long though ALMOST AS LONG AS MY INTRO LAST YEAR WAKKA WAKKA which may not help you out in the long run but Im still real impressed.Gigi Spot Well hello there Miss Gigi. I formally invite you into the haus of girls whos names are just two letters The cameras a little weird with you having to lean over a lot which shows off your padding a little more than you want probably but aside from some technical stuff this is a real fierce video and its a greatass surprise out of nowhere. Not many people can do Beyonce and Nicki a super big amount of justice so its real telling that you can pull off both as well as you do.My TOP SLOOTS OF THE WEEK are Edie Ko Rook Dazey Mayhem Pierre The Letter Gii MTD and Gloria Swansong. Im voting for  of you and this list is unordered so youll never be able to tell.

EDIT I do have a copy of it without the flare if youd like to see!Hopefully I live another week so I can show you that I am a country woman fighting for birth control rights but thats a whole other story  damn hat.,LSFYL,d4qegzb,3,t5_2yefl
8166535,0,t1_d4yaxqu,Yep! Sorry! Hehe. One is my laptop and the other is my drag account. Please dont have any hard feelings against any of us. It was just one of those situations where one thing lead to another and in the end we all felt bad and were glaring at each other...but its over and done with and hopefully everyone can move on from this. I know I say it all the time but Ive hosted stuff too and if you ever wanna go read the forums...yikes...every  pages or so a HUGE fight would break out between the modelsjudgeshost. At the time it always felt awful but most of us stuck around and even now we still have a skype group chat going even  seasons and after  of the first hosts have retired and we have a new one working.Whenever I feel down I know I can go jump on skype and have a family there to cheer me up. Same with this community for you I hope! Were a family which mean fights happen. P,LSFYL,d4yd6zn,2,t5_2yefl
