There is still some solid recruiting going on for summer interns but a big group of businesses recruit in the fall. Id suggest attending the spring internship and coop fair in February look on the site you can see whos attending the fair and many of them have open positions that are doing on campus recruiting and interviewing which you can apply for using husky career link. We post opportunities from around the country on there and employers actually come to us with jobs theyd like posted so look for ones employers have posted as well. I found my current coop with United Technologies on there and many other students in the office have as well.

What convinced me to attend was a combination of already low instate tuition rates scholarship money strong biology departments and an aboveaverage marching band for a big state school best one in New England New York and New Jersey in my opinion.The thing I love about the school the most is that its pretty much whatever you want to make of it. At least within the sciences and liberal arts theres so much students can do because the school has tons of resources you can accomplish a lot. For instance if social justice is your thing you can work your ass off within a studentrun organization or community outreach and actually make a meaningful impact on the lives of a lot of people. If neuroscience is your thing you can take advantage of the psych and PNB physiology and neurobiology departments many research projects and faculty. Wanna do a double major in PNB and philosophy while writing a senior thesis on existential philosophy under the guidance of a worldrenowned expert on Africana philosophy while making time to play in the incredibly fun basketball pep band? Yep. Its possible and Im doing it right now. Whether the school is right for you depends on whether you want a hugeuniversity experience.

I think my opinion the graduate student union at UConn is picking the wrong battles to fight using poor arguments to support their demands and is refusing to accept any answers that are given. It makes it more difficult for me to understand their issues when I see zero acknowledgement of the reason why things have changed i.e. recognizing the fact that the cost of health insurance isnt controlled by UConn because Anthem BCBS sets the rates for premiums for their health insurance and that isnt something the benefits people can do much about. patiently waits for slew of downvotes and peoples opinions of my views.,UCONN,corwf0m,0,t5_2rjvg

People yell as a means to educate those who choose to not listen people take physical action like sitins dieins rock painting rather than resorting to just writing since it is so much easier for people to choose to ignore what someone has wrote then it is to ignore something that you have to see.  Sometimes the loudest noise possible is what is needed to initiate change since a normal tone of voice is constantly shouted over by those in power.

Commuters had to leave even earlier to make sure they got to campus teachers and TAs who take care of their families had to leave earlier. It was a mess and it showed in the students around me and the lessons my instructors tried to teach. No fault on them though shoveling your driveways constantly for five ish weeks was bad.This morning they didnt shovel any of the sidewalks in Towers where I live and I barely made it down that hill in one piece said UConn sophomore Tyler Gavitt. The administration thinks were just complaining for the sake of complaining but it really just feels like they arent taking into account commuters or disabled students.Its also worth noting I just watched a girl slip and fall on slush walking down the hill from the chemistry building and she immediately started crying out of frustration Gavitt said.On Monday Reitz said the university mandates that all faculty members must accommodate students who are not comfortable with traveling to class in inclement conditions.While its our obligation to provide students the classes they paid for to the best of our ability they have every right to decide whether or not they wish to attend Reitz said.Many students however have proposed that rather than presenting students the decision to risk their safety to attend class or not the university should make an effort to reschedule said classes to give everyone including commuters and students with a mobilityrelated disability an equal chance to attend every class.I love classes its what Im here for said Ali who commutes to the Storrs campus. But I think the administration should give professors makeup dates for classes even on weekends whatever it takes.Other students including UConn junior Tyler Hayslett empathized on social media a need to acknowledge and appreciate the effort that many university employees and students put forth to clear the campus of snow and ice.I heard too many people complaining about the staff during the last snow storm I mainly wanted someone to put voice to the fact that facilities and grounds staff work really hard hours said Hayslett.,UCONN,cqxunsv,-1,t5_2rjvg

9515100,0,t1_d9lxc32,Its not a judgment. There is no ambiguity. Arbitration implies a judicial system open to arguments from both sides and the arbitrator makes a decision that is based off the arguments. There arent arguments here  other than that one line there isnt anything inherently sexist about those wiki edits. This is a factual statement. No arbitration no value judgments necessary ,UCONN,d9lxt6k,1,t5_2rjvg
9591025,0,t3_5cbsqx,Up to you. The  series is pretty easy to be honest. Equations are given and the most math you have to know is trig. ,UCONN,d9vagea,1,t5_2rjvg
9765575,0,t3_5f1wsz,Youll be shooting yourself in the foot unless you go to grad school. It will be clearly less difficult but its a massive pay reduction unless you go on to graduate level or do a plan of study that gives you a chance at med school which will be more difficult than CS to achieve.Why the drastic change in majors? There might be other fields that allow some flexibility without tossing away what youve already taken towards CS or are you just starting out?,UCONN,dagtohl,1,t5_2rjvg

9854339,0,t1_darvx4v,Yeah for some reason it kind of depends on whos working if theyll take the package or not. Your best bet is to put it in the actual drop off box.,UCONN,das1k7g,1,t5_2rjvg
9879054,0,t3_5gv0dh,This has already been covered recentlyI will use marijuana as an example. Its still illegal in every state regardless of whether or not its prescribed medicinally by an MD because its illegal under federal law. This is similar. Just because it isnt enforced doesnt mean its not illegal. You can use a colloquial expression like sanctuary city but it doesnt change the law. Whether its enforced is an entirely different matter which only time will tell.,UCONN,dav9ik6,2,t5_2rjvg

I was going to minor in stat and was essentially told it might be really tricky to get lucky enough to get into some of the classes for it and considering nobody cares about minors I just plan on taking what I feel like for related subjects.,UCONN,db34f2r,2,t5_2rjvg
9985894,0,t3_5ilwsk,I go through the notes and use the study guide as a way to know what I should be focusing on and have been successful thus far. That said there are only  hours left until the exam so I would mainly use the study guides if you havent started looking over material yet. ,UCONN,db96uok,1,t5_2rjvg
10230325,0,t1_dbudauj,I cant really say much since Im only  semesters in. However from my interviews thus far its a little eh. The things you learn in class arent what companies are looking for they expect you to know it. They ask Qs like how would you use that knowledge to do some task.For problem solving skills its basically more or less just getting used to tackling new problems and figuring out your own mindset on how to overcome the assignments. For CSE we had to code our own versions of a simulation and such so its not far off from what youd expect a job interviewer may want to know youre able of doing such.,UCONN,dc3nxpv,1,t5_2rjvg
10449626,0,t3_5plgd3,Itll depend on your TA I had this dude with long red hair. he was kind of an asshole especially if you dont participate but if you do then hes VERY helpful. and by that I mean hes going to give you the best summarized notes of the lecture which will make studying much easier and more efficient.  bloomfields lectures are all over the place so the TA discussions help you pull out whats important from that,UCONN,dcsk7lf,1,t5_2rjvg

10950775,0,t3_5wdiub,I just got into the UCONN Stamford regional school so I can give some insight. From Junior years because first two years were pretty bad Junior  GPA  H  CP  A and the rest were unranked.  coursesSenior Cant tell GPA  UCONN ECE courses  AP  HZ  CP rest unranked.   courses Other activities Robotics senior year.SAT ACT UnknownThat should hopefully give you a rough idea of how difficult it might be to get into a campus.

10994639,0,t1_decs0c9,Yeah I fully agree that if its an errorfilled assignment that can leave a nasty taste in your mouth. But for me at least yes there were a few errors were only human but it wasnt the type sent at pm yknow?I should emphasize that again I came in with background knowledge in CS. Literally everything that was taught to us I was familiar with so I cant speak entirely fairly on the subject in comparison to someone who came in with no background yknow?,UCONN,dee7hvs,1,t5_2rjvg
10995432,0,t1_de7cye8,A lot of schools around CT have whats called ECE Early College Experience classes which you can take for credit. I took a few in high school they count as actual UConn courses and not AP classes so your grade transfers as well and factors into your GPA,UCONN,deeaqls,9,t5_2rjvg

I believe you pick Rutgers over Hartford Campus but if you can call admissions and somehow get yourself on the main campus itll come down to personal opinion and how each school is for your specific majorinterests,UCONN,dewyl1t,5,t5_2rjvg
