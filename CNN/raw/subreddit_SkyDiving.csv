38450,0,t1_ceedio0,Before doing any of this clear with an Instructor at your DZ and let every one know Pilot and DZ that you are pulling high. The pilot might just acknowledge or tell you its ok but only fly in a certain area. Always clear with the DZ.Deploy at K ftBreak with your toggles till you collapse the canopy. By collapse I mean collapse its scary but youll know where is when this happens. Then do the same with your risers. When it collapses dont put your hands super fast all the way up try to do it steadily or you could induce an helicopter or nasty twists. Which is why you should practice this at  ft in case you have to cutaway also keep an eye all the time on your canopy to see how it deforms. After this I repeated it as someone recommended with my eyes closed. Even scarier but youll notice how the first time you will put your hands up thinking its collapsing when you are actually halfway. After that break with toggles just before it collapses This time you dont want it to collapse Well call this  Breaks. In  breaks check how much altitude you loose as well as the terrain you cover then check with  breaks and   . Repeat with risers.Again with  breaks make turns by moving your wrists check how much altitude you loose and how it feels. Same thing on    and  breaks. Remember to check for traffic youre way higher than everyone else but you never know plus it helps building good habits. Repeat with risers.Other helpful things to train is when you open do not unstow your toggles and fly with risers Fly not land. Helpful in an emergency. You can also while above ft and carefully unstow one toggle So one is still stowed and see how much control you have. Be very careful with this one and keep your hand in the unstowed toggle. This is helpful in case one of them gets loose when you deploy and goes crazy or when one toggle gets stuck This happens with old gear specially rented. Some people arent prepared on how to handle this when it happens and freak out. So practicing at a safe altitude and with the right mindset will help you be better prepared.gt Some of the things youll learn. How your canopy actually performs how far you can take it Youll be surprised how much terrain you can cover with  breaks or how smooth and flat you can turn with rear risers and how smooth turns can be made without loosing too much altitude. This helps when you miss the LZ and in emergencies.As far as landing goes after deploying AND ALWAYS LOOKING AROUND AND DOWN FOR TRAFFIC fly parallel of the landing zone and see how fast you move in relation to the ground. Turn  and check again. Then fly across and do the same. That will give you a good idea about where the wind is pulling you and how fast so you know where you want to start your pattern and how far you want to take it before making the final.You should do this above ft within the area that DZ has assigned. If in doubt ask.gt Seriously look around and down for traffic. People forget to look under them and just check over and around. But when you turn you loose altitude and you go DOWN. So check around over and under you.You can also try landing with breaks at  for example but be ready to modify your landing pattern since youll fly further break faster as well as doing a PLF. Again check with an instructor for recommendations.The most important thing for accuracy is using the same canopy on every single jump. If youre renting that may not be so easy which is why its a good idea to have your own rig. Renting or not the thing to keep in mind is use the same one over and over again.All in all that should build your knowledge and confidence under canopy make you a safer skydiver and have better landing.And I cant stress enough to look around over and under and to clear with the DZ and an Instructor before you do any of the mentioned thingsBlue Skies brother!,SkyDiving,ceit47a,1,t5_2rkgw

1053433,0,t1_chn8x56,First I dont know how soon you expect to finish the AFF program but judging length of time is extremely hard to do. There are so many factors to consider like weather ability and cost. I have seen students complete AFF in a matter of days and I have seen others take months. As for packing I believe a basic course is covered with the program. Even so there is a large funjumper community at Start with plenty of people willing to help you learn basic things like packing. I commonly give others pointers and have never charged a dime. Just last weekend I sat with a student and walked them through their entire pack job for the cost of a beer at the end of the day. This funjumper community kind of touches back on what droznig said before me. Check what aircraft the drop zone is running. Larger aircraft do usually mean better facilities and better quality instructors. At my drop zone we have two caravans which run pretty much all day on a good weather weekend. This means you will have more opportunities to jump and will spend much less time on the ground waiting for a seat on the plane. We have dedicated classrooms large indoor packing mats showers bathrooms camp grounds etc.To keep things simple try to remember that learning to skydive is more about doing it the right than about doing it quickly or cheaply. Its a serious sport with serious repercussions for cutting corners.  I encourage you to take some time and visit both drop zones. Meet the people there and ask questions. I would be happy to show you around Start Skydiving and answer any question I have the knowledge and experience to answer I am a coach and not an AFFI yet. I will be at the drop zone all weekend this coming weekend. PM me if your interested in coming over to Middletown. ,SkyDiving,cho13c4,2,t5_2rkgw

I understand the pros and cons for AADs.  I know a lot of people believe that if you wouldnt do the dive without an AAD then you shouldnt do the dive at all.  I think that way of thinking is becoming more obsolete with the changes that are occurring very rapidly in our sport.  I still believe if someone doesnt want to jump an AAD then thats their decision to make.

5488240,0,t3_3q6ur7,To answer the question which relates to how hard is it to learn the control needed to skydive in a stable position and how this would compare to what the OP watched in the attached gif. This explanation discounts any and all skills required to open fly and land a Parachute as well as any emergency drills.Nearly all people who learn to skydive will manage to learn the basic control required to fly stable on their belly in under  jumps most in under . This is achieved by having  instructors who jump with you and will hold onto you and help you remain stable whilst you learn. The first few jumps can be a extreme sensory overload which in itself will send most people into a spin and out of control. What you watched here is called Dynamic flying and specifically in this case  Way Dynamic or WD as there are  people. This type of flying at this level can only really be learnt in a vertical wind tunnel and takes upwards of about  hours to learn most of the moves you seen in the clip. The individuals in the clip have many s of hours practice.These skills that are learnt in the tunnel can be transitioned to the SkyTLDR Jumping out of a plane with no prior experience or guidance would most likely result in you falling out of control in a spin. The spinning and overall sensory overload of the situation would prevent you from recovering and safely deploying you parachute.

6943860,0,t3_4agzne,Got about a half dozen jumps out of one at Carolinafest in  when they were experimenting with it and looking to replace their Grand Caravan.  From a pilots perspective it looked to be a wet dream compared to other jump planes with its G cockpit.  As a jumper the door was plenty big there was enough room on the inside but goddamn was the door noisy and did it take a while to climb to altitude.  By the door being noisy I mean that it was as annoying as a PACs door but even louder and more highpitched and it was like that the ENTIRE ride to altitude.  Hopefully theyve changedmodified it so its better now.By slow I mean that Quest promises min turns on their website but it was probably more along the lines of min.

10239181,0,t3_5mkh3a,I think it really comes down to the particular DZ and your girlfriends personality. I think a lot of people get into the sport for the skydiving but stick around for the friends they make. Very tight bonds form in this sport more so at some DZs than others. Those bonds form through very intense shared experiences where we help each other hone our skills and have some of the wildest fun we know how to have. Theres nothing like it.Socially hanging out with other skydivers can be much different than with folks not in the sport. Not all groups and DZs are this way but when skydivers are together the topics of conversation tend to revolve around skydiving. To a nonskydiver hearing about all this stuff might be intimidating or make them feel excluded.For your girlfriend it could be a huge range of reasons. She might feel like if youre there hanging out shell have to constantly explain things on the side and that it would be too distracting. She might think youll feel excluded if you come and hang out. Its also a maledominated sport and a lot of skydivers can come off as pretty crude so she might just want to spare you from seeing guys openly flirting with her in front of you or making comments that you might take as grounds for a fight in a lot of other circles. Maybe shes only dated skydivers since she got into the sport and isnt quite sure how to mix the two worlds. Or she may just want to keep some parts of her life separate from one another.Could be other shitty reasons too. I wont lie and say that whatever doubts and worries are going through your mind arent possible or that youre worrying over nothing. Really you just need to talk more to her and get her to open up a little more about whats going on. It might go a long way to see about doing a tandem and hanging around for beers after to let you see for yourself. Figure out what you need from her to drop your worries and trust her.,SkyDiving,dc4o2oq,3,t5_2rkgw

Thats why we train new students incessantly on the ground so that muscle memory will have a chance to kick in.That being said bad arch is very common the first jumps.

11462652,0,t1_dfv9df8,This is the most simplified list I could come up with. Forget everything you think you know about the sport.. Go to the DropZone Locator and find the closest one to you.. Call them and ask what training methods they have or visit their website. Some may require you to do a tandem first others will get you right into their program whether it be APF AFF IAD etc.. Book it and go have the time of your life. Be a sponge listen to your instructors and ask questions. Be safe!The starting point is to just go and jump. Get out there and do it. See if you love it or hate it. Thats the first step. A tandem is quickest and easiest path to experiencing it for the first time. Some places will let you take a FJC and get right into the student progression so thats up to you. For your first time though I do recommend tandem as your first jump could cause sensory overload and you wont remember as much as you think you will. Get that out of the way and then start doing the real progression. Tandem does count towards your  needed for a license anyway.,SkyDiving,dfva92c,7,t5_2rkgw
