However studies show that a focus on diversity from large and small companies results in higher net revenues and a competitive advantage over other tech companies. The national and local tech communities have realized that while there is no specific intention to keep communities of URM out of executive level roles in corporations there is a severe lack of fostering and cultivating that talent to foster the minority pipeline in education to employment and to help them rise to the top and become leaders in their fields. Corporations like Intel are now focusing on diversity and investing millions of dollars to address the issue and are hoping to lead and influence other companies of all sizes to follow suit.Join panel moderator Ruben Cantu Executive Director of AustinSocialGood and panelists as they showcase new initiatives that Austin leaders are employing to address the issue of diversity in tech.,AustinRecruiter,d50fwhw,1,t5_3av60
