Im looking at you GirlsI think the season is  episodes. It is on Imdb though Wikipedia only lists .,UnREALtv,ct2nhmc,3,t5_38i7s

4607276,0,t1_ctb69sf,Something to blackmail Chet with I assume but I have no idea what. What would be so damaging to his reputation?,UnREALtv,ctbbxog,5,t5_38i7s
7144828,0,t1_d1psb2q,We need to start a twitter campaign to get that dog into Faiths spinoff or something PEDIT I also wanted to add it makes NO sense that Chet is holding an adorable dog at all times. Whats behind that choice? Is it just to reinforce this idea that Chet isnt really working that much and hes just goofing off with his weed and his puppies?,UnREALtv,d1qaibv,1,t5_38i7s
8021576,0,t1_d4hnpj5,Like obviously Rachel and Coleman were gonna get together but I also wish they waited or teased us more like with Adam,UnREALtv,d4hp8fq,6,t5_38i7s
8185957,0,t1_d50lkib,I thought what Coleman did to Jeremy was kind of juvenile but I didnt see it as harming Rachel. Interesting to see how his character plays out.,UnREALtv,d50snb3,9,t5_38i7s
8191385,0,t1_d503xjj,I wasnt confused  I think yes they were using those clips to explain Jeremys anger  but gosh I miss Adam!,UnREALtv,d51h3i5,6,t5_38i7s
8330725,0,t3_4thlye,The most important bit of this episode was hot Rachel meeting up Jeremy and showing that she started voice recording. My theory is that hot Rachel is an undercover journalist of some sort and she is actually in collaboration with Coleman to uncover the secrets of the show and make a documentary out of it. I thought of it this because I dont understand why they kept bringing up Colemans outstanding work Adam is always a hot distraction though... what was i saying again? hahaha!,UnREALtv,d5iw9ky,5,t5_38i7s
8334990,0,t1_d5ii0aw,What disclaimer? I streamed the episode so I saw nothing. ,UnREALtv,d5jfft7,2,t5_38i7s
8395765,0,t1_d5r09no,Agreed. Id prefer if the Yael story and even Coleman working with her was introduced earlier so it didnt painfully coincide with Rachels inevitable breakdown. Also Colemans obviously still cooking something but his POV doesnt seem strong enough for Yael to win at this point. It really seems like Yael isnt in a place in the game to win on her own but winning is what she wantsneeds for her story but if Coleman tries to blackmail the show for Yael to win everything will go down in flames anyway ie Make Yael win and this info will stay under wraps Yael wins and writes the story anyway. Not gonna lie though I would be incredibly okay with that level of doublecrossing going on YaelColemanRachel vs QuinnEverlasting.,UnREALtv,d5r0n5i,4,t5_38i7s
8472705,0,t3_4vp2ia,I dont like it when Rachel  and Quinn are fighting ,UnREALtv,d60mnuw,4,t5_38i7s
8475106,0,t1_d60nk06,The incident itself wasnt more horrifying to me but Quinns reaction was. I know shes always kind of crassvicious when producing but somehow tonight it wasnt amusing to me it was just kinda gross. Obviously I am in the minority on that though.,UnREALtv,d60xhdl,12,t5_38i7s
8491441,0,t3_4vzi9i,S had fleshed out characters. You had people like Anna Faith and Mary all with existing lives that made them more complex and real than your typical Bachelor contestant. That is nonexistent in S with the exception with Ruby. In S the contestants are completely two dimensional and slut shame and do shitty things to one another that there isnt anyone to root for.In S you cared about who Adam was going to pick and you also cared about Adam himself who was fleshed out as well. No one gives a damn who will win Darius heart because everyones so shallow. For all this talk about S focusing on race the writers really dropped the ball with the black characters and their stories. Darius couldnt be any less interesting and bland. No character in S is developed beyond the stereotype theyre playing. How the hell did the black cop get so far in the competition? We barely knew who she was and somehow she got further than the far more interesting Ruby?On top of that there are so many storylines thrown in S that everything seems insubstantial. First you have Chet taking Everlasting back and Quinn and Rachel teaming up to take him down which in itself could have been a good story for S but noooooo. By episode  this new character Coleman comes in which was also a potentially interesting storyline for the season. Then all of a sudden you have Rachel trying to backstab Quinn and then her teaming up with Coleman and Quinn teaming with Chet to take Rachel down and now we have this batshit insane thing about Darius cousin getting shot by the cops and Yael being a journalist WHAT? and her teaming up with Coleman to expose Everlasting and Rachel being raped as a kid  and lets not forget physically assaulted by Jeremy  and Quinn wanting a baby  SINCE WHEN?  and now wait she cant have a baby and WHAT IS GOING ON HERE? Its drama for the sake of drama instead of having the story evolve naturally and organically as it did in S which basically focused on Rachel and Quinns relationship as they manipulate the show IN THAT ENTIRE SEASON.Even Sarah Shapiro admitted in an interview that theyre burning through so much story for S and that they may slow it down in the next season with Ss pacing. So basically all the things that made S good is nowhere to be seen in S except for the strong performances by Shiri Appleby and Constance Zimmer because admit it they are damn good in their roles.Ill leave you with a quote from an article that sums it up perfectly When everything is shocking nothing is and when nothing is properly set up everything feels flimsy. It feels like someone looked at Marys death last season  probably that years shakiest moment  and decided Okay thats our show. You can read the rest of it here ,UnREALtv,d62z8mt,35,t5_38i7s

8548096,0,t1_d69u5hg,that whole jeremy thing felt like a  episode arc pushed into  minutes of an episode. goes from depressed despising rachel striking her to hes cool with her now doesnt take rachels rejection badly and shes cool with the dude who assaulted her. such a mess,UnREALtv,d6a310r,5,t5_38i7s
