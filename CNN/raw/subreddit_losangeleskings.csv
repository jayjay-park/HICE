514496,0,t3_200lcc,One thing to think about is all of these amazing players that come to our team really suffer offensively during the transition. Media was saying that we needed a pure goal scorer that didnt have to worry about our defensive system but what the fuck do they know? The system takes quite a bit of a learning curve to handle. Thats why pancakes went from top scorer in EDM to team slug Richards from C to send backup! Even Carter couldnt score initially but hes our goto guy now. Gabbo will figure it out but for now hes a good distraction that other teams can worry about just like  years ago.,losangeleskings,cfyr27d,5,t5_2rffj

If the lines shake out to be similar to what they were this postseason Richards . is a bad contract for a rd line player assuming he doesnt crack the top  lines again. A trade could be the best option in this scenario.    Stupid idea if Muzzin doesnt progress into a mil player trade Richards  Muzzin or Voynov for a  million dollar defender. Roll Doughy  this guy  minutes a night each in the post season similar to how Anaheim had Niedermayer and Pronger and the total cap hit would be less than Richards  Muzzin. ,losangeleskings,cia7rqd,1,t5_2rffj

I see him leaving.Stoll may give us a good deal to retire in LA. I dont imagine more than .m AAV until we say goodbye.Regehr unfortuntaely will probably go as well.McNabb has fit soundly into out lineup to fill the Regehr void.I see Martinez being offered a contract but who knows if he accepts. Like Williams his highlights have helped him command a very good payday one we may not be willing to afford.The LA Kings complexion may look very different especially on D by next year.

2807976,0,t1_cnn8unu,Seriously before I get in trouble for that that is seriously my response. Just .If youre a long time Kings fan long time fan of hockey and youre just generally aware of hockey and rivalries and that is it a game in which fans want to see every other team lose to their favorite one...Im pretty sure you can hear this happen in other stadiums from other teams too there were lots of Beat LA chants in the playoffs last season nobody found it classes. There are far more vulgar things that could be said and done too.It isnt so different than any other home crowd booing the visiting team though imo if that might put it in better perspective than specific chantings. Funnily this is something that recentlyish came up on rhockey too. It was like some kind of major hissy fit by a lot of people who felt the need to find something to whine about.But of course while I disagree you likely arent alone in this thought but again as someone who doesnt see it any different than your typical booing I have a hard time seeing what exactly about it is so awful.,losangeleskings,cnn9bbw,6,t5_2rffj
2823722,0,t1_cnp186m,I was thinking about this after the last game and I wonder if part of last seasons success was having Quick out for that stretch. Sort of taking out the safety net forcing the defense to play better and having them get used to playing that way. I wonder if giving Jones a few starts for a little while could help the D get into a groove play tighter and get used to not leaving the goalie to bail them out as much?,losangeleskings,cnp1ukp,3,t5_2rffj

2882620,0,t3_2t2gdk,I feel like theyve gone downhill since the whole Slava thing went down. We have the worst puck luck. How many pucks have gone in off of our players?

3981257,0,t3_361bpr,Holy shit this is way off base on so many levels.  First off I am glad that you have intimate knowledge as to what happened in the Voynov residence for you to call him a wife beater.  Second off I am confused how you came up with the rds contract over  years unless there is a part of the CBA I missed I do not think that is possible.  The buyout is spread over twice the length of the remaining contract in this case it would be  years.  It isnt spread equally though the CBA had buyout variables put in place to punish teams who signed cap diving contracts.  That means that we will have almost  mm in dead cap space for  years in .  There is no way that ODonnell would have been captain he was  and had just returned to the Kings.  Maybe Handzus if you were looking for a vet but even then I just dont see it.  As for Kopitar at captain I have watched him disappear for a  game stretch every single year he has been in the league.  He is amazing but at least with Brown he is giving the same energy game in and game out.  Brown has had some down years but that also correlates with him getting rd line ice time.  He is a former  goal scorer who will be put back on the first line this year with Kopi and will be given an opportunity to get some of his numbers back.  What free agents do you see coming up that we could use that cap space on?  Have you seen this years selection?  Maybe he does get traded but this seems very reactionary and I dont think you want to see this Kings core without Brown Williams Stoll Regher all in  year.  Part of what made the team special was the solid leadership and we are losing a lot of that this season might as well rebuild if we end up losing more.,losangeleskings,cra3iib,8,t5_2rffj

Take it with a grain of Habs fans tears but I think your roster is good as is. Quick is elite Berube should be a capable backup your defensive corps is still solid lead by Doughty whose the best Dman in the game right now imo and your forward corps is mean. Im actually a fan of how Lombardi kinda doubled down on building his team like a tank. Its weird how some people seem to be saying they think you wont be right back at it. Your team might end up just going like a wrecking ball through the other finesse teams especially when it comes to playoff hockey.

In fact we have a great opportunity to seize the first seed in the West and draw Colorado or Minnesota who would give us a much lighter series than Nashville. Were two points back of Dallas with two games in hand. Win both and were solidly the top team in the West. And Nashville is not budging from that top WC seed.

Because they were all one year cheap contracts that we can easily use to create competition with our kids and we arent tied down to them going into the next few years where we need to sign our actual key players.

He didnt mention all the new guys on blue line trying to learn or the fact we had to claw to even stay in the race with a backup after Quick was out for the season. Because these factors are out of GM and coach control. But he was happy to rag on DL for the Gabbo and Brown contracts. Dont get me wrong I dont like the contracts either but they dont encumber us so much that we can never make the playoffs until they expire.I dont buy the doom and gloom tales. Given the uncontrollable situation we still made some fuckin lemonade. ,losangeleskings,df8jns9,10,t5_2rffj
11278923,0,t3_60xvwo,Sounds like the organization is throwing in the towel. Not that I wont be glad to see him in the lineup just dont think it would happen if management thought we actually had a chance at the playoffs or unless someone was injured.,losangeleskings,dfag6x5,3,t5_2rffj

11295565,0,t1_dfcbgra,Yeah there a few goals where the celebration is already over and hes still describing the play that led to the goal. ,losangeleskings,dfcc3o7,6,t5_2rffj
11307506,0,t1_dfcbgra,I thought hes more of a color analyst than a PxP. Last night atleast in the first period he tried to be both. Hes used to radio where you have to paint the picture with more words to the listener. On tv we see the picture you just gotta guide us through the play. I thought he was talking to much and describing the play like we couldnt see it with our eyes. Weve been spoiled with bob for so many years no one is gonna be as good as him. I think this year ralph has been the best. Rosen didnt do it for me. I wonder when they will make an announcement about the future of the PxP. Id vote for nick then ralph.,losangeleskings,dfdot3a,2,t5_2rffj

11547751,0,t1_dg4pm0c,The guy couldnt motivate a selke winner with a m contract and a newly adorned C that has led his team in scoring ever since year  of his career. If you cant do that as a coach you need to go. His system tied a weight around the necks of goal scorers like Kopi Gabo and Toffoli. ,losangeleskings,dg4xutl,10,t5_2rffj

11693149,0,t1_dglfjw3,I remember that. There was speculation but I dont think it was anything. He does this weird thing on the ice where he gets all serious and refuses to smile about anything. He did it today on that goal. If you watch the highlight he refuses to even crack the slightest grin. It almost looks like hes pissed off when he does it but I think he just doesnt handle attention well.I said years ago he should have been made cap. I really believe that would have been a great move. But oh well.,losangeleskings,dglfqbk,8,t5_2rffj
11710877,0,t1_dgnfypr,Technically it may be a good strategy but its really lame and kind of chickenshit honestly... and now we will have to deal with them for years to come.

I dont know which roll it is though because I have about  exposed rolls in my drawers just waiting to be developed! What ISO is this?

11728142,0,t1_dgpeobt,Tbh though I think finding an elite center is harder than finding an elite defenseman. The thing is I think all three players at their best are top three in their position. So a replacement would almost most definitely be a downgrade.,losangeleskings,dgpeyux,5,t5_2rffj
