9570088,0,t3_5bytb5,On both sides of liberal America right now people are angry  they are throwing around blame and looking for someone to take the brunt of their anger.I wont tell anyone to stop  at least not yet.Millions of people are frightened this morning  and this is part of the grieving and mourning process.But some time soon we need stop this.If we didnt know it before yesterday and before the last  months  we all have more in common than we have apart.We bicker about the best way to provide health care. The best way to improve our schools to help the lower class and to bolster the middle class.We must continue to discuss those issues but some time soon we need to stop bickering and blaming one another. We need to start very soon figuring out how to undue this and how to minimize the damage this man can do to the country.And before anyone asks  Im having this same conversation with my DNC friends as well. Both sides need to unify before we go back to the polls  otherwise this will be the new norm.,shoudvebeenbernie,d9spigv,1,t5_3hgjh

9571146,0,t3_5byvue,Bernie didnt have what it takes to take down the DNC establishment in Primary. Whereas Trump took down BOTH the RNC and DNC in Primary and in the final election. Bernie made a deal with HRC to be a controlled opposition only to break the deal and came out to be the hero to take down the establishment because this was his only chance. Then after he lost the primary he made a deal with Hilary again to endorse Hilary. So there you see the character and flip flop nature of Bernie. IMO Bernie is just as opportunistic as Trump but Trump executed it MUCH better. ,shoudvebeenbernie,d9su7l4,1,t5_3hgjh
