1478624,0,t1_cj1l7w9,I definitely agree with this being one of Dylans best but my favorite of his has to be Bringing It All Back Home. Its not my favorite of  but I always go back to it. It has a great combination of folk and rock songs. I think this album has some of Dylans best vocal melodies with Love Minus Zero Mr. Tambourine Man Its All Right Ma and She Belongs to Me. ,rockheads,cj1mdwa,1,t5_32dw2
