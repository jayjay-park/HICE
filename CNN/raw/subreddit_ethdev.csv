9473793,0,t1_d9gqkgg,I finally got around to experimenting last night on Morden so yeah.  Figured out that you just need to include the abstract functions pretty much everything except the actual internals.  So if you include something like    contract Token         function transferaddress to uint value returns bool success    above your contract then you can create Token objects in your contract as such    Token token  Tokentokenaddresshereand you can use the transfer function of the tokens to send them like    token.transferaddresshere amounthereYou can use other functions in a given token like this as well or other functions in any other contract provided you include the abstract correctly.,ethdev,d9gulcx,2,t5_39dcn
10015509,0,t3_5iv4sm,A contract cant execute itself or be executed on a schedule. It can only be executed as part of a transaction. So you wouldnt add code to your contract to for example transfer  tokens to a certain address once a day.But Ill amend that second part just a bit. A contract cannot be executed on a schedule natively in Ethereum but there are ways to do it. You could use Oraclize or Ethereum Alarm Clock to schedule a daily call to your contract but youll have to trust and likely pay a small fee for their services. Another option would be to write your own daemon maybe in Node.js using web.js to talk to your Ethereum node to call the contract daily and keep it running  on a machine you control youll need to keep enough funds in an unlocked Ethereum account to pay the gas for each call.,ethdev,dbd1skt,2,t5_39dcn

11715716,0,t1_dgnxkh2,What do you mean? What would be an example of a contract where this is the case?Thanks!,ethdev,dgo07l2,1,t5_39dcn
