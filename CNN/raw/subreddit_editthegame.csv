Maybe web is the real interface but there a few things you can do that affect gameplay from your phone.  I keep thinking in terms of a game that has realtime aspects so you might be gaining strength or sleeping or learning a skill while youre not actively playing.  That might not be where this goes.,editthegame,cnymxix,10,t5_32o11
