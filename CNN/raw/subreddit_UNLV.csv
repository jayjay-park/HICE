4357664,1,t3_3awny6,Anyone who wants the change to occur can leave the university.  This world has become too sensitive.  gtThe nickname Rebels was given to UNLV athletic teams because the school emerging from the shadow of the University of Nevada Reno in effect rebelled against its bigger and older brother to the north.,UNLV,csgubjr,0,t5_2s7rh

4914975,0,t3_3i7k9p,This happened to a class of mine a few semesters ago. The teacher was an adjunct professor and mixed the days up. Class resumed the following week. Enjoy having one less class!,UNLV,cue2j5t,1,t5_2s7rh
6033058,0,t1_cyag0od,Yeah I noticed PSC  wasnt there otherwise Id potentially recommend that covers NV not US. Thats what I took because I didnt need my US const. credit from taking AP Government in high school. Its a  credit class where you show up for  Saturdays and then youre done. I took it with Cathy Hanks and it was the easiest A Ive gotten at UNLV.Edit I made a rookie mistake in myUNLV and didnt uncheck show open classes only. You actually have tons of options in terms of classes assuming youre not taking it this semester. I see that Michael Green teaches a history class that also counts for both credits and hes a fantastic professor. If youre willing to wait next semester for a spot in his class I would do that instead.,UNLV,cyag7q3,1,t5_2s7rh
6748438,0,t1_d0hc00q,The company I work for is headquarter out of state and I work remotely. I thought about getting a new job too in addition to grad school. My major concern is that I want to make a lot of money and finance is one way to do it.,UNLV,d0hcfoa,1,t5_2s7rh
7305598,0,t3_4fg7ir,This is definitely not going to be a helpful comment sadly as I have no advice to give.... But... Whats PHYS and PhysL like? Are they difficult or a lot of work? Sorry didnt know who to ask and I saw you post this. P.s. Good luck figuring out your math situation.. Maybe online? Or online at CSN and transfer it? I have no clue if that works. Or get tutored strong rest of the semester. Sorry. Trying to help! StayPositiveEdit Sorry realized you said . Not . My bad. ,UNLV,d28lice,2,t5_2s7rh

8237704,0,t3_4s838i,Yea pretty sure youre past the deadline. I applied for nondegree seeking for the summer semester in April because my GPA was too low to enter and then once my classes at CSN were done in the Spring I applied for degreeseeking immediately in May for the fall semester and my GPA got me in. I did that because I knew the deadline was July st. Youd have to talk with Admissions to find out if theyll let you in still. You did say you have an Associates and Im pretty sure that means instant admission but like I said youll have to talk to Admissions.,UNLV,d579ooy,3,t5_2s7rh

8529828,0,t3_4wizdl,GRE tutor here.  You can take it any time before your application deadlines.   Check with the grad school you are applying to find out the deadline.   The scores are only valid for two years so dont take it too early.You might hear rumors that if I take it in x month Ill get a better score because there is fewer people taking it at that time.   This rumor is bull.  Take the test when you feel you are prepared and are confident.The content of the GRE is similar to the SAT only they layer more concepts onto a single problem and they ask questions in a different way than on the SAT.  The vocabulary on the verbal section can be daunting.  Get yourself some flashcards and a list of GRE vocab and start studying that now.  You will be glad you did when you take the test.,UNLV,d67sj8v,1,t5_2s7rh

10028792,0,t1_dberix5,Thanks for the reply. How long did you do the English major?? Im worried Ill have excess credits and lose financial aid. Not too sure about this yet as Ive not seen an advisor about it so far.. ,UNLV,dbes2e3,1,t5_2s7rh
10191127,0,t1_dbz6zen,I was in a rush when typing it. I thought that it was kind of clear but thats probably because i know whats going onrereading the post now... it is really confusing....plus my grammar is super bad. Sorry. Anyways thanks for trying to help. Tomorrow i think ill just go to advising. Hopefully they will be able to help me sort everything out. ,UNLV,dbz7yph,1,t5_2s7rh

10358874,0,t3_5o9di9,Huh everyone here is saying that its enforced but I thought the first week it wasnt. I havent gotten a ticket Monday through Thursday the first week of the semester for a few semesters. Strange. ,UNLV,dci8m6d,2,t5_2s7rh
10737697,0,t3_5tm2zk,You know how there are some professors that your friends tell you to avoid just because they dont teach well or theyre difficult? But regardless you can still take the professor and get an A if you put your mind to it and do the work. Same with that saying. People will say that saying all the time but it does not necessarily mean that it will happen to you. You choose if you want to stay in Vegas. You can also choose to leave once you graduate. Obviously with hospitality there are a lot of opportunities here for that and UNLV does a great job to connect you and that is why it is easy to stay here in Vegas. But like i said it all is on your choice and your ability to make things work somewhere else than here. ,UNLV,ddnighq,7,t5_2s7rh
10785585,0,t1_ddsfaww,That is very fair to say very fair. Ive gone there  years and always morning classes. So my experience is much different than yours. Im also a lifer in Vegas so I do know about that part of town. ,UNLV,ddsgdrl,3,t5_2s7rh
