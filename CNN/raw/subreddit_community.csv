First Troy then Britta then Shirley meanwhile Abed is noticing the pattern and starts to think Magnitude is the center of something strange and explodes the whole thing into a huge conspiracy. Then one day Magnitude is sitting at Abeds spot and Abed immediately is like Oh shit! Darkest Timeline Magnitude! and then we hear it Bang bang.Thats where I was going with it.

I completely agree because Dan Harmon designs his episodes and its so high concept that a lot of jokes will even fly by the regular Community audience where they have to rewatch to get it.BBT is a show that makes fun of nerds for the most part. It parades them as social misfits for us to laugh at.  Since most of the population are not nerds or would not come anywhere near calling themselves nerds that sort of humor appeals to them.  But Community embraces how its different and takes pride in it.But on you Tyler Perry reference I think theres a huge market for movies when aimed at AfricanAmericans even if it is capitalizing on caricatures of characters.  It has Black actors and it has Black directors writers and staff.

He tweeted Community in response to a fan question of what show he would want to guest on Dan saw it and said Lets do this and a few days later hes on set.

223152,0,t1_cf3u7ke,I dont think that that relationship really comes into play until the character is portrayed by more than one actor. Sherlock Holmes is a great example. He has been portrayed by so many actors in film and stage So of course Sherlock Holmes exists as a character that transcends any one portrayal even in film. But people still have their preference such as Benedict Cumberbatch. But in film at least you usually only get one portrayal by one actor of any given character so by default that becomes the definitive portrayal. Thats where it differs greatly from stage in my mind. Because a stage production must have different actors in order for it to be shown in multiple places at once whereas you only need one version of a film or TV episode. So yes the episode addresses that fact and subverts it by making us think about another actress playing another Trudy in another Mad Men in another reality. ,community,cf3v1t3,0,t5_2qu49

Thats the rule of thumb anyway. As you might know Megan Ganz was hired by Dan with an Always Sunny although thats past its sellby date now. At the moment thats something like Veep Girls or The Mindy Project. But theres nothing wrong with Community as an exercise in tone and formatting while youre still in school.

231917,0,t1_cf4hnq9,That would be true if Abed wasnt talking to a character from last season. Harmon has been really loud about his displeasure of season . This show is his baby and the fact that he brought back a character he didnt even create probably means he realized he was being some what of an ass to the show runners from last season because they really did try. He must of liked the idea of Abed with Brie Larson but it didint work at that moment since Troy was still around. This is the first time this season where one of the characters are acknowledging something that happened last season so this definitley makes sense to me.  Fans already should know there is no such thing as looking into it too much with this show.  Community was created all in Harmons head so I dont think that its as far fetched as people say it is putting his thoughts out through Abeds dialogue. ,community,cf4sbr1,1,t5_2qu49

443815,0,t1_cfqk596,I think its mostly Abed having a lasting reaction to Troys departure. Along with character growth also comes character regression. Thus you have Jeff almost turning heel again in repilot Britta becoming selfconscious with her old friends and Abed becoming distant at the loss of who he was close to.It also felt like he was trying to force comradery with Hickey reaching out to the only available person to reconnect to. Im sure Abed still feels like hes falling ala the lava episode or even trapped like in season  and it seems that since he now knows what its like to have a proper best friend he desperately wants to find something like that again.,community,cfqrljn,1,t5_2qu49

587104,0,t1_cg6wb0y,Yeah I came here to say this... that scene in the cafeteria with each of them fighting the evil version of themselves was one of the worststaged scenes I had ever seen on Community. The previous paintball episodes were creative with the different shots borrowing from different actionwestern movies but that scene felt like a bad directtoDVD scifi movie  and then immediately after with Jeff and Abed talking behind the couch it switched to a bunch of shakycam stuff for no reason and just for that scene. I almost wouldve bought the episode if that whole climax wouldve been better directedwritten.  ,community,cg70ahy,5,t5_2qu49

The plot of replacing a broken treasured item immediately put a bad taste in my mouth I didnt see it from the start so I didnt get to hear Troy call out the trope.The thing that saved it was the random jump to anime when Jeff and Shirley were foosballfighting.Once I decided to just start from the Pilot and power through the whole show the first episode that really sold it for me was Contemporary American Poultry. Then of course came the first Paintball. Then in early S what really put the icing on the cake for me was Basic Rocket Science.,community,cgbtqkn,2,t5_2qu49

632186,0,t1_cgc3l15,Maybe its a little hyperbolic and we need to demand more from our show but even the almost universally reviled fourth season is better television than something like The Big Bang Theory or god help you  Broke Girls.Like we can establish different scales of quality and Community is in its own class. From my point of view at least. I have problems with the way they handle DampD its completely inaccurate but its still the best version of DampD Ive ever seen out of a sitcom handled with more love and care than the schlock we see from the competition. And thats what I think we mean when we say that Communitys better than  of whats out there. Its certainly the best in its class. No other halfhour sitcom has as much heart.

836593,0,t3_23pfm0,Best Episode Nnnngh this is hard. However since Im a mystery buff Basic Intergluteal Numismatics. Worst Episode There were a lot of stories that just went nowhere but Im gonna have to give this one to App Development amp Condiments it felt too packedtogether and I thought Jeff and Shirley didnt really need to be rivals again.Best Performance From the Greendale Seven A tie between Joel and Alison. The former was amazing in AADampD...However Alison breaks the tie with the delivery of her EVERYTHING! line.Best Performance From A Supporting Character The Dean. Full stop. He was incredible this season and I hope Jim brings it just as well in the next.Best Guest Appearance I dont know if youd call Rachel a guest or recurring character...But if not her then Walton Goggins as Mr. Stone.Worst Guest Apperance Nathan Fillion. He was so underutilized. SobsMost PoorlyUsed Character Poor Shirley. She has so much story potential but instead they decided to just recycle the Jeff Vs. Shirley storyline...Best Use of Lighting Editing and Special Effects Basic Intergluteal Numismatics it really fit the David Fincher vibe.Worst Use of Lighting Editing and Special Effects I kind of watch on a crappy old TV so the lighting in Geothermal Escapism made things WAY too dark to see what was going on at some points.Best Episode Concept Basic Intergluteal Numismatics. Once again Im a mystery fan.Worst Episode Concept Im too young to remember G.I. Joe so I dont think I can really count G.I. Jeff since I probably dont get it...So App Development amp Condiments.Funniest Moment The Knock knock floor duel between Jeff and Britta.Most Touching Moment Troys goodbye to the group. When he and Abed hugged rather than their handshake the waterworks started.Best Quote Did you hit your heads on each others heads? is my top but Britta also gets another for her making the buzzsaw sound in G.I. Jeff.Overall Season Rating  and a half. I think many of the eps were either too packed or ended too abruptly and it was a shame that Prof. Hickey got more focus that some of the study group but I have faith in the new season that Dan can improve.,community,cgzdg0c,12,t5_2qu49

If NBC made their episodes available globally online through the NBC website then they would have been able to see how global the audience is and also allow the shows ratings to get a boost.

1463624,1,t3_2axegd,Season  was the traditional Community we grew to know and love. The characters grew closer because they went through a lot as friends. Shirleys unplanned pregnancy Abeds Christmas breakdown and Pierces pill addiction made the group closer. Season  felt like the group turned into cartoon characters which the repilot addressed. Jeff became extremely insecure and cried about four times that season Britta turned into the stereotypical blonde Abed breaks down from TV schedule change ups Troy has always been the same to me Pierce became less wise and villainous to just becoming a character that doesnt know whats going on Shirley had a nice backstory as Big Cheddar and Annie learned to adapt to Troy and Abeds childish ways.

1743929,0,t3_2edswi,I think there are several levels that I dont think anyone has touched on. I dont think Jeff is an alcoholic at all. Jeff loves to drink. But only certain things. He loves scotch. Hell I love scotch. And bourbon. And whiskey. And  whisky. While I think Jeff does frequently drink to cope I think he also drinks for the flavorful enjoyment. He is never seen at least that I know of pounding back cheap beers just to get hammered. I lived with an alcoholic for awhile and he would drink anything. He had preferences but if it could get him drunk in any amount he was into that. Jeff just doesnt seem to be really that into other types of alcohol. And if I was in a cartoon world and they didnt have Woodford Reserve Id be out of there too. Also he doesnt seem to engage is destructive behavior when he drinks. Occasionally things happen but he doesnt have a DUI record that I can remember. Its never been states that he has drank to the point that he has physically hurt others. It doesnt seem to really have impacted his education or professional life. It doesnt appear to have impacted his relationships with anyone. He hasnt hurt someone to get a drink either. I really dont think there is any way to truly classify Jeff as an alcoholic. Unless you use the he drinks more than I think is normalacceptableappropriate logic. Or some people I know think if you choose liquor over beer regardless of the amount youre an alcoholic. But neither of those are accurate. And for me I dont even think he really could even be described as having a problem. ,community,cjyzfeo,6,t5_2qu49

A solution of . novocaine was used for local anaesthesia of the abdominal wall. Rogozov made a cm incision and proceeded to expose the appendix.

On the S finale commentary he sounds so incredulously happy with his choice for making Annie the burst of human passion and I think other JA fans saw only his selfdeprecating tone and missed the fact that hes as excitedhappy as we were about this conclusion. With Harmons decision for it to be Annie and his happiness over that it seems pretty clear to me that hes decided to press the trigger on the pairing so I am so hopeful about S because this can only promise GOOD things!

Dean Camp was met with interest when it came up at CommuniCon and the two returning characters from SS still not have been announced phooey tell me I need to knooow so maybe it might be a plot point in S honestly its too early to know at this point. gt Mainly since I feel that with so many of the original gone its important to find new developments for Annie Britta Abed and Jeff. I feel you on this. I really hope that all of these new cast members dont hog the screentime like Hickey did with S or that we get an extended episode order.

Ratings dropped consistently each week throughout the fifth season  just as they did in pretty much every other season.Community basically maintains just enough of an audience to allow Sony to justify keeping it alive since they seem to genuinely appreciate the shows ambition and artful integrity.I mean even syndication of Community doesnt really get the ratings it deserves. I really expected the show to take off in popularity when it went into syndication because then people could see an episode almost every day and get a proper feel for the show quicker. But that didnt happen.One bright side to it moving to a streaming service though is that now NBC cant fuck up its timeslot or have  week breaks between episodes. If Community is ever going to properly thrive its going to be a result of it proving to be a big success for Yahoo Screen.,community,cml1pl5,3,t5_2qu49

2676533,0,t3_2qo4b6,The start of a new chapter.When they released this poster with that tagline and they revealed the title of Season s premiere was Repilot I got kind of excited at the possibility that from thereon they would be treating everything after Season  as a spinoff in response to the finality of Season s finale. I thought that it would be kinda neat if they did  seasons of this Community spinoff. So what Im saying is I would definitely be fine with  seasons of Community.  might be pushing it a little because  is when things start to get stale and everyone wants to move on which I guess is realistic in a way. Its a community college people will come and go.As for Community expanding beyond the Greendale campus I think Greendale is a character in itself now. I honestly wouldnt have it any other way than it is now.Im not sure what the movie could be about but I know I want it to be a representation of what Community iswas.  years from now when theyre airing the Community movie on Comedy Central at AM I dont want people to turn it off for being too weird. I want the movie to be weird enough to please fans but normalaccessible enough to make people go back and watch the show. I want it to look and feel like Season  of Community for the first  of the movie and then I want it take a weird What the fuck happened? turn somewhere that leaves you on the edge of your seat for the rest of the film. I want the Community movie to cure cancer. I want the Community movie to bring back my greatgrandmother. Basically... I want Community to get the recognition it deserves.,community,cn7y07l,3,t5_2qu49

Grading and classification of article  Pencil sfw gtMany pencils across the world and almost all in Europe are graded on the European system using a continuum from H for hardness to B for blackness as well as F a letter arbitrarily chosen to indicate midway between HB and H. It is a persistent myth that F stands for Fine grade F pencils are no more fine or easily sharpened than any other grade. The standard writing pencil is graded HB.  According to Petroski this system might have been developed in the early th century by Brookman an English pencil maker. It used B for black and H for hard a pencils grade was described by a sequence or successive Hs or Bs such as BB and BBB for successively softer leads and HH and HHH for successively harder ones. gtInteresting Paperandpencil game | Pencil skirt | Pencil case | Pencil optics Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcntk oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecntk.

Most popular ships Ive seen have indeed been about people who could end up together in real life Jim and Pam. Ross and Rachel. Etc. And youd be shocked how many couples end up together that you wouldnt think would ever end up together. For example Jeff and Annie are basically Bradley Cooper and Suki Waterhouse. Those two are together in real life. Same age difference. Very similar personalities. Etc. As I said if you dont like romance thats fine. Millions of others do and theres nothing wrong with it. Just dont bully others for liking romance. Its a natural part of life. People falling in love is happening all around you. I dont like stories based purely on romance but if its only a subplot then I dont mind it. Adults fall in love and get married. Thats life.

They allow for actual development of characters unless key moments like a JeffAnnie revelation would be in the special episodes so they have more purpose outside of just all out fun and they feel more important and tied together in a story. After rewatching the show again the MeowMeowBeenz episode came to mind. The episode added nothing. It was a perfect episode for a  episode season but in  episodes it just didnt need to be there.

3611395,0,t1_cq3wzlc,Megan has writing credits on IMO two of the best season  episodes Cooperative Calligraphy and Intermediate Documentary Filmmaking. I remember the A.V. Club has a long article with indepth commentary by Dan on the writing process for all of the episodes in season  and he mentions that besides shifting the order of plot points around he mainly stuck with much of her dialogue which Dan doesnt do often. The little Jeffsgaydad exchange with Jeff and Britta is hers too. She seems to excel at the snappy bantery dialogue being witty and clever while also rooting it in character. I listened to her interview on the You Made It Weird podcast she has a huge brain and I have no doubt she was a huge great force in the writers room for season  and . Then again people like to blame her for the pretty poor finale of season  so who knows.I think another thing people forget or dont know is that the first  seasons had the team of Neil Goldman amp Garrett Donovan from Scrubs as writers and coexecutiveproducers. I think the first season in particular has a real Scrubs feel maybe ScrubsmeetsArrested. I remember an interview where Dan talked about how in season  NBC had told Dan that he would have ownership over the project but also seemed to imply the same thing to both the Russo Bros. directors and Goldman amp Donovan and that the first season especially was kind of a power struggle between who of those three er five would ultimately have the goods to run the show. I think by season  Dan had already begun really taking the reins. Goldman amp Donovan left after season  the Russo Bros. got busier and busier so now the show really did prove to be a Dan Harmon production.,community,cq3xbn0,14,t5_2qu49

Season  and  have been dominated by the save Greendale plotline  its weird to see them back in class just for one episode for one long joke.Itd be different if we still actually saw them all going to regular classes like biology or even discuss them. But to suddenly throw in an episode about a class an absurd one at that  which is fine in itself but needs the other normal classes to balance it out just seems a bit disengeniois and out of place considering the past two seasons focus on save Greendale.I think it kinda shows that the show has lost its path a little. It used to be hey we need to pass this class and all sorts of adventures would spring from it.

3908327,0,t1_cr1puf6,gt It makes no sense for these people to still be hanging around the college.This is a peculiar criticism. I mean the show has had at least three known paintball wars in a small community college a butt crack bandit Changnesia Koogler a community college founder who has been hanging out in a secret compartment under the school for years a chicken finger mafia a zombie breakout a glee club and a video game that you can get scanned into it and youre concerned about what theyre still there?To me the verisimilitude of Community always came from its characters who despite their quirks felt like real people. You understand their motivations. You met their families and loved ones. You saw characters grow like Abed from someone out of touch with reality to mostly in touch with reality especially in this season Jeffrey from a selfish womanizer who starts a study group to get laid to a caring and protective fatherfigure which has again been displayed this season more than usual. Even Chang has grown a lot this season. Greendale has always been a magical place full of surprises and shenanigans and you could always expect some unrealistic wackiness there but never really anything realistic. Its the characters that make Community real.,community,cr1s8mw,26,t5_2qu49

Sheldon is a very unique character but theyre turning him into a lovebug like the other  guys in the show which takes away everything Sheldon was all about.

I think you have a good rule of thumb but theres always the caveat that sometimes what the majority thinks is funny is awful. My Persian uncle has a slew of antiIndian jokes that kills at family gatherings and Im just sitting there cringing.

A lot of people on reddit are seeing what they wanted to see and trying to justify it now so in their heads Annie and Jeff end up together.   The only compelling evidence Ive heard today was that Annie was getting pretty upset about Jeffs potential wedding to someone else. Edit  I think Annie had feelings for him at one point starting as a young crush.  It MIGHT have become more but Jeff kept her at arms length due to the age difference.  So in a sense he did let her slip through his fingers.  But it seemed to me that she didnt feel that way anymore shed outgrown it.  ,community,crtcmz6,5,t5_2qu49

Even if that means fewer episodes per year and not doing them in seasons with X episodes. Even if there are say a couple episodes without Annie then a few where shes there but not Abed then Britta is gone for a few... whatever.

4354878,0,t3_3aur57,I think that any season seven would have to have Annie and Abed return. The way Annie returns is simple internship ends after ten weeks she goes home. Abeds a bit trickier. Even if the show hes currently working on is canceled why would he go back? He can just work on another show. I would also love for Shirley to come back as well. Regardless assume for the sake of this pitch that they have all returned.I think season seven would have to step away from Greendale  not completely  but it would need to explore more locations outside of school. GCC and I assume City College also is a crazy place so whats the town like? Is it just as crazy? Do the townsfolk just randomly erupt into weekend long games of Laser Tag? Or are they just normal people living their lives as normally as possible? I think season seven should be about integrating the group into the town. If Greendale is the former then the group has to reconcile with the fact that theyre the normal ones while the town does Mad Max at a k and crazy stuff like that. If its the latter then the group has to learn how to dial it back a bit which season six started them on which would in turn lead to them learning how to better integrate into society beyond Greendale Colorado. TLDR Just do what Dan wanted do after his season four. Move away from the college and integrate the group into the outside world.,community,csgj01h,2,t5_2qu49

Really takes me out of the moment and ruins some of the emotional impact of the scene. Community is usually way more concerned with editing and the little details like that.

4985571,0,t1_cum3h03,I forget the name of the episode but its the one where Jeff is running the school newspaper the MASH episode. Its also the episode with Jack Black. Jeff is very concerned about playing it cool pretending that nothing bothers him just like one of the characters in the show. Eventually Abed asks Jeff if hes ever seen the show and explains that the character Jeff plays is not always relaxed that he also takes charge of other situations or something along those lines. I think the absence of Jeff allows everybody to let their hair down because the boss is gone. ,community,cumy21g,1,t5_2qu49

Dan Harmon created one of very few shows I have seen where you forget youre watching a show where the characters and story feel real. The conversations actually sound like real conversations the scenarios while absolutely bizarre play out like youd expect those scenarios to play out. The characters are all individually loveable and most importantly its not just a comedy. The choices made behind the scenes to immerse you in the show while keeping the subtle ridiculousness of the shows world intact are all pure genius for example the soundtrack of Epidemiology. I am a huge fan of this show and everything it stands for and nothing will ever do what it did. andamovie cant come fast enough.,community,dd161tr,1,t5_2qu49

11078585,0,t1_denf0jg,gt Gillian and Donald are doing the most exciting and artistic work right out of the gateIm sorry but nothing in Gillians resume screams artistic to me. Love is basically another typical Judd Apatow romcom the likes of which we have seen a lot in the past its not even one of the top netflix shows at the moment and Dont Think Twice has very limited appeal no wonder it didnt get a wide release.Shes pretty onedimensional and most of her minor movie roles have been in crap movies.Im assuming you are a Gillian fan so may be you find her work exciting but objectively speaking nothing much stands out in her career so far apart from Community and Love  if one wants to stretch it . So you may want her to land a major acting award but so far nothing in her work screams an Oscar for me. Honestly shes a very average actress.If you look at Alisons profile on the other hand shes done diverse roles since the start of her career while showcasing a lot of range in her acting and with GLOW shes continuing in that direction. That makes me feel she has a much better chance to actually land a major acting award in the future. Plus shes a bigger and more marketable star too as weve seen her do commercials for Smirnoff and Apple her profile will only increase with potentially another successful netflix show since she has BJ Horseman already.,community,denqx2r,0,t5_2qu49

11483100,0,t1_dfxazm8,hmm that gives me food for thought.Law and order people joke with glee and relish about prison rape.by your logic The states monopoly on violence and also commitment to reform and rehabilitate would imply that prison rape would be nonexistent.This in reality is not the case. We must therefore assume that state prisons are actually apparatus of fear and coercion from  the states exclusive monopoly on violence  and  they concentrated and made into daily regimen for multiple purposes.This is likely by design to scare the bulk of the population largely poor into obedience to the power of the state as conferred by the landed titled and those with assetsBut the prospect of prison rape means that the fear and violence is spread unequally. This gives us an ethical quandary. If people are raped in prison then the prisoners doing the raping are basically rewarded for continuing the same set of antisocial behaviours inside prison as they did outside to maintain dominance within a dynamic hierarchy. this weakens the states monopoly of intimidation and violence by coopting opportunists into their regimen as adhoc unsanctioned actors enjoying an unequal experience in prison. they are basically sending rapists to a rape holiday camp. the only rational solution is for the penal system to enact a diet of daily raping for ALL prisoners equally. however we cannot have prisoners doing the raping or even the guards as that would be highly unethical to subject a certain profession or class into this inhumane practice.gentlemen is is quite clear to me that not only must the state must enact a system akin to jury duty and have the people called by mandatory lottery and have everyone report for Rapist Duty when called men and women equally.,community,dfxlvim,7,t5_2qu49
