9664917,0,t1_da3so9j,It depends on what kind of setting you want to practice in.  If you want to work in a hospital or with a maternity unit under an OB then it probably doesnt matter.  But if you want to run your own business or do home births or births in a birthing center thats not well supported at all in North America.For this reason if I wanted to go into midwifery and do outofhospital births. I would  study in the UK if I could manage it.  The practice there is well known and well accepted even if it isnt common in fact just  years ago NICE The National Institute for Health and Care recommended that women thought to have a low risk of pregnancy complications would be better served by giving birth at home or at a midwifeled unit rather than at hospital.  Can you imagine anybody in the US making that recommendation?  In my state the insurance agencies wont touch home births with a  foot pole and even birth centers are legislated into oblivion.
