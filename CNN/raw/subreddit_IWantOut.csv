Thats why I said it was a great combo CIS states dont mind and all the counties that charge a few hundred bucks to enter for all Americans dont do so for Hungarians!The reason I really like the US passport combo that said is at the end of the day I can enter virtually any country with no fuss way more than my European friends I CAN enter Russia etc on that passport btw just costs more and unlike what many Redditors think most people love to meet Americans when I travel and tell them where Im from. Plus for what I do most jobs are in the US so frankly its nice how I can accept jobs both in Europe and there with no fuss. The tax thing is annoying but you really just fill out a form each year. For me the benefits of traveling as an Americanworking there easily far outweigh that though. ,IWantOut,cegcm9u,2,t5_2r5hw

23228,0,t1_ceh2frh,For eastern Europeans and Asians specifically its not as difficult as you might think. Not in Czech Republic anyway. Firstly because Czechs dont mind paying anyone under the table for work while in other countries like Norway this is a big deal and its hard to find under the table work and secondly because they usually have a vast network of connections among other immigrants that are already in Czech Republic so they get a lot of help with visas and finding work. Its actually harder for Americans or Canadians to immigrate to Czech Republic because they miss that massive network and because they dont have such a strong fuck the law ask for illegal work mentality.,IWantOut,ceh2t3q,2,t5_2r5hw

If you havent Id really suggest going to a few cities and seeing where you like best. If you have been try Belgium. I prefer Belgium actually! Antwerp and Brugge!Okay teaching elementary at any level will definitely help with any position and having a masters each will greatly involve your chances. Without a masters I think youd need quite a bit more experience. For example the FIS has  of staff with an advanced degree. That said I checked a few of the German international schools and very few have an elementary school teacher position open.Id honestly if I were you and your husband both apply to every open position. I think you need to really consider that the likelihood of there being two open elementary school teacher positions at the same time in the same city is very difficult. However if one of you gets employed the other can come and likely supplysubstitute teach until a position does open. It doesnt have to do with being the best or most qualified it has to do with openings. From what I saw Bonn has a Grade  teacher Franconian International School has a Grade ... but not multiple openings.Youll have your best chances in Berlin where they are multiple international schools  four if I am correct though British schools are less likely to hire an American just due to qualifications. Id also if you do not have it get your certification to teach IB programmes as those seem very popular not just in Germany but in most international schools.,IWantOut,cejjvsn,1,t5_2r5hw

On a permanent basis US is more viable than Canada in terms of gun laws.  Im not sure if Canada will change its laws anytime soon not saying that but I can say that murica will never give up its guns.  As far as US goes I would look into Colorado as another person said.  It isnt snowing year round where does it? but it gets cold in winter.  What is great is you could start in one of the bigger cities in the foothills and then move up into the mountains if you truly like colder weather.  Have you lived in a cold environment before?  I grew up in Maine certainly one of our coldest states and can certainly say consistently below  for even five months is rough...That all aside Canada is a great option what I would go for personally but that is very biased as I want out myself.  Canada is even colder depending where you go and they have better healthcare than US.  This statement is again biased as Canadas healthcare is socialized like yours in Australia in US taxes go to tanks or what have you not socialized healthcare.If I were you I would attempt to see a bunch of places during your year off.  See US and Canada and explore those options one might resonate more with you.

If you study in Czech no matter your nationality or citizenship then you dont have to pay tuition.As for tutoring English Czech Republic is still one of those EU countries where you can get a work visa to teach English with a TEFL or something but the pay is poor and your standard of living will be low if thats all you do. Its excellent for students though. Especially if youre already over on a study visa so youre not forced to work legally.There is more info on studying in Czech Republic here  Note though that you should still look into other eastern European countries Slovakia Slovenia Hungary maybe even Poland I simply know most about Czech Republic because I grew up there and I still go back often to see my family and friends.As a sidenote I calculated the living costs wrong because I assumed it was for  months because I thought summer holidays dont count since you can leave and go home but the academic year is in fact considered to be  months.

602302,0,t1_cg8lv2f,I grew up there and definitely took the wilderness for granted. Its without a doubt the best part. If youre an outdoors person its a great place all year round. In terms of urban living the city is definitely dense and vibrant but there is a lack of nightlife and cultural events. In my opinion the great food and the look and feel of downtown make up for it though. Also Stanley Park being attached to downtown and the existence of actual urban beaches are big bonuses.The rain and clouds in the winter can be a real drag. However despite the cloudy reputation July and August in Vancouver are actually extremely sunny. My only gripe is that summer is basically only the months of July and August and it never gets quite hot enough for my liking. Even in the middle of the summer it never stays hot at night.Its expensive as hell but people generally get paid good wages to make up for it. Back when the minimum wage was hr I was getting paid hr in the th grade in a job that was literally handed to me. If you want work youre gonna find it. Definitely more affordable to rent than to buy a home though. The city is in the process of a transition to greater density. People cant afford entire homes anymore and so youre starting to see a lot of them being divided into several apartments and people building extra homes in their backyards. It was interesting to experience it growing up because I feel like the city is in the stages of turning into a rental market. Maybe  years down the line things will be a little better in the housing market.Basically if you love the outdoors and dont mind the weather I absolutely recommend you try and move there.,IWantOut,cg8qh3c,12,t5_2r5hw

671129,0,t3_21u6xt,First off Im going to recommend getting a working holiday visa for either Australia or NZ instead of going straight for residency or other long term visas. Its much cheaper NZ will be free for you and Australia will be around  and will allow you to spend some time in either place up to a year before deciding anything long term. Plus it will be much easier to find a job in person and this would allow you to find other parttime work while you look for a more permanent position.Even if you dont go the working holiday visa route k sounds like plenty of cash to support you as you look for a job. Australia and NZ can both be expensive but if you are even remotely careful with your money youd last a long time with k.I havent done much research with Australia but I know for NZ it is possible to apply for and receive a residency visa without a job offer but it is MUCH easier with a job offer which is obviously much easier to get in person.In NZ there is lots of construction going on in Christchurch rebuilding from the quake and theres always lots of mining jobs in Australia if you can handle the lifestyle.FYI NZ weather is NOT like PhoenixAlbuquerque,IWantOut,cggk1zm,8,t5_2r5hw

Are you prepared to spend  months of your life getting coffee filing papers and making copies knowing that there is a better than not chance you will not be offered permanent employment after the internship is over due to immigration issues? NYC is a great city but if you are timid and scared and unsure of yourself it will chew you up and spit you out. If you can handle that and want to experience it go for it.You mention Berlin too but say you need to be fluent in German to survive there. Do you mean in a work setting? Because you can get by in Berlin just fine with only English in a social setting. Another thing Berlin has going for it for you is that you are a citizen of the EU so all you would need to do is find a job. There are no immigration issues to deal with.

Ive seen people ask on this subreddit if they have a chance of coming to US after older family once had residencecitizenship but no longer have it and sadly theyre out of luck. If my parents dropped their EU citizenship before I was born id be very upset. If you wait till theyre born just get certificate of birth abroad from US consulate and boom theyre citizens and you can renounce your own. I cant tell you for certain whether if you renounce it it hurts them though. But I dont think it would. They dont have to keep a passport unless traveling to US. Going through immigration I dont know but I wouldnt be concerned about it. If they do Im sure the airport would have an escort just like when kids travel alone. Your future kids are eligible but if you renounce it before they are born no. ,IWantOut,cjm9m9n,30,t5_2r5hw

1726052,0,t1_cjsulfd,In terms of improving your French ability I would strongly recommend reading French language novels a lot. Reading is the one thing that will vastly improve your knowledge of vocabulary grammar and culture all at once and very effectively. Alongside watching French TV shows films and listening to French radio before I lived there reading is such a vital part of the process. People who are well read in English tend to speak well and come across as intelligent. This is true of foreign languages too. Repeating structures and phrases learnt via reading in conversations solidifies this knowledge. If there isnt any French literature that catches your eye then I would recommend reading a translation of one of your favourite books in English this makes the reading process easier too given that youll already know the plot. Aside from these ideas immersion into French life and culture is obviously the quickest and most effective means to improve your standard in French. This brilliant websiteidea is an excellent cheap way to travel in France if you can access a visa. I did a few of these before commencing work and they helped me no end in improving my level in French.As for the job front Im really not too sure as I wouldnt know what to specifically search in your situation.Ah the wonders of the EU.

Bulgaria is like  flat.  Compare that to  federal plus  California state tax plus . FICA SSMedicare  . in the US.  Get some actual numbers for your target country.gtI hear doing taxes for expats has become a living hell.FBAR and FATCA are two of the biggest problems.  They dont depend on where you get your money or how you get paid only whether you have more than k in a foreign bank account.  The way its counted is screwy too  its the sum of the maximum value of all your accounts.  If you put k in account  and then move it to account  then youve hit the k limit despite never actually having k.  USbased accounts dont count towards the limit and dont have to be reported since US banks already report your account info to the IRS and US Treasury.You have to file US taxes as long as youre a US citizen.  Checking nonresident instead of resident isnt any harder and getting paid in the US doesnt excuse you from FBAR and FATCA so... what are you really saving?It is possible but annoying to live mostly off USbased accounts while abroad.  For cash get the Schwab investor checking account  no ATM fees worldwide.  Be sure to also find a credit card that has no foreign transaction fees  Youll still need a local account to pay rentelectricetc but you can keep next to nothing in it and thereby avoid the FBARFATCA limits.  If youre getting paid in the US youll also either need to pay month for a SWIFT transfer or hit up the ATM a few times every month and then deposit that cash in your local bank account so you can pay rentelectricetc.Be sure to get a chipPIN card if you can for both debit and credit.,IWantOut,ck8216h,2,t5_2r5hw

2528472,0,t3_2om9a9,Ok lets go through your options.StudiesYou need money for tuition and living costs in order to study in either of these countries. If youre not willing to take up a loan or save up then this is not an option.WorkYou will not get a work visa without securing a highpaying job which isnt happening without an education. If youre not willing to get an education in an indemand field then this isnt an option.So thats basically it. I see you are considering coming over illegally but you should know that it will be pretty much impossible for you to convert to a legal status because when you try to leave the country the authorities will scan your passport see that you have overstayed and ban you. Its basically not a longterm solution.So in summary my advice would be Get a good education in an indemand field and learn the language. One without the other does not help. Nobody is going to offer you work when you have no education when there are already millions of Danes and Swedes in these countries who speak the language and dont need a work visa.Besides if youre such a language prodigy then you should be able to get a scholarship in the US no?

My SO has lived in Europe his whole life and absolutely loves the US and also wants to move there badly so thats another factor.

The company I work for Interac does a far amount of business contracts. Im not sure if you can directly apply for that position with Interac however. I was offered a contract to teach a class during my Elementary school teaching. Basically once a week I go off to a nearby city and teach for two hours to six students. Its good supplemental pay for me but I do know a few colleagues who only do business contracts and theyve both been here far longer than I have. It may be that you have to put in time with Interac doing school system teaching called ALT Assistant Language Teacher or AET Assistant English Teacher work and work your way up to only being an LC.To tell you the truth you wont learn much about the way Japanese business work when youre on the clock. You can ask your students during break times and such but theres not much to learn. In order to do anything other than teaching English youve got to have a trade skill or be heading up a branch here for some international company. Its a shame Japan doesnt have the competition based movement in the workplace as in Western nations. Most Japanese companies will not hire anyone but fresh graduates so many Japanese people work at a company for life while attempting to make the requirements for whatever their preferred promotion is my students need to pass an English test to be eligible for their next promotion for example.Id say come here if you want to experience the country and maybe have a year or two off to figure out your next move. Youll also be close to the rest of Asia where you can enjoy cheap holidays. But dont come here hoping to move up the ranks in the English teaching business or get hired by some Japanese company.

You have to compete with quite goodlooking guys who often are taller than six foot.Im quite well traveled and have been in lots of places around the world. Ill try not to rant too much I probably want to live somewhere else one day so I am somewhat biased but Norway is best described as ... small and limited. Its a homogeneous and a bit cold culture and people. Even our capital is a very small city. Our standard of living is worldclass but because were a small population there are a lot of things we dont have that people in other places take for granted. Things like interesting cultural offerings and events varied food selection in stores different organisations and clubs for specific interests subcultures in general ethnic and cultural diversity... its just way less to choose from. If you live for things like nature hiking skiing you might love it and find many people who are likeminded. But the more you deviate from the mainstream though the more you will feel like an outsider depending on how unique your interests and hobbies are.Some might disagree with me and its not that bad for most people.

Theyre both very beautiful dirty cities with extreme weather although Seattle has less pollution and rats. Seattle is very beautiful although if you are prone to depression it wouldnt be a good idea to spend a lot of time there because the weather is an emotional drain to everyone. Everything seems etherial on the th day of rain. The people are so friendly and the coffee is stellar. Sports are more important than you would think so if youre into sports like lacrosse soccer baseball or football mainly the Seahawks its great. The food is so fresh and public transport is easy to use. If you want a car traffic isnt too bad. Cons are housing prices and weather but the city is so beautiful its worth it. Youll never be bored in Seattle and its a very laidback city overall. Miami very hot and it isnt dry so the heat will seep into everything. It doesnt matter if you just stepped out of the shower youll feel sweaty. Generally the people are not as kind as in the North. Theyre polite to your face but they can be very fake and shifty. Northerners are more upfront and callous. It is very diverse though particularly for Hispanic folks. Cubans are to Miami like the Japanese are to Seattle and the culture is loud and vibrant. Wherever you go the city is beautiful. Shopping is amazing but the city is a bit expensive and traffic is terrible. On the bright side Floridas housing is so cheap right now so youll have your pick of where youd like to live. The beaches are beautiful and sandy and the water is warm unlike Seattle where theyre pretty much made out of barnacles. Theyre both wonderful places to be but weather is probably a major deciding factor.,IWantOut,cozm959,10,t5_2r5hw

In  India and China were in practice the most advanced industrial countries in the world with access to very much the same resources animals climate and so on as Europe. But Europe managed to dominate both. That shift cant be explained by geographic location or resources. Europe is notoriously poor in natural resources and couldnt support the current population on its own. I agree with almost everything in that series but it didnt try to explain why Europe went for expansion and colonization when other big powers at the time didnt do that to the same degree. In that shift IMO race played a dominant role as did religion. Both were used as excuses to explain the barbaric campaign as something beneficial to the subjected people as a civilizing mission.

I earn less than the FEIE limit and still use the foreign tax credit so that I can still contribute to my Roth IRA and as an added bonus it reduces the US tax on my interest income in US accounts to  due to the higher tax rate in the country I live in plus if I ever move back to the US I can claim excess foreign tax credits for years.  I owe the US absolutely nothing each year. About the only cases where youll be paying additional tax to the US are if  you have certain foreign investments or property or  you both earn more than the FEIE limit AND live in a country with a lower income tax rate than the US.  I think the only countries that have lower tax rates than the US are in the developing world and in these countries if youre actually earning more than the FEIE youre living extremely well already...Singapore may be one of the only exceptions.  Anyway I would recommend only remotely consider renouncing once you actually have that extremely highly paid job in Singapore plus an alternative citizenship to fall back on being stateless is no joke.  Plus get the math right before you even consider such a decision  lets say you earned kyear and only paid  to Singapore.  You would use the foreign tax credit deduct the tax you paid to Singapore and only owe the difference in tax rates to the US.  Youd still only be in the  US tax bracket so youd owe  of income which is .  Your standard deduction is  which will reduce your AGI a bit so youd owe about  with no other deductions.  Alternatively I believe you could still use the FEIE reduce your AGI to about k minus standard deduction is k in taxable US income which falls in the  bracket or .

Boulder is expensive as hell but lots of down to earth hippy types there. You dont mention what your skills are and so I cant tell you if it would be foolish to move without a job. The job market is competitive in Boulder and Denver as well as SeattlePortland. Colorado summers are hot as fuck. People will say its dry heat but  is still hot. The sun is so intense you cant leave anything in direct sunlight or it will melt. Now for the pros. Public transportation is decent in Colorado Denver Boulder areas. The people are friendly and the beer selection is out of this world. The PNW is much more beautiful than Colorado but you cant really get away from people here like you can in CO. I could go on a hike in CO and not see many people where in the Seattle and surrounding areas it is so crowded.

What I did was staying in a hostel for the first week and started to look at rooms to rent on the internet on sites like gumtree i dont remember other names but you can find them with an easy search. Try and book as many house visits as you can because most of the houses you will find will be in worst condition then showed in pictures. Find a single room for about  per week in zone  is pretty easy in my opinion I luckily found it in zone .As for the Job just put together a good Cv and bring it to shops restaurants and other places you would want to start working you dont really need an agency from your country if you dont trust them  plus  London has local job agencies too.  The first week I was there I gave out around  CVs in shops and was called back by  of them I didnt try any restaurant though.  If you are patient and smart enough youll be fine  its really not hard to find house and job in. London. However you need to keep in mind that its a very expensive city for example the the monthly ticket for busunderground cost around  the houses are not so nice and you usually share the house with  people I once share it with  people...that wasnt pleasant sometimes you might be asked to pay  months of rents in advance  as a deposit If you find a job they might pay you monthly or after the first month so youll have to be able to survive with your initial budget. ,IWantOut,cs0ezn8,3,t5_2r5hw

But that is just a VERY small part and there is so much more to see so many more countries to see. And you dont need to stay in the cities where it is over crowded full of vendors and bad traffic. Head to the regional areas where you will get to appreciate their culture uneffected by westernisation. As far as the weather goes youll get used to it. It may take a bit of time and of course there is more enjoyable weather somewhere else but its all part of the experience. Unless youve experienced a winter similar to that of the countries youve suggested I dont think it will be as easy to adapt to as you think.

There are also language assistant programmes where you help teach English and get your rent paid and pocket money I think. If you have a little bit of money saved up you can do helpex or wwoof where you volunteer for a farm or other business in return for bed and board. You can do this for a couple of weeks or much longer and can sometimes negotiate pocket money payment too.

Your mother should have a British birth certificate seeing as she was born over there.  Because of when she was born your mother is a British citizen.  Heres the cool part  British citizenship can be passed down by birth for ONE generation.  You and I were born in the same year with my mother being born  years after yours.  YOU ARE ALREADY A BRITISH CITIZEN!Heres what you need to do!. Find your mothers British birth certificate.If she has it inhouse awesome youre set.  If not you will need to contact the appropriate registry in the UK.  Some googlefu should show you where.. Get YOUR birth certificate.  Your B.C. should list your mothers name in the appropriate box.If your mother changed her name from her maiden name you MIGHT have to send in your parents marriage license to prove the name change.  I sent my parents license in just as a precaution.  No idea if they actually looked at it..Get correctly sized and staged passport photos made at a qualified shopstorefront. The requirements for UK passport photos are listed on the UK govt. passport site.. Visit Get as much information as you can.Try not to overcomplicate things.  The language is a bit odd for Americans or maybe just me and may stress you out.  Dont let it.  You are a citizen.  The folks who have commented before me are mistaken..Be prepared to pay through the nose.A UK passport is not cheap especially if applying internationally.  I think alltold I spent .This is including using DHL to ship everything out so I paid a bit of a premium.  I dont trust USPS with sensitive personal papers.. Find a reputable countersignatory.This part can cause stress due to all of the requirements listed by the govt. for one to qualify as a countersignatory.  Its actually quite simple and comes down to a difference in wording.I used my old General Manager from a previous retail job as my countersignatory and had no problem.  I think any person in good standing not a felon with at least a management level job will do.It took my passport about  weeks to arrive and that was with having to resend my declaration paper because my signature ran outside the box yeah Im an idiot.  So yeah.  Congratulations you are already a citizen of the UK and you have been since birth.  You wont be able to pass it down to YOUR children unless theyre born in the uk or you marry someone from the UK and then make babies but you should be all set.  HAVE FUN GETTING YOUR PASSPORT!If you have any questions regarding any of the steps feel free to contact me.

For example with Mechanical Engineering you could specialize on the use of ultrasound for diagnosis biomechanics studying both the human body dynamics and the mechanics of tissues fluid mechanics in respect to blood flow etc. And there is surgical equipment such as surgery robots and other mechatronic devices such as exoskeletons and so on.With Electrical Engineering you could study the several types of diagnosing equipment EMR ultrasound ct scans and some other medical devices such as pacemakers and all kind of electrical apparatus. There are also the roboticmechatronic devices I mentioned before for Mechanical Engineering.Not to extend myself much more...With Material Science you could study biocompatibility of materials Computer science there is bioinformatics Chemistry and bioprocesses are somewhat selfevident.So my advice to you is choose a general topic in biomedical engineering get a year bachelor in a larger area of engineering as is the standard in Europe and then do a year masters in biomedical engineering.

The european nanny states and Germany is one of them will cause you to rethink a little since only comparing wages without seeing the picture as a whole could be very misleading and a true comparison requires research.Why am I telling you this? Because dude youll need to think European. I guess you did some research on the finances part already so now you need to do it on the labour market part too. Youre the alien now. Not that there is anything wrong with that but you need a job visa. STEM does have exemptions so people like you are invited to come here and look for a job but generally the company should take care of that for you along with an explanation why they didnt hire somebody from Europe. If they dont thats a red flag but generally speaking the contract needs to be handed in and stamped then you get the visa and then you fly in. So there is no way they can pull the offer while youre on the plane to Germany. The concept of At Will Employment doesnt exist. They cant just let you go like that. Check out the regional employment laws and dont expect them to be similar to the ones youre used to.EDIT trial periods exist thou!  You should check if you have a fixedterm contract or a permanent contract. Note that fixedterm contracts can only be renewed a very small amount of times and after that they either give you a permanent contract or cant hire you after that. Do not be surprised if they dont renew the contract indefinitely  that would very much be against the law! Sadly there is a phenomenon where foreign workers are exploited because they dont know the laws and are willing to work in conditions without questions where others wouldnt. This happens to highly qualified persons aswell! So always talk to your union BTW I dont know where you are from exactly but the unions are probably also not what you are used to...  the engineers union will probably have an english cheat sheet for you summarizing your rights.I hope this helps!,IWantOut,cvb4vol,8,t5_2r5hw

One thought that struck me is the remark about freedom talk indeed people talk about what they miss more passionately than what they have and if a corporation mentions they value X you can be assured they are currently shafting it. One point she seems to be coming from is the idea that having covered your basic needs  such as health care and livable wages  enables choices Not the megalomaniac shop window full of things you cannot afford but rather choices that are free from crippling constraints. More than just being free from being free to  and not just technically so. Behind that she mentions the notion of a kind of social contract that she found thoroughly lacking in the US.

I also have a few friends who work at gaming companies I think a few are at ubisoft right now? and they only use English anyway. They arent able to speak a word of French.The visa is a bit of a pain in the ass. You do have the six months but you can always apply for an extension if you need more time. As long as you have health insuranceenough funds and some valid reason for staying they usually grant the extension. And when you find an employer they could sponsor you from there because youll definitely need a work permit. But make sure not to bring too much with you when you first cross the border. The border patrol might think youre trying to stay long term and can refuse to let you enter.Overall if youre moving from LA to Montreal its going to be a piece of cake. The rent prices here are a joke and the exchange rate is helping you even more and the cost of living is pretty decent. Also there are so many transientsbackpackers it will be insanely easy for you to find an apartment quickly and to leave if you feel like Montreal isnt a good fit.

I cringe reading these stories now because I did the fiance visa thing in the opposite direction when I was too young in the much earlier ages of the internet when this was still a completely weird thing.  There are much laxer financial requirements going that way but I still needed my mom to sign off for sponsorship from my end even though she didnt pay anything.  Even so I met this guy  times and in total spent a few months in person together before jumping into this which doesnt sound like a lot saying it now!.  Anyway we were married for  years most of them rather unhappily and I felt very stuck in the relationship because it was about  years before he could be a nonconditional permanent resident.  A breakup is a much more serious thing when one half of the couple has completely uprooted their life and started over again in a new country.  By that point for which most normal couples would have just broken up without having to go through the pains of legal divorce it was kind of like yeah whatever and I only finally managed to end it in my s.  Its my life and I have no idea what the alternative would have been but I cant honestly say that I dont regret what I had done with that and getting married so young.  But I also dont know what I could have told my younger self to make myself not do it!

You mentioned Austrian economics so assuming youre Austrian thatd be Wein or Zurich theres also a consulate office in Mnchen but not sure if you can do the visa process there. I do know on a student visa in the US you arent allowed to work your first year but may work the following years have several international friends who study here. I found a decent amount of information off this websiteFrom what I can make of it once you graduate you can get on an F visa which allows you to work for up to a year. From there if you have any intention on staying in the US youll need a sponsorship or find an American to marry. DEssentially the process would go like thisGraduate High School  Apply for J Student Visa gt Get into US University Study gt Senior year talk to international office about an F work visa gt Graduate gt Find a one year internship with a company you would enjoy working for and who will work with you gt Get sponsored get a work visa. gt Work until Green Card Permanent Residency. The big key here as far as staying in the US is finding a company to work with you. With most college programs here youll do handson research or internships around your senior year. Heres the big catch you want to find a company big enough that they have the resources to sponsor foreign workers it costs them money to the feds to sponsor you while at the same time having a friendly and personable human resources department that likes you. It really comes down to who you know and how well you get along with others. Intern for them your senior year and ask about working for them under an F  Trainee visa after graduation. From there if you work hard and they like you they could sponsor you and get you on a full workers visa which will eventually lead to a green card....If while studying you find a nice young American you fancy  Get married and job done!,IWantOut,cx9x62s,1,t5_2r5hw

My wife did almost all of that paperwork and it was a substantial amount. While the dogs didnt have to be quarantined upon arrival here my wife had to get a lot of paperwork signed by her vet testifying that the animals were current with all their vaccinations had microchips and other stuff. If you have questions let me know and I can ask her about it when she gets home tonite.I cant really tell you a lot about the Amsterdam housing market. I live on the Belgian border in a small farming town a bit south of Eindhoven. I can tell you that things tend to get a bit cheaper the further away you get from Amsterdam. I would ask for specifics in ramsterdam.k Euros a year is a lot of money. You will be fine if your wife doesnt work. If youre working in a technical field your lack of Dutch wont be a problem unless you want to obtain citizenship in which case you will learn it. I took a few years of German in high school and it has made learning Dutch a lot harder. The languages are so similar that I want to say everything as German. Its hard for me to pronounce my numbers as een twee drie vier vijf... because they sound so much like ein zwei drei vier funf. On the other hand the rules of grammar are very similar so it will help you put your sentences together.Im not sure exactly what your wife does. If she is a surgeon she will probably be able to find a job although not being able to speak Dutch will definitely be a hinderance in this field. If she is a bit lower down on the medical ladder it gets harder to find a job without being able to speak the language. Dutch people expect to hear Dutch when they go to the hospital or to their GP. If she is a nurse let me know. I just got my Dutch nursing license approved and I can give her some tips.Finally if I were you try and have your company set you up with an apartment somewhere. Then spend a few months trying to find out where you want to live. It will be a lot easier to make that decision when youre actually in the country.If you have more questions let me know!

Foreign earned income is income you receive for performing personal services in a foreign country. Where or how you are paid has no effect on the source of the income. For example income you receive for work done in France is income from a foreign source even if the income is paid directly to your bank account in the United States and your employer is located in New York City.If you receive a specific amount for work done in the United States you must report that amount as U.S. source income.I really dont see how you can get out of this.  Theres no magical loophole.  I live and earn wages abroad and still cant even get out of paying US tax on the  in interest income that I earn from my savings account each year.  If you can somehow make the case that its not US income then you just need to find a place with a lower tax rate than the US but places with zero tax are pretty nonexistent in the developed world.,IWantOut,d4zsn9p,1,t5_2r5hw

8346857,0,t1_d5kvih8,The only advantage that a Tier  visa gives you to stay permanently currently  as you note its difficult to rely on things staying the same is that if you graduate with a course at a Bachelors level or higher you are given  months after your course ends to stay in the UK and look for a sponsoring job and any job that sponsors you during this time does not have to perform the Resident Labour Market Test to do so. It doesnt give you any right to stay on in itself.Usually a company wanting to sponsor a Tier  visa in a nonshortage application has to perform the RLMT which means showing they advertised the job for  days and nobody applied who already has the right to work in the UK. If somebody applies who meets the minimum requirements and can legally work in the UK they will not be allowed to sponsor for that job.

8936947,0,t1_d7jwo9c,I can understand studying for something you want to do as you dont want to study for a job that will make you unhappy.However the game development industry in the Netherlands is pretty tiny from what I heard. It was specifically mentioned as one of those educations that would not get you a job at all or a job in a different sector. It certainly wont get you a work visa because they can just hire one of the unemployed locals with the same degree. The only way I can think of is if you also have an impressive and unique portfolio or career aside from that degree.I think you are able to get citizenship if you have been living for  years in the Netherlands for example on a work visa. But some political parties want to extend that to  years. Here is the website from the government about immigrationThe IND is the Immigratie en Naturalisatiedienst and there is a link to the English version on the right at the top.If you dig around in that website youll find that generally for a highly skilled migrant work visa there are minimum salary requirements. Under  you need to earn something like  euro a month which is a fairly high salary here. IT people dont make as much in Europe as they do in the US and my feeling is that will be even worse for game development at least in the Netherlands.

9510810,0,t3_5b3dv8,A few random thoughtsHow are you going to pay for this? University in Germany may be free but living there certainly isnt. I do not think that credits from a US university will transfer to a German university and therefore taking classes in the US would be a waste of time but Im sure someone who knows more on this will chime in.What are you planning on majoring in?If you have a student visa you are severely limited in the hours you can work school is your job and there is no way in hell that you can support yourself on the little hours you will be allowed to work.For an undergraduate degree you will probably need to know German. I may have read that some universities offer certain undergrad programs in English but this is something you need to verify. So your idea of learning German now is a good first step.University in Germany is very different than in the US. University in Germany is free but the expectations are also very high. If you struggled in the US youll may be worse off. ,IWantOut,d9leqsj,5,t5_2r5hw

9556798,0,t1_d9qw7iq,gt As for a masters degree consider going to Germany for grad school instead of The Netherlands. I think it will set you up for success better.Just curious but what makes you say this? Apart from the higher cost which can potentially be offset with scholarships I dont think Dutch universities are inferior in any way. OP if your goal is to move to the Netherlands and you want to do grad school going to a Dutch university would make a lot of sense. Graduation from a Dutch university or a top  university in the world gives you the right to the orientation year visa which is a  year visa which allows you the right to work in the Netherlands during that time as well as makes it easier in some ways for a company to sponsor you for a highlyskilled migrant visa after that.A bachelor  several years of experience will also increase your chances but be aware that masters degrees are pretty standard in the Netherlands so youll be at a disadvantage compared to other candidates along with the disadvantage of applying from abroad rather than from incountry.,IWantOut,d9r2ldo,1,t5_2r5hw

Its not on the radar for being a city that cool young people live in or should visit. I think all of those things actually work out to the advantage of the locals for the most part perhaps helping reduce the amount of tourists and jet set expats people who move to cool cities for a year or two live in a bubble with the other cool people help drive up rents and then on to the next cool city.

I personally know someone who almost had their visa denied due to what the lawyer said and there are countless stories on immigration websites of lawyers giving bad advice. It doesnt add any credibility to your case so my recommendation is to read through all of the requirements documents and forums and if there is still trouble find a lawyer. gtif they decline you I think there is a reasonably sized cooloff periodThere is no cooling off period. You can make another application immediately gtit reduces your chances of getting it the next timeThey will scrutinize any further application but as long as you addresscorrect any issues it will not reduce your chances unless you have lied on the application and received a ban.

So I think that would cover the remaining majority of people in this small subsection of people on temporary assignments abroad who also couldnt meet the physical presence test.  Rant time I dont know why the US government always have to make this so goddamn confusing that you have to spend hours trying to figure it out and then youre still not sure and Im certainly not defending any of it...its not rocket science that an American whos a resident for ANY period abroad should NOT have to pay for a US health plan that they cannot use and can possibly not even be enrolled in with a foreign address.  And that even if you come back to the US for some period during that for work or vacation that you should not have to have a plan if its for more than X number of days...this whole physical presence test thing is an idiotic rule in general. Im still covered by my works health insurance plan while Im abroad if its for work and I buy travel insurance for when Im there on vacation as most people who are foreign residents would. Total idiocy really. But its not quite as bad as some people are interpreting here...still it is indeed stupid.  And if I dont meet the physical presence test the year I return because I spent more than  days in the US in the previous  months then I will still just stick down C on the tax return and not pay them any goddamn noncoverage fee and if they want to come get me then they can go crosscheck it with border control records and come after me if they wish.

10424376,0,t3_5p9wts,so i dont know a lot about the working holiday visa but ive lived in HK on and off for the last decade plus and i thought i could share some insight.  gbp for a year assuming thats the time frame youre concerned with converts to roughly  hkd with todays exchange rate. im in uni and i live in highly subsidized oncampus housing and spend very little  i spend about  hkd per month on food and any other spending needs that arise. note that i pretty much have access to most amenities including study space gym cheap food no utilities bills etc. if you live very very frugally you may be able to live on what i live on but the largest expense in HK is definitely lodging. youll have to haggle hard to get a reasonable price. i know a friend of mine who hosts a tiny AirBnB room for  hkd per night.    is already well over what i spend per month so you can do your maths on that.other than lodging if you do live frugally things should be pretty affordable. a cheap meal costs around  hkd on average if you go to the right places you should be able to find meals between the    hkd price range as well. transportation could be a big expense depending on how much you travel  what prices youre used to back home but its not unreasonable. for reference to get from the outskirts end of purple line of subway to the CBD costs about  hkd and back and takes about m by subway. dont know what kind of TA job youre referring to  primary school? secondary? local school? international? research assistantship?  but those may be difficult to get without a higher degree and without a network. maybe you can look into private tutoring but that space is very competitive as well this goes for pretty much any salaried  paid post in HK. have you considered freelancing maybe writing paid blog posts? i would imagine some AirBnB hosts may be willing to arrange something with you prior to your arrival ehhh i would think that securing a job in that time frame is pretty optimistic. maybe you could provide a list of hard skills that you currently possess so myself  someone else can provide a rough benchmark on your employability.i should also mention that its illegal to work on a visitors visa im guessing thats what youd be on before you get your working holiday visa unless its strictly on the down low. even then if someone reports  finds out youre busted. if i were you i would scope out potential writingrelated freelance jobs as much as possible on the many job boards like Upwork and get a few gigs before you land here.Edit  mistyped number,IWantOut,dcpo7b5,4,t5_2r5hw

In terms of family were both very estranged so no problems there itll actually be complicated tracking them down for the visa process.

By the sounds of it you guys probably wouldnt want to be in a city like Vancouver which is good anyways cause its crazy expensive.  But I lived in Abbotsford for a while like hour from Van and loved it.  I too am not a city person and Abbotsford is a city but very much small local feel to it plus lots of opportunities in the area.  Just from personal experience I would say that would be a good place to start because even though your only about an hour away from Van you can cut your living costs in like half haha also once you get settled in a bit more and your looking for a more rural place chances are you wouldnt have to uproot everything and switch jobs and everything again because that area of BC is littered with small towns and areas that have the alone in the woods feel but are actually all quite close to each other.  And aside from all that its BC and its beautiful there and there is so much outdoor recreational stuff to do there and everyone is friendly and now im starting to wonder why I moved away hahaha...but good luck with everything!

Being a native speaker is what makes you stick out if you also have a backgrounddegree in educationteaching this makes you a pretty interesting candidate to hire. Most people end up in language schools but I feel that with your education you would be a good fit for teaching at regular schools. Just look into the regulations for teaching minors at regular schools in each country. Look also into international schools where the teaching language is English switzerland has a few.

I know theres a lot of political tension but I think its good that you are a dualcitizen and bilingual. The only thing is I think they make you renounce other citizenship to attain US citizenship and it can take a few years to get. I only suggest the US because of California Florida the keys Arizona but no beaches Im thinking of and the US Virgin Islands my first thought seeing your post. Oh and obviously Hawaii a dream place! but its so expensive to live there.Im currently invested in moving to Latin Central or South America but those are related to my future career as Im in school still. Southeast Asia is great but its a bit far from Canada. Spain and other European countries would be good ideas but theyre in Europe.If you wanna stay close to Canada I think your best bet is the US the Caribbean or something downward from there. Mexico has many expat communities and nice beaches as well. Ive also considered moving there but everyone I know thinks the cartels are too big of a safety hazard.,IWantOut,dgoqrgr,4,t5_2r5hw
