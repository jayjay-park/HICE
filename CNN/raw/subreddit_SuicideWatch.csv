1625,0,t1_ceeme0t,You most likely have a chemical imbalance in your brain depression. It really all depends on your relationship with your parents. My parents are assholes. I knew this before and nothing changed. I said I was feeling down for awhile then told them I wanted to kill myself. I think my dad said good and my mom said I was making it up. If you trust your parents it would be a good idea to bring it up because it would probably help. Its up to you though. rdepression could give you more details about depression if you wanna check it out. ,SuicideWatch,ceemga9,1,t5_2qpzs

59340,0,t3_1usao0,I have had a very shaky relationship with my parents all throughout my life and one day I saw a quote or a comment or something that said something along the lines of there is no rule that says you have to love your parents. Some people myself included at times feel that just because they birthed us they are worthy of our love regardless of the terrible things that they say and do to us and that simply isnt the case. We feel guilty because we despise them for what they have done to us mentally physically and emotionally yet we feel we should still be trying to connect with them and make them understand.

Trite go get em phrases like youve written while they are nice are not always helpfulThat being said online self diagnosis is never the best way to go about things and OP should really see a psychiatrist before assuming there is something seriously wrong with him.

If you dont want to get help for you do it for her sake.Does she know about your parents? How theyve treated you? Why youre doing the things you do? She needs to know if she doesnt already.

Ive been fired a lot of times because of this. Its really hard for me to be on the ball every day. I can do the repairs but talking to people is a challenge. Ive had to get my doctor into work to explain to my boss and co workers why I get down once or twice a month. In the past that has backfired though. Ive had bosses just use that as a way of insulting me or belittling me in front of everyone else. This sometimes spirals out of control and has me questioning my self worth.

Ill end up being hospitalized and when I get out Ill find either my apartment has been robbed or all my stuff was set out because I dont have anyone in my life to take care of my stuff while I go away like that.

345784,0,t1_cfggskd,thanks for caring enough to post here. i am amazed that complete strangers would reply like this to someone that wants to stop living. you are amazing and i admire you.i was raised in the cult of Jehovahs witnesses. half of my family will not associate with me because i am not in the church. so my experiences with organized religion have been lackluster. i have tried to join many churches in my life and i couldnt find myself in total agreement with any of them in particular. my girlfriend that left me after six years my depression has spiked since this happened was a very spiritual person and i had difficulty relating in that manner.the one person that i ever felt like i could talk to about personal life issues such as this was a philosophy professor i had before i dropped out of high school. she truly was nonjudgmental and i learned so much about my life choices and concepts that touched my soul from her.i have an appointment with a counselor on monday i really look forward to sharing my feelings with a professional.i love my life i am truly afraid of death. i want to be saved.i dont think i can believe in a god.,SuicideWatch,cfgly72,1,t5_2qpzs

356070,0,t1_cfhnu76,Honestly for me its been reading a lot of rSeductions inner game. A big core part of their philosophy is making sure that you feel confidentgood about yourself because if you dont obviously you cant expect to seduce anybody or socialize very well. Regardless of whether or not those are your intentions they are usually fairly good reads. Using the things I learned from that subreddit I picked up my first girlfriend and that boosted my confidence by a ton.Theres a lot of selfhelp material out there but whats worked for me is the whole fake it till you make it motto. It works. Its a feedback loop Act Confident gt People Like You More gt More People Like You So You Get Self Validation gt Self Validation Leads To Confidence gt People Like You More etc.Finding a hobby is good. Maybe a hobby that you can turn into a skill. I found music and I worked my ass off to learn guitar and learn how to sing well with it and now in total Ive definitely performed in front of  people total and Im very good at what I do.Its nice being able to say I am very good at what I do. That confidence that you gain from actually BEING good at something and DESERVING the confidence i.e. instead of faking it working on something until you have a right to be confident about it transfers over to other parts of your life too.If you dont have a therapist or anything along those lines to help you with this this may be a lot harder but stopping your negative thoughts when theyre about to bury you further is VERY important.Does any of this help?,SuicideWatch,cfho8rj,1,t5_2qpzs
366029,0,t3_1y9y3k,Wow that is really interesting.  Im from Virginia in the US.  Do you have a specific reason you are feeling this way?  You mentioned something about losing someone close.  Breakup?,SuicideWatch,cfipcwg,2,t5_2qpzs
367189,0,t3_1yaiw5,So I did actually read all the way through this. And I can say. There are girls that like short guys. I actually know a woman in her s who recently discovered that she thinks guys of a certain shortness are extremely hot. She is about  feet tall and she loves guys in the  range. So there is hope for dating you just have to be confident for that to come through. Which IS possible building confidence that is but if you have so much repressed abuse then the best way for you to move forward is to see a therapist and keep trying until you find one that works. That abuse gets into the back of your mind and screws up a lot of things for you which makes it difficult for you to believe in yourself. But believe me there is something there worth believing in in yourself. But youll never find it if you dont try. So think of seeing a therapist as hiring a professional outdoors man to help you explore the backcountry of your mind. You will see and learn and hear wonderful things. And one last thing try not to feel like a failure because you dont have friends or family theyre probably all screwed up in their own ways and that makes it way more difficult for people to connect. You are a great person and you will find a way out of this. I believe in you.,SuicideWatch,cfitowm,2,t5_2qpzs

394332,0,t3_1ylko1,i was just a bit younger than you the first time i attempted.  id just dropped out of college lost my girlfriend was working a job i hated to pay bills i couldnt afford and apparently had undiagnosed bipolar.  so while not exactly the same our stories arent that different.what got me out of it the first time was first reaching out to a friend and stopping myself from making the final move and second coming out the other side with a profound sense of selfimportance.  not in that im better than other people kind of way but in the im the only one who can fix me kind of way.  i stopped giving a shit about other peoples opinions.  i was alone in a world where i was the author the protagonist and the only person reading the book.  and it was very liberating.  everything i experienced and felt and wanted and needed came to me through the lens of only my own experience.  i started feeling more like myself again by being true only to my own opinions.  and i hadnt felt like myself for a long time prior to that.  it was refreshing and helped me get myself back up and out of that suicidal rut.maybe it wont be the same for you.  maybe your problems are different and cant be fixed in the same way.  but if nothing else know that youre the only one who gets to decide how your story ends and it doesnt have to end now just because this chapter sucks.  standing at the bottom of a shithole makes it seem like the whole world is just an endless encompassing mountain of shit.  but you can crawl out of it and start to see all the things youre missing again.,SuicideWatch,cflmzwk,1,t5_2qpzs

Even if I think the advice is stupid they want my life to be as good as possible or they wouldnt give me that advice.

501939,0,t1_cfwh223,I was so glad to get your note.  I actually tried to reply from work today but I was slammed and kept getting interrupted  my admin was out with a cold and I had to do her job too.  I didnt do it very well.  She may need a raise. I can appreciate what you say about people not hearing you Ive felt that way myself pretty much all my life.  For me the few people in my world who matter seem to go ahead and make all sorts of assumptions.  Its as though they decide how I should feel based on their scope of knowledge and then they apply their assumptions to me and walk away.  Theyre all so busy with their own crap and I get that.  But they never really hear me.  They have no idea how I truly feel.  I wonder if its like that for you as well.I have to take some blame for it though because I let it happen.  I get so down and so disconnected that I dont fight it I dont put up my hand and ask for help or say you dont understand.  I just feel as though theyll never get it and I dont see the point.  Im not sure thats fair of me but I have a hard time communicating when things are dark.If I were to guess I might be able to tell you a lot about yourself.  The irony is that those of us who find ourselves here those of us who feel so desperate and alone were the ones that truly understand life love loss and everything else that is connected with being human.  We feel the world around us far more deeply than the chosen ones.  I think that makes us the better half but it comes with a tax of course.  We pay it daily.For me I know that I have to forgive myself for a lot of things even if it was all very unintentional.  I have to forgive myself for fucking up relationships and for not knowing better or making choices that I wouldnt make again  for being where I am now.  Its not so easy to do and I havent succeed yet but Im working on it.  Its just another part of being in the better half  were painfully hard on ourselves.  And its why simply talking things out to anyone is a good plan.I want nothing more than to give you a recipe or a program that might lead you to the sunny shores of happiness but I dont have that.  Nobody does.  I feel better today and in fact Ive had a good week.  I think its because I told someone how I was feeling.  Ive never really done that before.  It made it seem more manageable to me once it was outside my head.  After that I started to look for any little light at all any reason at all.  And its been okay.Im likely more screwed up than you are and I have nothing to offer.  But I care about you and I want you to be okay.  That sounds really corny I know and its not like me to say it but its true.  I do care about you even though weve never met.  Were both at a fairly unique place and were both here at the same time.

589500,0,t1_cg79ybu,If it doesnt effect youre ability to function then chances are youre not addicted but just heavily reliant on it. Im the same way I started masturbating and watching porn when I was  and when youre so used to getting off that way with that visual stimulation it makes it difficult with a partner. He knows I watch porn ans knows I watch much more than him Ive done it  times in a day and like you said spent way too much time on a stupid thing that throws off my sex life. Honestly I wish I could tell you I did steps  and problem solved but I still struggle to get off with my boyfriend that part he doesnt know about and I dont want to emasculate him by telling him. But Ive made a decision to really limit myself on porn and keep sexual activity to just me ans him. When we do have sex we engage in more foreplay and oral and I have been actually enjoying it more on a sexual level than just emotional so it is definitely getting better  its almost just mind over matter Ive realized. When you go into sex not even expecting an orgasm and just letting your partner get off you dont truly let yourself enjoy it. So you might want to try these things and see if it helps you too also you shouldnt be ashamed to tell him. Just say hey I dont want to feel like Im going behind your back or anything and I feel bad because of our agreement but Ive been struggling with this  its not like youre messed up youre human and have sexual needs and if you dont get them with him youre going to appease yourself the one way thats proven to work. In the meantime try finding things you guys can do that puts the focus on you so you can find out what you enjoy may it be more foreplayoral or even try some toys think of it as a fun learning experience for both of you to enjoy.

One of my best friends had stabbed me in the back and walked away when I needed help I was questioning whether the one friend I had left was still my friend I couldnt even convince myself she should be because I didnt believe I was worth her time and I couldnt really deal with all of it. Id been borderline suicidal a few times but never as low as then Id even gotten as far down as writing a suicide note. She knew about my problems though and shed always been there when I needed someone plus shed made me promise a while back to never do anything rash I owed it to her to try to stick it out. So I told her I felt like shit I could really hear something reassuring and she ended up unknowingly talking me out of stepping off a  story roof. She gave me enough reasons to keep going and Im still here. Your situation might seem bleak and hopeless and while youve probably heard the cliche a thousand times things can get better. You said your mom cares about you take heart in the fact that you matter and are loved by someone you can get through the rest.

655516,0,t3_21nl59, m USAHave you tried a therapist? they are able to talk out your problems and concerns without prescribing medication. Suicide seems like a lot of work for such a simple result. I was borderline self admitted on my family recommendation  legally in the states they must keep you for  days after that you are generally released and hope that your medical bills will cover the expenses.I was eventually convinced not to self admit unless I felt I was a danger to myself or those around me. Mental hospitals visits are considered private and your work does not need to know you are in one... however you are required to submit a form to your employer for medical leave regarding mental health. I think the thing you should focus on is yourself. perhaps you have set expectations for yourself that have not been met? or are they unattainable? then rework your goals. Suicide does not affect you. Depression selfharm and anxiety do.Suicide affects your friends acquaintances mother father siblings extended family teachers etc. Everyone is looking out for you and you should not be afraid to ask for help if someone says they cannot help you it does not mean rejection it means they lack the skills to help.How will your mother function without you? she might go day to day onward but she will always wonder how she couldve helped. you would ruin her life. What about your father? the rock? stoic yet passionate. he too would lose purpose in life. We are glad you are here welcome to the world D. Sure it has its ups and downs but there is a lot of people here who have ups and downs too. and corn dogs. ultimately let your doctor know you are seeking professional help they are required by law to remain confidential and are paid to take care of you. most hospitals have mental health services as well but it is quicker to go through a therapist or psychologist.,SuicideWatch,cges5zz,1,t5_2qpzs

The feeling I have while all thats going on is crippling. To be honest the idea of killing myself puts me as ease. It can be over and Ive battled with this all my life. Its probably not going to be any other way for me. I was born with a disability and will hold me back in almost any situation in life. This is different than just being nervous or tongue tied. This is embarrassing its crippling its nothing but pure panic and fear anytime Im around another human being. Medications make me feel worse or no different at all Im going to be homeless in a week and I will lose everything Ive ever had. I already lost all my family pictures because of this mental disability. They put me in the hospital for a year and a half the last time I tried to kill myself.

Just hold your head high and think about how much youd rather be yourself than one of those spoiled sorostitutes who has life handed to them on a silver platter. As for feeling like you wont be able to help anyone as a therapist? You already know how to ask for help you already know what it feels like to need help. Empathizing with people who need help is half the battle so you can do that perfectly. As for going to graduate school you have more drive than I ever will. I questioned even wanting to go to college. After high school four extra years seemed like an uphill battle straight from the dungeon of some torturer. Youve once again already fought half the battle. If youre overwhelmed pull a couple irons out of the fire. Drop an unnecessary course. Take some time to relax. Go on a walk or listen to some music you like. Talk to your boyfriend. Hes there if you need him. People love to help other people out especially if they love you. If your inner voice is telling you that youre nothing dont listen to it because its not worth listening to something thats telling you stuff like that. Tune it out do something productive try extra hard on your next assignment. Ace an exam. Youre clearly able to. As for going out on weekends screw that! Not going out on weekends doesnt mean jack. It means youve got better stuff to do than get hammered and jump up and down while people play crappy dance music. Dont worry about what other people say about how you look or anything. Being different from everybody else is admirable not something you should try to avoid. Who needs to fit in? Seriously. There is so much more to focus on than trying to get accepted by a bunch of people who wont give you the time of day. They are not important. Do not give them control over your life by allowing their judgment to dictate what you do or how you feel. Youre only a burden if you think you are. Be upbeat. Exercise always helps me feel better if I feel down. Take your mind off of things. Read a book watch a movie start a TV series. You can change the way you look at your life and its not so hard once you get started and make the effort to look at life positively. The fact that youre looking for help means that you havent written yourself off yet and that you realize theres a problem. Good on ya. I wish you all the best and I know you can change your outlook. I believe in you. ,SuicideWatch,cgon4ld,1,t5_2qpzs

I can promise you that you can last through it and you should think about how many people need you to last through it too even if you dont realize it and maybe even if you havent even met them yet. Take some time to just absorb yourself in something. Something productive is great a hobby or some learning but it doesnt need to be. Ive burnt an entire week straight in bed watching a TV series.

I got fired from an abusive employer and bullied by abusive employees who are still employed. Because of my level of education it would be harmful to me if I sued to go back for it. Ill never get to be emotionally stable as assured by relatives since I was . Ill never get to be financially stable no matter what I try. Ill never be able to actually stick up for myself because when I do stick up for myself legally everyone threatens physical violence and Im not as tall or strong as most of my peers. Part of my body was messed up in childhood and I need surgery to fix it which insurance wont pay for because they consider it nonessential and nonpreventative. People just tell me to get away from an abusive household and people is to go live at a homeless shelter. Well Ive tried that and while I was on the phone to be admitted to the shelter they filled the only open bed. Im an easy target because Im fat have gynecomastia Im short have Aspergers and Tourettes. Relatives who are mentally ill refuse to get treatment. And I am left as the only person getting therapy. I am trying to fix the pain and my problems.

I live with  canines a huge black pup who just weighed in at  lbs at the vets yesterday and a dog thats  wolf and  German ShepherdHusky. I spend a lot of time walking around the mountains with them. I cannot live with other humans anymore even though Ive gotten past my fear of them for the most part. Im very empathic even though I grew up in a family in which no one else was capable of any empathy at all. Im not saying this as a form of criticism its just a fact. I was ostracized and bullied enormously as a youngster and it has taken me many years to sort out who I am. But finally Im happy! I never expected to be but I am. Thanks so much for answering. We may not have access to the conventional ways of living a happy life but we CAN create our own ways and make our lives wonderful. Dont let what others do and think limit you. At this point in the development of our species not one knows whats best or even appropriate. Not one. So each of us must find out for ourselves. Its a pain in the ass but thats how it is.

You are definitely not alone in this and Im  here for you. It might be a good idea to see what kind of professional help is available in your area. I know the cost sucks but there could possibly a service thats partially government funded. Getting a professionals perspective on your situation might be really helpful. I dont know enough about your relationship with your boyfriend to judge but him not being very good with handling or talking about emotions and problems definitely doesnt mean he doesnt love you and care about you.

Ride the bad feelings as much as you can and realise that better times are ahead.

Right now I still have some options being opiates because Ive tried all the antidepressantantianxiety or muscle relaxant. Im at the moment on fentanyl patch  mcgh. I dont feel as if I was slow or any of the antidepresant crap ive had before. Its far from being good but its a little somethingi know it wont last.  Like you I dont have a job and couldnt even if I wanted to. Ive been disabled for  years now. The money I make is really bad. I cant even eat enough or  buy new clothes. I dont have a car and I wouldnt be able to afford one. Im slowly going towards the idea of just ending it. No more painmy pain is  on a scale of  with fentanyl.  no more weaknesstiredness and sooooo much more. In the past ive tried suicide years ago and failed. But it was more a cry for help. Now that I know theres nothing i can do and that the doctorshospital cant help me Im heading towards suicide. I too have hatred in the hospitaldoctors. So many of them didnt listen and some still dont its disgusting. Just thinking that people in pain are left all alone to deal with this crap makes me sick. I dont even go to the hospital when I cant even walk anymore cause I know they cant do shit about it. I dont even see my parents anymore. I have my nephew whos  that comes to visit me but thats all. My friend dont call often and some dont even invite me anymore. Im rambling but all in all I think you are stronger than me and that should try opiates before opting out. Ask for fentanyl. A patch that last  days and is active hours a day. It might help you a little and if you are like me wont mess around with your head too much. I know Im suppose to say that time will heal things but since I know what you are feelingor close to.  I know its not true. Just at least try it.

1321643,0,t3_297wdv,Actually one of the three necessary reasons for high risk of death by suicide is a sense of alienation or thwarted belongingness and the sort of fatalism or nihilism or meaninglessness that leads to ideation of the sort your friend is expressing are linked to thwarted belongingness So this sounds to me more like an slightly unusual manifestation of an absolutely typical reason.  gt  I dont know how to reason with this.But regardless any kind of reasoning with someone at risk for suicide is something that should generally be avoided.  It can sometimes help but it also can backfire.  Building rapport with them forging an interpersonal connection is a much safer and more effective strategy.

But even the most desirable men get nervous over this sort of thing and even get turned down. Its all a matter of compatibility between you and the woman. I once thought that Id struggle with relationships because Im quite introverted and dont meet many females but my current gf is the same as me introverted. Just given the nature of our personalities it was unlikely that wed meet because we both never went out much.

1437445,0,t1_ciwftw7,First off what the hell are you doing responding instead of watching the World Cup?!But anyways lets get to the rest of it. The fact is most people have innate biologically driven sexual needs. Yes you can ignore them and it certainly wont kill you to do so but part of a relationship is keeping your partner happy and if you really care about them you will be more than happy to satisfy their needs. Of course if you stick to your belief in abstinence you shouldnt be obligated to break it for your partner since they too have an obligation to make you happy. Thats why its important to find someone sexually compatible even if it means having the same view of sex. But you should have lots of time still to figure out your actual sexual needs and views on the topic especially once you enter some sort of relationship. Essentially compatibility is one of many major factors that should be considered when you consider turning a normal relationship into something more and for some people its a bigger deal than for others.In my opinion sex isnt a physical manifestation of lovethats an emotion way too strong to be expressed through a mere physical act. Love means an emotional connection bonding deep mutual caring and trust and of course attraction. So love usually results in sex but sex by no means symbolizes love. People hook up or hire prostitutes not uncommonly today and have for thousands of years to the same or even greater extent than now.And personally I think that concluding that waiting as the only possible choice necessitates the belief that there is only one the one and that true love can only happen once something I would contest simply from observation of some people around me though Im not nearly old or experienced enough to have personal experience to draw on for that one. But Ive already discussed this particular belief with you and Im not going to try to convince you if you dont want to be convinced.As for the suicide thing. Most peoples first instinctive reaction when meeting someone who is suicidal is to try to convince them to change their mind as if it would be that simple. Most people dont understand what depression is like and additionally see it as an imperative to preserve the lives of those near them even if it means trying to guilt them into not doing anything drastic which is what telling you that youll make people sad isan attempt at causing a guilt trip. If you want to know if killing yourself matters if the sadness it would cause matters or frankly if anything at all matters...thats more a question for rphilosophy. The purpose of existence has been one of the biggest issues for thousands of years for philosophers and I wont endorse any one out of the dozens or even hundreds of schools of thought out there. Its an interesting thing to look into though.Out of curiosity could I ask why you said this was so annoying to you? I mean I understand why but why did you bring it up?

Having a anxiety andor suicidal thoughts is not weak.. its human! And there are times in which it is important and fully okay to be not the strong individual.Search for a therapist with a close friend of yours! A neutral professional perspective WILL help you a lot. Thinking about suicide is totally okay! But doing it should only be the last option... AND THERE ARE OPTIONS even if you do not see them right now. But close friends and your family  a therapist will help you!If youre thoughts go on and you start to plan your own suicide.. if it gets really really bad for you..

First couple of resources for you   Where to get help   How to tell someone youre suicidal Part I   How to tell someone youre suicidal Part II  I reference Natashas site because she is an authority on mental health and wellness.Natasha writes If the person isnt supportive its not about you  its about them. Which is true. When people spit out platitudes or attempt to offer pithy advice the majority of the time they are telling you what they wish to hear. It is what will make them feel better. Less uncomfortable. It is an attempt at sympathy when what is really needed is empathy.  I dont know why the organization you emailed did not respond to you  if they did not get the email if your email ended up in a spam folder if no one checks the email on a regular basis. That would be very frustrating and certainly does not reflect well on them or the responsiveness expected in our digital era. Even so is there a phone number you could call to follow up and ask them if they did receive your email?  ,SuicideWatch,cizbcas,1,t5_2qpzs
1463396,0,t3_2axeau,Metaphorically you sound like your chained and shackled to the ground. Your demons whip you as you struggle but youve grown so tired from the barrage the licks have bece numb. Youre not a failure man. Not at all. You have feelings you care. The hardest thing in the world is what you must do. I mean it when I say itll be hard and a worse part about it is you have no clue what youll need to do to beat it.Back to the metaphor you need to rise. Use your knees get an inch or two between you and the dirt. Get a little slack. Youre gonna have to get up. This is where you activate merciless beast mode. Its all about you. Break those god damned chains. Fucking burst from them then use them to tie your demons down. Stand up man! You have the power. Your mom would love to see her child chin held high.

1485485,0,t1_cj2gxgv,Honestly I was super intrigued by your post as Ive never discussed this stuff with someone equally interested! Perhaps isolation breeds a particular genre of thought. P I also grew up extremely isolated and unhappy I theorised about life and peoples existential delusions all the time ha.Its been a while since Ive devotedly read philosophy. I sort of want to recommend you the work of Arthur Schopenhauer as well simply because hes a right pessimist and my experience reading him was along the lines of OMG HES SO RIGHT highfive for pessimistic truth happiness DOESNT exist! I knew it! and ...OK this person has gone too far this is ridiculous. Id love to recommend you some further reading but Im by no means an expert. Id recommend Camus essay The Myth of Sisyphus alongside his novel The Stranger for sure but if its OK Ill have to give it a think and check my bookcase. Do you enjoy reading fiction or poetry?I like the idea of living to learn also. Im in a much better place now than I was before but sometimes it has been a bit comical when I have since felt alone and despairing but at the same time OH GOD BUT I NEED TO BECOME AN EXPERT ON MEDIEVAL LITERATURE one of my interests. And really everything is a potential interest and source of knowledge.I think RE considering that happiness and love etc are fictitious constructs I still wouldnt entirely reject this notion today. However I think the reason why this view obsesses me less now is that interaction does to an extent have a moderating influence on theories bred in isolation. Im not now a social hero and I can very much empathise with your difficulty in forming close relationships with people. However since I left home a few years ago I have experienced an array of harmless relationships with e.g. strangers acquaintances and colleagues which I think have changed my perspective on the socioemotional component of life. I have been very fortunate respecting the people I have encountered here. If I might ask what is your situation with employment? I find it hard to believe that you have zero employable skills when you write so well. What else have you been reading? How far along are you in your book?EDIT youve actually motivated me to do some reading now. P Thank you.,SuicideWatch,cj2hb7u,1,t5_2qpzs

1486846,0,t3_2b7vk7,whats shameful to you about getting help and having your family find out about it?youre struggling with depression at the very least thats obvious. depression is an insidious debilitating illness. its not you though. youre not a coward. getting up and out of bed is an act of supreme bravery when youre depressed. ditto for doing all the little things like brushing your teeth or combing your hair or changing out of pajamas. depression subjects its victims to terrible suffering and its simply not fucking fair.please call a hotline theyll direct you to services that will help you. depression is treatable. it may not be the easiest ailment to treat and the road to recovery might be long and full of setbacks but you could easily say the same of anything worth having in this world. there are people out there in the world who are dealing with similar issues who understand what youre going through. if nothing else please seek a support group. theyre free and it can be incredibly comforting to have comrades along for the ride. im so fucking sorry this is happening to you. mental illness gosh... hell of a thing for anyone to deal with. but you writing this here is a step in the right direction. give yourself a chance please and call a hotline. its scary as hell ive had to do the same thing. holding the phone in my hand dialing hanging up. just keep dialing. i couldnt stop crying for the first five minutes i was on the phone with someone. like full on out of control sobbing. they waited patiently for me to calm down enough so i could actually talk.please please please call. give yourself a chance at treatment. you deserve it. anyone who tells you otherwise who shames you for being courageous enough to say i need help can go  fuck themselves. they have no idea what its like.,SuicideWatch,cj2ng4h,1,t5_2qpzs

As someone trying to find a job in Accounting right now I was really impressed by your internship at the CPA firm. Interestingly what matters is not the number of stressful situations that we are exposed to nor the amount of stress that we have to withstand. Most important is our perception and subjective internpretation of the stressor and how we react to it. This depends on the personal arsenal of coping skills you have. Managing a ton of stress like you what are dealing with in healthy ways can prevent thoughts from becoming selfdestructive. I really feel for you in this situation but keep challenging irrational beliefs or the unhealthy thought patterns that are weighing you down because you can overcome this. I wish I had more practical help to offer. I know its hard right now but try to make a list to live and consider who would be forever affected by your loss what you would miss out on. Be active in engaging in stress reducers drink more water face difficulties head on knowing your priorities and take them one at a time learn to accept what you cannot change talk out your worries as you did by coming here! exercise vigorously at least  times a week.

Sometimes I can look at myself and see achievements outside of social or financial success but quite often I can only see that Im a person living off of disability. Coincidentally I too have a sibling two years older than me who makes a similar salary. For me its the humiliation of it all. I cant imagine having to sign a piece of paper like that like you had to.I similarly stopped taking my medication a few years ago after I could no longer face seeing a particular doctor and stopped seeking any kind of help. Falling through the cracks is unbelievably easy sometimes.What Im trying to say aside from the commiseration is that your health mental and physical arent a reflection of your worth. Youre more than the relationship with your boyfriend your job your health or your education. Its more than okay to be disappointed I have felt similarly. If you feel up to it please consider talking to your parents. Tell them you miss them and maybe consider asking them for some help with this.

You were very brave for being able to go through that step in life while you were so young you should be very proud of yourself.  I was a lot like you my mom was an alcoholic cheating drug addict my dad worked all the time so he didnt know what was going on. Most of the time my sister and I would walk to the closest grocery store to get food. When I realized I was gay at  I was horrified my parents were very religious and conservative. I decided to keep it a secret until I was  and in those years I started to hate myself. I was hospitalized for self harm and bipolar disorder when I was  and then again when I was  after I tried to commit suicide for the th time. I honestly couldnt see a way out I was so desperate that I NEVER would have imagined that my life could ever get better. I cant even imagine the pain that you feel right now because everyone is different. But I know that feeling of hating yourself and just wanting it to end.   I can tell you this right now I am  years old in a different state in college with a wonderful girlfriend and a very supportive dad and sister. It did get better for me all I had to do was stick through it even  through the tough shit. Its really hard but I found happiness after  years of hopelessness and despair.

I cant tell you how sorry I am that this happened.But dont let yourself blame this pain youre feeling on a misplaced sense of guilt. Youre no more to blame for the car accident than a grocery store is when someone is in a wreck on the way there. This is one of those senseless random tragedies that is so difficult to get over because there is more hurt than there is blame.If she had family go to them and help however you can.

Take it a day at a time. I try to conquer small things set small goals and work up to other things. its okay to feel how you feel you arent alone. You are important. hugs ,SuicideWatch,cjxxny6,2,t5_2qpzs
1736394,0,t1_cjxxvdz,First I know you know this but I need to say it just in case youre not thinking about it right now...you are not responsible for your friends happiness or her depression. She is the only one who can decide to live or die. You are not to blame if she chooses to end her life. If youre feeling like youre in over your head its important to know where your limits are. And then decide how far you can comfortably work with her. At this point if your limits have been reached and youre feeling anxious then you need to talk to a trained professional about your own feelings of helplessness and listen to their words. Let them help you with your own stress in this situation. If she is pulling away you cant make her come closer. All you can do is be there if she decides to choose to talk to you. Just like Im doing right now with you. This is important to know deep in your heart. And thats one thing you can say to her if it will help. Tell her how important she is to you. That you will listen without judgement to whatever she wants to talk about but only she can choose what she does with the feelings she has inside...and mean it. Tell her youre confused by her latest statement about gods love since shes never been religious could she tell you what she meant or does she want you to drop it. Let her responses guide the conversation. Let her know that she is the only one with the power to reach out and choose to live or die. That you know shes suffering. That youre there regardless of what she decides but you can only help if she wants you to. Now heres the hard part. If she doesnt respond you cant make her. This is hard to understand. And it can make you feel extremely helpless and afraid. But its true none the less. If this happens its important to give her the suicide assistance numbers you feel are the best for her situation whether she responds or not...and then talk to an experienced professional about whats coming up for you with this. If she does open up then know that talking about her plans to end it will not make her commit suicide. It will give her a safety zone to express herself. Try not to shut down if she begins to talk about it but if it triggers your own points be honest about that with her and suggest that others who are more trained and experienced might be more helpful  but still you know its up to her if she wants to talk to them. Lastly do not make promises you cant keep. If something feels wrong dont do it. Trust your instincts. Let me know whats happening. Im here. ,SuicideWatch,cjy1c62,1,t5_2qpzs

Im really sorry your family responded to your past troubles in a way which made you feel like they were angry with you. That must have felt like a rejection or even like you were being blamed for feelings outside of your control. Im sorry to disagree but isolating yourself further at the moment seems to me to be a bad idea. At the moment I cant help thinking that you need as little time alone in your own head as possible. Your friends kind of by definition like and value your company so youre not infringing upon them by asking for their company in anyway.The even which youve described as the beginning of your current problems doesnt sound like it was at all your fault and I think its really unfair and unlucky that it lead to your problems at school.If you continue to feel this way please do post here again or contact one of the helplines listed in the resources. ,SuicideWatch,ck695ag,1,t5_2qpzs

The laws vary from state to state but in general mandated reporters are only required to contact authorities if they possess knowledge that you intend to do immediate harm to yourself or others. For example if a man walks into his therapists office and says Im going to kill my boss tomorrow that therapist must report this. If he says Sometimes I feel like taking a long walk off a bridge there is no eminent danger so the therapist does not make a report. ,SuicideWatch,ckfajds,1,t5_2qpzs

I guess that maybe shes just too scared to tell you that she wanted to break up and instead decided to ignore you because thats an easier way?Do you really think that you did something wrong? Can you actually think of anything you did wrong? You said shes interested in women now. I know you said you were in the relationship for seven years but sometimes it can take someone that long to figure out that theyre a bisexual or a lesbian.

If youd seen how my family and a lot of my friends talk about people with mental illness you would be reluctant to talk to them too.I have a bit of a support network but I always feel bad telling them anything because they all have their own issues and I dont want to bring them down so I generally just pretend I am doing ok so they dont worry. but that brings the added part that they tell me everthang and I get to listen and pretend i am ok and try and help however I can even though I cant help myself so I dont really do anything for them in the end and then feel bad that I cant really do anything to help them. ,SuicideWatch,ckvpr9t,1,t5_2qpzs

Ive found it helpful when I dont know a lot about what someone is going through from what theyve shared just to ask questions that help me understand where theyre coming from. If someone is in a really tough place where theyre struggling with hard questions about whether and why to live or die often its helpful to try to really understand whats brought them to this point and explore the questions together rather than just giving an answer. ,SuicideWatch,ckxpx5u,0,t5_2qpzs

2067887,0,t1_cl2o0jb,Thank you for the response. The reason that I became extremely upset tonight is very complex and hard to explain. My family does not have good dynamics. There was abuse in my family when I was younger. As I grew older the abuse stopped but my family never healed. Tonight my mother and I got into an argument. The argument reminded me of the abuse that went on in my family when I was younger. My mother is not the type of person who can admit that she too has problems. But instead of admitting her own problems she uses me as a scapegoat. Its unfortunate. And it makes me very sad. I truthfully do not know if my mother loves me or not. I dont know if she does. And that makes me very sad. Without family I am nothing. Edited to add I will be trying to get some rest. Thank you again for reading my post and responding to it.,SuicideWatch,cl2o9u5,2,t5_2qpzs

2312091,0,t1_clxgz5s,I was just putting forward why it sometimes helps other people. I dont mean to say that it should or will help you because it hasnt helped you. Talking is supportive for some people for probably a lot of different reasons. The times its been helpful to me for instance was because I felt listened to when I felt very alone in my feelings. It was a sense of camaraderie and validation. Ive also had some very negative talking experiences. Talking has never cured anything for me either but again I did feel supported which for me was at least helpful in the temporary. That hasnt been the case for you.Unfortunately all that I can offer is support and commiseration.

The key thing is everybodys crap is different and could range massively in external perception to the individual going through it however each scenario is just as life affecting to each.Mentality plays a huge part in coping with things. Most people have a natural coping mechanism. By the sounds of it you have to learn one. Thats why I suggested the breathing exercise above for when you feels things are going to shit its a start. You need to level a bit mentally by that I mean you need to reduce the peaks and troughs in your thinking and emotions I.e. Dont get too sad about the sad things and likewise dont get too over the top about the good things.Imagine a wavy line running left to right try and think about the line turning into up curves and down curves we do not need Empire State Building peaks and troughsAdditionally exercise. I do not care what you do run swim lift team sport.... But when I was suffering from big mental downspots I made the mistake of not exercising at all.

2332034,0,t3_2m0x6v,So right now I am in highschool. I go to a gifted school that is challenging and a lot of work. Right now that is making me very stressed and my mom is thinking about moving me to a different school but then I would lose all of my existing friends. So right now I am swaying back and forth between schools. Also throughout much of my school days Ive been rejected a lot by girls and asking them out so I dont really even try anymore with that. But every so often I do but when it ends up being a no I just say oh okay and ignore them but feel kinda numb inside. And this is where the weird part comes in...Well so since I cant really get a girlfriend I still think some girls are really attractive to me so I creepshot them. If you dont know what it is its basically where you take pictures of their butts without them knowing which is what I hear wrong. I feel like it is sort of wrong but I still do it. So anyway today I was doing that and the flash on my ipod flashed and people saw it but I dont think that they thought I was actually taking a picture I think they thought my light just turned on inside of my sweatshirt.So yes that is the awkward part. Basically when I dont end up getting a picture I get kind of sad. Now I believe this is some type of mental disorder but I am way too afraid to tell anyone in fear of being judged. So reddit I come to you with my deepest problem that is causing me a downfall. Please try not to judge but if you must Ill try not to mind. There are quite a few people who do what I do so Im not a small minority. Thank you.,SuicideWatch,clzyazb,4,t5_2qpzs

Youre not sure what to gain from your friendship and it sounds like you may still be getting hurt by her. Even though she may be a nice person she may not be the type of friend that youre looking for and vice versa.Ive found that breaks can be helpful in these type of situations at least from my personal experience. It can definitely strain a friendship when it feels like the sides are a little unbalanced.

Getting help at a hospital actually means spending about  minutes a day talking to a doctor and the rest of the day obeying workers under threat of violence while dealing with barely functional adults that you cant get away from. Your doctor exists to ask you if youve figured out you need to lie and say youre fine to get out of there and that your pills havent destroyed you too much. You will have no form of entertainment or belongings to occupy yourself in most hospitals.And if youre in the United States you are responsible for paying for it. If you dont you stand to lose your assets have your wage garnished if they didnt fire you for missing all those days in the hospital and people will hire you.

I cant even imagine being in your position and the fact that you are trying to help instead of running away speaks volumes about your character. However I would not try to deal with this on your own. Your Mom sounds heavily invested in the delusions shes experiencing and thats impossible to mitigate without professional help. I think you should talk to your familysiblings about what you should do tomorrow. Tomorrow seems like it could shape up to be a crisis situation which is dangerous not only for your Moms safety but for yours as well. Depending on what your siblings think it might be required to have your Mom committed to a general hospital for a psych evaluation especially since she is talking about ending her life. Psychiatrists cant fix everything but there is the possibility for big quality of life improvements and at the very least you know that your Mom will be safe from herself. As for your Mom turning on you and thinking that you are part of her delusions I really dont know what the right solution is. I think your Mom getting help first is paramount. Good luck OP and good on you for reaching out for help you shouldnt have to deal with this alone. Im over here stressed about finals week I cant begin to imagine what youre going through.

This goes for people that feel the same way you do and the people around you.  Imagine what would happen to the person that found your body.  Thats why I couldnt do it.  If you shot yourself imagine the reactiontrauma of your momdad or even a stranger found your body not to mention the mess.  If you hung yourself how would they react seeing your blue lifeless face hanging from the ceiling.  Not to mention all the people that you would hurt by killing yourself.  I know thats selfish of them right?  But isnt it also selfish to want to kill yourself without letting other people give you a chance to help?  Try looking up some stories of people that lost someone they care about or even hardly knew about.  Youd be surprised how many lives you touched without realizing.  Please reach out to people.  Give them a chance to help you.  This could be anyone from your parents coworkers or some random person on a help line.  People will try to help you if you give them the chance.

Have you asked friendscoworkers if they know anyone that can hire you or give a recommendation to their managers?  Have you tried recruiters who go out and search for jobs for you?  If youre still feeling down set yourself a goal.  If you dont find a job you like within one year you can end yourself.  In the mean time though you have to give it your all.  I gave that chance to myself except it was more like  months and it gave me enough time to realize all the people that truly gave a shit about me and all the shit I could be doing right now to make my life better instead of staring at the ceiling all day figuring how how to kill myself.  Ive been rambling but I hope you read all this.  Living every day like its torture is not your best.  I hope you find what youre looking for,SuicideWatch,cmrf5yv,2,t5_2qpzs

I try to avoid depression and do all I can so I wont slip into depression  when you are depressed your thoughts are critical and negative so that you cant see the truth. People are selfish and look out for themselves first of all but at the same time people are inherently empathetic and loving. Your sister cares for you and loves you shed be horribly emotionally scarred and pained by your death. Its extremely painful or just too hasslesomedifficult for her to try to talk about it. Sounds like she is trying to give you some tough love.  Thats fine we cant expect everyone to be able to talk about such a painful difficult topic so easily. There is miscommunication between the two of you. She hasnt blocked off all contact with you she only screened night calls because she feels it intrudes on her health. Thats an example of her looking out for her health first of all. We need to look out for ourselves before we can care for others. ,SuicideWatch,cn3adlt,0,t5_2qpzs

No one knows what to say anyway. No one really caresThats okay. First of all you just have a feeling and that feeling isnt reflective of reality. I feel that people dont like me but I have learned to trust the part of me that knows that they most likely do like me. Secondly you cant expect people to have something insightful to say about alcoholism and personal change. Thats why people talk about safe topics like did you see that movie. The discussion doesnt need to be serious or personal just interacting with people is important for mental wellbeing. gtI want her to like me so badYou want someone to like you? Guess what so do I. You want a woman in a position of relative authority to like you? Me too. This is a natural desire and you dont need to let it flare up. Notice it point it out and make a calm facial expression and say thats how I feel about that all Im going to do is be myself and now Im going to keep busy with my Christmas day.

I dont know your parents but if my son told me he was feeling suicidal and wished for me to love him I would hug him and never let go.Maybe its worth a try? Seems like a better idea than dying imo.Also although I know this isnt the time and place for discussing the validity of old sayings and such I think its a good idea to describe why I dont think actions necessarily speak louder than words. Sometimes they do but most of the times I find that clumsy actions rarely were the intentions so if youre going to consider suicide please have in mind that although they may have screwed things up or whatever they may have done it doesnt necessarily reflect their love for you. Were all just human we do mistakes and Id be very saddened if someone used any of my mistakes as an argument for considering suicide. Like I said this isnt the place but I thought it was relevant.If you still believe that actions speak louder than words then tell your family and give them a chance to prove their love with the right actions. Im sure theyd be willing to commit to it if they knew the severity of your suicidal ideations.,SuicideWatch,cn7f1g7,1,t5_2qpzs

2678342,0,t3_2qp3fz,Hi mate its great that youre reaching out! I dont know how to offer feedback other than to just go through some lines and offer my thoughtsgtI have a lot of issues but I do a pretty good job of convincing everyone Im completely fine. I jokingly act like a narcissistic ass hole but Im not really sure why. Im thinking now that it might be because I dont want anyone to get too close even though I really do if that makes sense.I felt this way for a lot of high school and into college. I constantly felt pressure to fit in to be liked not necessarily popular but not dislikedI was a sad class clown. Trying to mold myself to fit the expectations of others as I perceived them gave me a lot of stress and made it difficult to know who I really was. I looked back on my behavior sometimes and cringed. The fear of being found out was a big reason I distanced myself emotionally from people. I was struggling in school I felt sad for no reason and often felt worse because I didnt know why I wasnt feeling right. gtOn top of that maybe I dont know who I really am and am scared to find out. I think you nailed it. It took me until the end of college to figure out what I really wanted in just the short term and what my actual true internal values were. It is extremely difficult to isolate your opinions and emotions and ever more so in a hyperactive social media world. Social pressures are also magnifiedI remember spending TONS of time on facebook when it was new for people not in college judging myself trying to project a good image to others. gtIm just typing this all up now because I seemed to have had a pretty great relationship with a girl Ive been dating for about a month but all of a sudden it feels like she doesnt like me anymore because I told her some of those feelings I talked about above. I depend on other peoples approval to feel like I mean something.On one hand its good that you had a catalyst that made you seek help.

I was reluctant to take medication for years. At first there were some side effects and it took some trial and error to find the right drugs but it really helps in the end. Alcohol might help for now but it sounds like youre dependent on it and you want to avoid that at all costs. As for the what ifs you have to fight back with as much logic and emotion as you can muster.

2769414,0,t1_cni5nae,Dude depression is hard. In a way nothing is worse than feeling trapped in your own head than feeling like no matter what you try you cant force yourself to do what you know you should. But the good news is the same as the bad news its just in your head. All youre really trapped by are thought patterns and you can fix this problem. There are a few steps that I take when I bottom out mentally and emotionally. The first is that I need to reach out to somebody and be honest about what Im going through because that unburdens me. Their empathy and advice is a good reimder that Im not alone in this. It doesnt have to be your parents right away but at my worst thats who I turned to even though I truly didnt know if theyd accept me help me disown me I had no idea. But I did and Im glad I did. Eventually they need to know since youre still so reliant on them.Next I know that when my brain gets lazy and unfocused it usually has a lot to do with diet and exercise. Its such a cliche but if the first thing you do when you get out of bed is five pushups or a quick run down the block you will feel different. Its kind of absurd how effective this is. When I look at me at my happiest its because I was exercising and avoiding fried or processed foods and when I was the most depressed I was being lazy and feeding myself a bunch of stuff I shouldnt be eating. As a rule of thumb if it has an ingredients list you probably shouldnt be eating it. Moving towards a more natural diet does wonders when it comes to mental health.And finally find a way to be productive even if its something tiny. Take baby steps. Read a couple pages of a book you want to read. Open your textbook and read a paragraph. Once you take the first step the floodgates open. Hell you dont even have to go to class but wake up on time get ready to go and be out your door on time. Then make the decision of whether to go. Its just a mental trick. Sometimes you really wont be up for it but at least you tried. Other times it was more that you never got yourself in gear and the feeling of being late paralyzed you into complete inaction. The only thing you can do is just put yourself in a position to succeed.And last thing youre not a burden. Youre your parents son. They love you and want you to be happy and most likely they would already be helping if they knew what you were going through. Your lifestyle makes you feel completely alone but more people feel or have felt exactly as you do than you could possibly imagine. And even if theyre not supportive this is your life your battle and its worth fighting. Try not to feel shame because by getting through this you will be stronger than most.,SuicideWatch,cnivejn,1,t5_2qpzs

They may have more responsibilities with a family and relationship now too but you may be surprised on how relationships can solidly last over stretches of time. And as for feeling like youre constantly reminded like youre living a less superior life then what you could be try to understand that regret is not only a common human behavior but often times an irrational one. Youve been living in hard conditions and many of the things you may not have achieved or obtained are impacted by factors out of your control. Being able to get to where you are today is something physically incomparable to another person and judging by what it sounds like youve endured shows a great strength of character. Times are hard now but dont give up! I believe in you and Im sure lots of others here will feel the same way ,SuicideWatch,cnpgj2b,0,t5_2qpzs

I would strongly suggest that you open up to someone close to you because your problems are very important and they will most likely be happy to help you and flattered that you chose them to confide in.And if you dont have anyone like that in your life you can talk to me or someone else on the internet there are a lot of places because I think what you are going through is difficult and important and I personally think that it is very helpfull to open up and talk to someone. ,SuicideWatch,cnrdp0s,1,t5_2qpzs

Doubting your position is normal for you its not looking okay and you dont know how to deal with the situation youre in.The general advice is to talk to your closest ones and explain them your situation and that you feel helpless. What youre doing is bottling up the problems and pushing them forward. This has consequences that can blow up. Its great that you found out that your grades were holding you down because of dyslexia a rather somehow common problem in people right? You know others with dyslexia? Might help you bond with someone and deal the problems together. You could ask college for help with that. Are you deep into the study? If you are in a really really tough spot you might consider talking to a school counsellor or anyone that is supposed to be your goto guy a tutor or counsellor like that. You could ask for options like maybe a simple break due to medical reasons.If thats a nogo area or you dont think it needs to go that far push yourself to either schedule more time for schoolwork or train yourself to finish your schoolwork earlier even if that means you will have less recreational time for yourself.Dont go too hard on yourself and make the best out of it.,SuicideWatch,co4v9n4,1,t5_2qpzs

We all learn one step at a time.Dont bring yourself down have a little patience and I promise life will not always feel this way you will learn to cope with your insecurities and grow out of your shell.Hope youll be feeling better soon and remember that there are people here wholl listen and offer their support in case you ever need it! ,SuicideWatch,co5h35o,0,t5_2qpzs

I was seeing shit and hearing shit and I was convinced no one would believe me if I told them so I kept it to myself and tried for years to get help without telling my family exactly what was wrong and they sort of just kept blowing me off.  My father kept pushing me back into school and I kept trying to tell him that I need to get my head straight first and he looked me dead in the eye and asked me if I thought he was an idiot.  So I kept going back to school and tanking.  Ill never be able to afford to go back.  So you know there goes the whole having a dream thing.Its still nice to think about though.  Probably one of the only things that keeps me going.  The world truly is a beautiful place if you can manage to look past all of the ugly buildings and pollution and overpopulation.  Everything happened exactly the way it needed to for life to occur and evolve.  It all fits together so perfectly.  I guess I have a really naturalistic outlook on life.

Most of the times I am bringing up points that people should know  Galileo is the allusion I always think of  but I think in general what scares me is peoples natural inertia toward something.   Its like they adopt a dogma and then try to defend it at all costs versus adopting a belief system based upon their experiences.  Like I love the core values of religion but most religions seem to have groups of indoctrinated people who are incapable of reason.  Same with people who associate with political parties.  If Im being too ambiguous I will think of of better example.  Confused.I met a girl over the summer and felt more connected with her than anyone I had ever met in my life.  She kind of used me though.  She has a boyfriend I found out about later and a bunch of other dudes she sleeps with.  Does rave drugs and stuff.  It didnt overshadow what I felt which I think should mean a lot from a conservative nearly straight edge purposed virgin.  She was one of the most empathetic people Ive ever met.  Thats another easily misconstrued situation.  I was never unrealistic about it so I saw and acknowledged the red flags.  Knew shed leave me but was sad when she did.  Sad that she self medicates.  Alone because our connection wasnt as important to her.  Confused because even though I think I was and am really open minded so many peope still accuse me otherwise.

3176199,0,t3_2wikv2,Well truly there is no point. What youre tired of is the endless searching for a reason when there is none. Because you probably dont have one.In life there is no inherent greater purpose for man. Youre a blip on a massive planet in the middle of the universe. Youre here and youre gone. Poof. You meant something to the peoples lives you touched but soon enough youre forgotten dust or fertilizer for the trees. And thats the beauty of it all.Non feeling and having a void in your heart can mean a lot of things. Loss or intense extended melancholy can do it. Youve probably finally decided that life is not worth it you were tired of the rollercoaster. I dont know you so I cant be certain. What i can tell you however is that your purpose or rather the point in living is something you create for yourself. I cant honestly explain that without knowing you but please do understand that you wont find it in endless pondering thought of grand scheme or god or anything like that. The only one who knows who truly knows what you want is you. This apathy you feel is something I felt at a time too. The lack of any happy or even sad thoughts. Utter mental exaustion. It hurts. I know it.My advice is to go experience nature. Take time away from this insane busy world and try your best to have simple clean thoughts. Meditation is an underappreciated technique for this as it allows you to cleanse your mind. Start small small as possible. Stare at your wall and think of nothing else. Do minor stretches of the legs and arms. Clean your environment house car etc. and unclutter yourself. Focus intensely on personal hygene make it a point. If you are in school pick a class or two you like and really zone in at least thst one hour a day and try to catch everything. If you can organize yourself even slightly things are easier and your emotions will have less strain.Ultimately I cant help further without knowing you more personally. Feel free to PM me anything you like Im here if you need me. Sorry for being wordy and possibly pointlessly philosophical. Oh also I have some literature you might be interested in not stupid motivational crap but some fiction that goes in depth that is both enjoyable and relatable and tackles what I think you might be feeling.,SuicideWatch,cor7n3w,1,t5_2qpzs

Anxiety is what helps you be ordered helps you to be successful.  What you are dealing with is overactive anxiety.  The good news is there are many avenues to help with this! I can post a few article links for you to read if you wish.  What i will say is I am extremely proud of you.  It takes a great deal of strength to wade through anxiety.  Find some coping mechanisms that work for you and you will slowly be able to relax when adding small amounts of stress into your life.  It will only get better from there.  Eventually you will learn to take the overthinking and the fear and harness it to your will.  You will become successful and you will accomplish things that now seem laughably impossible.

While I cant say that bad experiences with mentalhealth care are rare its also true in my experience that people who persevere usually do find some decent help even if the road to that point has a few bumps.  Could you maybe clarify for us exactly whats happened so far with your school counsellor?   Also could you tell us what sort of help you think you need and how what youve found so far has differed from that.  Some of us on the mod team have some expertise in navigating the system and we might be able to find some other options for you if thats what your interested in.Either way it sounds like your experience is that every time you ask for help the vicious cycle of stress and despair just escalates.  Thats horrible but usually when that happens its not anything to do with the person seeking help its just that the system is far from perfect.   But the system also has many great people who really care and honestly sometimes it only takes one of those to change everything.Do you mind telling us a bit more about your history and your previous attempts?  How long since the first one?  Was there ever a time in your life when you were really okay?  What kind of socialfamily support do you have if any?  Or is your family part of the problem...?I know youre in a very dark place right now and from what youve written here it seems like your mind is latching onto all the worstcase scenarios and dwelling on them.

Feeling like a burden feeling super fucking lonely its more than alot of people can handle.  To me I think the worst part may very well be the fact that we cant even share this information with our family and friends because we dont want to be more of a burden.I dont know if its good or bad that we have to try to find anonymous help on the internet but thats what Ive ended up having to do tonight.  I think the first and foremost thing to solving your problem is pretty much on this subreddit and that is just finding someone who wants to listen.  I know how youre feeling bud Im feeling the same way.  But at least we know that we arent the only ones.

3529060,0,t3_30p5sm,Violence is an expression of impotence and rage is an expression of our inability to address issues we are faced with in a collected way  you feel powerless to affect the things which are making you angry so you fall into an impotent rage later.To address your anger issues you need to address why these things make you feel angry. Why you are so emotionally affected by these things. Perhaps you are not so much angry at the situation as angry at yourself for being unable to stand up for yourself or express the feelings you have. Perhaps rather than being rooted in some innate rage problem its actually based on a confidence issue or an anxiety issue where you cannot speak out in the way you would like to. Its hard to give you further advice than that without more information.As for a suicide gene there are certainly reasons beyond our control why our lives turn out in certain ways however its tempting to externalise our problems to give up and say its genetic I cant do anything and thereby excuse ourselves of any requirement to put in effort to change our lives. Its not easy to become happier but it does involve input and the belief that you actually can overcome your difficulties if you take the correct steps. Attempting to blame all your problems on something like a gene that is forcing you to end your life is dangerous because it legitimises making no attempt to change things as you feel predestined to end your life which is in my opinion not true at all.,SuicideWatch,cpujc8c,1,t5_2qpzs

I am disturbed by your trend of not only allowing posts that flagrantly violate the rules to remain unmolested but also specifically commenting to alert the entire readership that you are aware of these posts and aware that and how they break the rules and that you have deliberately chosen to let the offending posts remain.  I  disturbed by this trend of yours because it is such an obvious and deliberate choice to unevenly enforce the rules you created and could effortlessly change at any moment to permit the prohibited behavior you are allowing to remain.  This disturbs me not just because it undermines any sense of stability or consistency in the rules but also because obviously so heartfelt is laughably easy to fake if obviously so heartfelt is apparently justification for breaking the rules then all anyone has to do is convince you a fallible human that a troll post is heartfelt in order to have free reign to undermine the rules you and the other mods remind the readership time and time again are based on years of observation deliberation and study.  It disturbs me that so much supposed effort can be undone merely by a halfway convincing lie or by a clumsy oaf doing more harm than good.Please remove the offending post.

3556164,0,t3_30yqnv,gt. I guess I like video games and writing so Ive thought about being a game reviewer.There are plenty of ways to start doing this. You can be a podcaster you dont have to be a writer. You can do video walkthroughs on twitch.com. This is something I would absolutely love to do but I dont have the  funds for the computer needed to do it. But you dont have to have a gaming computer to do podcasts although you would need a podcast system. There is one major thing that people hold themselves back from doing their passion because they think they need to make money from it right away. That is not how art works. And writing is art. To be an artist or good at anything enough to make money you have to have  passion  practice and  luck. But heres the thing youll never actually do what you love to do in your life if you keep holding back because the idea of not making money or fame at it right away  failure to you. Thats just tragically sad. You got to try first. And you got to seriously apply yourself. I do open mic comedy and I honestly dont think Im good enough to be famous but I keep doing it because MAYBE. . .I also have found so many good people for friends this way. Dont give up like that that. I suggest you check out twitch and see what thats like. Any movement in any direction is better than none at all. Find a game reviewer who does walkthroughs whos been doing it for a while and email them. Strangely enough people like to talk about themselves and they dont think in that everyone is competition for me. Way. Many big businesses today started out by one person calling another business and asking honestly for help. So dont give up. I mean here I am I told you I would love to be a walkthrough podcaster and Im telling you what you could do where I cannot right now due to money.

3635175,0,t1_cq6lyjr,You dont feel attended to it seems and no one can substitute that feeling of recognition for you.  You sound intelligent and you self reflect those are two great tools to live and care for yourself. Once again dont try to change or mask yourself. Dont suddenly hit the gym  times a week and eat salads. Go on a  minute walk spontaneously  because you ACTUALLY feel slightly better afterwards. Spend an extra  minutes in front of a mirror not to prep your appearance to change yourself for others but to recognize and reaffirm and appreciate yourself. Because knowing yourself removes so much fear and confusion and it removes the sense that you are a liability to others. Be better than anyone else at taking care of yourself know yourself more than your friends and family do. You will love yourself when you know yourself I promise. For now try to think of your perception of yourself as looking at a glassy mirror its been unkempt for years and you hate the dust and the mildew and the inability to see and care for yourself. Your lack of awareness of your thoughts and their abusiveness are the dust on a neglected mirror. People often mistake their thoughts for themselves but the dust covers the reflection it is not the reflection. Once you sweat and work and LIVE caring for yourself and wiping away the dust you will understand yourself more. Such as recognizing which thoughts are simply abusive and unhelpful and recognizing when youre running to food simply to drown them out. ,SuicideWatch,cq6myll,1,t5_2qpzs

What youre going through doesnt make you weak. Depression is considered by some to be the worst illness there is. I have been diagnosed with schioaffective disorder which means Im schizophrenic and depressed and frankly the depression sucks way more than psychosis. You need to appreciate that whats happening to you isnt natural. Its the depression talking just like schizophrenia talks to me.

3760082,0,t3_33gskp,Im going through a similar situation. I made a reddit post about it too but it is far longer than it needs to be so Ill try to paraphrase it as best as I can.I had a friend. She got depressed. I tried to help. Things werent looking good so I applied a bit more force. She went offline and disappeared. About a week or so later she made some suicidal posts on facebook. I was scared of that plus I was scared that I only made things worse. I backed off for about two months thinking she would contact me when she was ready. She got over her depression. No response. Through the time between the lack of contact I was filled with doubt and my own suicidal thoughts resurfaced. After contacting a suicide hotline worker I opted to try contacting her. Things were somewhat resolved. I was still feeling doubt. About two months later I showed her all of my disgusting thoughts and showed that I wanted to kill myself. After a few more exchanges in the same conversation she blocked me. I sent a last letter of sorts saying that I just wanted help. She told me that she was scared of me. I tried to at least end things on a civil note. This was yesterday.Most of the details have been left out to make it a quick read.It really sounds like the middle of where I was where I thought I made the situation worse. When she went offline a horrible thought came to mind. I thought Id killed her.Really Im not in any position to give advice so please take what I have to say with a grain of salt. I would recommend stepping back a bit. I doubt that the source of her depression is over you. If you are still concerned try and get someone to recommend a suicide hotline to her. Or if shes not talking to others much try and get them to talk to her. But I think its important to not let her feel overwhelmed. But I think a suicide hotline is a better choice.While this is important you need to focus on getting better too. Youve explored your options. If youve let her know that you just want to help then youve done all you can. Dont let this destroy you. You can win this. You can overcome it. You are not responsible for anything that happens so dont feel guilty. Youve done more than your fair share.I know this was a clumsy and awkward response but please do consider it. Like I said Im not really one to give advise so I would recommend that you contact a suicide hotline if you need to talk too. I have talked with them and can confirm of their efficacy. Do keep in mind that they cant give you an answer but they can provide a bit of guidance. Please. You can do this.,SuicideWatch,cqkvlaz,2,t5_2qpzs

I havent really heard anything from you that sounds like an awful person you dont get along well with your parents on deeper issues yet you are forced to spend your life around them so far no way that could be pleasant and it is much more unhealthy to just bottle up all these negative feelings your whole life but it seems that is what is expected of you.  I would suggest not making a decision until youve had time living outside your state on your own.  I was extremely suicidal growing up I did not share any of the beliefs as the community in which I was raised but a few years on my own made me much more calm.  I am still suicidal but it is nothing as it was the pressure is off.  Anyway good luck feel free to PM me if you wish.,SuicideWatch,cqqz1bw,1,t5_2qpzs

3823084,0,t1_cqrg9zt,Thanks for your message Hugo it makes a lot of sense to me! I guess i was just feeling extraordinarily hateful towards my parents and my self last night and i have no idea why. But trying to find a silver lining in suicide was not helpful to my situation in any way. I guess i have to face up to some of these feelings and address them so talking to my father might be a good idea as long as i watch my mouth. Hes always ready to listen to me even tho we often argue but i think if im calm and collected and keep what you said in mind i can find a way to steer the conversation to something useful. I wont do anything stupid sometimes it just feels like im going to snap but i guess we all feel like that some days. It touches me that a complete stranger on reddit would put in the effort to write me a response like that so i want to thank you for that too  ,SuicideWatch,cqs2b4d,1,t5_2qpzs
3829144,0,t3_34a8aj,I am sorry about the things that happened in your past .. there is nothing that can be done to take all of that away . But then you are a survivor . You didnt give up then .. you lived to see this day . That means there is so much strength in you that is unrealized even by you. Dont think about where the future will take you .. dont think about that potential mediocre office job you may end up doing . When the time comes it will be for you to decide whether you wanna take it up or not .. you say hi are good at things  that you are a genius . Then you are an asset to this world and that is what is gonna define you  not your past .. If you think running away and then killing yourself will be better then why dont you run away and start from scratch at a new place .. where you wouldnt have to prove anything to anyone .. where you wont be judged or measured based on your past but on who you chose to become .. and even if you get judged who cares .. you need to live up just to your own expectations .Use your strengths  use your knowledge  use your intelligence .. be into teaching or something.. May be travel elsewhere and do teaching or community service or something .. just dont give up .. If you need anyone to talk to to just listen to you  you can count on me to be that person .. feel free to reach out to me God bless ,SuicideWatch,cqsr6bx,1,t5_2qpzs

I have been accepted into two of the top five universities in my country another one pending just because I am good at memorising stuff and rewriting them on exam papers. Im just book smart.But employers arent looking for book smarts who cant even have casual conversations with others. I have no friends.

Sometimes I cant pronounce my words correctly if I can even remember the word Im trying to say in the first place. I wont be able to find a job in my field after graduation. All I can do is go work at minimum wage places where you work like a robot. I am afraid even getting into those places are going to be difficult.My memorisation skills are getting worse as well.

Theres always that envy and jealousy though. My parents who are alcoholics recently had a big fight involved the family all that good stuff. Ever since I was young after I made a serious attempt to reach out to them and at least hope theyd think about improving to which they literally rolled their eyes and continued to drink while fucking sober I vowed they would never have my love.

Yes obliteration is quite a heavy price to ask for but I remain resolute in that I would trade everything and all memory and sensation just to stop my existence.

3975436,0,t3_35zxqf,gtI will never love someone like I love her. Ever. This isnt the best possible plan you know. It is certainly not what someone who loved you would want for you either. OP please pay attention to your own words and supplications they are truly wise and right and true.That means that you too must not give up on the love that is always possible when  people who are able to sincerely and deeply communicate meet and enjoy one another fully.Love is not something we can plan for work for believe in or create in isolation. Love is a living thing that takes place in real time. It is not an idea or a thought. It is far greater and more powerful than mere thought. Love is absolutely free and cannot be bound or held. If it can be possessed it is not love. You cannot give hope to others if you do not have equal hope for yourself. There is no way around this. It is the same as with love. If I do not love myself I cannot love another. It isnt possible. It has taken me years to learn this because I grew up with the complete absence of love as a child and had to learn later in life what its all about. It took over  years.A person is a living entity. A person like love cannot be possessed and kept for oneself. That is not loving. All beings must be free. If I am not free I cannot love. If I am dependent or bound to some idea I cannot love. I cant have genuine relationship if Im not free. The most painful and destructive condition for a human being is not knowing themselves thoroughly and acting instead from a state of confusion or incomplete understanding. If I do not know why Im doing whatever Im doing I will cause disorder in my relationships. If I do not know why I want what I want I will not know how to go forward in life. If I dont know why I believe what I believe how will I ever find truth?Your words are wise. You are  correct. You may also want to consider another type of love. Love that is not for just one or two others but for all of existence.A french guy named Teillhard de Chardin defined love as the affinity of being for being. I like this definition because it does not exclude all but human beings. It is also a good definition because it also refers to another aspect of love the love of all of existence for all of existence.This love is only apparent to me during meditation. In meditation one sees that Love is literally the glue keeping all parts of existence together in harmony. If you can meditate you can make contact with this Love and it is wondrous beyond all measure.,SuicideWatch,cr9flwo,1,t5_2qpzs

4001330,0,t3_36av49,Youve already admitted you have a problem. Thats a start. I used to be suicidal like you except I was  and it lasted until a few months after my  birthday. Heres the thing. Looking at my life you probably would never have guessed it. Tall skinny dude with good grades albeit falling slooowly and a few SOs. If year old me told you all this and went up to you and said I was depressed wouldnt it seem like Im being an asshole? Wouldnt it seem like Im throwing the word depressed like tumblr throws around triggered? What would I have to be sad about? I had this wonderfully normal life but I couldnt stop wanting to kill myself. Focus on that.In reality I cried a lot in private and avoided my friends because I thought they all secretly hated me and were just acting nice because they pitied me since they knew no one liked me. Imagine leaving all your friends and riding the subway home alone crying yourself to sleep. Then imagine cutting your arm. A taste of bleach. A huge bottle of Advil. Screaming at your mom and making her cry. And now imagine me in my pajamas chilling on my bed. Maybe after I type this Ill play some games. Maybe read. Maybe exercise a bit. And theres no difference in what I have now and what I had when I was depressed. If anything what I have now would be less than what I had then. I moved with my grandparents because of my depression from NYC to this small town in the middle of nowhere. Nothing to do. I see my friends maybe once a month. Same goes with parents and siblings. My laptop is pretty old it even has cracks around the USB port. Since my grandparents are old they dont use the internet like I do so they dont pay for fast internet. Compare that to a brand new Apple computer and an HD TV that has Netflix and  somehow magically ???. When I was depressed I didnt feel like I could do anything. After I was depressed I was waiting to rule the world... or at least my life.   Im not going to say Its all about perception because even though its true it doesnt help. Knowing my perception made me suicidal didnt help my depression or change my perception. Heres what Im going to say. Youre . You dont feel young but you are. In reality people never feel young. A  year old doesnt feel young. The oldest a  year old ever felt was when he was  which is now. And then when he becomes  he looks back and goes Look at those  year old babies and then that  year old becomes  and so on and so on. I dont care if youre  or pushing a million. Its never too late to start something now. If you ever think youre too old to start changing your life well at that point you can sit around and do nothing or sit around and do something. That also goes for being too dumb or too fat or too ugly. We all start as the most pathetic form of mankind a baby. A shriveled up bloody crying doesnt know jackshit cant even walk etc. etc. And then we grow into this beast thats conscious and can speak and run and throw and do math and ride cars. No animals can stand against us. Sometimes we end up as ridiculously goodlooking or smart or funny or all of the above. Sometimes we end up fat and we feel lonely etc. Either way its a hell of a journey from a baby to growing up. Do you realize that there are some babies that are born get hungry and die? All we do is get older and we either work towards our goals or sit around and do nothing. One leaves us slowly rotting away while the other slowly gets better. Heres what I would do. I would just cry. You said you feel like crying go for it. Part of being human is this huge range of emotions we feel so if you feel like crying dont hold back. In fact dont hold back any emotion you get. Im not saying if theres a hot girl and you wanna bang her go up to her and kiss her. No thats actually a horrible idea. What Im saying is feel that emotion. Feel the lust or sorrow or joy and if you feel like acting on it thats where you slow down and ask if its a good idea.

4001659,0,t3_36b39g,I think you might just be in a rut. We all go through times of feeling crappy. We really do. Im sure this isnt your first time too! That is probably the strangest thing about life. When were down we all know damn well that we arent happy. We all feel like crap and just get stuck. But then some anything happens and suddenly we shoot back up. But heres the weird part. Most people dont notice that part. Most people cant tell that theyre happy and overlook that so naturally they think theyre always down. My suggestion to you is to find  good things every day. No matter how stupid or tiny they are and write it down. By the end of the month thatll be over a hundred and youll just naturally start to notice the positives of your life. Even if this sounds lame just consider it.,SuicideWatch,crcf5dn,2,t5_2qpzs

There have been formal training programs in place for years to educate the educators who apply its practice in our schools.Yes... MBSR has a very efficient organization backing it. The number of Buddhists studying it is quite remarkable.gt Of course the negative stories on TM schools are not in San Fran yet but in Fairfield. Have you not heard them? So sad. And now theyre exporting it.TM has been in San Francisco schools for  years as that NBC report points out. Surely with even a single school with hundreds of kids practicing it every day for  years there would be lots of negative stories about TM to tell but both the old and new Superintendents of SFUSD want TM taught to all students.And TM has been taught to  kids in schools in Peru. Certainly there must be many negative stories there as well and yet the government wants to expand the program from  to .Of course school system of Rio de Janeiro with  million kids on the waiting list to learn TM has to have done its own research but apparently the anecdotes you dont document trump the ones that the school systems DO document. ,SuicideWatch,crhywjz,1,t5_2qpzs

You can go and ask to be admitted to a psychiatric unit for evaluation we call it a  or Ive heard it referred to as a Baker Act and you will usually stay there for  or  days. That is usually the minimum and you will see a psychiatrist while you are there and he or she will put you on some medicine. There might be individual therapies and group therapies that is what I had when I had gone and you get to chill out and take some time for yourself to figure out things.I think that it is very telling that you are asking about this because it shows that you feel that something is NOT right...if you feel that strongly dont be afraid to ask for help. If you feel committing yourself is the best thing for you then DO IT! I am proud of you for asking this. I just got back from a  commitment and I am glad I did. I tried to hang myself and I knew then that I really needed to go BACK to the hospital asap. I had tried to OD only a few weeks before that almost succeeding in my suicide attempt then.I wanted to add that you wont be able to have a cell phone security risk but most units I would think will have a pay phone system in place. Where I was we had certain times that we could use the office phone to call out to loved ones and give them the pay phone number so they could call back. I dont know if it is the same everywhere but that is how we had it. Can you tell us what is bothering you?

She came out around two and a half years ago and for the . years she was out my mother treated her like shit. She would rarely allow her in the house she would berate her tell her she wasnt really trans would purposely use male pronouns etc.Shes gotten much better over the last year or so but she still refuses to help pay for any hormone therapy or for a sexchange op even under the condition that my sister pay her back.In regard to her being someone I can talk to shes never been that for me. Shes the type of person who believes she knows everything and ever since I was little she would trivialize any problems I ever came to her with call me whiny or claim that I have no ability to deal with problems. I may sound like Im exaggerating but Ive never seen her display any form of empathy. Her response to her children asking for her help is usually bad advice and reminding us over and over of the stuff she went through when she was young.In regard to support groups Ive been going to the LGBT groups on campus and Ive made a few posts on reddit in my other account.

So then what the fuck point is there of living? I should either exist in this flat barren empty dead state of complete loneliness and isolation. Or if I look for a guy to date apparently Im gonna completely fuck it up and date a guy who will rape and kill me because of my poor judgement or some shit.So why not just die now and end the whole thing? I feel dead now anyway from being completely alone for so long. And I dont really see the point in continuing to be alone until I refine my supposedly shitty judgement.

4350444,0,t3_3atztz,Breathe my friend. Do whatever you can to calm down aBout the weird social situations. You can do this my friend. Find some faith and. If you have meds for anxiety take one. Knuckle up and Apply anywhere and everywhere possible even if they dont say theyre hiring. Fast food grocery stores. Leave ur name n number if you have to. Always a good idea when you really need a job. Do as many as you can in a day n start calling all the places the next day while youre goin more places if possible. After asking to check on your application for a few days maybe you should have some good news and be somewhat used to talking to new people. Save your money and call or go to all the apartments near where you live. Renting a house might be too much for you right now so hopefully  you can find a cheap and nice place. Income based andor utilities paid is a plus for you since youll be making minimum wage probably.But all you need to do once you find a place is have the money or however they want it fill out paperwork pass a background check usually get the keys and you officially have your own place. Once you have a job your people should back off a bit too so hopefully theres less stress for you till you move out. Also at this point dealing with people should really easy n not add stress. Also you are on your way to being an official adult .Definitely keep the shelter or whatnot in mind but dont go untill u have to. I believe in you my friend you can do this have faith in yourself. You got a pretty fair amount of time. And as long as you dont stop applying and searching till the point you either get one or go to the shelter you should land a job. You dont exactly live in a rural area with only a few fast food places a gas station n a handful of other businesses. Small towns suck. It is something you can easily do and the anxiety should ease up after a few awkward introductions.  You should never even consider the last option let alone untill youre too haggard from sleeping in the shelterstreets to keep applying and checking back with them. Ive been homeless before and yea it sucked but as long as you dont resign yourself to being the guy begging for change for food when u really want beer or drugs its survivable. You even have a shelter that you can get to.,SuicideWatch,csg0zto,2,t5_2qpzs

You continued functioning til you couldnt as well and then started to take care of yourself again.  It will just take time I think.  You sound impatient to succeed as yourself  about failure  if it did happen are the consequences that horrible to cause this much stress?  Im not judging just sometimes I think Im failing and that the world would end with me dying in shame and then nothing happens and I try something else.Also this feeling you have now is part of recovering from your lows.

There are certain symptoms though and legally Im not allowed to check for those so if go see a psychologist.And you might be feelin down about yourself but remember one thing. You came here. And that means somewhere no matter how deep down you dont want to feel this way anymore.Gaining selfconfidence is simple but it isnt easy. Focus on the positives in your life. If you cant find any explain all this to your closest friend am ask them why they talk to you or spend time with you. The answer might surprise you and starting there you can start to discover new and exciting things about yourself.Lifes not anywhere near finishing my dear friend it seems its just beginning EDIT I dont know who the hell down voted you cause it takes a lot of bravery to open up like that especially to a stranger.

4447091,0,t1_cskbutx,I truly do hate to see a young person so down especially when you consider that in a year from now you could have shit totally turned around. Ill be frank with you though just understand that Im not coming from a callous indifference for your humanity. This shitty good country has loads of things that can help you get on your feet but you seem to consistently ignore the advice that is thrown your way by people doing better than yourself. In the  left thread uBearsRock  among many others offered not only a first step but a variety of recommendations for a path forward. And the only reply you made to ALL OF THE EFFORT that he and many others put into providing some advice and feedback was a  word reply addressing  comment about the military not working. Honestly I read your reply in my exgirlfriends voice. I routinely tried to provide options and opportunities to her to flourish and find her feet. All she ever offered was excuses and the more I read your comments thats all I see. excuses. Fact is this great country offered you a free HS education which you chose to quit. It offered you a GED in case you quit HS you didnt do that. Ergo you fucked any chance at the military bailing you out. Youve been begging for money for years and gotten golden advice with you either ignore or offer some special pleading for how it wont work for you. Did you know most of us here work our asses off to make it check to check? You say happiness for you is not worrying about a roof over your head and less stress yet when someone mentions day labor places your only response is that you dont know where any are at. Thats super fucking motivation on your part. You routinely start these threads asking for help and one by one dismiss every option and then play the victim. Dude if you want to give up thats on you but know you did it in spite of all of the good direction people have offered you. If you want to get out then start fucking listening and quit the bullshit special pleading. Okay maybe the military wont take you. Go get your GED work day lobor and develop a trade. Ill say it at the end again I do hate to see that youre so down that youre considering ending your life. I also have a history with anxiety and depression. My life isnt easy. Im more rattled by things than some people. And depression can feel debilitating for months while anxiety can feel suffocating moment to moment. Consider addressing your anxiety and depression as necessities if they are that crippling but ultimately you must right your own ship. There is a community here that will offer moral support and direction. In that sense youre not alone but your actions will be what changes your life. Best of luck.,SuicideWatch,csr8psa,3,t5_2qpzs

4476408,0,t3_3cewvu,Hey I know how you feel thinking that youre selfish or a bad person for expecting your friends andor family to pay attention to you. I have similar thoughts from time to time. I want people to know the things Im going through the pain Im feeling. I want them to know and to help me out or give me some attention. The thing is these thoughts dont make you or me selfish theyre normal thoughts to have. Ive had some conversations with people recently about it and I found out that many if not all people feel this way when theyre going through hard times. Honestly we all have thoughts that we think other people would be disgusted with. When it comes right down to it its your actions that matter not your thoughts.I wish I could say something to make up for your friends leaving you behind but I cant. That feeling of loneliness and abandonment is a pain that cant be helped with words. We need people in our lives real people that care about what happens to us and an internet stranger cant provide that in the same way that someone close to you can. You say they are focusing on themselves though maybe thats what you should do for now. I know youre trying and I know its hard but you have to move past what other people think of you and take a look at what you think of you. Do you like your life? Do you like what you do? If not what would you change? If you can identify what you dont like about yourself you can work to change it.Moving on to your family let me start out by saying that you have a shitty brother. If he really meant what he said then hes the one who should be taking a look at his own life. A normal good human being would never say that to anyone so dont take that too personally. As for your parents like I said before everyone thinks things that shouldnt be said out loud. Just because they said that to you doesnt mean its true and frankly it was wrong of them to take their own frustrations out on you. They clearly have their own problems to deal with.Lastly I think youre on the right path with focusing on things you love to do but a deep depression like this can cause even things that you love to seem empty. Back to what I said before if you can get past what others think about you try to figure out what you think of you. If you like who you are then forget about everyone who tells you youre worthless. If you really need a suggestion though I might have something for you.Many people myself included get hung up on their body image and the way they look. When I started working out it felt really good. It gave me structure and something productive to do it improved my health and made me feel better and over time it will improve your looks. If you stick with it it can make a huge difference in the way you feel about yourself and can give you confidence. Confidence is huge in making and keeping friends as well as significant others. If you want to give it a try there are plenty of resources online that can help you get started. Just start slow and build up. It really can make a world of difference. I hope you can move past this and find people who really care about you. Eventually we all need people to care.,SuicideWatch,csux6ad,1,t5_2qpzs

Even if the depression was due to an event or some sort of mental trauma that would still result in a change of neurochemistry.

Depression can be a terrible cyclical disorder that makes it seem like it will knock us down every time we get up. Im so proud of you that you took it upon yourself to back out of your attempt and save your own life. I cant tell you what the next step will be but for me it was finding the right treatment for myself and fighting tooth and nail to be my own advocate within the system. This means firing bad therapists for example. Its hard to keep fighting when you have to go through so many treatments talk therapy meds whatever the doctors say to get to the right one because its easy to become disheartened and decide to quit to give in to the intrusive thoughts that tell you you are somehow not worthy.Again Im so proud of you and you can be proud of yourself for saving your life.

4584128,0,t3_3dt3w6,Hey there man.   I read your story.  I relate a lot to your story.  I too had a girl promise to love me forever and cheated on me with my best friend.  They recently got married.  Needless to say it destroyed my world.  You and your family seem like amazing people always willing to give the shirt off your backs to someone who needs it or wants it.  Thats an amazing trait in this world.  You have been hurt screwed over and forgotten about by people you opened your trust to.  Thats a tough feeling.   There are a lot of people willing to take advantage of nice people.  I am sorry that you were treated this way and I am sorry that this happened to you.   You didnt deserve any of this.  I know the feeling of having all of your hopes and dreams smashed in front of your eyes.   I want to share a couple of things that helped meFirst Get lots of sleep.  You will think better and be able to make better decisions.Tell your girlfriend that you love her that you want to be with her but that you cant play these games anymore.  Tell her to call you if she ever changes her mind.  Tell her you love her family and that you will miss all of them in your life and especially her.  Now walk away.  Dont contact her and let her make a decision.  It might be the hardest decision you will ever have to make but in the end this is what I should have done instead of dragging it out for another year.  Not only does this give you some sense of pride back but it has the possibility of her realizing that she is the one that needs to make a decision.  Odds are that she will probably call you.  But if she doesnt its time to let go. You have to find a way to laugh.  Weather by watching funny videos jokes or whatever you need to laugh and smile.  Try to find a way.  It will make you feel a million times better.  As far as your family fighting  You know what they say the only time to panic is when the fights stop then you know there is nothing left to fight for.  I think every family has its drama.  Thats ok.  Focus on yourself.   You cant please everyone and at the end of the day the whole world is against you.   Push it all out of the way and focus on you.  Weather its goals dreams or just getting a new tshirt focus on yourself.  I started meditating.  Everyone thought it was weird but it makes me feel so much better.  Anywho just advice from a guy who has been in a similar position.  I dont know you personally but I can tell just from your post that you are a good person.  I sincerely wish the best for you and hope you can get feeling better.  Hit us up here if we can do anything at all for you!  Best wishes!,SuicideWatch,ct8fi78,1,t5_2qpzs

When  in  people have rape fantasies you really dont need to carry all this shame because you fantasise about something that is illegal or what you consider immoral. Everyone has experienced fantasies and arousal at some point towards something they would never wish to do in real life. I think the issue for you is that you are not comfortable with your current porn habits and find it difficult to stop. It also seems to be implied that you dont think you can have a regular sexual relationship because of this.If this is causing considerable distress a cognitive psychologist would be a good option.

There are other major and career options he could take that he could probably outperform in as well as be financially stable. But when I bring those options up he doesnt want to deal with the stress of those jobs even though Ive found low stress options as well. But I guess from there those jobs are stressful because you still have to be the best for some reason and if youre not youll lose your job. I suggested software engineering for him which I still think he should pursue but I dont know if that would help right now. And I dont know how he got it into his head that he needed to be the very best and to do that he couldnt make a single mistake. Science is all about making mistakes and learning from them.

5136673,0,t1_cv2vur1,It sounds like youve identified a feedback loop where you dont have very many reasons to see other people such as a job and as a result spend a lot of time alone which makes it easier to be depressed. And then being depressedanxious makes it harder to venture out into the world thus further diminishing the amount of time you spend around other people...and this feedback loop continues. Does that sound right?I want to ask do you enjoy being around other people? Do social situations typically make you feel better or at least distract you from your more negative thoughts?

5208829,0,t1_cvdkn6y,I think its best to start to work at setting your mind into the current moment and short term. Thinking too much about the future can be overwhelming and send people into a downward spiral. You dont have cancer. You have an idea of what you want to do in university and you have the free will to work towards that every day. A shitty job can ba dragging you down but you can send resumes and put the effort into bettering that situation.  If you begin to destress and take small steps to be kind to your body with a little exercise and better food you will build up a body that will be able to keep the cancer at bay or more easily fight the cancer cells with the help of medicine.  I used to spend a lot of my time bogged down with thoughts of my worst case scenarios which left me paralyzed in the current moment and not enjoying the good days that go by. I believe you can make some small changes to make your present days better which will help make an awesome future and give you back the control that you feel is out of your hands. ,SuicideWatch,cvduudh,1,t5_2qpzs

5221752,0,t3_3mitau,Although not quite to your extent I also went through most of my life without forming any sort of connection with another person.I think thats actually a common theme in this sub because of how helpless being alone truly makes us feel. The thing Ive always found curious is that loneliness is actually one of best ways to form a connection with another person. Almost everyone I know even people with more friends then they can count feel lonely because there is never a way for us to communicate everything we want or to understand everything other people want to tell us.Learning to live in this harsh reality and learning to communicate with other lonely people is also part of life. Even just an interaction where you say hi to someone in a coffee shop or ask someone a question at work can give us insight into how to communicate with the people you regularly interact with. Forming relationships with other people even if in small steps was the most rewarding thing I ever experienced and I think you will find the same.When I finally broke through and made a real connection with another person is was life altering because I could really communicate all the things I thought no one would ever understand and they could do the same for me.

5297559,0,t3_3njwfn,Hey there friend I just want to share a personal experience related to this.Honestly I often do feel this same feeling of being a burden onto others. Heck it led me to posting a few times in this own subreddit.The one thing to remember is that feeling you get when you help others. That warm feeling you get when you can help someone out of a bad place. Now imagine that x. Thats the kind of awesomeness people feel when they help someone in your situation that dont have depression.Dont think of it as some kind of challenge to people to somehow indirectly hurt them think of it as giving them the opportunity to give someone they know a bunch of happiness. Because honestly thats the way we do feel when we help!Also another thing and I dont mean to make it sound like your worries are false quite the opposite but the likelyhood of someone identifying you are very very low. And even then I dont feel like they would respond with irrational behavior or hatred they would see someone hurt and try to help. Reaching out online has helped me so much in the past and youve already overcome that first obstacle! Finally I want to talk about that last paragraph. Would you like to talk more about your feelings towards sex? Do you feel as if you arent attracted to anyone or is it more just the anxiety of having it in the first place? If its the former then maybe try checking out rasexuality sometime. It could give you some closure or a lot of support.Never be afraid to reply,SuicideWatch,cvotogl,2,t5_2qpzs

But this is your life with all its shitty downs. I know its cheesy but this is you and this is what will make you you. It hurts immensely right now but struggle like that makes us better people almost super human. The world needs people like you who have went to hell and back because its people like you who act as a light to guide others. All the people who have shaped our world have had shitty lives like yours just think about that for a second.Dont you ever give up on yourself and all the people you will help in the future. The more they put you through the more valuable your wisdom will be. No one can ever take that away from you so derive strength from that and survive for the rest of us. Try to play this smart avoid confrontation with your parents because they will never change and it will only bring you pain. Keep your brother and your friend close to you. When youre independent thats when you can show them that you were right all along.Hang in there think logically and plan your future life! If it means tricking your parents for their financial support till you can escape then do just that. Theres nothing wrong or immoral with pretending to play along temporarily to survive for the greater good.

5563253,0,t1_cwmbb8b,Youre right my friend it seems bad stuff does happen to good people but obviously good things do too and its useful to be able to focus on those things if possible.  Every day where nothing particularly good happened could be thought of as a day when nothing particularly bad happened too.  Living for other people isnt such a bad way to live your life. Ive seen plenty of examples of that in the hospital recently  doctors and nurses who seem to be at work permanently all devoting their lives to people they barely know the names of.  There was even a cleaner who stopped near me in the evening to make a phone call to her child at home. She was saying that there was pizza to cook and a few other things like please dont let mummy come home to a mess tonight but the way she was talking sounded like the child was maybe ten years old. When she finished the call she said love you lots like jelly tots and she saw me smiling. She then said hes sixteen and we both laughed. People can live for others but thats not all that matters to them and though they dont always show it people live for you too. People care about you you care about people so you have to care about yourself. I think really thats all we have and thats good enough.,SuicideWatch,cwmo77p,1,t5_2qpzs

I specialize in training dark and ghost Pokemon. I like different Pokemon for different reasons. The first game I played was gold but I consider myself a Gen  kid because sapphire was the first game I played to completion and its what got me really hooked so I like mostly Hoenn Pokemon I guess I can name a few for every region though. For kanto I love Gengar. Its a bit of a glass cannon but any strong special offensive team mate is a winner. For Jhoto I really like Houndoom. Houndoom is the Pokemon that started my specialty for training dark Pokemon. For Hoenn theres too many to name. I always make sure theres a mightyena a sableye and a shedininja with the sturdy ability on my team. For Sinoh I really like froslass and spiritomb. I wasnt gonna list legendaries but Giratina is my favorite legendary and its from Sinoh. Unova chandelure. Never got too much into the game though. And Kalos... I guess I have to name another legendary because I love Yveltal. That ended up being a long ass list  sorry about that. Once I start talking about Pokemon I cant stop,SuicideWatch,cwx62dr,1,t5_2qpzs

But social isolation is incredibly hard on our mental health and it sounds like youve ended up disconnecting from your social support network.  If you have a history of being bullied then all that trauma can come back to haunt you when you experience a milder form of rejection.  We can all end up being social outcasts for one reason or another.  It was like that for me until I was in my mid s so I can relate.  I hope that youll keep talking about this here or wherever you feel comfortable.

5847343,0,t1_cxk93dz,I never felt like therapy was worthwhile. Never had anything to say. They always wanted to find some reason and there is no reason its just the way it is. I still see a psychiatrist for medication trials and I know I could ask or say anything to him if there were anything to say. He actually asked that I call this week just to check in since his schedule was full and itll be  months between appointments instead of the usual one month...but theres nothing to tell so not sure Ill even call.Like anyone moods fluctuate even if only from worst to less worse but Ive dealt with depression for over  years with no significant improvement. It doesnt go away and come back like it does for some people its always there. The only time I had relief was a couple months back on the Emsam patch but it tore my skin up so I had to stop using it. The oral MAOIs havent agreed with me and that was the last psychiatry approved treatment left to try. Leaves only suicide as the last cure.,SuicideWatch,cxm457t,1,t5_2qpzs

5864630,0,t1_cxod4ye,I had the same thought that these things keep happening to me and I just dont want to be around anymore. In October my ex broke up with me through text message we dated for  months. I felt this way then tooA few weeks ago a former coworker who I adored cheated on his girlfriend with me but he basically indicated he wanted me instead. Then in the morning he said it was a one time thing but I went into it thinking it wasnt. I told him that I felt suicidal and he drove over to see me and we agreed to be friends. He came over a few times and we just talked but every time it was me wanting to see him and he kept trying to cancel our plans every time. He texts with one word ambiguous answers or tried to fake make me feel better.Ive never been the first person to tell them I love them until him. Last night I sent him so many hate filled and suicidal messages and I dont know why I did it but now he blocked me out of his life.I kept asking him what is it about me that makes me so unlovable and so...disposable? I tried so hard. I feel really used and like you I feel like Im done. But i think there are things in this world worth living for other than people even if Im too fragile to be here which I am. Ive decided to put my everything into my job and attempt to forget about the past. Im just trying to keep myself busy so Im not alone with my thoughts because thats when I feel worse. Im not sure if you have things to occupy you but I hope you find something other than some idiot who didnt realize your worthIt makes me so angry that girls like us have to deal with this and I hope we all stay strong and get through it ,SuicideWatch,cxodtmo,1,t5_2qpzs

5986362,0,t1_cy47pu5,Thanks man. I hate the medication route and see a psychiatrist and psychologist. My friends and family all arent sure whats happened to me either. They accused me of being on cocaine because sometimes I would get these really happy episodes.Honestly it was a bad string of decisions. A girl I connected with and messed around with suddenly her boyfriend wanted to stab me and was stalking her and me. I am a muslim and a guy I befriended as he was a new convert to the religion told me he was gay and wanted to kill himself because he was in love with me. My parents and I are separated by about  generations theyre in their s Im in my s I go insane at work I dont eat or sleep right. I have no sexual desire since women have always caused so much trouble lately anyways.I cant seem to find any peace and when I do get semi religious and start feeling better I start seeing weird signs and coincidences and start to feel like theyre are these messages all around me from the t.v episode that I watched to the words of friends and family all interpreted through some sort of filter that I have to decode. I fear for my sanity and think I might be schizophrenic sometimes or at the least have psychotic depression. I keep isolating myself more and more Im lethargic paranoid and riddled with anxiety all the time. Im a role model for my nieces and nephews but the only relief I get is from alcohol as it helps me not think. But I would rather kill myself than become a perpetual alcoholic which really does seem like the only medicine that helps. I go to the gym Im healthy at least I look it I have a very high kept appearance with great clothes and style and hair and all that. I take good care of my appearance and I am always told I am eloquent with my words.This works against me because the doctors think Im completely fine and lying to them but my feelings are real. I have intrusive thoughts all the time that I try to fight but fail over and over and over. Somethings gotta give I cant live my life this way.Im trying to snap out of it and not think too much and not think the world revolves around my head but I am literally a prisoner in my own head all the fucking time. I dont trust anyone anymore I dont feel happy ever and cant enjoy anything and dont have any goals because everything seems mundane and like it will just end up shitty because I touched it anyways. TLDR this is just an off my chest post of all that is wrong with me. woe is me type of bullshit I know I am weak and should just exit the gene pool I would never want to have kids and subject my putrid horrible genes on them. ,SuicideWatch,cy4cd9c,1,t5_2qpzs

I had the same experience coming off of uppers and I remember thinking that I was screwed because I couldnt feel anything or even remember simple facts like things I learned as a kid... It does take time but the brain is incredible. You will heal. Your brain will begin to send and receive the proper the neurochemical messages in a few weeks youll need to get plenty of rest and make sure youre eating and staying as active AS POSSIBLE. I know its very difficult. The ahedonia makes it almost impossible to get moving and youll feel anxious and depressed for sure but if you stay sober it will gradually begin to balance out. You have to hang on though. I tried to overdose on Xanax after I came off the hard drugs thats how bad I felt and how much I just wanted to sleep. My friend who is a neurologist explained what was going on but he has studied the brain extensively and he assured me that the damage was not permanent. There may be certain things that seem to linger like trouble with concentration and impulses which can lead to relapse but thats the thing... If you fight it every single day that you fight it youll heal. Your brain will heal. Give it time. Im here for you. Message me before you use again thats all I ask. Message me first. If I cant talk you out of it thats ok but maybe I can. Maybe the extra few minutes of decision time will make a difference.

6025146,0,t1_cy86x9t,Still possible maybe likely enough to justify my daily pain? Well have to see.. No I dont want to try and claim its worse than what you can imagine or even something you have experienced in fact your incessant need to help draws me to the conclusion that youve been through enough to arrive at this point in your life I know people arent naturally as nice as you or I Ive met enough to know that for a fact its experience that changes us. I may even consider going as far as to say although in the case of more serious matters such as death of relatives pets impending death of self drunken parents beating I have dealt incredibly well I may have found my Achilles heel. This may just be the kind of pain I simply cant deal with which for a normal person you could simply say Dont think about itfocus on other things and they would be able to get past it but me being weak combined with my overactive torture chamber of a mind may be too much for me to handle. Interesting how this perspective makes me see something of a weakness in myself and want to change to protect and improve myself like my dad always instilled in me from football maybe Im not as emotionally stable and concrete as I once thought. ,SuicideWatch,cy9f2yf,1,t5_2qpzs

Insurance companies are getting on board so I think if you live in the US or similar countries you can get access to transition without being rich. If youre dealing with depression please seek some help for that.

If you have any money left at all it might make sense to get a storage unit for your stuff until you get back on your feet. Especially if its expensivehard to replace. If you are dead ass broke you may have to sell your tools. It sucks to sell your possessions but you may be able to make enough money for a security deposit at a new place. Go on craigslist to search for shared rooms you may be able to find something fast. Its rough I know. I was kicked out at  with  to my name. Just enough money for gas to get to a friends house an hour away. I slept on a closet floor in a seedy apartment for  months. Eventually I was able to get a steady job that paid above minimum wage so I moved in with my boyfriend. It was rough living but it brought me some strange form of happiness. One of the best times of my life actually.You can get through this it wont be easy but it will make you stronger.

6206410,0,t3_40l0uj,May be a long shot but check out Sonic Highways on HBO. I was feeling very down for almost the same reasons. Ive been in bands all my life signed a couple times and now Im almost  and only play to my dog after work in the basement. I watched it and it really put perspective that even the little things Im doing in my basement are contributing to the art. It makes me feel better about practicing my craft and even got me recording some little things using my phone. If you dont play an instrument it also shows the way music of any kind connects people and an important part of those connections are the people with the love that keep music alive for all. The fans roadies engineers everyone needs music in their life. Whether performing or spreading the message. I havent loved myself in a longtime but Ive always held my love for music close. Hopefully that will someday help us both. ,SuicideWatch,cyv3pcx,2,t5_2qpzs

6208420,0,t1_cyvay6n,Being alone is a piercing feeling. Its not quite loneliness which is one of those feelings you can get several times a day. Its not even being left alone which I consider peace of mind a lot of the time. Its that feeling you get when youre sitting up at  AM about to watch the sun come up knowing theres no one there or worse theres plenty of people there and you still feel like youre out in the cold.I did it to myself for so long I made an identity too. Not like someone I use in chat rooms or on social media  or even ingame. It started as someone I pitied and ended as someone I felt like I had to meet. In the end I turned that person into the lead character for a book Ive been writing for  months. Whats worse is that every day I go back to this manuscript and write and trying to bring this guy a happy ending and its never coming. But it does make me feel better to look in on him and see that I can live while he goes on doing what he has always done.This identity youve made is it truly how you feel about YOURSELF? Or is this someone and something you wouldnt have recognized years ago? If you cant separate yourself from that person there may come a time where the burden of that identity becomes too heavy and I implore you to let that person go. Wash your hands of them and in your mind turn the page to something youve never thought about before.If you cant recognize the person and every time you think about this identitypersonality then youre already halfway there. That beast is just the weight of depression trying to snuff out whats left of you and I would beg you not to let it. Youre too rare a person to suffer at its hands.Do me a favor. Take a day for yourself. I dont know about you but the sun is out here and I cant stand it. Its too bright and I have to have the dark of night to think. However I want whatever works for you to be figuratively bright and sunny. It doesnt have to be today. Just work up a bit of strength and settle in for an introspective day.Take a walk. A long walk. Listen to a record and close your eyes. When you reopen them write down or inwardly record what scene they made you think of. What happy place the songs took you to. Record them. Theyre now plans to go there. Take out a pad of paper and draw. Dont pay attention to rules. Dont worry about shapes. Just draw because you can and no one has any power to change that. Take a drive. Go to your favorite spot and then keep going. Go further than youve seen and return. When you reach a new horizon stop and get out. Enjoy the scenery. Watch the people. See the solitude. Hear the comforting chaos. Wrap yourself in it and get lost in it for a moment. I know this all sounds hopelessly philosophical and quite frankly like Im Deepak Chopra or some snake oil salesman but it has kept me alive and I feel so much better afterwards. After youve done it if you decide to please...tell me about it. Id like to know if you find something new about yourself and if that new thing has kept your spirit moving.Heh. Want to hear my goofy depression stormshelter? I promise its silly. I drive or walk to a QT gas station near me and I buy a ridiculously oversized novelty drink. typically cherry Dr. Pepper or something to that effect Then I cruise on out to a mall near me. The mall has this tiny piece of shit courtyard that has a wimpy water fountain and a few dilapidated wooden benches. I strap on my hilariously big pair of headphones and of course theyre cans for sound quality. Then I listen to Katatonias Unfurl on repeat I repeat this process consistently and Im not proud to admit how much money Ive spent on huge fountain drinks and gas to do this but if it keeps me going I dont just value itI require it.,SuicideWatch,cyvbwpa,2,t5_2qpzs

Looking back things seemed better you werent trapped in the mire of your current purgatory. Looking back you wonder if it will ever be that good again. If youll ever feel normal again.This is how depression beats people. It is a devil whispering in your ear convincing you that nothing shall ever get better. Promising you that if you just gave up and let go the pain and suffering would end.That is a damn lie. Insidious and manipulative. Never believe it. Not once. Today may seem like hell. It may have been hell for a very long time now. But your life will be wonderful again  believe it. Despite the adversity you must overcome despite the hurdles and the heartbreaks I promise you beyond a shadow of a doubt that if you believe in yourself life will get better.All you need do is take the reins of your fate and keep hammering away as you have been doing. This is a dark dark valley you are walking through. But on the other side lies a verdant meadow where blue skies and the company of good friends await you. Keep fighting. Every day you do not give up you have won another inch another foot another mile towards paradise.Ok moving on.. Its ok to get help. Death is forever but even if you have to go inpatient to get help for your depression then its okay. Thats a small fraction of your long life. You DESERVE to be happy. Depression convinces us that we dont but we do you do OP. If you had cancer you would get chemo so if you have go through rough treatment for just a small fraction of your life to be internally happy then thats ok too.

You say I just failed an exam am losing my girlfriend to a guy more exciting than meI know it seems like it all may be crashing in front of you but I can bet its not. Yeah a F on an exam is never good but hey if everything fails you can retake the class right? Failing never feels good and its not fun to think about but the best part about failing is trying again and seeing yourself succeed. You can do it. You made it this far dont stop now.Now you talk about your girlfriend and this other guy whos more exciting than you. Fuck that. If your losing her to someone else she isnt worth it. Now if thats something in your head because you are upset you owe it to yourself and her to bring it up and talk about it. Maybe taking about it will bring some clarity and you will see its not true or that she isnt worth your time. You said you feel like a failure and ashamed. Man can I relate to that. Daily. But you know what helps me? Looking back and seeing what I went through to get where I am now. Maybe that will help you. I try to think about what I did and the choices I made. Yes not all of them were the best but hey they got me here. Some were the best choices I ever made and some were the worst. But the worst is always worse than what Im going through now and the best just makes me want to get there again.You say your friends moved away and you lost all that made you. Bro thats bullshit. Other people didnt make you. You made you homie. Dont forget that. Yeah friends are nice to chill with and kick back but you can make more. Yeah its no where as easy as it is when your a kid but the friendships you make now will last longer than you imagined. This week get out and go outside. Go for a walk take in nature and fresh air. Think about what you have been doing and what can be different. Find your motivation or as I call it your light and run with it. Take that light to a new level.

6471030,0,t1_czod92f,It sounds like they rationed you into treatment which would be suitable for someone with less severe anxiety less severe depression and no PTSD.  Then the system did not respond to the fact you were deteriorating.   What kind of therapy was used?  Was your therapist trained to deal with PTSD?  I have seen a few accounts of people having their PTSD awoken by an unwary therapist who is unable to fix what they have stirred up.  Have you had a diagnosis from a psychiatrist or was it just done by a GP?  It is common for PTSD to be latent and to be suddenly activated months or many years later by a stimulus which may seem far too small to cause such severe destruction.  This is a commonish pattern in people with preexisting trauma from childhood.Since your problems go back a long way do you have developmental trauma  CPTSD?  Wikipedias PTSD page has thisQuasiexperimental studies have demonstrated a relationship between intrusive thoughts and intentional control responses such that suppression increases the frequency of unwanted intrusive thoughts. These results suggest that suppression of intrusive thoughts may be important in the development and maintenance of PTSD.   .  Your description of losing your sense of self is something we see a lot here in people with traumatic backgrounds.  What exactly do you mean by losing your self?   Doesit fit the description of depersonalisation here?       I have had the feeling disconnected part of this  years ago during depression. It never felt like anything was lost though.  The feeling can be created temporarily by dissociative drugs.  In the case of depression and anxiety depersonalisation normally is just one of the symptom it will be cured or reduced as the underlying disorder is alleviated.   The loss of a sense of self may feel extreme internally without being obvious to outsiders at least on the internet.  People who feel their self has been destroyed or lost can still act online like full people  caring considerate people with a personality interests ethics.   ,SuicideWatch,czonf46,2,t5_2qpzs

6484039,0,t3_44gbhg,Honestly you sound pretty amazing. Not only do you really care about your family and friends but you have this insight and self awareness about your feelings re suicide that may help you to influence how you feel for the better. I have also thought about suicide for years and years. I have used my awareness of this tendency to build on the list of things that keep me here and contribute to happiness versus misery. Over time I have gone from actively suicidal to thinking about how it would be nice to escape but making my life better is the way to go as opposed to taking myself out of it. I dont know if that helps..Do you have a therapist you like? I see a therapist weekly for years and this gives me a place to vent out those feelings without bringing my family down on myself. She also has helped me improve hard coping skills so the tendency to think about suicide has greatly reduced.   Youve got this lt And you can vent here anytime too. ,SuicideWatch,czpzxcs,2,t5_2qpzs

6540064,0,t3_456i9r,I hope this can be helpful from the info I gleaned from your post. If not disregard. Ive had a pretty shitty ridiculous life. Like incredibly ridiculous. I have a lot of problems dealing with it. A number of years ago things got incredibly bad. Like flunking out of school not leaving the house for  months laying in bed  hours a day unable to care for myself bad. So I started trying to see someone to get help.  Remember when I said how ridiculous my life was? I realized that not everyone knew what to do with me or how to handle me few did actually. I saw one therapist who made jokes at my expense because she seemed to feel so awkward talking about what I have gone through. Another told me I should read more about natural disasters and tragic figures in history to give me some perspective on my life. Another gave me a book about thinking away depression. Geez thats all I have to do? Just think?! I felt like a loser. These were medical professionals and they didnt know how to help me it was obvious that there was something wrong with me and nothing would ever get better. It wasnt until one of my good friends went to grad school for counseling that I realized that some therapists and counselors out there have  years of education and may have very little background or foundation in many issues related to mental health. They honestly might not know how to handle certain cases or may be better in some areas than others. I also realized that my case may be a little different than others. So I saw a psychiatrist. It was actually incredibly helpful. I got a diagnosis of PTSD instead of the anxietydepressiondysthymiaetc. that I had been labeled with over the years and I was lucky enough that the psychiatrist had a foundation of working with people like me. I still have problems but I realized I had to find someone who could handle me and had experience in treating my problems. I noticed you talk about therapists and counselors in your post its possible that the people youve seen maybe dont have the right experience to really make a connection with you or that maybe theres a piece of your diagnosis missing. Have you seen a psychiatrist? If not I would recommend it. Be honest about your struggles so far. My psych was blown away by some of the ways professionals had tried to treat me in the past. It only made things worse. My point is the problem is most likely not with you but rather that you might not have found the right connection yet. Please keep trying. The first couple of sentences of your post remind me so much of that period in my life when I felt the lowest. I remember at one point thinking that the only thing I was good at was waking up in the morning and going to sleep at night and sometimes not even good at that. So I just kept doing that. I hated it I felt like this isnt a life. But I just kept doing it. I got a plant and started caring for it. At that point I did  things a day wake up care for plant go to sleep. And then I just kept doing that. I intentionally added things to my life that would keep me alive if I died the plant would die. I couldnt die. I dont know if this was helpful but I hope you can keep trying. Theres nothing inherently wrong with you and you can get help. There is help out there for you. It just hasnt found you yet. ,SuicideWatch,czvsnro,1,t5_2qpzs

6640934,0,t1_d063kmi,It is a curse but curses can be lifted. Words cannot express how much I hated being your age it was a total fucking hell. Its bad enough being a teen but being on the spectrum plus having OCD at that age isnt a joke so I feel I can relate to your experiences a little. The only thing I can say it that once you leave school you suddenly realise that all of these pricks and bastards who ruled your life and seemed to dominate everything count for precisely zero in the real world. The big fish of school life just disappear out in the real world and then you can start being you. I left school and never saw any of my classmates again. The social ties and structures of school dont apply now.As I grew up and my emotions settled I still had my problems but I gradually just learned to give less fucks. The beauty of growing older really is that you realise you dont have to give a shit about what any dickwad thinks about you. You are you not someone else they can just deal with it. I long ago stopped trying to fit in. If someone likes me fine if not its their problem I dont get worked up about it just smile politely and move on. I have a couple of friends and a number of acqaintences but I have absolutely no interest in pursuing any more friendships it would be just too overwhelming. Im a loner and thats fine. I have my family and own particular interests to occupy me.My point in all of this is that you are currently at a stage in life that very very few adults would like to revisit. The confusion fear and stress that teens go through is legitimate and very real and can only be exacerbated by a disorder like ours. Unfortunately it is so hard to see an end to these struggles as the added depression twists our view of ourselves and our place in the world. I havent got a magic wand for you but I can say that you arent alone in this and if you can give yourself the time and breathing space you might be able to find away for you to cope.Please take care.,SuicideWatch,d068aoq,0,t5_2qpzs

6705308,0,t3_47fv6m,Im sorry about how things went with that group of people today. If it means anything Ive definitely noticed that people who havent ever been suicidal tend to have trouble really understanding that feeling and they get uncomfortable about it. I think that a good amount of them might have felt empathetic but were afraid to say something or didnt know what to say. And I realize they could have just said anything but again maybe they were too scared or didnt realize that. Personally I know that feeling of wanting to run away. I really relate to the idea of the cage and especially the seclusion from other people. And I relate to how you feel towards other people. You seem really kind and its sweet of you to think so much of your little sister. And I think that given your kindness and how much you care about other people it stands to reason that maybe your friends could be in a position to help you. I know you said they werent close enough but I always thought that too. My road to recovery from my lowest point had come partially from me being open to people who I knew would care and trying to accept their sympathy and seeing them go out of their way to do things for me. Im not saying that you necessarily should do it because I dont know enough about you or your social life. But I think it could be worth considering.

7210793,0,t1_d1wgze8,Wow this is very insightful. I get similar feelings about even being depressed. For example I think what right do I have to even be depressed? I still have it better off than half the world starving in huts cant afford medication etc.Im certainly not a qualified judge. Most of the reasons I hate myself are purely a result of overthinking. I certainly cant justify the reasons for my self hatred in comparison to the natural instincts of the human race. However as you know for people wired like us getting over these hurdles is nothing short of a miracle it definitely can happen. Im glad you overcame it.I completely get what youre saying though. Its hard for me to put things in words sometimes and its quite impressive the way you summed it up. Humans think they are superior to other species because of our consciousness and as a result of that we operate as if the world was designed specifically for us as if a world without humans would be a waste. The truth is all life is equally important the earth is a living thing too and without us it would be just fine. We just think that because no one would be there to perceive it that it would be a waste this is far from reality. Its ok to shoot a deer but not another person why? Animals tear each other apart and walk on the same ground as us they just dont go putting each other in jail because they seem to not know any better.

7249748,0,t3_4epobg,There is always a reason why we can do certain things and why we cannot do others.  The fact that youve only thought of the more complicated ways to kill yourself rather than the easy ones means that a part of you doesnt want to let go yet.  Thats also why you came here because you just want the pain to end you dont want to die you just want an easy fast way to stop the pain.So Im going to ask you to do something  I want you to make a list of your problems and then I want you to try to come up with a list of solutions to those.  Youve gone to Uni you had to be pretty damn smart to get in there so I know you can do this.Then sleep on it for a night or two and look at it again and see if you can improve on any of your solutions or if there are other problems you didnt think about.  Youre young...Ive been there...weve all been there....tons of other students are currently in your position not know where the future will take them in this fucked up world we live in and thats normal.  From this point on from this point where you said Enough is enough I need help and came here....this is where you define your future from here on out you define how things will go to the best of your ability.  Tonight or this morning...Im in the Midwest and you whackos down under are living in the future so I never know what time it is only that it makes my head hurt thinking about it....anyways whenever you see this...start fresh mark today as the start of you getting help or asking for help the day you start making changes.You dont want to die I dont want you to die...I want you to live and thrive and do some kickass awesome stuff but in order to do that youre going to have to be a little brave because it wont be easy and if you cant be brave then Ill try to be brave for you and I will listen to whatever you have to say and try to help as much as I can.  Yay run on sentences!  All the grammar twits are losing their mind when they look at my posts!

I nearly dropped out of college with one class left to take cutting myself sleeping constantly etc...  What helps me with expectations is you have to realize the worlds a really big place.  There are people who are janitors making minimum wage somewhere.  I love those people.  I cherish those people.  By any first world standards theyre scraping by and I respect that so much.  Ive woken up more times than I can count and felt like maybe I was put into this world to be sad.  That maybe thats just my job.  But as feeble as it may be I refuse to believe that.  NO ONE deserves to be sad.  NO ONE deserves to think they should die.  The more I believe that the more I seem to find people that regardless of how little I know them are willing to lend a voice or aid to my plight.  They might be total strangers on the internet but human beings are capable of some amazing compassion and I hope that you take advantage of this site and users like myself and other commentors to keep talking about how you feel and keep moving forward together with the rest of us.So yeah PM if you need to talk.

I am no mental health professional so I cant help you with your depresion but you mention you had a bad old love story.  You said love story.  So you are capable of loving!  You LOVED.  Find it in yourself to be open to feel it again.  If you are depressed please reach out and talk to someone who can help.  And once you do be open to the possibility that you will find love again.  The girl waiting for you may be going through the same thoughts as you right now.  I cant tell you when you will meet her I didnt meet mine until I was  years old but listen to me gehche YOU WILL MEET HER.  Start small think about someone that loves you for you. IT WILL HAPPEN! I spent so much of my s thinking it was not going to happen.  Searching for people to talk to online so I would not be lonely and then the funniest thing happened One of those people online said Hey I want to introduce you to someone.  Next thing I knew I was meeting this person and then found myself in a relationship with her.  We had our ups and down and have lost two children in the womb.  But through it all we were there for each other.  It was so unlikely to ever happen until it did.

7412463,0,t1_d2fq0hp,Hey bro I can relate. Seriously. I loved a girl all through high school. She was my life every morning I was excited to see her. When it all came crashing down ending in a fight and her cancelling going to senior prom with me would have been my first school dance I felt like my life was over. It spun me into a several month period of depression. Im sure if you have the patience you could go wayy back in my comment history and find the time this all happened because it was all that was on my mind. I was also taking accutane at the time which has a side effect of severe depression. All of it hit me at once it was by far the worst time of my life so far. I left school one day intending to kill myself. I pulled over to decide how I did not want there to be something gross left behind so I decided pills. I went back to my car and realized somehow to this day I have no idea how I managed this I always have my pockets full of my stuff my keys phone literally everything I had including pills were inside the car locked. I was forced to sit there for a couple hours was a not very much traveled road until someone from school who recognized me pulled over. I used his phone to call AAA and then had to wait for them to come.Point is after being denied my right to take my life I just wanted to see my parents. I finally opened up and told them what I had been struggling with. And that is what I had needed to do the whole time.It was not easy and I was still depressed and sometimes suicidal but I decided to not give up. I started to live for others just wanting to make others smile and not wanting anything in return. That is what finally got me out of depression because it was the only way I could be lonely but happy.Anyways I am now married to an incredibly sweet beautiful girl and I am forever thankful that I locked myself out of my car that day. I do hope you read my story here and I do hope you understand that you cannot rely on life to make you happy. I know what you are feeling that cold empty dark lonely place youre at and I want you to know that there is more. You need the help of others though please please please open up to your closest loved ones about this. And if you already have share that its getting worse. I dont even know you but I love you man I wish I could be there for you and help you through this.,SuicideWatch,d2kqy4u,1,t5_2qpzs

7504874,0,t3_4i12x4,I dont know I feel like it could either be  way more lyrical or  way more personal. Going anywhere in between seems sort of borderline cliche. Its like you want it to be universal but you cant help but including some personal info e.g. edgy teen which sort of makes this testament of your suffering sort of awkward. Perhaps you could include an extended metaphor somewhere? At the same time I dont find your arguments convincing. I feel like more thoughtelaboration could be put into them. Thatd really make this note stand out.For instance I think your understanding of human nature is sort of flawed. Here let me break the note up sentence by sentencegt For some life is a pleasure. Something they enjoy something they love to experience.I understand you needed an attentiongrabber for your introduction something to lead the reader into the rest of your note but this just seems lazy. You very briefly describe a life totally unlike yours because you want to contrast it with your own insufferable existence right? But this perfect life you describe is a total caricature. I think if you described a normal life and I mean normal not some brief idealization and then said something like Thats not for me. I think youd have something good going here. Youd have to come up with a convincing argument for why that sort of life is not for you though. And its gotta be more relateable.Only a god can go through life unscathed. gt  Im not one of those people an edgy teenager who hates his life and wants to end it.Poor transition. Also acknowledging that youre an edgy teenager makes it look like youre trying to sound selfaware and while selfawareness is a good thing I think trying to sound selfaware is something an edgy teenager would do.gt Why? Ive thought about my future and where it will end.This argument is very poor. No one knows what the future holds. Your life isnt a Greek tragedy Fate does not exist. The stars incline us they do not bind us.gt  I only see two options.You only see two but Im sure there are plenty more. Youre limiting yourself.gt I slowly grow apart from others slowly isolating myself and dying alone or I kill myself now while I still have friends and prevent that slow descent into agonizing loneliness.This is another extraordinarily poor rationalization. Youre going to kill yourself over the possibility of being alone? Youre not even alone yet. Besides people shed friends all the time finding new ones isnt going to be difficult. And a third counterargument Who says loneliness is a bad thing? Its your perspective that is keeping you hogtied. gt Some people dont understand that it doesnt get better. These are people who get sad sometimes and think they know what it means to be depressed. Yet all these people are successful. Theyre all people who have a support network of others that they can trust. Theyre sad that their fish died? They can go cry on their friends shoulders. This is again a gross oversimplification and a complete caricature. You add a bit more depth than you had in the introduction but this is still a really ridiculous passage that fish line lol. In this exerpt you alienate yourself from what you think a normal life is. Youre saying Here this is what I think is normal. Look how notnormal I am! You provide a really bad definition of normal and this failure to provide a realistic definition causes your entire argument to fall flat. gt Yet what happens to the people who dont have a friend? They dont have anyone who they can trust. They dont have an outlet for their emotions. They get to keep everything bottled up inside and since the stress is never released it just builds up and magnifies to ever increasing anguish.Makes the assumption that there arent outlets other than society with friends. What didnt you feel some catharsis in writing this note? What do you think the purpose of art is?gt I guess I finally cant handle the pain anymore.This is better but not visceral enough. gt The constant selfhatred I feel towards myself since I keep living has finally convinced me to just take my life and end it. Do I think this couldve been prevented? If somehow you could change my personality change my life and just change me as a person so that Id stop being such a toxic asshole in life perhaps that wouldve stopped me from committing suicide. I couldve had friends a supportive group of peers and maybe even people wouldve appreciated me. I mean knowing that youre an asshole makes you one step ahead of all the assholes who dont. In this excerpt you again express your longing for a normal life e.g. I couldve had friends but it feels sort of hollow. You have a lot of unrealistic expectations I guess and because reality isnt matching your expectations youll forfeit reality and kill yourself. Also good on you for recognizing the obvious counterargument i.e. you can change.gt But that cant happen. Its almost impossible to change someones personality yet more impossible to keep that change and definitively impossible to change peoples perceptions of ones personality.Your refutation of that counterargument is disgusting. WHY isnt it possible to change? I guess you get into that later down heregt See everyone already hates me. Almost everyone I know despises me dislikes me or just barely tolerates my existence. How do you know this though? I think these sentences would be a lot more poignant if you described an experience of yours where you were bullied or made to feel lonely. In fact adding a couple personal experiences in here would really give the note some life. gt Im a net drain on society as a whole. Thats a fact.I dont know how to critique this because it sort of comes out of no where. I mean it sounds bold but it looks more like you were just looking for a place to use the phrase net drain. Seems to be poorly reasoned imho. Also gonna need a source on that fact.gt You cant dispute it you cant try to say but name I personally like you! Congratulations you found one person who likes me. Yet what about all the other people who dont like me whatsoever? Its pretty solipsistic to think that your opinion is the only one that matters.Seems like you went through the trouble of writing this because you wanted to use the word solipsistic. Also isnt it sort of I dont know ungrateful for you to disregard someone elses appreciation like that? Besides if people who appreciate you if their opinions dont matter then why do the people who depreciate you why do their opinions matter? And what if I argue that neither of those peoples opinions matter and that the only opinion of you that matters is your own? And you might reply with Well I hate myself and that opinion wont change. to which Id reply Why not? To which youd replygt I hate the person being that very faulty person that everyone else wants to go away. I also hate that person who just completely screws up in everything he does so much that nobody will trust him to do anything anymore. But the thing I hate most about this person the reason why I want to kill this person is that this person isnt some abstract concept I want to divorce from myself its that this person is an intrinsic part of me and the only way to remove this person from the world is to remove me from the world.To which Id reply Yeah no. People change. Human nature isnt static. Growth is possible. Existing within time permits the possibility of change. Im sure there are those out there who believe time itself is change lol. In fact the only surefire way you wont change is if you kill yourself.Hope this helps I look forward to seeing any improvements. ,SuicideWatch,d2v9kie,2,t5_2qpzs

If you really want to gain weight you can do it.As for finding yourself and not knowing what to do youll be fine.

I had pounds of drugs so it took awhile to open each one and dump it out.    just dont carry them where people can tell you have drugs and carry a printout of the pharmacy so if the police stop you you can tell them exactly what youre doing which will be more believable if you have a printout of the location youre going to.  and if you have a variety mix them up into bigger bags it looks less likely that you are dealing when its not separated.  if you dont have lots of drugs keep them in the prescription bottles since in my state technically its illegal to carry them outside of the prescription bottles.  and dont speed or give the police any reason to pull you over.,SuicideWatch,d37m6zt,1,t5_2qpzs

7745687,0,t3_4ldyd5,I can tell you that suicide affects everybody around the person who did it. It doesnt matter who it was  whether it was the policeman who took the call from your disoriented family the EMT in the ambulance the person you used to sit next to in class the teacher who learned your name or even the nice old man you used to casually speak to at the gym every once in a while people care. Suicide is the most disheartening thing that happens. It basically is telling everybody around I just cant do this anymore  fuck it. Im done living life there is no point and there is no point for you to live life too. It is a demoralizing event that affects everybody around you in ways that you cannot tell. There have been multiple studies confirming that when people hear of a suicide the likelihood of suicidal thoughts increase in that individual. When Robbin Williams killed himself there was a spike in suicides across the nation. And likewise in local communities when somebody commits suicide you can see the effects in suicide rates among those living in the community. Think about the outpouring of grief from the hiker who died in the Appalachians this past week. We spent thousands of dollars in resources attempting to save her before finding her dead body. People didnt think Why am I out here looking for this person I dont even know? We spent all the resources and manpower looking for her simply due to the fact that she is a human being and human beings have value. I can promise you the same decision would be made all over again if there was a chance of finding her. You have value simply because you are a human being. That means that people do care what happens to you even if it doesnt seem like it from your perspective. ,SuicideWatch,d3mmmr5,2,t5_2qpzs

Do you think the therapist is a good fit for you? Are you on any medication?Depression isnt just a way of thought or mindset it is biological. Sometimes therapy needs to be supplemented with antidepressants in order to really be effective. The fact that you are graduating from university actually puts you in a better position than many people in society dont put yourself down about your future!

7832418,0,t1_d3vkkwq,Yeah for one and a half year. Little progress. Tried several meds with no effect. Even though my current psychiatrist is good I feel like Ive given up on it like most things. Life in general. What my study on life has shown me is that the concept is meager and for me at current state not worth living.Ive always been quite good at science and systems in general? and also found it interesting. Later on the process and the logical approach really appealed to me. Though during my time with my psychiatrist Ive remembered that I manifested that emotions are not productive so I think I cut them off at a very young age. Maybe science was a place where my parting from emotions did work so I felt comfortable there and went for it? Or the other way around?Why I cut off emotions I dont know. I might have gone half my life without knowingthinking about it. But I remember seeing a pattern where all good things where eventually followed by a setback. So rather than the rocky roller coaster where you ended up at the level you started at anyways I went for a smooth ride. Stability is highly praised in school and society so it must be good! Or so naive little me believed it had to be. Or knew? Dont remember.gt I think the mistake that you are doing is that life cant be boiled down to an easy science solvable by man.Now youre setting boundaries btw easy science is with a couple variables is not what Im looking for. Ive articulated the concept far beyond that. Isnt impossible what supposedly we stretch after? M. Ali thought so Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world theyve been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. Its an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. Its a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing. The one thing I would want changed is my approach on it. Rather than learning stuff I find that by exploring I still enjoy things once in a while. PC games for instance. Real life adventures feels too much of a hassle and since its all done before any motivation erodes away before I get started. But I ramble.,SuicideWatch,d3wfjdh,1,t5_2qpzs

You certainly werent made to feel particularly important.Not that beneficial if you already have anxiety and difficulty feeling selfworth.I remember once going to see a psychiatrist for the second time. It became gradually clear he hadnt kept or reread whatever the notes from our previous meeting and was purely bullshitting through the session.It really messed with head. I definitely didnt believe that person was going to be beneficial for me since he couldnt even be assed to be on time or remember what I told him last time. It felt like someone was kicking me while I was down and I was very angry about that.Some mental health workers arent professional grade and you shouldnt subject yourself to them.I dont know about Massachusetts but I hope someone who does can point you to someone who is good for you.Youre in a reasonably good place all you need is to tackle your own internal problems and you can start to be happy.

7945104,0,t3_4o2epk,Oh brother. Reading your post made me sick to my stomach with regards to her pressing you into an open relationship when clearly it wasnt what you wanted. When she asked you for your blessing it really wasnt a question but only posed as one. Try to feel better that she was going to leave you no matter what. She is clearly using you as a stepping stone until her next relationship of fun and excitement came along. Please do not hurt anyone although you might have an urge to. And its not the other guy you should be angry at. She will do to the next man what she did to you if that helps.I along with countless other men have had similar situations with women. You are not alone. I would not suggest the ER unless you are in need of immediate and dire help. Try to find counseling with a man that suits you. I believe as a man we need to tread lightly when it comes to the system as it is these days as it always doesnt work in our favour.It seems third wave feminists get all the attention these days and decades of erosions to mens rights have left us under represented and thrown to the side in North America. Your financial life is going to be very difficult going forward but many men are able to get through it. Hopefully you will too.I too always made my partner my best friend and when things go to shit we are left all alone. Finding a male friend to talk to is very difficult. We have been taught not to share our feeling between our brethren. We are seen as week if we do but try to find someone. Be very selective of who you do pick.Do try to come to terms that this happened and its not all because of you. Go to youtube and watch videos by Sandman.

Im sure you were very masculine even if you didnt feel like it.

People on that subredddit may have the same questions and share some of their experiences with you about the struggles.From my understanding youre feeling unloved unwanted and isolated because no one is in touch of your true self and your true feelings. Besides being a genuinely kind person who cares to see others not suffer you try very hard to please people to be accepted. You know its okay to be not okay. Your feelings are valid and you dont have to be happy or okay all the time. Of course I hope you feel okay and happy but please know that you can be sad angry etc. It doesnt matter either youre a girl or a guy you as a person count. It is also more than okay to want to be heard wanted and loved. You are not needy to want these and you deserve them. I am very sorry you met many people who were so unkind and took advantage of you.

It frees you for something that might actually be a better fit does it not? And I ask these things as someone who went through a horrible break up a few years ago with someone Id been for a very long time. She left me for one of my friends. It sucked hard at the time but when someone does something like that or even just decides to leave for lesser reasons it reveals something important that is helpful for the person being left in the relationship which is the person leaving me is not the right fit right now.How about looking at it as the door opening that it is where you can walk in to a situation that doesnt include someone who has basically told you they would be dead weight to you in their present state? You say you have no money. Well maybe your ex wasnt a help on that front and perhaps might even have been an obstacle on that front. What if now you have an opportunity to get some real help that might help turn your fortunes around. How about looking at it like getting gifted with the opportunity to get unstuck and take a step towards a better life for yourself?Thats what ultimately my horrible horrible break up provided and Im not so sure it cant be the same for you. Hang in there please. It just might get better. Like Yogi Berra said It aint over til its over. Your life isnt. Please give it a chance to turn around. Ive been through it so Im a comrade pulling for you. You can do it. You are not alone. Dont try to do it alone. Help is out there even if its a hotline. Ive had to turn to those. No shame in it.

Which in my opinion is no different to gambling.And youre going to kill yourself because someone online told you to?

8212645,0,t1_d544b5l,Speaking as someone who is actively suicidal if youve just made the commitment to kill yourself tonight its not the time to do it. I follow the day rule myself. Others do  hours some go a week. Once youve made the decision to commit to killing yourself wait and see if you still feel the same way after x days. You dont want to perform the action that will end your life and then realize its a mistake especially if its going to be a slow death as it is with cutting. I believe anyone has the right to end their life but they should be  certain about it. That means not ending life on an impulse. I hope you make the right decision whatever that may be for you.,SuicideWatch,d544vji,1,t5_2qpzs

It needs to be taken seriously even if he hasnt tried to kill himself yet.

Im glad that you posted here instead of jumping off of that balcony.You did not invent your demons the contemplation of death and life is old and many humans alive and dead have given deep consideration to what can be called an inevitability. These thoughts do not make you strange or undeserving of compassion nor does your pain.Its hard to talk with people about suicidal thoughts though. Your landlord may not understand. They might want you to stay alive with the hope that you can perhaps get a better job and maintain the rent or they may be willing to evict you. But even if your landlord evicts you and your kids go with their mother your kids would still love you and want to see you.I dont know if these words help at all with your storm but I hope that you keep sailing.,SuicideWatch,d586ufh,1,t5_2qpzs

Well Im almost  and so far I didnt make career but after years of depression and being a mess I earn enough money to live comfortably and I have people I love and a place I like to call home. Thats not impossible to reach and I think its enough. Just go for a smaller goal You dont need to be amazing just happy. I understand that your former job was awful but I really dont want you to become homeless too. In addition a less terrible work environment may help with the social isolation too. I know it sucks that youre on your own and I wish there was someone to support you in this better than I can but this is what we got right now. You need work because being homeless is not going to make things any better. In return for applying for jobs please reward yourself somehow. This may sound weird but do something that shows you love yourself. Pat yourself on the back have a slightly fancier dinner take a bath use a face mask ... I know this isnt very masculine but its selfcare and it might just make you laugh too. If you feel you cant apply for a job right now because youre in really bad shape thats okay too.

Anyone would feel the way you do.But please dont believe the lie that youre simply an ungrateful bastard an awful human being that youve failed those closest to you. Because NONE of those things are true.Youre absolutely right when you say that you cant simply love someones mental illness away. You cant love someones physical illness away either. If you had broken your legs your boyfriend could give you all the hugs in the world and it wouldnt make the bones heal any faster.If you had broken your legs and hadnt received proper medical treatment would it make you an ungrateful bastard an awful human being or convince you that youve failed people if you werent able to walk and run the way you used to? Of course not.Would having a house two amazing parents friends a boyfriend etc somehow prevent a person from breaking their legs in the first place? Of course it wouldnt. So dont think yourself ungrateful. Lack of gratitude isnt the issue.The issue is that you are suffering and havent yet found a way to deal with it. And thats nothing to be ashamed of. I doubt you or those closest to you are medical professionals and even those who are cant guarantee any particular treatment with a  success rate.Depression is a difficult illness to treat because it actively prevents us from seeking treatment. It constantly lies to us about how pointless or hopeless or difficult that task would be. It magnifies failure and diminishes success. It tries to keep you in a spiral of guilt and fear and hopelessness.Its a horrible illness but it isnt your fault for having it. Nobody would choose to feel the way you do. You didnt choose to fall ill. But please dont believe the lie that you have no choice in how to deal with it.Do your parents know how much youve been suffering? If they are as amazing as you say theyll want to help you.You shouldnt have to tolerate feeling this way any longer. School is difficult enough without depression on top of it all. Please see a health care professional. Discuss treatment options. Do anything you think has even a chance of helping.If you have the courage and willpower to attempt suicide you definitely have the courage and willpower to seek treatment. Youve already shown courage in reaching out to us.Whatever you decide you still have us to talk to about it.You dont have to face this burden alone.,SuicideWatch,d6168lj,5,t5_2qpzs

Aside from the military which my school services a lot of many of my older students have been lifers working in food service or retail and they decide that just isnt what they want to do.

Ive felt this way with increasing severity for over a decade. It started when I was nine and here I am ten years later feeling the same shitty way. The only difference is I have less and less hope that things will change with each year. I have no hope now and the only thing stopping me is that Im scared of surviving an attempt with damage that only makes things worse. I tried killing myself before and was told how lucky I was not to have severed a tendon in my arm leaving it immobile. Im not afraid of the pain necessarily but Im afraid that something survival instinct a person finding me just bad execution will leave me alive and brain damaged or disfigured.Also thank you for replying.

8743519,0,t3_4zilmu,Just an idea  Given part of your username are you into haircuts?  Since youre in NYC you can check out cosmetology schools!  I originally graduated with a computer science degree so I never thought of this until my goth days I mean nights!.  Youll be able to meet others who are also into hair.  And during the school hours youll be imprisoned with other students so its easier than trying to meet people randomly to make friends.  It can be expensive and different states have different hours requirements i.e. how many hours you need to be in school before you can graduate.  I think for hair its about a year.  For skin aesthetician its less hours and nails are less hours than skin.  But you can go part time work during day school at night sometimes.Do your research as schools vary widely in terms of cost and quality.  The students vary widely as well.  In my class we had a little bit of everything  older younger gay straight married divorced single and multiple ethnicities.  Most were nice some were rude.  Especially with style there were the extremes of people brutally honest or fakeass liars but most were somewhere in the grey middle.  Drugs stealing etc. happened too but if you already are or can learn to be NYC streetsmart dont talk smack or throw shade too much about other students and dont do e.g. sex drugs rocknroll what you dont want to do itll be easier to deal with the situations.  Oh check to see if there are fights at the schools you research there werent at mine but I heard there were at the other school.  A fight can really mess up hair no matter how much product you use!  The whole thing is definitely an experience.When you graduate you wont make lots initially but it might be something you enjoy.  I had to toss my license and stick to computer work because I needed health insurance preexisting condition here but most everyone else utilized their license if they graduated.Or if poop is your preference theres probably a gastroenterologist or colorectal surgeon who might do an informational interview for you.  I know what doctors do with stool samples but Ive always wondered what info dogs are trying to gather from sniffing poop and more importantly what do they do with that info?

And... It looks as if you self medicate with other substances. You got a lot going on. I am sympathetic to ya so write back if you need to vent. Here are some options though. Call the school for help. They are highly invested in helping and not losing students. They will care. Call your prescriber. Suicidal thoughts could mean a change for your meds. Consider that your other meds that could be tricking your brain into depression. Also consider the other meds that give you false highs and set up cliffs to for you to fall into sadness.  It is like being caught in very very real illusion. Consider running a though experiment that being perpetually happy isnt an goal but happy is description for a moment. It is good to be productive and busy. This is more about philosophy than mental health. Just throwing that one out there for fun. Long way to say please dont do it.

So logically a note should be left. When a note is left many of them apparently say simple things such as Please feed the cats and some only say Im sorry or I love you. People say those arent enough. So if anything properly typing out a well detailed note is what would be the most helpful for them. I dont see why doing so wouldnt work. Everyone is okay in the end Im gone because my life purpose has been fulfilled and they have the answers they wanted. I was originally gonna do a little scavenger hint type thing for little prizes money extra details etc but I felt like that would be a stretch.

Im gonna be super straight with you right now because Ive literally been exactly where you are LSD and all.It actually sounds like you might be struggling with Complex PTSD I was mugged  years ago and developed delayed onset PTSD. I had a switch from being a totally normal person to my life being a constant struggle of anxiety suicidal thoughts and an inability to deal with social situations.The reason I asked if youve been through traumatic things is because you sound exactly like me one year ago before I got help. If you have the resources available to you wether through school work or some extra cash I would strongly encourage you to talk to a psychologist about your past and how it effects your everyday life now. It made my life a good thing again.Also talk to your best friend! If he knows you well already he will only enjoy getting to know you even more and the closest and most fulfilling friendships are made by opening up.Also Marijuana is good as long as its not a crutch  I smoke up with friends from time to time.Sending love your way man I know exactly where youre at and its fucking difficult but things can get better.,SuicideWatch,d8bjp93,2,t5_2qpzs

We all have to find meaning in our lives. There are many ways and the method chosen is much less important than that you choose a method and commit to it.   You could resolve to fight global warming and species extinction or you could acquire and nurture a pet rat or plant a vege garden or flowers.  You could set a career goal or a hobby goal.  You could become an expert in some subject and find meaning in using that knowledge to help people or to make a living and participate in your community.    Connections help a lot with meaning.

All sarcasm aside people perish in such a diverse range of circumstances every day and then one day you realize youre suicidal and you realize how hard it is to actually kill yourself off at will. Maybe God does exist after all...To be honest it sounds like you are not  on board to end it. Who is everyone? Because you cant possibly mean it literally. If you really want to die maybe risk your life to save another or in the fight for a good cause.Suicide can be a rational decision in a world that is as dysfunctional as ours. Depression used to be called a dark night of the soul an existential crisis. A lot of the time it is not a chemical imbalance a lot of things factor into it even if disorted thinking is also present. I think it would be good for you to evaluate your thoughts more because while you are right about your life being miserable now as a person with free will being so young you are luckier than a lot of us who are in this position. You dont have to be like this at least give it  more years what do you have to lose? You cant possibly think you know what the world has to offer you you might as well try to learn about how the world actually works since youre already here.

Today we talked again and i told her sincerely how i felt...at first she seemed  to understand me and then she took  mg of xanax.

10173940,0,t3_5lmepf,I feelfelt the same way. But one thing you need to realize is that that is how life goes. I have two friends and both of them are becoming memories at each of their own respective paces. One is almost a memory seeing that I hardly see him. And the other is settling down and getting ready to make that transition. Ive had a pretty hard life and a really fucked up family but terminating yourself isnt going to solve the problem you just have to get out there more and live your life. True life is based on the perception that people create based on their environment and societal experience but you can always choose to what you want that societal experience to be like the environment can also change but most of the times it takes longer because of the financial factor involved and thats something else that triggers other obstacles that we have to deal with. If you hold on you can slowly start making life better little by little. If you want a significant other then go out there and talk to people dont care if theyre a  physically give a care about how they connect with you. About how they make you feel as a person when youre with them. If you can spend hr with this person and it makes you feel like only mins have passed then youre on the right track. If you hate your job well welcome to the club but also dont forget that youre not a slave to them go out there with your best suit or dress on and hit those job applications hard. This is all easier said than done but everything in life is like that. Push yourself everyday to do better not for anyone but for yourself. I dont mind being a ghost or lonely its better that way while Im accomplishing things its better that no unwanted person notices. My girlfriend notices and shes a hell of positive person and thats all that matters. My negative individuals in my life thats cool they dont notice fuck them let them keep being idiots. I dont need their commentary on what Im doing. Remember you hit rock bottom what else is their left to do.....GO UP AND START CLIMBING OUT OF THE HOLE.

You are worthy of your own love of your own praise and companionship. You are always the person you can count on . Why depend on some external factor you can not control?

And as for the whole house and spouse with the  children and white picket fence if thats not your interest you dont have to have that its okay and if you do want it just start small go out on a date enjoy yourself dont try to rush anything just have fun youre still young you have plenty of time to figure yourself out.Theres a quote that always helps me out ...For what its worth its never too late or in my case too early to be whoever you want to be. Theres no time limit stop whenever you want. You can change or stay the same there are no rules to this thing. We can make the best or the worst of it. I hope you make the best of it. And I hope you see things that startle you. I hope you feel things you never felt before. I hope you meet people with a different point of view. I hope you live a life youre proud of. If you find that youre not I hope you have the courage to start all over againYoull beat this it wont be easy but you will and if you ever need a shoulder to cry you can always message me.

You went through a terrifying event and it seems like no one was trying to comfort you which only makes it that much worse. Its not unusual for people like us to not have connections with our peers and family. Its usually one of the things that draws us here. Its okay to smile and laugh or talk to yourself. You need to be comfortable with yourself first. Let those people move on with their lives and possibly tell the story of the smiling guy that told himself the funniest joke ever. If they do that then that just means you made their day better because now they have something to talk about. You just did them a favor! ,SuicideWatch,dcere4w,1,t5_2qpzs
10330076,0,t1_dceqt33,Would you prefer it if you did talk about yourself more then? Well its great you are still able to get joy from reading when you can! And those are indeed some implications you need to consider it would be foolish not to have thought it through before you commit to something without being aware of its downsides. That being said every career path carries with it its own drawbacks and it is worth keeping that in mind. I can appreciate having the idea of failure if you dont follow through with an idea youve had for a while but if you realise that it is not for you surely the failure would be going through with it anyway? And in regards to you saying  years its not as committal as it sounds. You could read for a degree in literature and then decide that youre done with studying. Or you could go onto do a masters or PhD and then decide you want to do something entirely different you arent locked in from the moment you set out. Addressing your last point the biggest difference between university and high school is that your further education is your choice and yours only  you are not being forced into it which is quite liberating.Lastly how are you doing today?

We just assume everything is going right for others while everything is going wrong for us.

10444845,0,t3_5pl3d2,Its pretty common for people in crisis to fixate on one aspect of the situation which can seem peripheral to us but which is enormous inside their heads.  That type of loss of perspective is something I see often in people who are at high risk.  Suicide risk assessment isnt simple and even the experts cant always get it right but we do maintain a guide to the basics here  Depending on where youre located there may be textbased alternatives offered by your local or national suicide hotline agency but of course shed require connectivity for that.  Both for the person in crisis and anyone helping them in these types of situation its essential to be clear in our minds about what is and isnt within your control. You cant control whether your friends marriage will weather this storm nor the circumstances under which is breaks up.  Obviously I cant estimate the risk of your friend being kicked out and cut off but it seems to me that the main thing to deal with now is your friends fears which seem to have overwhelmed her.  It sounds like what shes engaging in is catastrophic thinking and usually the expressed worstcase scenarios are a metaphor for the persons emotions.  In this case it seems like your friend feels that if her marriage breaks up shell be basically cut off from humanity. If she were thinking clearly shed probably be able to come up with lots of practical solutions to the internet access problems but until she gets her emotions validated shes likely to reject any practical suggestions to solve that problem.  Our talking tips explains how to use active listening to validate difficult emotions so perhaps youd like to have a look and then ask us any questions they dont answer...? ,SuicideWatch,dcs09u4,8,t5_2qpzs

10519163,0,t3_5qmgqq,There are two important points here.The first is that you are not crazy you just grew up a very unhealthy environment. The word insane means not mentallyemotionally sane. Insane means not sane. People need an emotionally healthy environment to grow up with a healthy mind and healthy emotions. You obviously dont have that emotionally healthy environment here. You are not emotionally healthy because you grew up in an emotionally unhealthy environment. Therefore dont ever call yourself crazy. Ever. Doing so will only make you feel bad about yourself. If you want you can simply say that you are emotionally unhealthy and thats true isnt? You arent not emotionally healthy but thats okay its not your fault. We dont get to choose our parents but we can choose to move on and live on. The second is that you should think very carefully about how to deal with this situation because your parents seem like they are both mentally insane and also very comfortable with lying. So I would be careful about contacting CPS because your parents are very likely to lie and CPS is sadly more likely to believe a parent than a child because of other children who falsely accuse their parents out of anger or spite. So I would talk to your brother in secret if you trust him to not tell your parents and to see if he is willing to talk to CPS with you. If you two do it together then they are much more likely to take you seriously.You can be the one to call but he can cooperate when the time comes. Also they will likely talk to you individually so they will know that you are telling the truth if you decided to this. They may possibly believe you if you contact them alone but this option is risky because they may sort of believe you may then talk to your parents who may then lie and may leave you only to be punished by your angry parents who are obvious lunatics. Therefore be very very careful and smart about what you do.If you have any proof of any mistreatment such as bruises or scars then you can contact CPS immediately and show them these as prove. However I do not recommend that you contact them and simply say My parents once did this and they told me this because there is the risk that they wont believe you.The only problem here is that a homeschooled child accusing his parents without proof or without a witness just doesnt look too good in my opinion. But who knows I have never been in this situation. I just wouldnt want you to end up in a worse situation. Your parents sound like mentally insane sociopaths who actually plan this shit out. I mean making your brother stare at a wall all day and spraying him if he fell asleep is literally mental torture. The only problem in this case is that it doesnt leave scars or marks to be used as proof. So I really think that your parents plan this shit out which is making me think that maybe they are not like crazy crazy but are instead sociopaths who plan these things out and who have been telling you all those stories to frighten and scare you. Like you said no of those stories are fit for a child. If you can get your brother on board then contact CPS immediately. The stuff you wrote is very very serious and will definitely result in you getting separated from your parents which may be a very good thing in this case.If you feel you ever feel like you are about to commit suicide then dont call a suicide hotline immediately and tell them everything tell them that you thought of calling CPS but just didnt feel safe because your parents didnt leave any marks or anything.I wish there was something I could say to make you feel better but I dont believe there is.  The only thing that I can say is that you are not crazy you just grew up in a very very unhealthy environment. An environment definitely not fit to raise any human being.,SuicideWatch,dd0glmx,2,t5_2qpzs

10548105,0,t3_5r16sc,You are not pathetic for having internet friends!This Reddit has literally saved people from death. Including mine. Is that pathetic? No! it is a life saver.And I agree with you on hospitalization. It seems extreme to jump right into that. But perhaps it is what they feel is best. Perhaps what they see is different from what you are experiencing. Maybe ask them what is it you see in my behavior that warrants hospitalization? It could very well be that the people who love you simply dont know how to care for you and think that doctors and nurses know best and therefore can give you the best chance at success.And yeah a lot of the time they are terrible places. My hospital mental health ward is horrible and demeaning to people. I stood up to several nurses Because of how they treated the people there while visiting friends. I stood up for people I didnt even know. One guy didnt want to eat. He didnt like his meal and it looked like slop. But the way she was treating him because of that I told her maybe if the food was edible he would eat. I sure wouldnt eat that shit if I was here. And I doubt you eat this shit even though you work here she gave me a dirty look and walked away. The guy and my friend thanked me. With that story in mind there are also nice people who work at the hospital too. I spent a lot of time in them for many reasons. And most people are really awesome. Many of them go above and beyond to help people. If you are nice to them they will do their best to help you. I have had many nurses come to my rescue on many different things. They are good people.

If I had to guess your therapist would probably tell your parents just to be safe. However I would still tell her since there is a pretty high possibility that you might develop resistance to Zoloft making it less effective and therefore bring back your suicidal tendencies again. ,SuicideWatch,ddirpr0,2,t5_2qpzs

10735951,0,t1_ddnbqo5,I have very few people in my life. My father abandoned me when I was a child. My mother is just not a good mother. Because of my abandonment issues I fall in love with people with commitment issues. I fell deeply in love last September with a guy and I caught him in bed with someone else. With the endless cheating and emotional put downs I still couldnt bring myself to leave. I ended up pushing him away because he wouldnt agree to stop talking to the girls he cheated with. I just want him to love me. Other than that I really have no real friends. Only men who want to use me. My best friend lives a city away and treats me like crap. She ditched my birthday. Im a  year old woman and I couldnt get anyone to show up to my birthday. I spend ALL my time alone. Im completely isolated. I posted on my Instagram a picture of my plane ticket and people know I have depression and no one noticed. I also dated a really really nice guy for the first time in my life recently I fucked it up by showing him too much too fast and it scared him away. He was the first male to ever treat me with any respect. I badly wanted to stay friends with him. I tried to but I think he felt like he was leading me on. And so he distanced himself. Every time I try to make friends it fails. Everyone already has a solid group of friends. And no one wants to be around a fucked up depressed and suicidal person.

10754697,0,t1_ddp74oh,Yay Im glad that helps.   I think of suicide as like swimming and getting swept out into a rough sea by a current.  If you get slapped by a wave when you try to breathe it should not matter you just breathe on the other side.  If you are already out of breath it is harder to wait and if the next breath goes wrong too for some reason you stop swimming and just try to get some air.  Your friends dont notice you are in trouble and swim out of sight which is only one wavelength away but you cant see them.  Then it gets dark and you keep getting whacked by waves when you wanted air.  This metaphor is getting out of hand lets leave it before the giant octopus arrives.   But what I meant is that some people just have bad luck and get hit with too many waves at the wrong time and drown.   It would be a terrible waste for you to be lost to the world like that.  .  Your father presumably left because he could not live with your mother.   If they had a really bad break up she may have made it impossible for him to see you.  Maybe there was violence and she got a police order preventing him from contacting her or you.   She might be genuinely scared or pretending to be because she does not want him in her or your life.   Parents sometimes lie to their own children if they feel the other parent is a bad influence.    You should find out.  Ask your mother but also ask other relatives and everybody who knew your father.  His workmates and friends might know where he is and everybody has a piece of the puzzle.   If mental illness was the reason your parents could not get on that does not mean you can not see him.  He might have had to move away but you can still write.   Your mother does not sound like an easy person to get on with.  You came home upset needing love and reassurance but instead you got yelled at and told your feelings are wrong and you should feel something else.  Maybe that happened to your father too many times.  Do you usually feel loved by your mother?,SuicideWatch,ddp9kpe,2,t5_2qpzs

Not only have you had these experiences and survived it sounds like you want to keep surviving given that you are reaching out for support.It might feel like there are few reasons to keep going right now because you seem to be in a pretty dark place but the fact youve reached out suggests that you want to find reasons to keep going. You mentioned that you disagree with your diagnosis a good starting point might be working towards assisting your pdoc to correctly identify which condition youre living with. Once you know that and once your pdoc is treating the right condition you could find that your experience of life improves. You know yourself better than anyone else you are more than qualified to tell your pdoc that they need to focus on finding the correct diagnosis before trying out different treatment regimes.There are so many life experiences that are available to you now good and bad and you can decide what you want to do.

10939090,0,t3_5w8wmi,Something I have to remind myself constantly is that its actually normal for people to feel shit when shit things happen or even when shit things dont happen.Know this anyone in your situation with your experiences and with your brain chemistry would feel exactly the same as you do. You are human. Humans feel crap sometimes. Some of us feel crap all the time. Depression the desire to be dead or to never have been born at all the sense of hopelessness of helplessness of selfloathing and selfblame  these are natural human emotions the same as any others. Feeling the way you feel is a normal part of being a human. Its science. Humans feel things. Sometimes those feelings are pleasant and sometimes they suck.Heres the shitty news you literally cannot physically or mentally stop these feelings from happening. There are ways to get better at coping with them when they surface and there are a bunch of things we can do to avoid our feelings which doesnt make them go away and probably make you feel worse afterwards but we cannot make feelings go away.Heres the good news we are not responsible for feelings happening in us. Feelings happen in your brainmeats. Its all chemicals and nerve impulses and squishy gross bits of brain doing squishy gross neurochemical stuff and absorbing and producing different types of braingoo and sending bits of electricity to other gross bits of brainmeats. There is no blame. Your brain is its own boss. All we can do is react to what our brains give us.Your feelings are not your fault they are nothing to be ashamed of they are not an indicator of poor character or weakness. If someone has diabetes are they to blame for what their pancreas does and doesnt do? Do we expect them to mentally control their bodys production of insulin? How could they? Hey brain tell that pancreas to straighten up and fly right! Its not possible. Just like you and I cannot reasonably realistically be expected to manually operate our neurochemistry. Someone born with no hearing cant just toughen up and start hearing again. And we dont judge deaf people for being deaf or blind people for being blind or short people for being short or any of the other completely arbitrary atypical things with which a person can be born.And if youre thinking Yeah but I wasnt always like this okay someone gets run over by a bus and has to have their legs amputated and they spend the rest of their lives in a wheelchair. Do you say to that person Pfff you arent trying hard enough  just grow some new legs? I hope not! Damage that happens to our brainmeats and our neurochemistry over time through our experiences also cannot just be healed by the power of positive thinking and rainbows. Trust me  Ive tried. Given that how you feel is not your freaking fault and that you cannot just magic it away I have found that the most important thing to remember is to show the same compassion towards yourself as you would towards a friend or family member who was feeling like this. If someone you loved was feeling suicidal would you blame them for it and punish them? So why are you doing that to yourself? Youre in pain. Nourish that pain. Do something that gives you a sense of comfort as you would for someone else who was feeling like you are. Find a smell that brings back happy memories get a really soft blanket or teddy bear that feels soothing when you stroke it listen to the top ten commercial hits from years gone by and sing those stupid lyrics and play air guitar watch YouTube clips of pandas experiencing snow for the first time let yourself have a couple of scoops of ice cream or a few pieces of nice cheese on good crackers or a row of a block of chocolate and take the time to really taste that flavour rather than just hoovering it down.You feel awful. I feel awful too. Give yourself permission to feel awful for a while. Watch the whole first season of your favourite TV show from when you were growing up. Mine was Dawsons Creek and I didnt stop with the first season either!! Set up a blanket fort in your loungeroom and watch your three stupidest favourite movies. Mine are Clueless Bring It On and Empire Records. Do for yourself what your possiblyimaginary best friend soul mate understander of all things YOU would do for you. Do what you would do for the person you love most. Let yourself feel shit and do things that comfort you and make room for feeling shit  its not going away so embrace it as an opportunity to bingewatch Revenge or Scandal or all the Twilight movies!Breathe into it. Cry when you feel like crying. Remind yourself that you can just as easily control your own brain chemicals as you can control how big your feet are.And then when or IF you feel up to it do one thing thats important to you like calling someone to let them know you care about them or weeding just one of your garden beds or taking out the garbage or doing a load of laundry. It doesnt have to be spectacular. Just as long as it moves you towards the way you want your life to be. And then bail back to the blanket fort and watch your equivalent of Mean Girls and think I totally called that personpulled out those weedstook out that garbagedid a load of laundry! Achievement unlocked! and give yourself a gold star because you and I know that that was genuinely hard and screw anyone who doesnt get why.You are human. Humans have feelings. Brains squirt out and absorb chemicals and send electrical impulses to other parts of our brains with as much manual control as we have over our fingernails growing. Your feelings are not your fault. When you feel bad comfort yourself. Let yourself feel bad and know that no matter how bad you feel that feeling is not bigger than you. Its happening inside you. You are bigger than it. And it will get smaller and bigger and smaller and bigger completely without your control but it will never be bigger than you. You engulf your feelings literally physically scientifically. And you have a soft teddy bear and you have old DVDs and you have a box of tissues and you know how to cry and you can breathe and eat ice cream and listen to really bad pop music and stay in your blanket fort for as long as you need.This is your time to feel shit so freaking revel in it.Im gonna go watch some The . Under my soft blanket. With a bag of crisps and a glass of cordial. Because Im an adult and taking care of yourself sometimes means actually taking CARE of yourself.Let me know how you go.,SuicideWatch,de8agp1,2,t5_2qpzs

10979137,0,t1_decfs44,Sure Ill talk about anything. My father threatened to kill me when I was  for some stupid everyday mistake  year olds make cant even remember it now and I ran away. When I developed a few mental issues one being anxiety I briefly mentioned the anxiety to a friend and my father overheard. He gave me a lot of abuse and wouldnt believe there could be anything wrong with me because you wouldnt get that from such a good father. My mother is pretty similar but she also makes up bullshit and tells other family members like she has a highschool vendetta against me or something. They both go out randomly and dont return for quite a while have never taken any interest in anything to do with me and they used to smoke outside my window so they could laugh when I was coughing and leaving the room from all the smoke getting in. My parents also absolutely refused to let me seek medical help for anything. I was given a diagnosis for diabetes it was a misdiagnosis thankfully but when we thought I had it my mother would try to purposefully feed me sugary things to prove that diabetes isnt a big deal because they raised me right. Nowadays we talk for a few minutes when were all in from workcollege and maybe a minute before we go to sleep. Aside from that I separate myself from them. Theres more but I think you get the idea.Thats fair enough. Past few days due to escapism Ive been getting  hours sleep.Edit Missed the relationships part. Most abusive one was multiple years she would try to manipulate and guilttrip me claim things that never happened gaslighting physical attacks tried to force me into kids and marriage made my family dislike me more twisted everything I did or said against her. Prime example she wanted me to get a part time job during highschool because as a guy I should be more aspiration oriented this is while I was already making money and achieving top grades. She then demanded I quit the job because it was retail and they sold pokemon in the back and she was religious and didnt want me there. Okay. So I make excuses and keep the job until the end of the contract temporary and then because I didnt have another job two days after that she was threatening to call me a rapist and take me to court etc etc even though we were never even sexual at that point aside from some small events which she initiated and controlled. The other one was more normal and lasted half a year but she cheated on my the whole time and spread a load of bullshit around college and my entire class hates me now which is fun to walk into every day. Both of them tried to convince me that depression didnt exist that I was selfish if I didnt feel like eating or something that day. ,SuicideWatch,decg8eg,1,t5_2qpzs

11038155,0,t3_5xm2wu,Its quite common among depressed folk to feel detached uncaring and apathetic about themselves and everything around them. I guess it takes a very effortful conscious process to get around that feeling which speaks to why we often feel that we cant get out of this rut that we find ourselves in. You talk about not caring enough to stay in class or to clean nor caring enough to eat properly. Perhaps you could make a list of small goals to accomplish for yourself each day like brushing your teeth showering eating meals and just do them because its a written routine rather than because you actually care about doing any of those things. It works better if you have someone to remind you to go through those tasks and to enforce the routine but you can put it into motion yourself too. A side effect of building a routine for taking care of your basic needs is that you can start feeling better at least on a physical level i.e. youre clean because you showered even if not mentally. And then little by little you might be able to find it in you to start caring about larger responsibilities again.,SuicideWatch,dej5lxn,2,t5_2qpzs

11103765,0,t3_5yj1g2,I was actually going to post something very similar to this  Im  with depression and ADHD survivor of childhood sexual assault well I was . My main support is my family my mom in particular usually being the person I talk to about everything. I also do have a couple of close friends. But its so DAMN hard when these people dont quite understand. Its not like getting out of a bad mood or funk like people think. If I could think it away I would have done so in the past  or so years of my treatment. Theyre wellmeaning with their comments of course and I think we can take solace that they are listening and trying to help even though it seems patronizing Thinking about suicide? Take a bubble bath! Paint your nails! But Ive seen posts on here talking about people actually cutting off contact because theyre reaching out and it breaks my heart. So Id like to think we are fortunate to have people try to help in their own way and stick around. Sometimes I tell these people Im not looking for advice on what to do but it would really help if...x y z. Even if its asking them to be a sounding board for them to say Im so sorry youve been going through this or giving you a big hug after and staying with you for a while.I just want to say that I read your post and felt an instant kinship. I have a job not a great one but Im employed I have a wonderful family that I try to talk to Ive gone to inpatient outpatient have had psychiatrists and psychologists support groups done the whole exercise and better dietnutritionist have reached out to friends for social things even tried spiritual healing because I didnt know what else to do. Unfortunately I dont think I can give you the right advice either because Im kind of in the same or a similar boat. The thing is the people who are going to understand you the best are people that are struggling with the same things and looking for the same kind of help but probably havent found it. For now I can just tell you that Im a stranger who is wishing you all the best and rooting for you.,SuicideWatch,deqlox6,5,t5_2qpzs

11130881,0,t3_5yw82g,Well I cant say I relate to these problems but I can understand that hearing someone saying Its going to get better its sometimes like trying to believe in Santa Claus. Its very hard to hear and you might feel as nobodys listening but sometimes they are they just dont know how. I think our society is making us lose that essential part of what makes us human the ability to connect and love. It is that feeling of loneliness you get while surrounded by people. But trying to reach whenever youre able may be the best strategy there are a lot of people in the world some might get you and maybe bring back whatever is missing.

11131522,0,t3_5yvqpb,You dont think you want to commit suicide. Thats wonderful because it tells us something. It tells us that a big part of you is at least trying to tell the rest of you that you want to keep living! Learn more about this part of you. Find out which part of you this is  is it your friends your interests your passions your beliefs? I got news for you this part of you is your friend. This is the part that is on your side which wants you to stay alive. Let this part of you convince the rest of you that you want to keep living. Maybe learn something about your closest friend and become closer that way so you dont feel marginalized within your friend group? That might be a good start.I believe that you can erase these thoughts because above all else you dont want to commit suicide. And the part of you thats telling you that is what you need to embrace.

There is always and i mean always someone out there who will think youre the most beautiful or handsome girlguy theyve ever seen. And one day youll bumble into them just like me youre heart will skip a beat and youll know you found that special guygirl and they will happily snore next to you whether you understand why they love you or not. Sometimes it just takes patience sometimes it takes going out there and just having a few drinks at a bar and giving out some smiles or striking up a conversation. Doesnt have to go anywhere doesnt have to mean anything but getting into that social environment and building up that elusive confidence definitely helps.

11236494,0,t1_df5g0q9,Yeah it can be discouraging trying to reach out and support others and having it not work for them. Of course theres no one thing that helps for everyone thinking about suicide  so theres no possible post you could have made that would have worked for everyone. One thing it can help to keep in mind though is that when people are closest to the edge that often brings with it a feeling of our present pain and distress being overwhelmingly more intense than our reasoning about the future if it can even feel real at all sometimes people get to a point where cognitive constriction makes it impossible to even process the future as a meaningful concept. And in general this is the impact it will have on the people around you messages dont do anything to relieve the suffering of the person struggling and sometimes even end up worsening it  the most reliable way to do that is by giving our empathy which because empathy involves connecting with someones feelings and experiences really works best on a persontoperson level rather than as any kind of general message as the sidebar guidelines mention. Having struggled with our own suicidal thoughts can be a great help with this if were up for it but of course its always okay not to be andor to need support for ourselves.,SuicideWatch,df5n322,1,t5_2qpzs

Maybe if instead of working with the dead you found ways to help the living you might find more meaning in living.Im not dismissing this profession it sounds like it is a valuable service but if it isnt bringing you happiness then you have the power to change it.  And dont think for a second you dont have the power to change it.  We all have choices.  Some of those choices come with costs that we are unwilling to bear.

Invite them over for dinner small talk about work make plans to have a drink after work go to a pool party theyre throwing blah blah blah.  I think you got it correct on the emotional connectivity  Im not emotionally connected to anything or anyone nor do I really want to be anymore.I think this is why I cry when I see other people happy  I know thats not in the cards for me.

You are just lonely and want someone to listen to you talk but the only people who youll find who want to listen to such talk are very foolish or naive people who would find it impressive and they will only leave you feeling more alone. Until you begin to recognize your own ignorance you are not going to get better. Right now you are under the illusion that you know something about the world because you have read some books. This does not constitute real knowledge of life and reading the insights of others does not grant them to you. You must do the work yourself. If you cant overcome your arrogance and selfishness you will find yourself increasingly alone and unable to relate to others. My advice to you is to begin volunteer work immediately. You need practice in humility. It will greatly relieve you of these pains you are experiencing. This may sound greatly disappointing if not downright insulting but really Im not interested in confirming your illusions about yourself or boosting your selfesteem.

11659021,0,t1_dghjz24,I think I saw senselessness in life a while back too. Its easy to not feel anything and just write the world off as something that shouldnt even bother existing but we as humans have a couple really beautiful qualities. We can find meaning in whatever we choose to. We can love. We can create and explore. And we can question. We can question anything we come across and see if it works for us or not. If the point of our life is to logic and science our way into a better life its not going to happen. Science doesnt tell us what is meaningful for ourselves. We have to figure that out. And I love having that opportunity. I love having the ability to create meaning from just sitting here listening to music typing and being okay without having to justify everything. Because although our massive intellect is a huge gift unless it is applied with wisdom it is going to run us into problems. So I guess your purpose needs to be whatever makes sense for you without overthinking it. You dont have to lift the weight of the world. You could smile at stranger today and they could go home and be a lot nicer to their kid because you did that small act.

I graduated with an English degree and panicked and ended up living in my mothers basement for a few years evaluating my life and trying to figure out what I was going to do next and worrying that Id made a terrible mistake. But an English degree is not hopeless. It is a great place to start.What I found for myself is that my English degree by itself gave me a lot of skills that my peers didnt have in terms of critical thinking writing the ability to problem solve that sort of thing. But what it needed was a bit of specialization. I ended up going back to school for a post grad certificate which was only a few months long in publishing which included an internship. The internship was the MOST important part because that gave me actual experience to put on my resume which is what I needed to open the doors into the fields where my English degree would have value. After that I worked in journalism for a few years government communications and now Im in nonprofit communications. All that in the last  years when the economy was just about as bad as it is now not before when things were easier.I know its hard. I know that  years ago when I was where you are I didnt want to live anymore. But I would have missed so much and all of it was made possible by my English degree. Which is silly now that I think about it but true. Im not sure if this helps. But I wanted you to know Ive been there.

11736126,0,t3_67dk1h,HelloIm not sure if this will simply make you feel worse but my response to hearing about things like this is first fatalism and then being supportive. I take it far too seriously to ever think that simply because somebody is alive theyre not at a very real risk. I think most people skip fatalism in favour of optimism undermining their ability to be supportive because of what it feels like to both be attached to somebody and to expect their loss. They care internally in their own way. They are generally happy though so depression comes out of the blue to them it is an unexpected blow. Theyve studied this in music and with negative statements for depressed people those things dont shock us. We have less to lose in an emotional way and somewhat limited way that allows us to remain attached. Thats how I view it. Meaning I really have to say something bout your therapist . . .gt but its not a desire to die right? You just dont feel like life is very attractive right nowWhat is a desire to die? A lack of desire to live the withering away of life. Thats what the thoughtful instead of impulsive more violent desire is. More violent desires get called impulses. It all gets dismissed. If you dont want to live though thats close enough. If I valued some afterlife more than life then what do I desire? Life or death. What you feel about your nowandhere life matter much more than potential feelings that could belong to somebody else after you finally get help. This is yeah people seem to think time does the trick. Put you in a waiting room call the number skip the treatment. Call it a day. Its slightly ridiculous.I do things that I like being alive for as opposed to alive for. That is I focus on experience. It helps a bit it doesnt shake that feeling out but it does build some other feeling up. A feeling that tells me Id hug you right now if I could. ,SuicideWatch,dgqbii1,3,t5_2qpzs

You did the right thing.I dont know what the heck is wrong with your parents but what theyve said to you frankly disgusts me. Im not gonna lie as someone who has had to deal with a suicidal family member in the past it is a burden but I would HAPPILY take that burden for them. The problem is that your parents dont seem to see your value as more than the weight of the burden. Theyre wrong you are absolutely worth it. I wouldnt be on  this subreddit if I didnt believe that.Right now I would strongly encourage you to eat more. I dont want you to have anorexia on top of your current condition as well.
