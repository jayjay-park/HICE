913393,0,t3_24i9ys,Howdy!As a former vintage bus owner the answer is both yes and no I think.  You didnt mention your layout but if you have the boxed in jump seat behind the drivers seat it is the perfect place for a toilet.  I hinged the seat lid and put a toilet in mine.Portable showers are easy to make and will fit in most anything.  You use a hula hoop for a shower curtain rod add your shower curtain a base to contain the water and a small stool to sit on that will also fit inside your base.My splitty was a tin top.  I procured a collapsible over sized milk crate that folded flat when not is use and stored it in the tall closet just inside the side doors.  I lined the crate with a plastic garbage bag to make it water proof hung my shower curtain from a temporary luggage bar and placed a small  legged stool inside the base for me to sit on while showering.  Make sure that your shower curtain hangs inside your base to contain all of the water.  I chose to use simple trigger spray bottles for my water source just because it was small and simple.If I was out somewhere by myself I had two pipe style luggage racks that attached to the rain gutters.  I would insert a smaller pipe into one and hang my shower curtain from that and shower outside.I never lived in my splitty but I have many fond memories of traveling the country in it.,vandwellers,ch83x91,2,t5_2rnwo

1202582,0,t3_27v4s3,First off you dont seem  sure that you want to live in a van but rather doing it by force. I just wanted to say that this usually results in people hating van life.Even if you have to fool yourself try to look at the positives other than just money.. I understand the house issue I also bought a house at the age of  and wish I never did it.Being you seem more forced into the van life rather than by full choice Id suggest not worrying about the perfect van. Get something cheap and dependable. Your cousins van doesnt look bad for k to be honest. What ever yo do own the decision you make. Be it living in the van or living with your parents. Its no one else choice but your own. If you do live in the van do yourself a favor and dont just go from point A to point B looking for work.You never said where you live or what work you did but Id take the ability to move around with your van to try various places out. Go somewhere you think might be fun to live for a month or two and just get a temp job.One reason I say this is because you will want to take your time getting to FL because living in a van in FL is not fun due to the heat.. Even in December its often pretty warm.,vandwellers,ci4wq1c,3,t5_2rnwo

1371943,0,t1_cinohxs,Usually you can take the battery out and take it to autozone or other auto parts store for free testing. But yea if youre really charging the battery effectively its probably on the way out.The best test would be a load test after a full charge.BTW have you checked the water levels yet? If you havent been doing this regularly doing it now might ease out a wee bit more life.Wet deep cycle batteries are always cheaper than AGM or gel batteries when comparing Ah to Ah.  The AGM can be mounted in any position cant really be rewatered and handle the bumps and shocks of offroad more effectively. ,vandwellers,cio9ewy,1,t5_2rnwo
1416419,0,t3_2acuhj,Watts  Amps x Volts. So when you have  amp hours that means at  volts minimum required you will have      watts for one charge cycle. Assume half that due to losses and making sure you keep the battery alive for a long time youre looking at about  watts of usable power for one charge cycle. A charge cycle being to let it drop down to  charge and then you charge it back to near full. Note the last  will take a long time to charge.So with that in mind calculate you total amperage of all the devices you use. It should have a power label somewhere on the backside of each device or appliance that tells you volts and watts. If you get a  amp circuit which is pretty big make sure they all have a combined amperage less than  amps.If you have more than  amps just make sure youre not using all items all the time so you dont burn out your  amp circuit. So on and so forth if you get a  amp or  amp circuit.If you are under the required amperage calculate how much watts they have by getting v  their amps and thats how many watts you need per hour. So if you have  watts per charge cycle and you use  watts per hour you will get about  hours of use before needing to recharge your battery.If you are charging while using such as solar or wind generation you can calculate how much watts and amps youre getting per hour per charging and just subtract that from how much youre using.You can also determine your watts and then decide how many hours of use you need then multiply them together to get the watts required per charge cycle then double it. Then divide that total number by  to get the total required amp hours.If you are using  watts per hour for  hours you need  watts. So you need a total of  available watts to have a well maintained battery.    is amps so you will need a  amp hour battery.,vandwellers,cittrp0,9,t5_2rnwo

2025356,0,t1_ckwcx3w,Howdy!gt  I would need to stay productive on the road which would mean late nights spent coding in other words lots of light. Even with tint and blackout cloth Id be worried about stealth in an obvious camper van. You seem very open about the lifestyle and thats awesome but Im not sure I could or should. I just dont know that itd be received well.Being somewhat of a nightowl myself I can tell you that the only comments I have gotten is from neighbors who tell me it always gives them a secure feeling if they look out and see my lights on late at night.gt  No windows means one less fast point of entry for the opportunistic thief. I guess theres still the cabin windows but if I throw in a partition theyd still have another lock to get past. The determined thief is going to get in regardless but its peace of mind to some degree.Thieves go for what they can see but they also go for what they think may be a good bet.  Cargo vans and UHauls in that order are the number one amp two thieves choices according to Crimewatch.gt  I have asthma and Im pretty sensitive to smells so  years of someone elses smokewho knows what else absorbed into the cloth of an older used van is probably something Id want to tear out and reupholster anyway so theres actually some appeal to starting with a blank slate and adding insulation.This may be a good reason to strip and rebuild a window van but the ventilation of a window van would be a high priority for an asthma sufferer Id think.  The window visors are great but Im not a huge fan of roof vents because of the leaks and the chances of them being leftt open in the rain or while driving off.gt Youve been super helpful in providing generator details but Im afraid it went over my head a bit. Ill probably stick to buying one if necessary but how do you feel about charging a battery bank off of the alternator? What about gas fumes from running a generator inside?Charging while driving is always the best choice if you drive enough.  I never ran my generator inside I always slid it outside to run.,vandwellers,ckx9kw8,1,t5_2rnwo

2230571,0,t3_2kouzc,Yeah blow dryers pull ALOT of electricity. If you have a really powerful inverter wattish you can use one but it sound like the minimalist approach is what your aiming for. So if you wanted to blow dry you would need to find gas station bathrooms with outlets to use that. As far as food goes i think you have the right idea. Just be sure to carry more then you think you need for emergencies. This may be a personal bias of mine but i dont like your choice of vehicles. Subarus are very capable vehicles as far as safety and all wheel drive ect but in my opinion extremely unreliable if your not an experienced mechanic or have money to burn. Repairs tend to be high cost for subees. also it forces you to use the roof rack option which is safe enough but if someone really wanted to they could take the whole box off the roof with minimal tools and effort. My suggestion for a better alternative would be a awd van a previa a mazda mpv even an astro van.  something that still gets decent gas mileage and affords you the space to store everything in the van. That would be my choice especially for  people for an extended period of time. Also  people in a cramped space will get pretty muggy on humid days so pick up a small v fan to put in your window when needed. Doesnt have to be anything expensive something like THISWill do you just fine.For cooking grab a little propane camp stove. HERES SOME Theyre really easy to use compact and portable Dont use one indoors unless you have the windows opened with the fan being used as an exhaust. Also if you plan on using your cars outlet as your primary source of elextricity while out in the woods get a jumper pack. Something like this it takes  hours to fully charge can charge using your cars outlet or a standard house outlet. It has a usb port for charging small devices like cell phones and a w ov house socket that will be enough to power a laptop for about  hours. Not powerful enough for your hair dryer Also it has a normal v socket and a small air compressor in case you get a flat. and of course jumper cables to jump your battery if needed. Using these things instead of your cars outlets will save you from being stranded in the middle of the woods due to a dead battery. ,vandwellers,clncx6r,9,t5_2rnwo
2251206,0,t3_2kyl62,If you can wait until spring just save whatever you can. Then get a van. A minivan may even fit your needs.

Not what someone else needs.If you are going to be in town where people will look at you like youre homeless you need stealth. For slab city you would wan comfort. Your van has to fit your needs. Finance isnt a reason alone to buy a van and live in it. It can get expensive with insurance and gas a food and more gas if you travel. And renting a room can be cheap plus give you an address.

3341889,0,t3_2yeutf,Your choice of blueboard is good because it is vapor permeable and it will slowly dry out when you inevitably get some condensation inside your wall.  You want to prevent condensation the best you can though.  This means that you want to keep air containing water vapor from finding its way from the inside of the van to the colder surfaces inside the wall where it will condense.  Your goal is to slow down the condensation of water inside the wall such that the wall will periodically dry out completely.  To slow down condensation do your best to make the wall airtight.  Start with the reflectix foil bubblewrap.  Tape seams.  Seal around edges with silicone caulk.  Then do the same with the blueboard.  Be sure that the inside surface is airtight but vapor permeable as well.  For example luane plywood backside unpainted front side one or two coats of latex paint.  If you put polyurethane or an oil finish on the luane youd make it vapor impermeable and the wall would not be able to dry out.  There will be some condensation.  Making a wall completely airtight is harder than making it completely waterproof.  Masonite is also vapor impermeable and therefore not a good choice for the inside surface.  If you have to make a tradeoff on the finish surface allow air exfiltration not airtight through the finish surface.  This will also make it vapor permeable.  So for example you could use an open mesh plastic. It is inevitable that you will get some condensation inside the wall but as long as the condensation is at a slow rate and the wall periodically dries out then the mold will not have time to grow.  Besides moisture mold needs something to eat.  That would usually be paper or wood.  You can substitute PVC trim material say X available at lumber yards.As noted blueboard is a good choice because it is vapor permeable what you want.  Do not use polyurethane foam sheets and especially not foil faced polyurethane sheets Thermax because they are both vapor impermeable.I think the tricky bit with van walls is to get a vapor permeable finish surface.  In house basements with cold concrete walls condensation and mold a potential problem we use  blueboard X wood strips flat on top of the blueboard and then  as a finish layer.  The paperless drywall is not very flexible but it might work well if you can find  thickness.  It has a layer of fiberglass which makes it quite strong.  That said you want something with similar properties.The basic problem with vans is that a sleeping human exhales a lot of water vapor and the metal skin of the vehicle is often relatively cold at night whether it be in a cold climate or a warm and humid climate.  If youre in a dry climate like CA in summer the wall will get wet at night but dry out during the day.  Air exfiltration air leaking out leads to condensation and eventually mold can be hazardous to your health.  You can minimize the problem by ventilating but that means cold air coming inside at night.  It will also help to ventilate during the day and park in the sun.  That removes the dampness that accumulates at night.Source Ive studied Building Science.  Here is a reference that explains the problem of condensation in walls ,vandwellers,cp977oc,6,t5_2rnwo

Sorry to hear your Fords even curvier but it looks like youre off to a great start! What are you going to use for paneling? Are the furring strips the cheap kind or the more finishedtreated cuts? The reason I ask is because I used the cheap stuff from Home Depot and am thinking now that they are to blame for some minor warping along my wall panels. It may be hard to see in the picture but what I think happened was the furring picked up moisture and got hotcold or whatever and now the FRB is getting wavy.

3860526,1,t3_34n5xj,Hard to say but sometimes it can be as much as renting a small condo but you get so much freedom and also no neighbors or roommates that cause you trouble. Expenses depend on the veheicle too. The bigger the less MPG and the less MPG   on gas. If you do a double set up with carrv then that means x insurance and more driving since you have to come back to the RV everyday like a home. Also double tickets if you forget to move it for street sweeping. I think the single van set up is best in terms of saving but you lose utilities in an RV unless you have a nice camper van. For the eating out bit you can cook at the park where the barbaque areas area. Also food banks can give out nice stuff sometimes and helps a ton with food expenses. For Gasoline Im thinking switching to an EV to pay less per gas. They say some stations are free and others charge about  per HR so that can help with gasoline.If you think about it though when you compare it to someone who RENTS and has a CAR then you automatically are paying less. Because you only have the car bit and no rent. For eating out you can try the cooking bit I mentioned at the park in the BBQ areas or inside a camper van if you find a nice one. Also food banks....For me the goal is Utilize Food Banks EV to cut on gasfree gas single car to avoid x insurance and tickets. Use Free WIFI spots whenever possible like the one in my gym for example.Gym isnt so bad some go for month and I have herd of lower rates. That means showers and working out to stay healthy and focused... its very important. For electricity use your cigarret lighter when you move and when not try to plug at a place your eat or stay. Libraries are great but sometimes they can get full at some hours. For me I think the EV will change that. The EV WILL be the battery and I just charge it at the charge station and take energy from the EV to power up my stuff. As for storage.... try to avoid it if you can. Donate what you dont use. That is what I did with a lot of stuff that I just kept around but NEVER used. The donation should be tax deductible  Carry only what you need and stay light.,vandwellers,cqwc1zx,2,t5_2rnwo

Depending on how much the transfer was slowed and if the van was already cool from running the main ac then it seems to me that it would be possible to keep the air cool with the ice coolerradiator setup. Whatever heat inside the van would be transferred into the cooler melting the ice. Since there would be less heat at any given moment in the van due to the precooled environment and the insulation the ice should last longer.

4395790,0,t3_3bcrq3,Ive had an  with stow and go seating.  It works for me without modifications although there are a couple Im thinking about.ding ding ding!  I would call it a winner!  With the seats folded into the floor the back is roughly X amp flatish.  there are a couple of... um... divots?  where the seats lock into place and so theres a little recession with a metal bar for the seats to lock to.  The floor isnt completely flat.. theres about a  inch raise in elevation between the middle and back rows.  Not enough to prohibit comfortable lounging and sleeping though.  I looooove the versatility.   My favorite set up is to leave one middle and one back seat up so that the  passenger seats behind the copilots chair are upright along with the driver and copilot seats and the other middle and back seats behind the driver are folded into the floor.  This provides a nice size sleepinglounging area foam mattress very comfy amp easy to roll away for storage.  But also I like the variety of changing positions and sitting in different seats.  One of the steps of converting the middle seat is to fold the backrest down flat against the buttarea of the seat.  This makes for a flat surface you can use if needed.  The seats are comfy for lounging they can sit upright or lean back.  With a small lap desk and a cooler I feel like Ive got a miniapartment going.  And its super easy to convert back up into a passenger van if I want to haul a load of friends somewhere as my gear easily stores behind the third row when the seats are up.I havent wired it.  It comes with both  volt plugs and what looks like regular house plugs already installed one of each up by the driver one of each by the drivers side middle row.  But I havent tried them out.  Im too scared of draining the engine battery by runningcharging stuff when the engines off... not worth the risk since I dont knwo what Im doing.  The electrical world is greek to me.  It looks like if you were smart theres enough room under the hood for an independent house battery.  I wonderhope that there might be an inverter in there already because of the houselooking plugs.  So thats one of the modifications Im trying to figure out could I add a battery thats charged by solar that would run the plugs without draining the engine battery. The other modificaiton Im looking into is cooling.  Its nice under a shade tree with the windows cracked four of the windows roll down the back two are wing windows that fold out on a day thats  degrees.  But hotter than that and youd better find some serious shade or some wearable ice.  So Im thinking about installing a roof rack so I can have my own builtin tarp tie down to make my own shade.  And Im shopping around marine solar vents to see if I think I want to invest the money on hopefully! maintenance free cooling.,vandwellers,csl5325,1,t5_2rnwo

At k I dont think thats unusual.  Though I will note that ignoring the signs of a blown head gasket can bring you cooling issues.My normal field test for a blown gasket is to bring a rubber glove and open the radiator cap on a cold engine and wire the glove over the opening. If theres engine exhaust leaking into the coolent the glove will inflate. This tool is a better way to catch a head gasket leak early. If you catch the leak early enough its just a normal expensive repair job.,vandwellers,cu5i2xd,1,t5_2rnwo

5523558,0,t1_cwhg6ze,Hey! Nice truck. I love the battery box idea but want to comment on your methods. The inverter is a really odd choice. For the most part anything youd use in a truck can be run directly off twelve volt. Inverters introduce losses into your system  of the energy is lost in conversion and you dont get it back and are usually unnecessary. I would have preferred to wire something like this into the side or top of your awesome box so that you can plug straight into the battery. You only have to protect it with an inline fuse. Better yet get yourself a fuse panel.As for battery you made a good choice going with a sealed battery in such a small space since it wont vent hazardous gasses. However the bluetop isnt exactly designed for what youre using it for and you spent a lot of money on that only to get   amphrs of battery bank out of it. Youd have been better off getting a solar battery of the same cost which are sealed AGM the same style and youd get more power out of the battery too. If you wanted to save money you can get much cheaper wheelchair sealed AGM batteries link them together and they will last longer and provide more power for your application purposes. You dont need the cranking amps provided by that battery. ,vandwellers,cwhon00,14,t5_2rnwo

6534845,0,t1_czu7fwd,Okay took a little bit to type up a better response.  Get ready its a giant wall of text.  Its not completely complicated but it takes a lot of words to try and explain and make sense.I wanted to grab a couple of illustrations to make it make a little more sense but I spent most of my time eating scouring the internet to see if anyone already had the right illustrations up and no one did.  No wonder nobody usually understands how this stuff works.  I did enough hunting to make sure my information is right and just did up my own illustrations after work.  If I get a chance later this week maybe I can write this up a lot nicer somewhere else and offer it up as a reference.Before any of this makes sense you need to be able to see how each piece acts under different electrical loads but there are a lot of variables that change things.  These illustrations arent accurate per say to any particular setup but theyre about right for the stock alternator and starting battery you get in an E your year and hopefully just good enough to explain the concept.First off the alternator.  Most of the graphs for those show the max output current you can get depending on the alternator or engine speed which doesnt really help us much.  What you really need to see is what your alternator will do at a fixed cruising speed as you increase the load on it.  At cruising speed you can see the voltage output of your alternator is mostly flat up to somewhere around its rated output and somewhere after that as you put more load on it the voltage its able to put out drops.  For the flat part of the graph the voltage regulator is cranking the field up in the alternator to keep the voltage up.  Once the field is at full strength thats all you have and the voltage drops quickly after that as you increase the demand for current.Next up is what your starting battery does at different current levels  This was the hard part to find and I ended up extracting this info from some really good battery charts put together by a boat guy for Home Power magazine.  Everything on that first curve I link changes with both how big your battery is and how discharged it is so Ive made one for each of the different situations wed need to look at to understand how your isolator is working.  For this first one its assuming about a Ah lead acid battery basically the Group  battery in your Econoline.  As you look to the left of zero on the bottom thats discharge current with your battery supplying power and to the right is charge current with power being put into your battery.  What you can read roughly off this chart is the voltage.  This chart has about the right voltage numbers for your battery being  charged which is pretty normal for just having fired up a van thats sat for a while.Now lets look at the first and simplest combination just your alternator and your starting battery.  Right after you fire up your van the alternator kicks right up to .V or so.  Your vans fuel pump and electronics are probably taking maybe A to run so your system will probably be at around .V  you have to guess first to figure this out and then go back and add things up to see if your guess was about right.  Whats important to see is that your battery and alternator are tied together so they have to be at the same voltage.  At .V your alternator can put out about A and your battery wants about A worth of charge so .V is right if the rest of your system is demanding about A right then.Now with that simple combo lets crank on the headlights and turn the fan on low so now were raised our load from say A to A.  At A output your alternator is at about .V but your battery still wants some charge too  but looking at the battery chart the battery charge current is probably going to drop to more like A.  So now your alternator is putting out .V to supply A to the car and A to the battery.Okay time to overload the alternator.  Crank the heat on max those blowers draw about A on max turn on the rear air and maybe heated seats or something.  Flip on the wipers get everything going.  Now weve got about A of demand in the system.  Thats way more than the alternator can put out by itself at above V and if you trust the slightly fictional chart I made your alternator can only put out about .V at that load.  Battery to the rescue!  Its still connected and if it were actually at .V it would really be putting out some juice!  Whats really going to happen is that the system is going to settle at whatever voltage the output current from the battery and the alternator add up to A.  Looking at the chart that looks like about .V to me.  At .V your alternator can still crank out A and your battery is going to put out the remaining A.I picked the simple situation first because this one has to make sense before you can understand what happens when you throw in a second battery bank with a different charge.  In this simple example you already have two things that can put out power alternator and battery that have to decide how to share the load.  The thing is its not really so much a decision.  Each thing has its own natural behavior that the chart tries to make sense of and the system has one natural law which is that the voltage for all the pieces were looking at will always be the same because theyre directly connected.  Hence the alternator and battery will increase or decrease output until the voltage stabilizes between them.  Its a bit of a physics balancing act.Now lets go back to the first example where youve just started the van and have a reasonable A system load but now we add in your house batteries.  Lets say your battery bank is Ah equivalent to almost three of those starting batteries in size  I want to exaggerate things a little so its easier to see the effect in the different charts.  Your battery bank is only  charged when your isolator relay connects it to the alternator and starting battery so its chart looks like this  The shape is really similar but the currents are much bigger because the bank is bigger and the voltages are lower because the bank is half discharged.  Your vans system still wants about A to run its own stuff.So now with that relay connected the all the voltages are the same law applies to all three pieces.  To figure out what its going to do I have to guess a voltage again to start.  I can make an educated guess and say maybe the system will run at .V which looks pretty close.  Lets see at .V our alternator puts out about A and our demand is A from the cars electronics plus about A what the mostly charged small battery wants at that voltage and a whopping A that our hungry battery bank wants at that voltage.  Thats a total load of A more than the alternator is putting out so Ive obviously guessed wrong.  If I try again it comes out closer  At .V the load is A car still about A starting battery too small a change to tell but down to about A on the battery bank.  The alternator can put out just a few more amps too.  So the load goes down to A and the alternators capacity creeps up to maybe .  Basically were about there whats really going to happen will be just between those two voltages but our charts arent good enough to be crazy accurate.Now with that example you can really see how the power gets split between the two battery banks.  Your starting battery doesnt want much because its too full to take much more at that low of a voltage and the voltage is still too high for it to discharge.  Your aux battery bank is just going to suck current in until it drops the alternators voltage down to a level where its being satisfied.Now to see what was going on with your rig the other day when your aux bank was really down heres a curve for your aux battery at only  charge  This is enough of a difference to start to suck juice out of your starting battery just like you saw.  Im going to guess .V first.  At .V your alternator is putting out about A your start battery is actually putting out about A.  Your van still wants A to run and your aux battery wants to suck up a full A!  Thats probably a pretty good guess on the voltage were within a couple of amps of everything adding up.  A or so from the alternator and start battery and  of it going into recharging the auxiliary bank.  You can see where even small changes in my guesses on making those graphs would make it draw harder from your starting battery.  If your aux was less than  charge left youd definitely pull a lot harder from the starting battery since your alternator is completely maxed out.  My alternator curve could easily have been generous for that alternator over A too since I just cooked up that part of the curve by eye until it looked right.  Unlike the batteries I dont have good hard data for that one just enough basic knowledge of how it works to cook up a chart.TLDR Nothing in the system really knows how to distribute the electricity each piece just has its own performance characteristics and the system will balance out naturally to whatever voltage makes the available supply from the alternator meet the demand from the car electronics and the two battery banks.,vandwellers,czv978l,2,t5_2rnwo

Easier to maneuver than a work type van.Dont bother moding it or anything like that just sleep in the back on a cushion or mat.Dont bother trying to cook in the van. Buy your food from the market in the evening. Buy boiled rice chicken breast can of beans and make a meal out of that. Eat the leftovers for breakfast.

The price seems fair but I would expect an older van with that many miles to need a lot of work. If the seller has service records it may not be a big deal but at this point your rolling the dice as to whether youll have a lemon on your hands.A few things off the top of my head if you had a mechanic look at it. i would have him run an Injector leakoff test as well check for blackdeath and check the condition of the Drive shaft there known to only last k miles and condition of transmission fluid.If youre not conformable servicing cars I would stay away from sprinters. They are very expensive to have work done. At a dealer an oil change would be  transmission  Torque converter fluid change . RemovalInspection of glow plugs . You lose a key it cost  for a replacement...etcIf your mechanically inclined I would do the above work plus change out differential fluid fuel filter beltshoses. If you have any rust spots sand it neutralize any rust with an inhibitor and paint over it. I just recently purchased a sprinter and am currently working on my conversion after I lost my former van Red Dragon...RIP. I wouldnt deter you away from sprinters but understand what your getting into and make sure you have deep pockets if you plan to outsource your repairs.    is a wonderful resource and should have several guides on what to look for when buying a sprinter. ,vandwellers,d1iesxa,1,t5_2rnwo

7504879,0,t3_4i4bdh,In the specific context of Urban dwelling one thing I still dont understand Its constantly recommended to black out your windows or use curtains for lightblocking and privacy but wouldnt these two things actually attract more attention from the law or people in general? With blackedout or heavily tinted windows I know there are state laws that dictate how heavily your windows can be obscured. And with curtains I believe its perfectly legal but wouldnt that immediately signal someone is in here or I have things of value I want to hide? This is of course not considering windowless cargo vans because I can see how they can be perfect in some settings but not so great in a residential city setting where people might get freaked out for some reason. What has occurred to me so far is to keep windows uncovered like any other normal van during the day time and use subtle rolldown curtains that you pop down only when heading to your sleeping spot for the night. That way if anyone does happen to walk by its night time with less visibility and they could just look like dark or tinted windows.Any thoughts on this topic? Thanks for any insight you can share.

If everyone did it this way is maybe not a relevant scenario to consider because its simply not that commonly done and isnt likely to become common.

With some milk or butter they are a total complete food containing all the right combos of carbs fat and protein. But that requires a good cooking surface Ill throw in rice here so you may need to be hooked up to make a batch of food and then keep it in Xtreme coolers with some daily ice which is a pain.

Because if they skipped that part or put in fiberglass or denim youre going to have to take everything out and replace. The bed frame is pretty minimum. It would work for now but you can make something better for storage at least to the front.

9443778,0,t3_5a1aec,The Yeti cooler may be worth the high price in some instances. If youre only worried about is keeping things cold for many days Yeti isnt for you.The Yeti cooler isnt a technological marvel. It was a couple of guys who wanted a cooler to keep things cold for several days AND and not get destroyed after a year of use.  of people do not beat their coolers to this degree. There are many coolers that will keep cold for any reasonable amount of time some even longer than Yeti. And theyll do it cheaper and lightweight. All you have to do is add insulation and reflect radiation. Make it thick. That is why Yeti and similar coolers have such thick sides.Where Yeti and similar competition like Rtic shine is that they are built to withstand heavy abuse. Think Hunting and fishing guides. It will be a seat kicked dropped tossed left in the sun and salt air etc. Most coolers will get destroyed.Yetis last. But most people do not abuse their coolers to that degree. They will not recoup the value of the cooler. Ask yourself how long you expect that cooler to last and how many coolers you could buy before you reach the cost of a Yeti or an Rtic etc. That is how long you would have to keep and use your Yeti cooler before it became cost effective.Because of the popularity of Yeti there is now competition for their type of market. Rtic works well as Im sure others do too. If you want heavy duty but large and heavy look at Yeti and its competition like Rtic. If you want cold for days but wont abuse your cooler and prefer lightweight and more inside space look at Coleman and igloo etc. max cold type coolers.,vandwellers,d9d2dvw,3,t5_2rnwo

9926169,0,t3_5hkjv0,I work in the bus industry so let me chime in.The double doors leak both air and water. If you live in a cold environment this can be an issue. There is no way to seal them effectively as they travel across check plate. Mitsubishi Rosa has a newish single panel swing door that can be sealed but double folding doors  no. The engine is hard to work on mechanically almost everything is done inside the bus. If you need to pull the engine out for anything you have  options  lift the bus up or drop the engine into a pit. Neither can be done unless you take it to a truck  bus mechanic. A normal mechanic will not always be able to perform this task.The axles are truck axles  they contain oil in the hubs. That seal can break and there is no way you drive it any further. The gearbox will need rebuilding no matter what. If the gear selector is not reaching a certain point there is something seriously wrong with it. This would have been driven by multiple drivers many dont always treat the vehicle nice.Radiators and turbo  all connections will break first. The turbo has an oil feed.These often have air  you need to work on that every  years. It cost big money to repair and gas them.Most common breakdown issue is the hubs belts cooling oil lines and turbo.,vandwellers,db1el39,31,t5_2rnwo
9927370,0,t3_5hmo4v,Whichever van has more glazed area will be colder  windows are basically holes that allow heat to rapidly enter or escape. However many camper vans have large vent holes for way fridges and propane furnaces which also make it hard to keep warm inside.The difference between the thermal lag of an uninsulated vs. insulated cargo van is enormous. Because the steel and glass of van bodies are so thermally conductive anything you can do to slow down the heat gain and loss helps. An insulated windowless cargo van can be warmer than a minivan  keep in mind the cargo van will have more air space inside to heat or cool.In cold climates insulated window coverings can help a lot  theres lots of different article online about how to make insulatedquilted window coverings like this one,vandwellers,db1k802,5,t5_2rnwo

How much will tuition be with and without scholarships? Also I assume youd start college in  months. Thats a lot of time to think and explore. You can enroll now and just not go later. If you already have scholarships you can probably coast for the rest of the school year. Start thinking beyond it. Volunteer places apprentice places read stuff experiment etc... Maybe youll find something that lights you up for studies or nonstudies in that time.But again recognize that college is essentially a mostly valueless piece of paper. You can learn all of it on your own through reading reflecting experiencing. Hell dont enroll in college get a van and just go to classes anyway. They wont even notice. Do the assignments that you want to do just for the hell of it. Download the textbooks for free. Take  courses at a time since the demands are lower. People do this.

10702529,0,t1_ddjvgiv,Well dont underestimate rednecks.  They make do with whatever they have.  For instance a redneck solution to reexpanding a tubeless tire on a rim after plugging it or booting it on the inside after repairing a hole is to spray ether starting fluid into the unsealed bead of the tire while pumping air into it from a compressor and then setting the ether off with a barbecue lighter.   When the ether ignites WHOOMP the expanding burning ether blows the beads of the tire against the rim creating a seal and the compressed air coming in the valve stem keeps it there.  We did this to a large offroad tire in the middle of nowhere.  Fortunately one of the guys we were wheeling with had a compressor on his x truck.  If I hadnt seen this trick with my own eyes I wouldnt have believed it was possible.  Or that easy.  The only problem was that it wasnt balanced and we could have solved that if we had thought to mark the tire and rim before we disassembled them.I once limped a  Chevy Apache  x loaded with firewood that had blown up the manual shift standard  transmission back down off the mountain in nd gear the only gear I had that still worked by filling the transmission with a couple of bottles of chainsaw bar oil because nobody had any W gear lube and the only mountain general store we could find was out of W engine oil.  Once I got it home I went down to the town junkyard and traded the owner a welding job for a  GMC transmission and patched the tailpiece off the  onto the gear box of the  and ran it.  I had to put a floor shifter in it and it whined pretty loud in st gear but it was still running three years later when I sold it.Redneck technology.,vandwellers,ddjvx3t,1,t5_2rnwo

Even if you did all that it is still a poor and incorrect way of making a roof penetration.

11129446,0,t1_der928o,Its nearly impossible to use a HiLift jack to jack up a car to change a flat unless you also have the bumper jack attachment.  The BJA is a device that has a hooklike structure that hooks under the bottom edge of a standard truck bumper like a pickup truck or cargo van bumper and a little short chain link and then a boxlike structure that fits over the lift jaw of the HiLift jack.  A HiLift jack is really designed for farm work and is designed to lift the heavy drivewheel axle of a wheel tractor to dismount the wheel and tire.  They are just about universally used by offroaders whose vehicles have heavy steel bumpers with winches mounted etc.  These bumpers usually are constructed out of steel tubing or pipe and have flat places jacking points designed to accommodate a HiLift jack.  You can actually use a HiLift jack to winch out of a hole if you can find an anchor point like a tree and have the appropriate chains tow strap and treesaver.  Its a shit ton of work and hassle but if you are stuck in the middle of nowhere and have no help its at least possible to get unstuck.  Anybody who owns a HiLift jack should practice this procedure.  Out in the toolies in a mudhole with the daylight fading fast is no place to be learning how to do it.For jacking up for a flat I would choose an eight or tenton bottle jack or a scissors jack.  And use a jack stand and wheel chocks.  If you are on soft ground you need something under both the jack and the jack stand so the weight of the vehicle doesnt cause them to be pressed into the soft ground.  A piece of x or  plywood under each would work.  Any kind of sturdy lumber really.  Places like  Wheel Parts a x parts amp supply shop sell a special heavyduty plastic HiLift jack plate but its certainly not necessary.  They work well though.,vandwellers,detih7o,1,t5_2rnwo

At this point I figure thats my only option because I feel like him getting to experience the outdoors more wont compensate for how much time hell spend miserable in the van  even if I can keep him cooled efficiently.I love the little guy to death and I dont regret getting him but I also feel like Ive sabotaged my freedom in my s by adopting a cat.

Regarding heat it is best to use a dry heat source. Otherwise you still need a vent to remove the moisture when using propanekerosene.On the other side of the coin you can survive without insulation. Just sleep in the van as you would camp in the winter with good air circulation. For the summer stay in the shade as best you can and open all of the windows.

The gap between the back door and the body is big enough to not squish the cable in my case. I did this now with both a station wagon and a van and it works fine. Obviously mileage may wary but maybe his is something to look into. I did that because drilling a hole into the roof is something Id want to avoid at all cost.

So you have x to work with for cooking bathroom changing and much or your storage. x of that is for getting in and out so you have about x to work with. That is  sheets of paper by  sheets of paper.Everyone is always interested where folks end up on a build. Photos are often enough and put more pressure on you to only post the good stuff. Many videos are just rambling garbage.It sounds like  people? Please clarify. That makes a big difference.Toilet is going to chew up your space. Portable marine head is about the best and simplest option. They black water tank of these separates and can be emptied in any bathroom. Many people slide the passenger seat forward and place the head behind the seat for the evening. Cheapo option is a  gallon bucket with a seat. If you really have an issue I wouldnt skimp here.You will not have the space for a dedicated setup stove top and dont have the power for a toaster and neither for a microwave. Simplify you expectations. Id recommend a dual fuel propane and butane cooktop like the Gas One GSP. About  off amazon. See how it works fairly minimal space use.Power a good power setup  amp hr AGM battery  solar panel  solar controller  wiring . If  is price prohibitive forget the laptop just use your laptop when and where you can plug in. You probably can still work with the iPad. For about  you can get an Anker power pack for your phone and probalby iPad. Anker PowerCore  can charge an iPad mini twice. Always have with you an extension cord and multi outlet.

Both the MultiPlus and solar controller charge to .V .V  cell and float at less than that. The cells are rated for a max of .V so this leaves some room. I have the MultiPlus set to auto shutoff at .V .V  cell and the battery monitor has an alarm at .V.,vandwellers,dguq96r,2,t5_2rnwo

11799402,0,t3_687vfk, Id be curious about rust issues. I dont know how it is in Hawaii but on the each coast close to the beach cars get eaten up from the salt in the air. That bed liner paint job might be hiding rust. Id want to see before pictures of the body before they painted it.Aside from that real world talk... k for a wd van that has a not so great diesel that is also  years old.. NO way in hell.. lol ,vandwellers,dgxi44v,1,t5_2rnwo

Its labor intense and the bushings can be criminally priced. While at a shop getting an alignment after I replaced the whole front end myself on my truck a lady was miffed that they couldnt just do her cars alignment perfect with her really bad control arm bushings. ,vandwellers,dgxz5oo,1,t5_2rnwo

11807424,0,t3_68g66m,This bed is Robert Macphersons build. He uses it for RennFaire stuff. I was really interested in these for maybe doing base camp style camping while overlanding. You could vac pack a foam padmattress with the bench and unload it when you got to your spot. Set up your yurttent and then you got yourself a mobile bedroom. You can find the plans here as well as some other woodworking plans. Mainly the site has beds but theres some storage stuff on there as well.,vandwellers,dgyeut3,38,t5_2rnwo
