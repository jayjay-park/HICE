Obviously  morphology is just a small step in analysis things that look the same might function totally different. That being said I would wager things that look different do not behave the same. Really I was curious to see if there were notable  morphological differences. If not then I would assume its airborne quality was more a molecular function even though its all molecular of course but then you might as well just say its all physics.That paper talks about differing morphologies of influenza from spherical to filament and the different properties each has  along with the type of cell that it infects more readily. ,ebola,ckfvu2i,3,t5_2xabe

Even though she has no symptoms there is riskIts not known with certainly exactly when someone starts shedding virus. There is some evidence that virus can started shedding even during mild symptoms or slightly before. It is known that symptoms can start suddenly. What happens if she is away from home and suddenly becomes sick?You are wrong to assume that vomiting or other fluid release will not start suddenly. This can happen. You have no evidence to assert that it MUST be the case that she can safely return home if symptoms start. There is risk of unexpected surprising things happening if she is away from home and becomes sick. She could be in a car accident. Or become stranded somewhere. Or become lostdisoriented. In that case she could be wandering around and nobody would know where she is and people in the vicinity would have no idea she was infected with ebola. Ebola can be transmitted though the air. This increases the risk of allowing her to travel in public. Allowing this person to go in public while she should be quarantined is all risk and no benefit. It makes no sense.

Secondly in experiments such as that theres a protocol to follow. You need to know how the dog contracted it you need a control group possibly more infected dogs after that.

2078987,0,t3_2iow58,This is what I keep coming back to. Ebola patients have left African countries while asymptomatic only to get sick in Europe. BUT  this has never happened in the US. IOW we are in uncharted territory.. We are quickly accruing evidence that heretofore existing trusted safeguards are proving at least sometimes fallible surveillance tracing protective protocol ala Madrid etc. . There is compelling evidence that the general message from the CDC and public health agencies which says infection is easy to avoid is not true and arguably demonstratively at odds with what scientists already knew. I admit to a higher degree of mistrust in official statements than your average educated American but I would argue there is a convincing rationale for why the CDC et al might downplay risks to avoid hysteria.. We are entering cold and flu season which means more vulnerable immune systems as well as more traveling respiratory droplets in general. I would assume there is higher risk as a result. Even if that resulting risk is still tiny. . Does preparing mean spending money on things you cant reuse anyways? No matter what happens  I can always use drinking water bleach canned food hand sanitizer. If we saw an outbreak in my community would  on a highgrade respirator be worth it to put my mind at ease? Probably. But Im not buying one today.

2085943,0,t1_cl4xwov,Thank you.  I actually saw that study referenced after posting however there was no link.  Still theres no known instance of a human being infected by a dog though.I do understand why you might want to take precautions and not let the dog around humans but the study also saysAlthough dogs can be asymptomatically infected they may excrete infectious viral particles in urine feces and saliva for a short period before virus clearance as observed experimentally in other animalsIn other words they dont stay infected for very long.  This would suggest quarantine is an effective deterrent for spreading the virus via animals.  While some would suggest that this is an unnecessary waste of resources Id argue that its critical we provide for this even if we have to charge patients for the cost of quarantine.The reason is that many many people treat their pets as family members and would try to hide their dogs if they thought the authorities were going to kill them.

These individuals should not travel by commercial conveyances e.g. airplane ship longdistance bus or train. Local use of public transportation e.g. taxi bus by asymptomatic individuals should be discussed with the public health authority. If travel is approved the exposed person must have timely access to appropriate medical care if symptoms develop during travel. Approved longdistance travel should be by chartered flight or private vehicle if local public transportation is used the individual must be able to exit quickly.Dr. Frieden has mentioned this controlled movement and that its part of selfmonitoring several times in the last few days but all of the above is from before this nurse got on the flight. ,ebola,clbjyrj,12,t5_2xabe

This is the reason dense populations are more threatened by it.  The US population will be FAR faster to fall if we are as susceptible and unavailable to get help.  The deaths will not all be by ebola either.  We move FAR faster and interact with far more people per capita than they do.  Unimpeded it will spread faster and further.Drop ONE severely ill undiagnosed virulent contagious noncurable sample into the US and it does FAR more damage in costs of life and economic impact than in West Africa.I am not advocating genocide.  I am saying there is NO WAY based on their maps we can help everyone.  Seeing their numbers of estimated losses is mindcrushing.  compromising a continent on the other side of the globe to expedite action against it needs validity.  Let MCF stop saying were tapped out send more.  and let us here  when we get this much we have a chance to beat it.  They are painting a picture where anyone with hope is delusional.  So of course we want to build a freaking moat!  There is NOTHING in that region of any interest but humanists inhabitants and political and corporate interests.  And Ebola is not even the cream of a society where the average income is  annual.  How do we globalize that?

Do tests go through isolations in defended areas and get people out of there who are not ill.  The costs will be great.  Either way.  What we can do is save a good part of certain areas and secure them and fight it back.  but it is clear we need a line of scrimmage impassable and mercilessly defended or we will have multiple indexes at large in transcontinental outbreaks.

2140790,0,t3_2ji5j3,A travel ban doesnt necessarily mean that absolutely no one can travel.The solution is to have the State Dept. and Congress create a special visa authority for travel to and from West Africa. Travel visas will only be issued upon highly individualized application reviews evaluating the reason for travel and the applicants past medical history. Medical documentation is a must. Precautionary quarantine may be required. In other words not all travel has to stop but the screening procedures and passenger scrutiny have to goway up to the point where we only have a couple of flights exiting the country per day.For the record there arent many direct flights from the  main affected countries to the U.S. Most of those flights go to the E.U. Lot more flights to the U.S. come from Lagos Nigeria Ghana and South Africa.

In theory you typically expect that this happens because more parameters always allows a better fit but the reason this surprises me is that usually polynomials are poor models of exponential behavior.In any case this is a mere math exercise. Parameter search for curve fitting must always be coupled to a reasonable prediction model that gives the shape of the function you try to fit. It is a well known result that if you use enough parameters for a polynomial fit your polynomial will go through every point exactly. This doesnt make it a great model.So far we have reasons to believe that exponential behavior is closer to the correct model because the disease is spreading by contact in community where each such infected person is likely to meet and infect approximately  other people who are previously unexposed to the disease.,ebola,cldknvs,2,t5_2xabe

Or in the case of the cold care syrup it might boost immune response to influenza viruses maybe.There are also people who call themselves homeopaths who provide more custom formulas to help people. As in most alternative medicine fields maybe  of practitioners have a mastery of the art and can help some people find relief or heal themselves. The rest are banking on placebo effect which is a real phenomenon but not nearly as useful as real healing power.The people who think that they can cure with Ebola infected tissues are deluded or hucksters.

That is just standard public health practice for infectious diseases such as Ebola.  Or are we saying that we need to allow people who have Ebola to roam freely the way we do allow people who have HIV to roam?  We also allow family members living with loved ones in the late stages of HIV to roam freely.  We cant do that with Ebola.  This disease does have to be isolated in a much more stringent manner than HIV.  The two diseases are not at all alike in this manner.  A child with HIV can still be in contact with other children.
