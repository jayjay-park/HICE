9342893,0,t3_58az5b,I didnt know this game existed not generally into games. I just read a bunch about it and this looks like the coolest game ever. Awesome progressive plot and gameplay and a riot grrrl soundtrack?  Wow. I want to play this so badly.  Unfortunately since Im not into games I cant play it either due to only having older consoles and a weak old laptop. Guess Ill be listening to Team Dresch and playing Super Mario World today. Hope other people have played and discuss so I can live vicariously.,riotgrrrl,d90a1kp,3,t5_2tgc4
10804536,0,t3_5ufrbp,Im in a band called HoityToity. We released our SelfTitled debut EP last August when we played the Pomona date of Warped Tour and we also released our newest single Opus on New Years Day. We recorded both of those at Hybrid Studios in Santa Ana with some studio time we won in a contest. We also have an older single called Off Course that was recorded in our drummers home studio and is a little bit more oldschool punk. Our newer stuff is kind of a mixed bag of alt pop and rock with punk influence. Our music is available on Spotify iTunes SoundCloud Google Play and a bunch of others. You can also find us on Facebook Instagram Twitter and of course our official websitehoitytoityofficial.com ,riotgrrrl,ddueu40,2,t5_2tgc4
