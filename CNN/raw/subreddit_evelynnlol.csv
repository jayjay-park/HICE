6177964,0,t1_cyrc09z,You can tune your runes too if youre going to start camp and then immediately invade the enemy at their first buff the pure damage here is probably your best bet to surprise them with a big E Q Q ignite combo for an easy first blood on all but the strongest junglers especially after the buff has roughed them up a good bit. Even better if you can get away with a smiteless leash so that you can steal the enemy buff. Most people smite the first camp to get the bonus and therefore cannot smite the buff. Its free pickings for you.,evelynnlol,cyrvcb6,1,t5_31gxs
