9963708,0,t1_db63uie,Thank you! I have been awful at updating this sub and overhauling the Info and wiki pages for it and this will be great for people for the time being. Ive got lists of V lives and performances and will get them and member profiles and histories up hopefully soon. I say hopefully because Ive been meaning to for most of this year but I am a bad mod. ,bap,db6apmk,2,t5_2ug0y

10960035,0,t3_5waci3,I dont get it? Whats so offensive about thanking someone that put a lot of time into being his fan? Jesus Christ some people just piss me off. Poor Zelo he handled it well but I cant imagine it wasnt without any worry over whether it would blow up or any guilt too. ,bap,deag7mx,3,t5_2ug0y
