People often look at roguelike in terms of concrete mechanics if you instead look at gameplay dynamics that those mechanics enable you get much more interesting results.Permadeath and random generation combine to make roguelike games have high stakes. Fire emblems character death emulates permadeath but in a much more forgiving way.

CatnipAddict has a bunch of videos up for DCSS as well and he does quite a bit of explaining as he goes on.Keep in mind though that a lot of DCSS commentary is opinionbased and geared towards what you want out of it. Surely some people will favor one god over another and some people will swear by one branch over another.

Im knee deep in rewriting the Corpse Wizard animation system which is turning into a full scale refactoring.  Sadly Im not sure its worth the trouble.  The master branch is undoubtedly a bit deep in technical debt but Im not sure reworking the animation system will produce a game that feels materially better.  At present Corpse Wizard feels pretty smooth since the game processes your inputs without waiting for tweening to finish.

1421343,0,t1_citxyeo,Beyond what Gastrox said I would avoid playing characters with a low hit point aptitude until you are a better player. They are much more vulnerable to mistakes and thus more likely to just suddenly die.If you want to play a caster than I would suggest doing a draconian or demonspawn. Both of them have acceptable hit point aptitudes reasonable spellcasting aptitudes and have fun abilities to look forward to as you advance. In addition to the general advice Gastrox gave I would like to add two more pointsWhen a monster first sees you walk towards an explored area. It will follow you and you will dramatically reduce the chance that you will allow another monster to notice you. This will save you from a lot of dangerous situations. If it does not notice you wait in place until it does or you leave its line of sight. Never play when tired or apathetic. The quality of your decisions goes way down.

1671243,0,t3_2difm9,Im trying to picture what a multiplayercoop roguelike would look like.  Most of them are turnbased and deliberative which would kind of make multiplayer feel...slow I would imagine.  But as allthingsfluff mentioned the games you cited arent really what I typically think of when someone says rogue likes.  Theyre more like roguelites in the sense that they borrow a few elements of your typical roguelike and apply them to action games....which is fine.  This is not an exercise in what is a roguelike?  You just need to worry about making a fun game.  But if youre looking for feedback a little more clarity on what youre proposing is probably in order since roguelike means many things to many people.When I think of multiplayer coop roguelike I envision something like Diablo.  Its got randomly generated procedural death mazes an emphasis on loot collection and usage hordes of monsters to slay etc.  And it was damn fun.  I dont think we need another Diablo though  fun as it was it was pretty shallow.So perhaps thats where some nice roguelike elements could be brought in to cooperative play the interesting combinations of interesting effects from loot the drink the potion to see what it does and hope it doesnt kill me kind of experimentation etc.  In other words the complexity and emergent strategy side of things.  Most games like this content themselves to differentiating weapons with damage type and DPS type things because theyre easy but they get boring pretty quickly.What Id do is play some of the more hardcore rogue likes and get a feel for the kind of crazy stuff that happens in them and see if you can envision a way to bring those sorts of elements to multiplayer.That said to answer your question about would you be excited for this kind of game? well sure.But.Roguelikes are a pretty niche interest at least on the more hardcore end.  I could get friends together to play Diablo  rarely  but if I were to pitch something like multiplayer DCSS I really dont think Id get any takers amongst my group of gaming friends.  So in that context while the game sounds conceptually interesting from a practical standpoint I dont see myself playing it.  I love me some classic roguelike action but I dont know a lot of people personally who I could get into my living room to play a multiplayer version of it.,roguelikes,cjptlvi,4,t5_2rhpi

Some people say its a bit kitchen sinky so they at world gen let you disable content you dont want say you only want typical zombies and not electric smoking zombies click the option.For me the wealth of options makes it. Are you going to just try and survive? If so how? Fight your way through grocery stores with a shopping cart like its supermarket sweep then hold up in an apartment for months at a time until you run out of pepsi and porknbeans and have to make another shopping trip? Do you head out into the woods get a farm going smoke a pipe and sit on your porch sunrise to sundown always watching for a lone zombie or mutant that might set foot on your property? Or are you going to try and solve the mystery? Find locked doors and the means to enter and then explore the depths of longabandoned facilities? I wont say more to avoid spoiling the HFS but let me tell you there is a LOT of different shit out there to find some of it very very terrifying. So thats really what makes the thing fun. Theres no goal other than not die unless the beforementioned HFS has some secrets that cause a good end that I dont know about but its a blast.

All the gods will do different things based on how much they like you and when you prayed last praying repeatedly pisses them off and they will punish you. Although the first god you always find except the Valpurus and Mortifier will give you a benefit if you pray.

3300744,0,t1_cp1tprb,So I have done localization for HyperRogue and here are my thoughts. There are people who want to help by translating so I did not have to do everything myself.  I still have to create or use some localization engine. I am Polish and in my experiences Polish localization is often done extremely poorly. For example Android has a simple localization system where strings can be provided in versions for several languages. This does not take some things into account for example a single English word could have to be translated differently depending on the context nouns have genders and cases some apps use workarounds so that they dont have to know genders and cases for all nouns but this is rather ugly and such a simple system has no chance of doing this nicely. Moreover some apps apparently do an automatic translation which is incorrect hard to understand and extremely annoying. I have set a challenge for myself to make a translation engine which produces beautiful Polish sentences with correct grammar which even takes the players gender into account  I like programming such stuff so this was actually fun for me. Translating to Polish was some work but not too much either. The sentences in HyperRogue are rather simple they refer to at most two objects at least so far and the rest of the sentence is fixed. So this is relatively easy I guess it could be harder if the game generated sentences procedurally such as Monster critically hitspunchescuts... monster for  damage breaking its chain mail and killing it.  I am still working on updating HyperRogue which produces new lines so I have to ask my translators to work again. I like to release new stuff early so I have to either wait some time before all the translators manage to find time to do their jobs or to release a version with incomplete translation and update later. This is a significant inconvenience although it is bearable. On the other hand my Vapors of Insanity has a quite complicated grammar system where sentences are not given in plain texts but constructed from words each sentence calls objects methods to provide their names in correct grammar there is a list of all verbs used by the game and the sentence prints the relevant one etc.. Since VoI is based on the idea that everything can be used anywhere there is no serious distinction between player items and monsters so this way I create a single sentence and it will be presented as for example you slash the orc with the sword the orc slices you with the axe you kick yourself with your right leg or the orc hits the goblin with you depending on the circumstances. Hopefully this should be translatable.,roguelikes,cp4ietm,2,t5_2rhpi

4906447,0,t3_3i3app,Making a good tileset is really hard.  I was watching an Angband lets play with tiles and they were just HORRIBLE you have no idea what icons actually represent at that point youre better off just playing with the text version instead.  However for games that have great tilesets and DCSS is the poster child here as far as Im concerned then they are preferable to text indeed.I play Moria and Angband and Sil in ASCII but Id never play DCSS without tiles theres just so much more information you can convey with a picture than with a single character.  For example in DCSS if an enemy is unaware of you it has a small ? icon on it if its scared it has a ! and if its sleeping it has a few zzzs.  Another thing its easyish to spot casters and melee characters the orc priests wizards and sorcerers have robes while the orc warriors knights and warlords have armor.  The same goes for the unique orcs Nergalle looks like shes going to cast at you while Urug and Saint Roka look like theyre coming over to give you a solid beating.  This sort of quick information cannot be as easily communicated with a single character you need an auxiliary information channel in Moria every time I see an enemy I need to press x and move my cursor on top of it to know what Im dealing with to know which spell to cast.Someone in a past thread made this comment which rings trueGood tiles gt Good textBad text gt Bad tilesI think that the tiles in DCSS do a better job than its text mode however in Vanilla Angband the tiles are not good enough and so the text is going to be preferable.,roguelikes,cuczt8f,6,t5_2rhpi

5250268,0,t3_3mwvgu,Well it shouldnt be a huge surprise that DCSS is better in this aspect as playability without need for spoilers is one of the design goals I would assume in direct response to Nethack.Ive also wondered this question. My speculation is that it was just really one of the best RLs around for its first  years starting in . The DCSS project didnt start until  and of course all the modern RL and roguelites that come after. Im assuming its partially nostalgia but also that the insane difficulty draws a lot of attention. Im going to butcher this explanation but here goes personally I find myself drawn to hard games as I slowly start to conceptualize them as public challenges i.e. thousands of people trying to attain the same goal for many years. Its almost like how Everest is a thing a challenge as much as it is a mountain. I think thats how DCSS really hooked me. I suppose Nethack occupied that space in peoples minds for so long that its entrenched. Its a really big deal to beat Nethack especially without spoilers.gtI can wax poetically for hours about this but I thoroughly love the mountain said Alan Arnette a mountaineer and respected Everest blogger based in Fort Collins Colo.

5789316,0,t3_3ufrdn,While the whole AAA being aimed at the mass market thing is going to be the main reason I think that the nature of Roguelikes particularly permadeath has something to do with it.A typical RPG is going to be played through once if that by most players.  Theyll pick one starting character and get whatever loot the game generates and level up in whatever way they choose.  And theyll keep developing that one character over many many hours until they finish or get bored.This means the experience needs to be balanced in a way that a Roguelike doesnt and indeed is better for not being.  The starting options need to be broadly equal so that you avoid some players entire experience with the game being spoiled by it being too hard or too easy.  Same with loot  you cant have a tiny chance of a fantastic weapon dropping very early or if you do that weapon will need to be level gated so it cant be used until near the point the player was meant to have such a thing.  Equally you cant have a small chance of something really bad happening.More generally the game needs to start simple and get more complex since players will learn as they go and pushing complex systems and choices at them when theyve only just started playing will lead to them being ignored or bouncing off the game.With a Roguelike though the players play through from the beginning again and again.  No matter if some of the racesclasses are much stronger than the others or some require a deep knowledge of the games systems from the very start.  That just provides interest for longtime players.  And pieces of outstanding good or bad luck just make individual runs interesting  and the lack of saves means that bad luck becomes something to deal with and overcome rather than just moan about then quickload.,roguelikes,cxepwh0,2,t5_2rhpi

5953666,0,t1_cy01lhw,The problem with that is chasing a monster into an unexplored area is a trap. Its something you should never do as an experienced player. So it just seems frustrating for everyone. It annoys experienced players because picking off the fleeing monsters or trapping them so they cant flee in the first place is tedious and for new players who have more attachment to their characters they get annoyed when they fall into the trap of chasing monsters and die because of it.I think ranged enemies do a much better job of creating the same situations without being as much of a trap for newbies.,roguelikes,cy020y1,9,t5_2rhpi

5970656,0,t1_cy28uc9,Gotcha. I think were saying the same things with different words and confusing things. I do that a lot..... One of my veryhighlevel visions  I have lots of those too  is to support multiple different clients at the same time. Theres no reason why a wellarchitected server cant support Telnet Actual Telnet using an actual Telnet client that speaks the Telnet RFC and supports many of the Telnet Options SSH WebSockets for an HTML UI or even for a thick client UI on mobile devices for example and to an extent supports MUD Clients with a cut down user experience that works better for those clients. If you can do client negotiation using the various options available you might be able to correctly identify the client in question and have a TCP exchange with that client that best works for it. Of course thats a long way off if it ever happens at all but I can dream The big worry I have with a project like this is the target audience. Ive no idea how much an online persistentworld game will appeal to Roguelike players and Ive no idea how much a Roguelike UI will appeal to MUD players. Especially if you also tell them that you cant use the MUD client that youre most attached to.It might be that the overlap is a huge hit and both sides of the fence  and more besides  love it. It might be that both sides of the fence hate it and nobody wants to play it at all. Thats the big gamble I suppose...,roguelikes,cy2a8ga,1,t5_2rhpi
6009083,0,t1_cy74584,DCSS is kind of like the roguelike genre distilled down with minimal extra fluff and less with every release. It certainly has its flaws but its clear and consistent design philosophy helps it to remain one of the most popular roguelikes out there.,roguelikes,cy7blla,5,t5_2rhpi
6011479,0,t1_cy7mh6l,It depends on how it worked but most likely no.Broadly there are two ways you could do accomplish it. Either you make it a random chance or a triggerable action.Random chance is easier for you to implement and for the player to understand. Its also harder to break that is there wont be a sequence of actions players can use to trivialize encounters while also helping to make sure players actually see the mechanic. On the other hand this makes it little more than a glorified critical failure mechanic. It would be nice when it happens just like hitting a crit is but not particularly interactive or memorable in the long run particularly if lots of enemies can do it simply because its bound to happen quite a few times and requires no input or skill on the players part.The other option is to make it triggered via player action. This route is very much a matter of getting out what you put in. On one end of the spectrum you could have a basic type weakness or special item setup where you hit the enemy with right colored attack or the turncoat powder and they help you. This is also relatively easy to set up but also prone to breaking and not particularly interesting once a player gets the hang of it since it will either be to expensive to use regularly or always the right choice. On the other end you could create a rather indepth system that revolves around enemies reacting to what you do in various predictable ways and combat encounters become more an exercise in puzzle solving than anything else. This setup has the possibility to be very interesting but would also be extremely hard to design and balance.Its its worth pointing out that the neither of the first two options benefit from you being able to misstarget spells with the possible exception of buffing an enemy but that probably still isnt worth it. Its to easy to avoid once the player grows even moderately comfortable with the controls to serve as a balancing point and theres no mechanical reason to link them.The final option reaction based puzzle combat could benefit from the ability to misstarget spells but again would be very hard to design. However even in this case the reason to allow misstargeting is not because the enemies can also misstarget but because its a possible action for them to react to.,roguelikes,cy7mumt,2,t5_2rhpi

I mean on ranged characters ammo scarcity is in itself a valuable resource that gets consumed rapidly of you grind weapons get damaged after to much uses etc.Why is it always food?

6149071,0,t1_cyoi4fi,About Jeff Laits games... I dont know what exactly makes them special. Of course I can say that Sword in Hand has unique for roguelikes makedecisionchangehistory flavour feeling that The Smiths Hand is rather unique roguelike game with strong economy flavours that  Day Band is unique roguelikegamebuilder that You Live Only Once! is unique narrative roguelikes which encourages to reflection.Unique? So great ideas? For sure this is very important but this isnt the only reason. Jeffs roguelikes are well done and his engineimplementation is good rather bugfree and tested in many drls. But the most important thing is balance. Not only difficulty balance rather balance between complexity and simplicity. Every of Jeffs games is about certain thing certain mechanics or certain story. So these games are very simple in macro scale and detailed and welldesigned in micro scale  I mean this one thing which is theme of game. It makes these games good as coffebreaks  but they provide entertainment for a much longer time than standard coffe break.Probably it sounds like psychofans blubbering...

I use it everyday and cant imagine living without it.For the ones who dont know what it is It adjust the screens colors to filter out the blue hue that comes with every monitor. The blue hue prevents the generation of melatonine. Thats the stuff that makes you drowsy before going to bed. By dialing it down the melatonine gets generated.

Its hard enough that you cant just amove and win but not so hard that you need to bury yourself in year old forums working out how to abuse mechanics to win.And the biggest part of it to me the ingame chat is incredibly useful to help retain players.

The things that make a roguelike what it is are common to turnbased tacticalstrategic games more than to RPGs. Diablo  falls on the other side of that. ,roguelikes,d4huh8q,11,t5_2rhpi

If you play a ranged character psychic or physical head over to a river or lake and murder some madpoles from a distance theyre strong and dangerous but they dont leave the water so if you have a way to kill them theyre easy XP.

I mean the idea is to roll many successive characters instead of just one and only one.Honestly I like the suggestion of singletimeline much better than my own.The idea of permanent death is kind of funny at least in our culture.  What other kind of death is there?  Isnt it an oxymoron to begin with given a stereotypical understanding of death?  Thats why I suggested temporary death.  In a roguelike death isnt the end and in some the continuity between character lifetimes is even formalized for example in poschengband you get to keep monster memory if you start your new game from a dead characters save file.  In ToME you unlock things I dont like this mechanic btw that persist across multiple characters.  In CDDA you can start your new character in the same world as the dead one and find the old characters stuff and in some loose sense pick up from where you have left off assuming you were able to find the old stuff.,roguelikes,d7vsk6d,1,t5_2rhpi

Binding of Isaac Dont Starve and many of the other games that commonly get peoples knickers in a twist still contain the elements that people enjoy in roguelikes and define the genre by.  Namely things like procedural content heavy consequences unpredictability making contingency plans and so on.If you want to make a more appropriate comparison it would be like someone looking up FPS and finding Tribes Ascend then once they get into the game they press a button and discover that it has a third person mode.  Thats not first person!  OMG!  RAISE THE PITCHFORKS!Defining and tagging a game as a traditional roguelike or Berlin roguelike would be useful if youre looking for a very strict representation of the genre but throwing a hissy fit just because a game deviates slightly from the formula is needlessly pedantic and regressive.  Genre is a fluid vague and most importantly descriptive thing not a strict law of conduct.To springboard off of your example there are games which are undeniably shooters yet are still simulation ARMA or strategy Natural Selection games as well.  They contain core elements from both genres and fit both genres.  Leaving out either would be a disservice to the games description.

10468122,0,t1_dctbtvz,Both cogmind and URR use customised graphics.  While theyre visually more on the side of ASCII than nonASCII theyre really nonASCII graphic games when it comes down to it.  The characters they use do not exist in nonbitmap fonts and many are hand made graphics for things like chairs or directional arrows and so on.  In the case of Cogmind the author had to visually distort the font by hand editing to get the feel he was going for i.e. square tiles versus half square for graphics and characters respectively and displayed using original ASCII fonts it would be a much less playable experience let alone unreadable.Theres an argument to be made that any game that uses a font bitmap is nonASCII but generally if they stick to the standard characters they can run both in terminal and using something like libtcod which uses the font bitmap.  Which is what for instance Brogue did in its initial releases.The distinction made on the case of Cogmind and URR is important because I think both show ASCII can benefit from a little enhancement as long as you preserve the feel.  And it reminds people who are inspired by both to make their own games that you wont get the same professional feel from just using standard unmodified ASCII character set fonts.,roguelikes,dcuo2wx,5,t5_2rhpi
10470477,0,t3_5pyx5w,There are an array of DRLs that might appeal to you as long as you accept the fact that after youve done a couple of completions youre likely done with the game. DRLs tend to be short lt hr with novel gameplay and some of the best of them are really amazing. For variety of gameplay my biggest recommendation would be PrincessRL There are league tables which help pick out the best from each year        Oh and theyre all free! You honestly have enough good games to keep you happy for years there Amongst the bigger roguelikes the top recommendations would be DoomRL and Brogue which both fit the h gap for a full run.,roguelikes,dcuxpj4,9,t5_2rhpi

10993208,0,t3_5wxupb,I do not dislike dogs quite the opposite butIf you had asked me this few months ago I would have answered Doom Hound DCSS.It can make you howl and that makes high tier monsters to appear right next to you. Cannot be resisted and it can do its thing behind the crowd. Buff enough that it barely can be oneshotted. Can be Hexed but they are usually lurking behind some goddamn reapers so their only weakness is not always exploitable. Seriously annoying!If you ask me this now Ill answer Time Hound Angband.There is basically never a reason to fight Time Hound packs. Stat drains are annoying as hell and outright dangerous if you cannot cure them. Damage from time breath cannot be resisted. And of course they do not drop anything. DangerProfit . One could arguably say the same about Plasma Hounds,roguelikes,dee1nay,6,t5_2rhpi

And it feels like he was more interested in talking about his favourite game than in actually contributing. For example my roguelike of choice is Dwarf fortress adventure mode but I didnt suggest it because I dont really think it is the best entry to the genre.If I ask for an FPS and someone suggests broforce they are wasting my time regardless of the fact that broforce is a great game. ,roguelikes,dfchr6y,12,t5_2rhpi
