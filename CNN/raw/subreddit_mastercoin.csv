1125690,0,t3_26ydwa,gt When considering only the interest of MSC holders  uripper gt Please also be aware that MasterCoins are not in any way equity. They dont give you ownership of any company I might start and they certainly dont give you voting or control over this project.   Partial List of Risksgt The more general answer is that Mastercoin provides a set of features that only work with MSC or Mastercoinbased currencies and there is a limited number of them. So in order to enjoy these features you have to own some mastercoins giving them an independent value. The more real world usage Mastercoin sees the higher the value of each mastercoin.  Mastercoin Wikigt  Will provide initial funds to hire developers to build software which implements the new protocol layers and ongoing funds to pay for maintenance of this software.  gt gt  Will richly reward early adopters of the new protocol in proportion to how successful it is.  MasterCoin Complete Specification vs. . First Complete SpecificationI under no circumstances feel that an increase in Mastercoin valuation due to the intentional and unnecessary monetization of the Master Protocol is representative of success in any way.The question should be what can we do to give value to the Master Protocol? not what can we do to make Mastercoin more valuable? I understand that there is a certain focus on the valuation of Mastercoin however this obsession is not conducive to developing a product that people want to use.gt In order to understand the need for the Master Protocol and Mastercoin we need to first consider the following fact Bitcoin is an opensource project with a capitalization of several billion US dollars Bitcoin is not a company and bitcoins are not stocks but if one multiplies the number of existing bitcoins by the price of one bitcoin one comes up with the capitalization. As such changes to the Bitcoin protocol have to happen very carefully because if something breaks the whole Bitcoin economy may collapse. Making changes to the protocol while the network is in use has been likened to fixing a  airplane while in flight and because of that the developers working on Bitcoin have been extremely careful introducing new features.gt gt The Master Protocol was created so that new and innovative features could be implemented relatively quickly.  Mastercoin WikiMaybe the issue is that implementing new and innovative features cannot be done relatively quickly because the Master Protocol in which these features are to be implemented is defined by these features. The development and implementation  of a protocol takes years  the development of features is relatively quick.  and the development of the Master Protocol is closer in magnitude to the bitcoin protocol than initially thought.The project has yet to be successful and its foolish to think that the Master Protocol has value until it implements the features which are unique to Mastercoin. This project is not an addition to bitcoin  in fact the only thing in common with bitcoin is the method of data storage  it is its own unique protocol.The discussion of monetization is years too early and the premise severely misguided with regard to the the goal of the project and intended function of Mastercoin as demonstrated July st .,mastercoin,chw8z3o,3,t5_2y1vq
