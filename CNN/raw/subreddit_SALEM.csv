7358529,0,t3_4g4vsh,Im sorry youre going through all that. Im also  and just wow... being out on the streets would be so tough.If youre really looking for a job there are jobs. It also can depend on what skills you have. The Employment Department on Union Street has people who all they do is help you find a job. You can drop by their office and they help you write a resume and get ready to enter a job. Its all free.If you have access to a computer you can also check out the departments iMatchSkills You put in your skills and it matches you with job openings.There are also recruiters looking to fill positions in industrial and labor jobs The economy is so good right now in Oregon that recruiters cant fill all the open positions. Its a good problem to have.Seriously you can find a job if youre willing to show up to work on time and put in the hours. It may not be fun but itll be a job. In July minimum wage will be going up so that could be a boost too.Above all else please dont kill yourself. If you need to tell your story DM me. I could meet you and buy us a coffee sometime if you want someone to talk to. Hang in there.Edit I suck at formatting,SALEM,d2em4nq,13,t5_2rxnv

8484101,0,t1_d621qzh,If you can find a phone number for them online you could call them and give them the numbers off the back if you can read them. I only suggest this route because I used to work for the Fossil watch company and they would replace the crystal for free on their watches for life. Any other work they would let the customer know the price before actually doing anything but most things were covered. I know its a different brand but I would think a company like Citizen would have something similar. Worth a shot anyway. If you cant read the numbers they may not guarantee any work without actually receiving your watch first but its certainly something Id look in to before paying someone in town.,SALEM,d6223u4,2,t5_2rxnv
