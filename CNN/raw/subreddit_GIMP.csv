644418,0,t3_21izdf,Generally speaking fuzzy select is not a good choice for extracting an object from its background. At a guess the inside of the logo is a similar colour to the outside and somewhere there is a break in the logo boarder that allows the selection to spill into the inside. You generally need to post the image for useful help.,GIMP,cgdir5n,3,t5_2que6
647697,0,t3_21kbhy,I took up the gauntlet of the challenge you presented just to see if it could be done. I was able to get something pretty close to what you want by chopping the image up into two side walls roof floor and far end. I saved each section to its own layer so I could manipulate them as needed. Then I used a combination of Shear and Perspective tools on the walls then just Perspective on the other pieces. I did the floor nd to last and made sure to match the angle of the perspective to the mortar lines in the brick walls. then I put the end piece in place behind everything else as it really didnt need any perspective changes on it. I am sure that I could use the Clone tool to fill in the ragged edges out to the desired size.I would be happy to send you the .xcf file so you can see what I did but I dont know where I can post it for you to retrieve. I hope the description of my actions are helpful.Cheers,GIMP,cgdw67h,1,t5_2que6

1731849,0,t3_2e76wa,This looks great.  And I have a tip that might add an extra ..Typically when coloring a BW photo the easiest thing to overdo is shadow saturation.  Im noticing the pink shirt has an even saturation in the shadows and core values.also the face is just a solid color overlay. Try adding a little red to the shadow area and desaturating those a touch as well.  Also a touch of pickup color on the face will go a long way.just my ....

2883780,0,t3_2t5daf,Warning I dont use GAP There is an interleavelayers  script that can do this but I thinks this is also somewhere in GAP Not really or at least not completely. In GIMP an animated GIF can have only  colors total one single colormap but GIF supports  colors per frame one colormap per frame. So you can get better quality animations is you dont produce the GIF in Gimp. Typically you stilll use Gimp to create the frames but export them all as PNGs there are scripts for this and create the animation from the PNG using some other utility. Shiftclick on the eye icon of the layer. That will setunset the visibility of all other layers. void,GIMP,cnvvzli,5,t5_2que6

Where are you getting hung up on?Anyway from scratch its basically a mask made from a pencil sketch texture google images search examples. You can use something from the internet or create such a mask yourself by using the Filters gt Noise effects then use Filters gt Blur gt Motion Blur to stretch the dots in the correct direction. Then use levels or threshold to get it close to blackandwhite darken the sides and whiten the middle then use that for a mask on the original.,GIMP,cqriqw9,3,t5_2que6

6351963,0,t1_czb6c42,Some discussion on the gimpircirc.gimp.orggimp channel found the following Symbolic and Symbolicinverted switched placesThis is because the original version of the Symbolic icons currently in use is light and intended for a dark theme. SymbolicInverted is created from the Symbolic icons at build timeThis works just fine provided that the build system considers the Symbolic icons more recent than the corresponding existing SymbolicInverted ones. It doesnt work if you had already created the inverted icons between two of the recent commits e.g. if you follow the usual git fetch git pull make approach instead of building from a clean checkout.We guess that the packager of your build does this and so Jehan posted a notice on the GIMP mailing lists to warn about this issue and provide suggestions about how to resolve it it is quite easy actually but only if you build GIMP yourself.Youll have to wait for an updated package in the gimpedge repository.,GIMP,czbnbtq,1,t5_2que6

8839955,0,t3_519czn,I dont believe that you can enter alternate units in the New Guide screen.  Hopefully that gets fixed eventually.  So your options are. Best Change the units in the status bar bottom of the screen to in instead of px.  Show the rulers using ViewgtShow Rulers.  Open the Move tool set the toggle to Pick a Layer or Guide and click and drag on the rulers to create guides.  Youll be able to see the guide location in inches in the status bar at the bottom of the screen.. Look up the pixel density for your image in ImagegtProperties its Resolution and defaults to  pixels per inch then multiply your desired inches measurement by that number and use that as the guide number e.g.  inches     px   px.. Use the rectangular select tool to define the area you want to put guides around then use ImagegtGuidesgtNew Guides from Selection.  Since the rectangular select tool options let you specify the offsetsize in any units you can use inches.  The downside of this method is that you cant define a single guide this way you would have to define  guides at a time and delete the guides you dont want.  So I recommend the first option.,GIMP,d7afr3c,1,t5_2que6
