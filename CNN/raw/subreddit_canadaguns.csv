181577,0,t1_cez3obt,Hehe you mean tiny birdshot? yeah Ive got a couple boxes of those. Pretty useless though in general unless you like shooting little wasp nests.Actually thats not entirely true. I did use them twice. Once we had a sick rat near the house on our farm Big  inch long bastard that was just walking in really tight circles endlessly. Wouldnt even notice if you went near it. Probably brain damage or something. Couldnt just leave it so went to put it out of its misery.Anyways shot it in the head from  feet away with a fps pellet pistol. It left a bit of blood and ricocheted off somewhere but didnt kill it poor thing. So went and grabbed the . threw one of those in the chamber and shot it from up close and it was like lights out instant dead.Did the same with another larger mouse that got caught in a trap but wasnt quite dead yet. Dont like seeing things suffer but not about to squish it with a boot or something fucked up like that. little shotshell worked just fine there too. Minimum of mess no chance of dangerous ricochets short range and quiet.

The SR uses a modified system where the gas pushes a piston rod to cycle the bolt to cycle the next round.Yes the standard AR gets dirty where it shoots gases into the chamber some people call this unreliable but really  its not. The problem with the piston system is that it is complete nonstandardized.  The AR platform has been around for  years and all the parts are interchangable  the piston changes the upper.  Bolts from one piston may not work with another piston system.  Ditto with drive rod or other parts of the upper.Theres nothing inherently wrong with the piston AR but its an expensive nonstandard upgrade which doesnt really give you much of an advantage over a standard AR.,canadaguns,ciqe9sm,3,t5_2tzuf

At least with the Liberals and horrible as the budget was guys had a mission something to train towards and goal to work for. Harper gutted the army as soon as he was done with us he even made us leave most our new kit in the Stan to be cut to peices and released and entire corp of experienced soldiers. In two years it was worse than the whole decade of darkness under the Liberals and I have many Sgts and WOs who will attest to that fact. But hey he balanced his budget.

2868330,0,t1_cnttlff,Some rough numbers for reloading using Cabelas as a starting point because its Canadawide and has enough selection of examples.Starting with . a bag of  new unprimed federal brass is . for primers a pack of  Federal Champion s are . A  pack of Speer grain match bullets are . and then it comes down to powder.   With the above combination were running at the low end of about a buck and a penny per round There will be a silver lining Ill get to it.For powder IMR  should be good for the chosen grain bullet and is . a pound which will yeild you about  reloads. at grains per cartridgeSo roughly according to the scraps of paper on my desk the cost breakdown is aprox as follows p  per unit Primers . p cents pBrass . p  cents pbullets . p  cents pPowder . ppoundgrains  cents pSo for reloading . with a gr in new brass with IMR in that configuration is going to be in the neighbourhood of . per cartridge but you can reload the same brass multiple times which cuts out  cents of the cost from reloads two through six and possibly more depending on how the brass is wearingstretching. You just need to resize and trim as needed.You can also cut your costs by finding a shop in the vicinity or another webstore that sells the various components for cheaper. You can also bring home brass you scavenged from the range and shooting trips and sometimes other shooters do what I do and collect the brass and are willing to share it for free. I personally spend at least  minutes during each shooting trip doing brass collection and general cleanup which is one of the reasons I am usually shooting alone. Not many other people are willing to stay that long consistently especially in less than ideal weather.Quickly looking at box prices on both Canadian Tire and Cabelas it looks like factory is running around .  . per right now so you are coming in at about par but subsequent reloads just get cheaper. Or you can buy a box of factory shoot that then reload it for  cents per round.Ill scan and link you some Load Data from the same Speer book as the . shortly  and when you look at it youll be able to see where I pulled the powder amounts from. Here is the . Load Data from the same Speer book as before. I used the lower table on page  which is the third image for the powder type and amounts.You dont really need to be cunning to justify the spending just honest. Its a long term cost cutter as well as an extension to your shooting hobby and it will help keep you from sitting idle by doing mental exercise working out the loads as well as the act of reloading itself. If you can figure out how much you shoot per year and what the cost of that is and then start factoring in the cost of running to the store for it price fluctuations and all those boring numbers that shell probably want to help work out the cost efficiency you should be in the clear. Provided she doesnt balk at the initial expense of course.  Im glad to hear she is financially responsible though. I dont think enough people are anymoreWhen it comes to the equipment itself the cost to quality ratio is important. So while its easier to justify buying a Lee reloading press for less the tolerances and build quality arent as good as say an RCBS or a Dillon. Dies and trimmers are cheaper to start for a Lee as well but again the quality is not the same. A Lee reloader will do the trick and is adequate for run of the mill reloading but if you want to get the most performance out of your cartridge like by slugging the bore to get the dimensions for the best diameter for a more accurate load then youll want to go with something better.,canadaguns,cnu4p1c,1,t5_2tzuf

Its  and itll last you a bit. Itll be fun on a budget. Just make sure you put your guide rod back in properly because cheap s are known to jam if not. With regards to an ATT in BC youre kind of right.If you have a clubrange membership already you can apply for your Long Term ATT which in BC should cover mine says this To and from all approved rangesclubs and international border crossings in the province of British Columbia and Yukon Territory. Once you get this you can bring all your restricteds as long as you have the registration certificate between your home and these places.So you will need to call in for a Short Term ATT one time to transport it from the sellers place to you. Or you can meet at a approved range and borrow the gun from him then take it home from the range under his registration papers while waiting for your new registration papers which should come in the mail in about a week or two.,canadaguns,cprh5eq,2,t5_2tzuf

3552082,0,t1_cpwsugz,I think its important to learn the full details of the story though  if the officer was transporting a restricted or prohibited firearm and the hotel was an intermediate stop included on the ATT I believe that storage in a vehicle is permitted  under Transporting Firearms  Leaving any class of firearm in an unattended vehicle. On the other hand if the hotel was the destination listed on the ATT then the firearm was no longer being transported and I do not believe it is permitted to store it in an unattended vehicle  this would be akin to storing your restricted or prohibited firearms in a vehicle at your residence.That said I cant imagine it would be safer to leave the firearm in the vehicle instead of the hotel room. Lucky for the officer they are given the benefit of the doubt until the full details are released while an ordinary citizen could likely be facing charges already.

But it was a great lesson because I made a bad assumption that Cabelas was sure to be cheaper than the shop at a nearby gun range. Ill pay a bit more to support small local businesses but it wasnt worth the  more I expected to pay so I tried Cabelas first. When I stopped in to check it out I was pleasantly surprised that I could walk out with the gun I wanted and a little bit lesspoor than if I bought the same thing from Cabelas.

So they did a bit of research and made a completely arbitrary cut off at mm. A lot of guns have  mm barrels so this made about  of hand guns prohibited. Nothing to do with concealability even though thats what the official explanation was  I mean you dont have to be a genius to figure out that it should have gone by overall length not barrel length if that was true. Nothing to do with public safety either. It was just simply a case of we want fewer people in this country to legally own a handgun because fuck you thats whyOp dont despair  you will be able to own a  as soon as someone makes a mm barrel for it and imports it as such. The same thing has happened with many other pistols even sub compacts like the Glock . Looks a little silly and is more expensive but better than nothing.

All of ATRSs offerings are in the multi thousand dollar price range all the way up to  BMG precision rifles. People are comparing them to the rifles you see at cabelas that are generally of lower quality and dont have the support that ATRS can offer. Look at this ATRS AR    Pretty much the same price as the modern varminter so I would argue that the nonrestricted tax that you speak of is non existent you simply have to know where the rifle is coming from. They are a small shop that sell to the few that feel the higher quality is worth the extra . people argue back and forth about ATRS but there are few people have actually seen an ATRS rifle let alone owned one so take what you read with a grain of salt. ,canadaguns,cxdaosm,1,t5_2tzuf

It is those members of society who illegally own firearms who we need to worry about and a registry will not help us identify them because criminals dont register their guns. Police cannot safely assume that because there is no entry in a gun registry or PAL database that there is no gun present at a scene. Doing so would be naive and put officers in great danger.In conclusion registries do not enhance safety but only add a false sense of security which may actually put people at risk.

Hes a dick for the most part but in this instance hes correct. You need to work on you. Im sure theres a lot of issues surrounding what happened that you definitely need to get straight. Do not be afraid to pursue as much help as you need in order to get to a place where you feel good. Relapse is always possible but the more support you have in place the less likely it is to really turn dark. Not only that but friendly and qualified medical advice here. You really should consider what he mentioned about exercise. Not just because of the stress relieving benefits. You recovered from an acetaminophen overdose. That tends to leave lasting organ damage that has a nasty habit of manifesting itself as organ failure anywhere from  hours to  years after the fact. Exercise and proper diet will help mitigate some of those effects. The fact that you are typing this . years later is a positive thing. Most acetaminophen overdoses Ive dealt with resulted in a full recovery a few hours later followed by organ failure and death within a week or two. You got lucky. Its a second chance. Work on you and if you want to get into sports shooting make that your medium term goal. Work towards making yourself better not only in your eyes but they eyes of those around you.  years from now revisit who you are. Then pursue it.

I do want to change this subreddit to posting news and the discussion of pellet and Airsoft rifles hunting target shooting or anything involving pellet and Airsoft gunz and the Canadians who shoot pellet and Airsoft guns them.I think theres a bigger untapped market of pellet and Airsoft guns out there that were not taking advantage of and get it away from the  year old kids that may want to enjoy the aspect of real guns. But big black scary guns are what leading to societys downfall. Staying in line with our Liberal fascist overlords political intent of the pussyfication of our safespace requiring populace I think these changes need to be started in this subreddit which will carry over to Real Life and our subscriber base will boom after the Canuckian Charter of Human Internet Rights and Fear of All Things Scary becomes rereratified in our House of Common Sense making it mandatory for all us Maple Leafians and Beaver Brothers to be a part of this wonderful Internet subculture of Pellet Rifles and Airsoft rifle lovers.Also painting of guns be them real or Pellet or Airsoft or not will become illegal. uTheCrover youre fucked now.May the Fudd be with you.Ninja Airsoft Sniper Pellet EDIT AdiposeFin for PM and top Moderator!!

7297129,0,t1_d27mgk2,haha yeah Desert Eagle is fun but Ill probably not get one At first I loved the P but over time it started to grate on me. Because I spent all my time on the CZ  and SP I have my grip style based on that setup. On those pistols I ride the safety. On the P the slidestop is exactly where the safety would be so I ride the slidestop and the slide wont hold open on the last shot. Fucks up my rhythm in IDPA. I also find getting the whole thumbsforward grip on the P results in the takedown lever bashing my thumb. Maybe if I had bigger hands and my thumbs were longer it wouldnt be a problem but for me my thumb is right behind the takedown and under recoil it just bashes me.My whole problem with the P which is still a great pistol on paper is that for me to be able to use it reliably and comfortably Id have to change my grip style which at this point is muscle memory. It makes me think too much about how Im holding the gun which is just stupid. With my CZ its just gripandgo. I tried adjusting my grip for the P but half the time Id just grab the gun like I would everything else and have to adjust my grip after bringing the gun up or after firing and realising whats going on.,canadaguns,d27mu0j,2,t5_2tzuf

They may not have processed it or entered it in the system yet. Thank them politely for their time.From this point on call once a week. Follow up on your application ask if there is anything you can do or anything that was missed. Thank them for their time. If there is anything wrong with your application they will not call you they will send a letter which can add weeks to months to the process for something you can answer over the phone.For a short term ATT once you have made your purchase call them a couple of hours after the gunshop has initiated the transfer and ask that your STATT be emailed to you.

For those that dont know the Czechs first made the Vz. with all Beech wood furniture before then quickly decided after a few years that hand fitting all the metal hardware for the stock was too much work not durable enough and too expensive communist times to manufacture. Recent developments in communist plastics led to the glory of Beaver Barf which is plasticwood shaving mixture the prime plastic development of the communist times. These arent exactly rare but they have gone up in price quite significantly over the past few years. Rumour is that Wolverine has some sets in bound if CZ can round some up in the factory dust piles.

That rules out many pistol calibers and virtually all rifle calibers. .xmm will deeply crater these targets at  yards .xmm will deeply crater or penetrate at sub  yards.  mag pistol rounds will leave deep impact craters at  yards and may cause dangerous ricochets. As someone who makes his living selling steel targets I do not advise using mild steel for targets. I dont even make them for rimfire.

It is best to lock up ammunition to avoid having to fight a court case.  Blacks Law Dictionary however defines ready as Fitted arranged or placed for immediate use causing no delay for lack of being prepared or furnished. The Oxford Concise Dictionary defines ready as easily available or obtained within reach.OP lives at home with antigunners so Im guessing his gun stuff wont be allowed to span multiple rooms.

8395436,0,t3_4ukj1d,Took my courses in January near the end send in my RPAL and PAL application and my buddy phoned in for my reference and it took exactly  days like they said it would minimum waiting period I guess. Got my license then but got laid off for  months so that all went on the back burner.  Applied for a range membership in late June and that took  weeks to complete and pick up my range membership and range pass. My buddy had bought a CZ SP Shadow for me before Xmas and was holding it for me until I got my stuff together. So at the beginning of July I had everything and my buddy initiated the transfer into my name that took  days but they warned me it could take  days. Then it took another  weeks for my new license with the ATT terms baked into it to come. Im finally legal to go to the range now. If I had managed to get everything done ideally I think it would be around the  day range if everything went as planned. ,canadaguns,d5qz5tq,1,t5_2tzuf

9308602,0,t1_d8vtqvy,I think there is a ongoing tension between the principles of muzzle discipline and the realities of handling a firearm. While we are taught to quite literally always assume a gun is loaded people dont really think of what that actually entails.Hell on the sidebar of this subreddit.gtAlways assume all guns are loaded.gtNever let the muzzle aim at anything you are not willing to destroy.Yet how are we supposed to observe the bore if the gun is assumed to be loaded? Its kind of silly because if the gun is  unloaded its unloaded. A cartridge isnt going to teleport itself into the chamber and pull the trigger. Unless you have a severe mental disorder then any responsible gun owner can easily discern if a weapon is loaded or not. After that doesnt really matter what happens as long as eyes are kept on that gun at all times. Any firearm is as dangerous as a big metal bat.Ive gone hunting with some friends of mine that served in the forces not deployed to Afghanistan or anything but still. When walking to our camp muzzle sweep after muzzle sweep and Im here thinking my friends are a bunch of psycho idiots. Of course eventually I came to realize that the guns had never been loaded and had been proven safe after we left the car. Or another example by the course training every time a gun leaves someones hands or enters someone elses hands it has to undergo ACTS and PROVE. That means if youre plinking with your friends and its someone else turn the gun has to be proven twice before actually being able to load again. Regardless of if the muzzle is pointed downrange. I guess what Im trying to say is that while its a strong general principle theres far more nuance to handling a gun than can be summed up in four sentences. ,canadaguns,d8vxlhx,3,t5_2tzuf

Additionally  if you are worried about you record of employment having a terminated with cause even if you may have had cause an employment lawyer can work to have that amended and termination without cause on a record is generally not a red flag.

9888046,0,t3_5h0ghf,Their decision is based on existing rules or interpretations so there is nothing to suggest a secret plan. The basis for the   rounder ban is the RCMPs belief that mags designed for the  rifle are inherently designed for the Charger pistol. They see the situation to be the same as the MP  rifle which shares magazines with the P pistol. The difference between these two situations being that  round  magazines were designed before the charger pistol while the MP  rifle magazines were in fact designed to be dual use with the P pistol from the beginning. So it all boils down to the interpretation of ...originally designed or manufactured.... I and most others here believe that the RCMP made the wrong decision here as the  round  magazines were originally designed for the  rifle alone. The Charger pistol was a later design that adapted the magazine. Its an important distinction the RCMP seems to have missed or ignored.The source for the exemption to magazine capacity for rimfire rifles comes from Now as for the Beowulf magazines those are quite clearly allowed by RCMP Bulletin .gt . Magazines designed for one firearm but used in a different firearmgtThe maximum permitted capacity of a magazine is determined by the kind of firearm it is designed or manufactured for use in and not the kind of firearm it might actually be used in. As a consequence the maximum permitted capacity remains the same regardless of which firearm it might be used in. So any secret RCMP plan is already foiled by their own previous ruling. So I dont believe this is their intention.,canadaguns,dawfodf,3,t5_2tzuf

Things like IDs passport documentation etc. I keep all that stuff together so it was easy not having to waste time looking for it. Then I packed a bag with all the clothes and hygiene items that I could. Then after that I moved onto person items firearms included based on monetary or sedimental worth. So expensive items got packed first all the while keeping an eye on how much time I had left gave myself half an hour. For ammo I just grabbed a medium garbage bag and threw it all in and threw that into the truck. Thats what I did. But Ill be the first to admit that it isent a good plan. But after that incident it became obvious that you should atleast have an idea of how to get packed up and out the door quickly if you need to. But since this is more geared towards firearms my advice is to have locks and bags for all your guns individually. Locks at the very least.

10694189,0,t3_5sx81u,I had the standard M from TradeEx and the metal on the slide was soft.  The slide wore out after only a few hundred rounds. TradeEx is a great company to deal with and they took care of me.  Still it was an issue with the Zastava that I didnt wish to repeat so I sold the new replacement before I ever shot it.  The notch on the M slide where the slide release slips in and catches the slide is machined right through the whole side whereas on a Russian model TT there is still a bit of metal spanning that gap behind making the TT stronger IMO.  Ive also shot over  rounds out of my TT without any problems.  My main spring recently broke on it and I ordered a new old one on ebay for cheap. If I had to make a recommendation it would be to buy a post war Russian TT over a M.  The post war ones are typically in new or close to new condition.  The thing the M has over the TT is an adjustable front sight and one extra round in the mag.  Other than that I think the TT is a better pistol.  The triggers were both a lot better out of the box on my TTs over the M as well. Perhaps the M Military Grade Ms are made more like the Russian ones?  I dont know.

In addition as of September   if you are a licensed client possessing a valid ATT to transport a firearm to and from a shooting club or range for the purposes of target practice you have as a condition on your licence the six transportation conditions.Whereby this is a situation where you might have the ATT as a condition but not the new license card. Thats my mistake here and Ill admit that.gt A lot of what you posted seems to contradict the RCMP website which does say these conditions will be placed automatically when you buy your first restricted or renew your RPAL.Im not disagreeing that either of these activities getting you the ATT conditions. Simply holding an RPAL though is not grounds to say you have the ATT conditions or will be granted them though. Nor is it enough to assume that someone who holds such a license holds an ATT.

In your experience could a firearm been made somewhat irrevocably safe by removing the firing pin or substituting a dummy bolt in the place of the real one so that the firearm can be made operable at a later time?Deactivation of firearms must be permanent removing a firing pin or replace the bolt do not qualify as deactivation. Deactivated firearms must also be inspected and approved by a gunsmith that is an RCMPcertified verifier.gtAre all firearms used in the film industry deactivated? Sometimes firearms in movies show the operation of the slide or bolt or trigger or safety. Are these functions rendered useless upon deactivation or can they still be operated somehow?No firearms used in the film industry are not all deactivated. Some are real some are deactivated and some are replica firearms Im not involved in the industry however so maybe someone can shed some better light on the topic.gtIs there a market for deactivated firearms or something the like?Yes there is a small market for deactivated firearms. They can be bought and sold freely without a license.gtIs there anything else youre compelled to share for which I havent asked about that you think would be relevant to my research? Maybe a variance in some of the stuff Ive asked about or some kind of if this then that mitigating circumstances that align with my goals.The most important answer to this question is call the CFO.,canadaguns,deakx7c,7,t5_2tzuf

Introduce yourself say why youre there keep it simple. Often land owners will be happy to let you pick off their rabbits and gophers. You can also offer them cash in return for exclusivity.

11639295,0,t1_dgck8qz,Just because you arent shooting long distance doesnt mean you dont need a quality scope. Check out the lr Marksman Challenges on youtube you need good quality glass to hit matchsticks at  yards. ,canadaguns,dgfbso3,1,t5_2tzuf
11646061,0,t1_dgffg7d,Right but what Im asking is whats the point in having a bunch of tactical gear like ballistic helmets? I go hikinghunting often and the idea of carrying half the gear you carry just makes me dread all that extra weight. If Im hiking in a sketchy area Im reaching for my bear spray before my shotgun any day of the week.Even for competitive shooting practice again I just dont see the need for half of that gear. Ballistic helmets  plate carriers etc... I dont think civilians should be prohibited from owning any kind of armour but it definitely sketches me out when people buy gear that has no other purpose apart from being used in shootouts.,canadaguns,dgg3fah,0,t5_2tzuf

11723749,0,t3_67ai1t,Chokes have two things to look for when buying the threading type or how they fit to the barrel and the pattern type how much they restrict shot.Common examples of the former are accuchoke winchoke and remchoke. There are many others.Common examples of the latter are full cylinder improved modified. There are others.When buying a choke be sure to get one with the right threading type for your barrel and pattern type for intended use. Some thread systems are interchangable and compatible with other makes and models. A simple google should be able to fill you in on what you can use here.So youll find things like accuchoke full and remchoke full. Theyll perform similarly with regards to pattern but fit different barrel types.Accuset is Mossbergs brand but read the manual for your barrelshotgun to be sure what type of threads it uses.For the partridge ammo question check your local hunting regulations and provisions. They may restrict the type of ammo lead vs steel for example for one. Shotsize of  is about right maybe even . You could possibly get away with . Theyre small birds and youre not looking to save money on a meat grinder... you shouldnt need more than an oz amount of shot. Even a full oz is pushing it beyond what you really need .oz can be sufficient. Afactor here is distance and how it patterns with your chosen choke type.For choke type it depends on how far out you plan to shoot them. Get a choke youre confident with the patterning at a given distance and shoot them when theyre in that range. i.e wait for them to reach that far out if theyre too close and know when not to shoot when theyre too far.Some people will use full chokes but will be needing to shoot them pretty damn quickly as they move out of relative range.EDIT All the above is written with the assumption of ga. Sizes and distances will vary with different gauges.,canadaguns,dgox13t,11,t5_2tzuf
