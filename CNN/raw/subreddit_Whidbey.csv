1319924,0,t3_296z9m,The island is about  miles around by water. Following the beach adds a bit to that. My son and his friends walked the complete beach route every summer for a few years  Ill get details from them. There are areas you cant walk  NAS Whidbey is a bit of a problem IIRC and there are some areas you cant pass except on a very low tide.,Whidbey,cii3wuy,2,t5_2tr41
1611261,0,t1_cjhm9x3,Goss Lake is just a lake. Lots of houses in the area. Its just one of the many beautiful areas around the South end. Clinton as a whole isnt necessarily bad I just always found the downtown area to be a bit sketchy. Just avoid any homes close to the main area of any of the towns except Langley. Its really quiet there usually. Lots of tourists in the summer though.,Whidbey,cji9lxu,2,t5_2tr41
