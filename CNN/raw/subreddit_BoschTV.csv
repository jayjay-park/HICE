People talking about it at work group tweeting etc. Probably decreases the audience it might attract.Otherwise  I didnt know Bosch from Inspector Gadget but read a good review and figured Id check it out. Got hooked instantly. Loved it. I personally liked the no name actors and found the romantic plot line realistic and compelling. You knew that girl was trouble just didnt know how bad or what type.I think the show would be a real number hit if it had a better distribution platform. If this was on Netflix it would be the talk of the town.,BoschTV,cp3nvow,1,t5_30fcd

The only real continuity issues are where he is in his career and how he got to those points but Connelly usually does a pretty good job of filling that in so that you could pick up his latest book and still get right into it and feel like you know Bosch. Season  definitely had a fair number of deviations from the books which was refreshing to see. They still remained faithful to the essence of the stories but they were able to mould the details to fit the two cases together into one story. I thought they did a teriffic job of keeping the essence of Bosch and the story lines without being a slave to the details which would have been about  years outdated at this point. ,BoschTV,d06hfx2,3,t5_30fcd
