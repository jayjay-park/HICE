6237883,0,t1_cyydm04,Someone mentioning rolling when landing on your feet made me get it I think.In parkour the point of rolling is to try and convert some of the downward energy forwards so you dont have to absorb all of it.I think the reason a skateboard jump hurts less at speed is the same. If you are moving forwards the impact with the ground is a glancing blow. Your momentum is actually diagonal rather than straight down. This means you absorb some of the downwards force and some of it is deflected into forward momentum.Im not sure I explained it well but I think this is the explanation.,holdmyredbull,cyyohgf,1,t5_30dl9

Were constantly told to stay on alert for suspicious behaviour and a dude running from the tube wearing spandex would be considered slightly off if not suspicious. We dont make eye contact here we dont smile at strangers were generally miserable most of the time unless were drinking and eating fish amp chips whilst watching football. Also folks here dont run from the tube unless theyre trying to catch their connecting train. Or these folks waiting are tourists and are just confused like all tourists are.
