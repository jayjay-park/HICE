6515876,0,t3_44ny0h,First of all I think congrats to Sam for doing so well in such an aggro meta.  Did any of his matches get camera time?  I suppose not ah well.   I think the subtle changes are brilliant.  Pyroclasm main is a great choice although helps little against the LSV eldrazi deck.  Hes running a th hand disruption in Duress.  Finally I really do not see the point in the th mill rock.  Getting the  mana to activate the extra ability is unlikely with  lands and  moxes.  And if we accept that is true then I just dont see the point in exiling our own cards when such a large part of our game is shredder  ruins to recur cards.  Id rather a rd pyroclasm.  All in all in the meta my hat is off to Sam.  He must have played the deck masterfully  EDIT Im sure its been discussed but has relic been tried over Grafdiggers cage?,LanternMTG,cztajbu,1,t5_3b8d7
6987538,0,t1_d1822jv,I enjoyed playing Blue Moon before Lantern Control came out. You may also look into Death and Taxes. Its not as good in Modern as Legacy but I believe its much cheaper than Blue Moon. The WhiteBlack version is the best I have seen so far.,LanternMTG,d18dmry,1,t5_3b8d7

10181589,0,t1_dbxr8fe,Yeah Ive played on cockatrice and it can be a little harder since theres no rules enforcement. It helps if you skype the person youre playing. ,LanternMTG,dby518h,1,t5_3b8d7
10232897,0,t3_5mf14g,I dont think the way that this deck is designed makes it very open to replacements. In fact Im shocked that we got  playables in the last few sets.This is honestly such an odd deck that I would be surprised if that is the norm for at least the next few sets.Inventors fair and the fast land were such huge improvements to all shells and Im in the ProCrane side of things. Huge improvements in a pretty short amount of time tbh. ,LanternMTG,dc3yfsk,2,t5_3b8d7
10399842,0,t3_5othcq,This is the one card that I wanted to get at prerelease more than any other and I whiffed. I definitely think it has a place in the  not sure about the main though.,LanternMTG,dcmw05g,1,t5_3b8d7
10666269,0,t3_5slwhx,Both of these people are giving excellent advice. You just need to play the deck and log the practice time.,LanternMTG,ddg57ta,2,t5_3b8d7
11325604,0,t1_dffozlf,To be fair storm does actually have a pretty good matchup. One of the few decks that can say they sport at least  against us.,LanternMTG,dffqle6,2,t5_3b8d7
