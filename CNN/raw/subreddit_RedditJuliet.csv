2640168,0,t3_2q22fr,Thought Id get in on this sharing of our Clashy baby pictures.    Found one at level four before I even had walls. LOLAlso discovered one from a dayandahalf later right after I joined Juliet!  My poor clanmates suffered through my level two archers for several days.  ,RedditJuliet,cn37a58,1,t5_30wu1
2715142,0,t3_2r50qd,Well generally when I upgrade my th I upgrade my lab and spell factory. Then I get all of the new buildings up to speed. Then I would do my army camps and get atleast  dragon barracks since dragons are game changers.  After that I generally do splash damage and air defense. About then is where i would farm for my barb king. Then the rest of the buildings should be upgraded as needed for the type of base you are using such as you archer towers cannons  teslas. Walls should be done with excess gold between upggrades. And research as needed or whenever your builders wont be open for a few days.  Also forgot to mention hwo important the dark elixer drill is make sure you build and upgrade that right away.,RedditJuliet,cncp8su,3,t5_30wu1

2856181,0,t3_2snmmp,Hey Iamien I believe the reason you were rejected was because people had requested to join before you. No elders were on to accept but when one did hop on we accepted the person who had requested before you. Thats how we determine who we accept if multiple requests pop up at once our apologies for any confusion and frustration this may have caused. Please be sure to hop on after we do our kicks tomorrow!Cheers Tovi.,RedditJuliet,cnsqxuy,1,t5_30wu1
