342367,0,t1_cfg5up7,Thought Id mention that if your wife is regularly taking SSRIs then expect that her psychedelic experience is likely to be extremely dampened.  I would recommend probably doubling the dosage of whatever you intend to give her.  Bearing that in mind my personal recommendation would be  micrograms of LSD if youre going for a more pronounced psychedelic anyway. Should be relatively mild and in my opinion LSD at that dosage has a fairly small chance of causing problems. EDIT MDMA is probably the other best option.  I hesitated to say it initially because the serotonin deprivation post trip might not be the most comfortable thing for your wife.  Note also that use of monoamine oxidase inhibitors MAOIs used for an ayahuasca trip could be fatal.,RationalPsychonaut,cfg981w,2,t5_2yce6

533367,0,t3_2084jc,Ill crosspost my comment here I argue they are real.Hold on now I know what youre thinking.  But we need to define real here first.  Just because its happening in your head doesnt mean it isnt real after all youre happening in your head too.There was a fascinating article about this I read not long ago that discussed this very topic in relationship to voices people hear in their heads unrelated to drugs that really got me thinking about how I interpret such things.  Its talking about hallucinated voices but it applies here as wellgt The second step is to understand that hallucinated voices are as real as just about anything. They arent what they purport to be  sounds coming from the external world  but that doesnt mean they dont exist. gt Lets count the many ways that hallucinated voices are realgt  They are real neurological patterns that exist in real human brains.gt  They are subjectively real. The listener actually hears them.gt  They satisfy the criterion for reality put forward by David Deutsch in his book The Fabric of Reality they kick back. You can read the whole argument heregt  They have metaphorical reality. We can reason about the voices the same way we talk about a movie with our friends discussing the characters motivations their moral worth etc..gt  They have real intelligence  because this is crucial theyre the products of a bona fide intelligent process. Theyre emanating from the same gray matter that we use to perceive the world make plans string words together into sentences etc. The voices talk say intelligent things make observations that the hearer might not have noticed and have personalities stubborn encouraging nasty etc.. They are above all the kinds of things toward which we can take the intentional stance  treating them like agents with motivations beliefs and goals. They are things to be reasoned with placated ignored or subverted but not things whose existence is to be denied.So are DMT entities real?

944887,0,t3_24xkq4,What strikes me about psychedelics is that the introduction of a chemical substance into our body can dramatically alter our subjective conscious experience. This basically says to me that our perception of the world is quite malleable which makes you wonder about all the different degrees of consciousness that exist in the world. The idea begins to lend itself quite nicely to scientific methodology. This is just something I have thought up on the spot but its a potential question that is probably of interest to rational psychonauts. As followsIf our subjective perceptions of the real world can be so profoundly altered by a chemical substance you could say that our bodies are mechanistically causing the response via pharmacological action due to the stressor the substance. Its interesting to wonder why we can so easily adapt to arguably such radically altered states of consciousness without it being to much of a concern for ourselves both physiologically and psychologically. Its also interesting that the psychoactive substances themselves boast incredible and unique characteristics  it makes me think about what roles theyve played in nature and human evolution over time.It makes me think that if a system is complex enough it must simply acquire consciousness via some means  consequently this leads one to consider what defines complex and you soon begin to think that everything is simply a matter of degrees and every physical phenomena must inherently contain some level of consciousness that corresponds accordingly with its material aspects.Of course their conscious perception if you can even call it that by then exists in itself but of course its far from how we perceive the world around us!About the community here though. I guess psychonautical endeavors can be thought about in two ways but really it should be a matter of balancing both methods. Creatively you can construct a world of imaginative ideas whether it be storytelling performance music art. Logically you can relate these ideas back to material phenomena in a meaningful approach that could give rise to new methods of research in any discipline really. It seems most people are preferential for one or the other and it does seem to get on some peoples nerves but ultimately theyre both trying communicate the same fundamental ideas as each other. So while theres no absolute need to split each other up  it is useful to have a separate subreddit so that we can focus on exploring one way instead of the other and you can always go back there if you choose to!,RationalPsychonaut,chbouw9,30,t5_2yce6

I had been reading QED by richard feynman and idk brushing up on like algebra  concepts so I had been in a studious state of mind leading up to this. This was about a year and a half ago.

It was that and how by zooming in or zooming out  becomes   becomes   becomes   becomes  etc etc depending on how you define a unit.

1417855,0,t1_citr3ri,It could be. Its more probably accurate to say that a feeling of certainty is not evidence nor is it necessarily the case that an aha! moment can only be caused by a correct inference. Incorrect inferences also trigger aha moments and feeling of certainty.This isnt nearly restricted to psychedelics this talk had very little to do with them in particular. This is something that permeates daytoday conscious existence. While it is often true that certainty or confidence is veridical truthtelling about the outer world there is no unbreakable rule that says confidence and certainty are reserved singularly for veridical interpretations of the world. In fact it can be amply and easily demonstrated that feelings of confidence and certainty are often dramatically wrong. One thing that he casually mentions fairly early on is that people are differentially affected by this. Some people accept their own feelings of certainty as the penultimate form of evidence and hence their feelings of certainty form the basis for their epistemology  their claims to knowledge. It brings to mind people who reject scientific evidence and medical advice when making decisions about their or their childrens health. It also brings to mind an awful lot of psychonauts.,RationalPsychonaut,ciu08zi,2,t5_2yce6
1452365,0,t3_2arans,gt    Can you take so much LSDShrooms in  dose that you trip for longer then say  hours? I know with some drugs it can go longer but Ive taken silly amounts of LSD and Shrooms all at once before and the trip length is only mildly increased. I always assumed it was because the chemicals metabolize or whatever in the brainbody over a certain period of time and then thats it unless you redose. Same reason that some pills need to be extended release capsules so your body doesnt just take it all at once and waste it. Whats correct?Yes but theres an extremely high tolerancecross tolerance so the longer you wait after your first dose the exponential tolerance impact accelerates. I think generally you have about  minutes for full enhancement.gt    Can taking too much LSDShrooms at once mess your mind up forever? Again people have said this to me as stories from friends of a friend but from my personal experience with psychs I usually think those people had prior mental issues changed there personality after the experience by choice or took it way too often for way too long and just lost grip with reality. But is the drug to blame here? Whats correct?Yes but this is dependend on your definition of messed up and whether the person had a dormant psychosis waiting to be triggered by extreme stress and how much they took. For a mentally sane person to have permanent effects whom did not already have a dormant psychosis theyd have to be taking several hundred times a typical dose.gt    Can you even take too much LSDShrooms at once? Obviously there would be LD levels but Im not talking about anything near that what I mean is is there much of a difference between say  hits of LSD and  hits g of Shrooms and g? I havent taken  hits or gs but Ive taken  hits at once and gs at once and crazy as it was it didnt feel so different from doses slightly lesser to it. Is there a limit to how crazy things can get? I know my headache doesnt go away morefaster if I take mg of Ibuprofen or mg is it a similar concept. Whats correct?Too much is a relative term. You likely wont die from LSD directly there are almost noif any records on LSD deaths.

Because of the intensely subjective nature of trips its hard to describe your brain putting two and two together but I think every tripper knows what it feels like for two separate clumps of neurons to form a strong connection together cementing this pattern with that one in such a way that oh my god I really get it! its a beautiful thing and it sounds like the OP got a lot from that.

I went so far as to send out texts telling people to prepare for nuclear winter and to move as far inland as possible. Chicago specifically so that those of us smart enough to make it could take up shelter in Fermilab and math ourselves out of the hypothetical mess wed be in.This was spurred by the parallel between apocalypses and tripping made by Terence McKenna and my believing my wonderful though perfectly fallible girlfriend when she told me that Vonfong was going to make landfall in Japan in two hours it was ish a.m. on Sunday and I took things a little too far.Thankfully though we all still have time to reverse the damage weve done to the planet before things are too far gone and that trip specifically has made me take that idea to heart.

2151658,0,t1_cld8alg,First of all thanks for your reply this is awesome. Thanks for the article link I found it really intriguing. It seems to be saying that certain regions of our brains in a sense keep our sense of self togethercreate our sense of self and when these regions are manipulated our brains have more freedom or are a bit loose in interpreting information and thus causes a loss of sense of self.And I found something you said in the comment section intriguing.gt To be metaphorical it is as if consciousness is a sea of threads and in some places these threads bunch up into great knots which act as discrete entities moving about this sea. Psychedelics loosen up these knots and the discrete entities of experience can feel themselves going back to being the experience of the sea as a whole.Also your point about two people viewing a chair is great. It reminds me of Husserls phenomenology or phenomenology in general and the part about our bodies being both and object as well as a subject reminds me of MerleauPonty if I can remember correctlyfrom your examples you seem to have some experience with philosophy?. Great stuff and your point about the differences between objective and subjective are great too e.g. we have a shared understanding that there is an objective universe that we all are perceiving also the point about not being able to perceive atoms.This reminds me of kind why I had this inquiry in the first place. I feel that there are what is commonly called spiritual or psychonatuicesque thoughtsideas e.g. ego is an illusion and we are the universe experiencing itself that I really bought into without being too skeptical or uncovering more beneath them. I havent given a materialist or naturalist critique of these ideas as much diligence as I should which is why I like rrationalpsychonaut because it often does just that.

We look around and see protrusions and objects we find that when we feel a desire for an object these protrusions go forth and hold the object we then feel the desire for the object to be pulled closer and the protrusions pull the held object closer. Wherever we go these protrusions come with us and soon we say that they are my arms we connect the feeling of desire with the action and we say I wanted this therefore I grabbed it. It feels as though we are in control but who is this we that is in control?

The self is real like a computer program is real.gt Its just that I wouldnt be able to find the computer program by breaking open my computer case and physically searching for it. Same goes for the self.I was going to disagree with you but then I saw the above comment in response to someone else. I think the only disagreement I have is semantic.To me I would define awareness itself as a self. No its not a static thing you can point to. Robert Anton Wilson quoted someone possibly Bucky Fuller? as saying I seem to be a verb. This makes more sense to me than the ghost in the machine metaphor uLilyo mentioned. But whether noun verb or something that we just dont have the language to describe that awareness that self is the one thing I am  sure exists.I am that awareness. I would consider that awareness to be my self. There is all sorts of cruft that builds up on top of the awareness including imprints indoctrination teachings etc. that make up our personality and ego. But that awareness is real and it is as far as I can verify tied to a particular physical body. So it is something distinct and to say that it doesnt exist strikes me as nonsensical.But I think the crux of any disagreement I may have with you is that we are using self in two different ways. I use it mean the awareness. I suspect that you use it to refer to everything that is constructed on top of it. But even then I think its a mistake to think that the ego is not real. It is a construct so its not something that needs to be fundamental to me but it does affect me and my actions. In fact I think I could make the argument that having an ego is actually useful and even essential. The problem arises when we forget that the ego is a tool that we have built for ourselves and start treating it as all of what we are.,RationalPsychonaut,cv4rrag,3,t5_2yce6

I think youre talking about western philosophy here surely not representitive the worlds philosophic inquiry.

There may be an ideological inclination to be materialist among many scientists in our day and age but that doesnt make that view correct.

5476021,0,t1_cwbfnrl,gtBecause there is no evidence whatsoever to suggest that anything else is happening and that my mind is making it is a perfectly adequate and rational explanation.Id say we are in the early days of psychedelic research. With enough experience many individuals do find evidence and data in their own experience that much else is happening. I wonder sometimes how many times people in this group have smoked DMT... and to what depth. I remember talking to a chemist who worked for a pharmaceutical company and him telling me his mind was making all of this. So I said come over to my place and smoke mg DMT properly and then after that you can tell me that your mind is making all of this Red veins were popping out of his head at that point! and he didnt persue the conversation. I dont think it is an adequate explanation that the mind is making this because what people are often experiencing is very alien phenomena. People experience these entities and beings which are very startling and meaningful and it is very common that people experience them.Is it possible that the mind like narcissus finds ITSELF meaningful? And then we must ask what is the mind? It could also be what you think is your mind is also part of something greater. So what is deemed to be the individuals own mind could also be a facet of what could be called the prime creator or god.

5486090,0,t1_cwcteem,That is a cool article.  I havent read it though I am not entirely unfamiliar with Narby.  Obviously there are people Francis Crick comes to mind who credit psychedelic experiences for important scientific revelations.  However this in no way suggests that there are nonhuman intelligences involved as the revelations are still predicated on a human mind having them.  We have a simple analogy serotonin or dopamine or acetylcholine or ATP etc are all partially responsible for scientific discoveries.  These are all endogenous chemicals.  Psychedelics arent even the only outside chemicals that have helped advance human knowledge greatly caffeine comes to mind it synergizes with our brain to make us more alert awake and increase our memory recall.  Psychedelics tend to synergize with our brain to open us up to new experiences and give us better  or at least different  pattern recognition capabilities.  Again this in no way proves that nonhuman intelligences are involved.    The first proof could have come come as strong evidence that chemicals like DMT and psilocybin have no evolutionary purpose.  Unfortunately we only have either a dearth of evidence or evidence that they do indeed serve an ordinary evolutionary purpose.   Ideally you could design a reproducible falsifiable and controlled experiment showing the entities in DMT hyperspace exist.  That is the accepted standard for proof in the modern world and its pretty reasonable.  While I do doubt that this would end up giving us the proof we seek it would be absolutely worldchanging if it did.  I would even support doing such studies in the future  I hope that organizations like MAPS which are generally focussed on what I perceive to be more pressing and realistic concerns will eventually be able to do these studies when there is increased public interest funding and legal access to drugs.  ,RationalPsychonaut,cwcwdav,2,t5_2yce6

5827194,0,t3_3v0376,Around ten years ago I took a very strong acid trip and wore redblue D glasses for most of it.  For the next week I could see rings and notes of red amp blue defining the forms of objectspeoplethings around me.  Since then Ive been able to consciously lock my vision back into that way of seeing but for that first week it was constant.  About a year after that I got really into magic mushrooms.  I mean really really into them.  They grew abundantly in the city I was living in actually like a weed so I would get up between .am and am almost everyday and go out mushrooms hunting.  My hunts took me all across the city on foot and I generally wouldnt get back home till after midday but I always had a couple of hundred fungi to bring home.  My normal habit was to eat a few while I hunted one for me one for the bag and then take a prepared lemontek or sometimes just citric soda soak dose of around  or so when I was home.  Anyway eventually I wound up taking over an ounce dry of magic mushrooms by accident and had a trip that shifted the nature of my perception in a fairly permanent way.  I can see the ripples of particulate matter caused by wind flow and light breaks down into sharded tunnels that appear in my vision just as solidly as a wall or a tree.  I see patterns in chaos like the ruts in laid concrete or the bark of a tree these patterns emerge in my vision with clarity sometimes supersceding the object that the patterns emerge from.  I dont view any of this as problematic since it doesnt effect my daily life and hasnt prevented me from doing the things I want to do Im also an artist so in my view its useful that said fluorescent lights can have a horrible effect on my psyche and do sometimes cause the recurrent visual hallucinations to become distracting to the point of disfunctionality  doctors offices are the worst!,RationalPsychonaut,cxjgyd6,7,t5_2yce6

7297464,0,t1_d27mx2t,gtWhat does this have to do with the fact that everything in Google DeepMind seems to be made out of dogs or looks incredibly distorted or even trippy?Oh well the neural network is trained on animals so it sees them everywhere even in static noise. Humans obviously have a greater repertoire of images to overlay. But the principle is the same. The neural network will use previous reference images in trying to figure out what something is... I believe the same thing happens when we perceive our visual reality.gt Where is your presented evidence that our brain picks up random noise during such experiences and then that random noise is then somehow mistakenly correlated as patterns but is actually just...random noise? Why is this noise random?Not random in the philosophical sense but like TV static where it is nonsensical data. There are people today with a condition called Temporal Lobe Epilepsy and this condition causes these people to have seizures mass misfirings in the brain during these seizures the individuals report powerful spiritual experiences where they are visited by god or talk to angels alien beings etc. So at the neurochemical level there is mass disruption of normal synchronized firing... but during a seizure all these errant signals get picked up and processed into the conscious mind anyway producing heavenly visions. People in highly stressful situations release all sorts of stress hormones which interfere with their ability to perceive with clarity. This can result in hallucinations. gtIll cite meditation as an example can you explain how you can discredit experiences that are provided simply by sitting down and breathing? Sitting down and breathing is a very good thing to do and can reinforce the pathways associated with relaxation and selfdiscipline. However why should we give the experiences we have during meditation any second though? The mind is very powerful and is capable of imaging all manner of things. If youve ever been in a sensory deprivation tank similar things happen. The mind working on almost no data attempts to interpret what little data it has using the whole brain. I wont talk bad about meditation I think it does have positive health benefits both physical and mental. gtI dont see how any of this proves there is a soulI never set out to claim that. I dont believe in souls I think the soul is just another word for ones ego. Its a myth that fools people into believe the ego lasts forever. gtHowever this doesnt prove your point that spiritualism is pointless or that there is no meaning to it. I never made that point in fact I made the opposite point I think its a good thing for the human psyche to believe such things. Myths and fables while being nonfactual are helpful to give humans meaning and purpose in their lives. It staves off the fear of death and lets them be relatively happy in their lives. Spiritual beliefs have evolved or stuck around for a reason... they reduce human anxiety when faced with the awareness of our own demise.gtHowever this shouldnt discredit the effects of psychedelics or meditation and their critical effect on thinkingintrospection as a whole and providing glimpses into the mysteries of consciousness.Oh well I would never want to do that. I think psychedelics are incredible tools for exploring the inner space of the mind. Most of the conclusions Ive espoused here I realized while on a psychedelic trip examining how exactly my own hallucinations come into being.

8504452,0,t1_d64ctyv,My though is that the God mushrooms were created by the same evolutionary mechanics as the rest of life. Psylocibin was just one genotype that happened to give the spark to human intelligence. The mushroom continued to reproduce and mutate into many new fungi. The universe was not created for humans and will not cater to our needs. It was pure luck. What really intrigues me about mushrooms and fungi is the fact that they thrive on death it is as if they absorb the life from earth. The fungi we trip on are effectively sharing the knowledge they have sucked from the earth.,RationalPsychonaut,d64lzwy,3,t5_2yce6

8685136,0,t1_d6r6pry,Thats an interesting point even though I wasnt necessarily suggesting the form of communication was a formalized language. I was trying to say that an intelligent lifeform would probably develop some method of communication even if it wasnt standardized.But regardless I dont know if your points necessarily refute my position either. Im not sure I see how they would apply. Assuming said lifeform has sufficient intelligencesentience for abstract thinking and selfawareness there would have to be the necessary physical apparatuses to facilitate such advanced cognition. This would assume a large amount of evolutionary developments to have already occurred. I would think that would include control of the sense organ used for communication. A mockingbird doesnt seem to have human level sentience yet it has amazing control of its vocal chords. Such an ability would precede the ability to develop language. So that point seems moot.Also formal language doesnt seem to be necessary for immediate survival. Collaboration for survival also precedes the development of language. A wolf pack does not need language to be effective. Thus language is not an essential survival tool and would probably only be developed for use in higher cognitive processes. That would make its usefulness for survival an unlikely factor in the development of words or the nonverbal equivalent of such.And finally I dont think the ability to develop language can be equated to the level of abstract understanding. Like you said language and abstract conceptualization can promote higher understanding but I dont see how this applies to the development of a language in the first place. Both are just tools that operate within sentience. And I would think that language would be a natural forward step in the development of a species. After a species develops enough to organize a social structure and have want to communicate ideas beyond whats necessary for survival the development of a language or some sort of communicative tool seems like a logical next step. This can then be further developed into a formalstandardized system in time but this also isnt relevant to the desire or tendency toward language in the first place.,RationalPsychonaut,d6r9nyc,2,t5_2yce6

I dont believe the harm associated with psychedelic drug use is dependent on prohibition at all although prohibition is slowing our collective rate of learning about psychedelics and how best to use them psychedelics will still have the same harm potential and will still require care even if we eventually live in some neorationalistic enlightened utopia.,RationalPsychonaut,d8v0r91,2,t5_2yce6

10849188,0,t1_ddy8wf2,Nice levelheaded reply to a provocatively inquiring OP.  And I cant help realizing a note of intrigue in your mention that Psychedelia is frowned on in academic philosophy because ...It almost sounded as if youve  encountered that yourself first hand maybe even in  academic philosophy.  You mighta been to college had some coursework Im thinking  from which you speak.On curiosity of bated breath Id give a penny to know anything you might tell maybe anecdotal  about what you if I gather right  mighta experienced at whatever campus  for academic frowning on psychedelic philosophizing as posed or attempted.  My own coursework as a student was way more up into science not a lotta philosophy two classes total. And from that standpoint it seems besides psychedelias tent show fauxlosophizing discourse  it poses a theorizing preoccupation too.  As a matter of alt form neotradition  its all staged as if something scientific yet to anyone minimally educated in science  curiously devoid of content credibility coherence or consistency.  Almost like some  thing  trying to outdo sciencey creationism badly or whatever other ambitious pseudoscience you got. A lot of it turns out to be a bunch of rodeo dough pure shuck and jive  scripted like no really its true the scientists themselves say so  I wouldnt lie to you why would I?  Seems quite a tangled web woven from false facts misleading information  talking points as a basis for conjure theorizing.  Not having as indepth a background in philosophy as science  your wellbalanced reply and clarion perspective  brought to mind an essay on a selective reading of Hume by psychedelic philosophers  enlisting his illustrious name in the alt discourse and cause for which it stands.  The essay frames it as the unreasonable legacy of a reasonable man  a Scottish philosopher by the name of David Hume.In case you havent seen it and like to ,RationalPsychonaut,ddz0mmh,1,t5_2yce6

11633989,0,t3_65ylmk,Man good read and very thought provoking.I think youre correct when you say all human interaction is really disguised manipulation even when it feels like love. This is exactly how weve evolved to be. You must keep in mind our egos are they way they are because it gave us an edge for survival over countless generations. Its only natural it will lead us to treat every interaction with the external world in terms of whats in it for us. Love as we commonly know it is but a gimmick of evolution to get us to mate and stick around each other long enough to ensure healthy development of the offspring.I also believe you are spot on when you describe the universe as violent absent and lonely. That is if you look at it from the ego point of view. After all what does the universe have to offer us other than the means to survive rinse and repeat?Of course from an individual viewpoint this notion can be catastrophic. All our lives we build a bond and affection to our worldviews as handed down to us by our parents teachers peers the media etc. We become emotionally invested in this worldview. You mention you used to value the importance of having good human relationships until you realized the egoic force that drives them. This made you angry and frightened. This is a normal egoic reaction. In a sense youre going through a period of grief. From Wikipedia Grief is a multifaceted response to loss particularly to the loss of someone or something that has died to which a bond or affection was formed. Youre grieving the loss of certain parts of your worldview.But when ego is removed you realize atomism isnt horrific but beautiful. There is much meaning to be found in seeing we are but a certain manifestation under certain conditions of the same mechanism that governs all activity in the universe. Something that completely transcends our individuality. However taking this viewpoint renders ego obsolete. Or so he thinks actually you will still need him for surviving daily life and not becoming a hobo so youll want to keep him around. You strike a deal with ego. You let him stay if he agrees to give up the drivers seat. When ego is no longer in control you can discover the true meaning of love which has nothing to do with egos version of it. You see life as what it is a game. And you play along but deep down you know its just a game and that lifts a whole bunch of weight off of you in your daily life. And you come to realize you have the ability through your willpower to actually do whatever you want by just playing the game. Its a fucking superpower I tell you. I mention this part because you seem to be on the verge of realizing your true superpowers. Im not referring to anything supernatural here Im simply talking about what we can achieve with our normal physical human abilities when we lift the limitations of our own psyches.So maybe you should take a break yes. But by all means keep on your quest.,RationalPsychonaut,dgeq4ae,3,t5_2yce6

Im saying that the so called person is a figment of the imagination and has no substance or separate reality apart from the experience itself. Separate self is an illusion and realizing that for yourself is exactly what transcendent who experience is. If you cant reexamine what you thought the nature of things and self were you probably wont get there.
