3989517,0,t1_crapuid,Thanks a lot for responding. Both of your messages give me tremendous motivation!  Going to a web site is a drag. Thats why you need to adjust a few browser settings so you dont have to.  Lets say youre using Chrome then in the Settings set   On Startup open a specific page set Zeerka   Appearance Show home button New Tab page set Zeerka Always show the bookmarks bar.  Then just drag  Add to Zeerka button to your bookmarks bar.    Now youre all set.    Any time you start Chrome open a new Tab or click Home button  your Zeerka page would appear just dont log out from Zeerka.  Every time you are on a site that you want to add to Zeerka  click on the  Add to Zeerka button.      About using browser addon. Its not completely off the table. In fact that was my initial idea but for now its not in a plan  too much work of developing an addon for each browser and keeping up with vendors updates that break it. ,SideProject,crb1fpm,1,t5_2w2vn

Also if you plandesigndevelop a system correctly from the beginning then it should be fairly easy for you to sub out one part of it or multiple parts of it for a different technology. Example being that when you start development you could use a SQL lite system then move over to Redis and then switch over to PostGres or MySQL etc for storage.,SideProject,d2ko55m,2,t5_2w2vn

7979831,0,t3_4oilhz,I feel this is the good idea with the wrong implementation. As someone stated below this is likes for actions. It wont be enough on its own.At my old job we sent one question surveys to each customer and they responded to whether they were happy or not with the service they received from the customer service agent. If you had a negative response rate above the medium you would lose part of a bonus. We strived to get those positive responses in order to get that sweet bonus. How does this relate to your software? There has to be an actual benefit for them. You can team up with stores coupon manufacturers credit cards or pretty much any other business that will benefit from the exposure and can grant a prize to those employees doing the heavy lifting good feedback   in credit idk.

8889484,0,t1_d7gcyw0,I dont really like the idea of handing off email delivery to a rd party service if by that you mean its a cutpaste operation.  If youre going to do it via integration with their API then its not a bad idea.  But I think you might still need an inhouse delivery and basic metrics solution. At that point youre reaching feature parity with curated but theres still no special sauce that makes me want to switch especially at similar price points. Having run a relatively niche newsletter for about  months East Asia Pacific Weekly heres my wish list much better clipping experience on mobile. Bookmarklets dont work and theres no native app experience for curated.  integration with bookmarking services like pinboard.in.  Auto add to my next issue when I tag something in pinboard. I could probably set up something using zapier but havent tried yet.  killer feature help me surface content my audience would like using machine learning.  Right now I basically have to read through daily emails from about  sources to curate the right kind of content. If I could instead point those same sources at your app and it recommends the top X articles over the last week it would save me a bunch of time. Bonus if it can extract the TLDR and recommend the short blurb to include in the email.

11500063,0,t1_dfzih83,Thanks for the feedback. Agree ideas are dime a dozen. So far we have a little over  drivers signed up and businesses signed up for our service so its not much but still enough to keep us motivated. If you are aware of anyone or any business that has tried his before would be happy to see their lessons learned.,SideProject,dfzj5s5,4,t5_2w2vn
