5463436,0,t3_3puy9y,I havent upgraded my brakes so take this with a grain of salt. I have done the research on the various brake upgrades and my personal thoughts areNo point in upgrading the stock front brakes first. As the car is now it will lock up the fronts far before the rears so excess front braking power will do nothing. Base level brake upgrade that people do gut the stock proportioning valve. This removes some of the massive frontbrake bias that the car came from the factory with allowing the rear brakes to do more of the work. Many people report massive improvements in overall braking but you have to be careful braking hard on a steep downward incline as there will be an increased risk of locking the rears very bad. Next level upgrade upgrade front and rear brakes. At this point the gt caliper upgrade you mentioned would be worth looking into. The best option that I have come across for the rear is to use the front rotors. They are larger and vented. To do this you need a latemodel SW turbo rear caliper which fits onto the existing caliper bracket and a mm spacer to push the rotor out. This is probably what I will eventually do. Good luck and please report back if you do try out any brake upgrades. ,mr2,cwa07cq,1,t5_2sd41

7077085,0,t1_d1ge3j4,As I am absolutely clueless I took it into a manual transmission shop as recommended by my family friend who is a mechanic.

I was thinking of switching out the cables but was having an insanely hard time finding out where to get replacements.Previously the bushing that was replaced wasnt specified as to where it was or what they did so it was hard for me or the owner of the shop to figure out what the repair was for.  Both of these times it has been taken into the same shop but this time it was the owner who took a look so at least I know I can talk to him about it next time.

7308683,0,t3_4fhyni,Your CV boot ripped. Not a huge deal just really messy. Your driver side axle has a joint that will deflect to allow suspension travel. That particular joint is highly greased and is sealed inside a rubber boot. After years of rotation and deflection the boot rips! You have two options. Both of which will involve taking out the whole driver side axle and getting an alignment after. The basic instruction is to unbolt the axle nut and everything else thats attached to hubif its blocking the axle from sliding out unbolt it. The goal is to allow enough room to pull the whole axle out from the hub side. The axle itself should just pop out from the chassis side with a little help from a crowbar or axle puller be gentle theres a C clip at the end.   . Remove axle replace boot onlyyoull need the boot and the tool to secure the clip that secures the boot to the axle put axle with new boot back in done.  . Remove axle put a new axle with a new boot on it done.Option  is cheaper but more time consumingharder Option  is a lot faster and easier. I did option  and it costed me  total for my SWyour parts availability and cost may vary. It took about an afternoon and it was my first time.

7930396,0,t3_4nw7ru,A lot of people seem to be looking for these so have a copypasta of some general information.In relation to the california emissions situation my understanding is that Toyota made the Spyder california emissions compliant for the whole world. This is why the zz engine has worse problems in the Spyder than in its other implementations  there are additional precats in the exhaust manifold see below.The Mk has basically  big problems Up until the  Facelift the ZZge engine has a couple of major flaws. They had crap piston ring design which meant they lost a bit of oil. That oil contaminated the pre cats which are catalytic converters mounted in the exhaust manifold itself. The contamination with oil broke down the ceramic catalytic matrix allowing fine ceramic particulate back into the piston bore and oil.... which made it grinding paste. That of course further destroyed the bore causing catastrophic oil consumption. Almost none of the cars exhibiting this problem make it past k miles. THen engine toasts itself. BIg ends often go because an owner ignores the problem and runs the engine out of oil. Honestly Id just avoid prefaceliftpre  cars. After  they revised the piston ring design and stopped the onset of the problem. Check local to where you are when the models got updated engines. Or just buy a broken one and put the ZZge engine in like I did.  The rear cross member which runs across the underside of the engine bay and locates the rear gearbox mounts and suspension pick up points rusts through under where the exhaust loops under it and at the front edge of the beam. Closely inspect this beam by removing the undertrays and getting well into the engine bay with a torch as well as underneath the car. THe cross member can be replaced but its getting hard to find as its discontinued by toyota. The Steering universal joint at the front of the car rusts to the point of failure. If the sttering is stiff notchy or inconsistent then inspect this part you just have to remove the frunk plastic shrowd surrounding the spare wheel tub to see it then this could be failing. Its a bad enough problem that if it fails completely which is entirely possible it could cause you to lose all steering without warning and die. So at least inspect it on any potential purcahse. THe part can be bought for  I guess and its only an hour to replace but its jsut such a horribly fatal potential failure I feel duty bound to mention it.Oh the handbrakes are garbage but thats to be expected MRs have always had awful handbrakes.Otherwise these are robust little cars with no major horrors to worry about. All panels bolt on and off and are easily replaced. If the engine is a good one it will run and run. O sensors have to be Denso or they throw EML lights but dont really affect the running of the car much.Re pricing depends entirely on where you are in the world. In the UK you can get a good car for  and a really nice one for . In the US I believe theyre much more expensive and harder to find.Servicing wise theyre no different to a Toyota corolla because thats exactly what the running gear is from. However some parts are expensive or harder to find so repairing accident damage for example is more troublesome. There also isnt a huge aftermarket for parts so there is a limited market for tuner parts. Anything specific you want to ask just shoot.,mr2,d47g98l,2,t5_2sd41

11715644,0,t3_66dv7n,Mid engine cars have most of the mass in the middle. For that reason when they spin they tend to go fast. Also MRs have a slight rear weight bias so without weight shift they tend to under steer.All that being said I autocross a Mk and have seen others autocross Mks amp Mks. All of the Mks I have seen run seemed to be very poised and were putting good lap times. The only MR I have seen spinning a lot was a Mk turbo and I think that was mostly due to a inexperienced driver being too aggressive.It is a good possibility that the spin you experienced was due to a bad rear alignment the MRs are very sensitive to rear toe adjustment. I would have a good  wheel alignment done by a reputable alignment shop. ,mr2,dgnzwzt,1,t5_2sd41
