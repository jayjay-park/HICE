21201,0,t3_1ud5aj,Thats it Im on the fire Woodson wagon.  All game all I keep saying is Why is JR still out there? after ever JR shot.  He went  FG  from  and yet played  minutes.   Which is pretty consistent with his horrible season anyway so its not like a surprise bad performance.And so how is he rewarded?  By playing the final two minutes.  And then takes that retarded shot.  And what does Woodson do after that?  LEAVES HIM ON THE COURT STILL!  God damnit Woodson if all youre gonna do is collect fucking checks do it from home please.  Fucking embarrassing. EDIT  AND TO FUCKING BOOT ITS THE SECOND TIME THIS SEASON A KNICKS PLAYER DID THAT SO EITHER WOODSON DIDNT SCREAM AT THE TEAM LAST TIME WHEN BARGNANI DID IT OR HE DID AND HIS PLAYERS DONT RESPECT HIM ENOUGH TO GIVE A FUCK.

352929,0,t3_1y42f4,Dolan doesnt own the Knicks. Cablevision does and has since the mid s. Dolan was put given his role at the top of MSG by his father who is the founder of Cablevision and is a billionaire. Dolan had alcohol problems in the early s and it seems putting him in charge of MSG was a way of keeping him out of trouble much like how George H. W. Bush helped his drug abusing son buy part ownership of the Rangers.Larry Dolan James father is  so who knows what will happen when he dies. It depends where the power goes. Perhaps Cablevision will cease to be so forgiving of James Dolans failures once Larry is not around.Alternatively companies come and go. Cablevision and HBO are the Dolans two most valuable assets. What happens when the cable model ceases to be viable and we buy content a la carte over the web? Will Cablevision adapt or will it milk every dollar from its temporary monopoly? Most companies in Cablevisions position  companies that have grown fat by preserving a monopoly  lack the agility to restructure when their monopoly finally breaks. If Cablevision starts losing money their first move will be to trim the fat and focus on their core business which isnt running the Knicks.,NYKnicks,cfhcjvp,8,t5_2rur5

382535,0,t1_cfkeqr5,Yeah he has had a disappointing season I agree. He had that preseason injury and never really got back to  it seems.Well yeah our big problem has been PGs having career nights and I think its relying on a  and  year player to guard opposing PGs. Having Toure Murry is nice but being so young he has almost the same problem as the older guys. He plays pretty nice D but is not quite able to run the offense effectively.I think our lack of depth at the Center position is making Felton look bad too.

The Knicks are buying them out to get them off the roster  to distance themselves from reality.Will they fill the empty roster spots? Most likely but only with Dleaguers...

460757,0,t3_1zcut2,Im a little confused by this play and the explanation provided. It seemed that the Knicks wanted to push the play to the left side of the court based on how everyone were all facing in that direction and that Tim Hardaway Jr. really came up high to push him even further to the left but exposing a very open driving lane.Im not so sure what the idea was for Tyson Chandler to stick to his man but he might have been given instructions to ensure that everything stays left who knows. Im not sure I agree about the comment about Felton hindsight is . The fact is that Felton committed to a man with the ball which could have given Hardaway a valuable second to get to switch and get to a better position defensively with his new marker he couldntdidnt. Felton got tied up but did a decent job pulling his new marker away so there was a lower chance for an offensive rebound.Even though the commentator asked for Anthony to come across for a charge look at the start of the play. Hes positioned so that not one but two magic players will not get the ball. He could commit but that allows an easy  point bucket as well.Im pretty much on the same bandwagon to say that the Knicks really need to think hard about getting their game together and not come across as a soft team but the explanation provided in the video didnt do it for me.,NYKnicks,cfsmzd8,2,t5_2rur5

He has always worked hard to come back better than before and Im happy to see him finally healthy and playing at a very good level. I wish Stat nothing but the best here in NY or anywhere else for that matter.With all that being said I do have one beef with the article. I dont buy his story about telling Dolan he wants to come to NY over Miami or Chicago or whatever. I have no problem with Stat getting his max contract whats done is done but he knows damn well we were at least rd on his list of destinations. By all accounts he wanted to resign in Phoenix but the Suns said hell no to the amount of years. Miami was his second destination since he is a Florida guy plus they were not waiting on Lebron like he said. The Heat wanted Bosh not him and thats why Ladies and Gentleman the knicks once again bid against themselves and give a max contract to a guy that NOBODY in the league was offering that kind of money to. ,NYKnicks,cg89si7,3,t5_2rur5

880181,0,t1_ch0iar0,Chalmers is solid and an obvious upgrade from Felton but his main job is to be a facilitator for that starting  offense in that he is not expected to take a many shots only when necessary or open basically the definition of a point guard. I dont really consider Chalmers an smart upgrade or one that will be beneficial. Plus  rings and possibly a rd and more Im not even sure he wouldnt be willing to re sign for less.I know Phil wants to run a triangle offense but basing the offense on how it was ran this year minus the terrible shot selections and percentages. The team relies heavily on Melo ISOs WHEN Felton couldnt drive because when Felton would drive he would put his head down and hope for the best and attempt to kick it out. And as we know this method was ineffective so we saw an absurd amount of here Melo. Chalmers is  capable of a similar role and probably much better than Felton at it. I just am not willing to throw desperation money to Chalmers and put him in a role as focal point to our starting offense.Collision has proven to handle the offensive load during CPs injuries as well as running the second unit. Hes done this consistently and fairly efficiently FG and PT Collision is a quality point guard and deserves a shot at a starting role much like bledsoe did. For the right price I would be willing to take a shot at Collision assuming we have enough space to offer an amount that makes leaving a contender to a heaping mess worth it.ALL THAT SAID. The  point guard free agent list is much more enticing Walker Irving Rondo Rubio Lin Nash Reggie Jackson More than likely most will resign with their current teams but the possibility and cap space  for the Knicks allows for us to go after AllStar caliber point guards instead of throwing  mill at a current backup point guard or one whos never been the focus of defense due to LBJ Wade and Bosh being in the starting ,NYKnicks,ch4bw01,1,t5_2rur5

Youre right that the counterfactual reasoning is flawed.  I underrepresented Gallo but healthy Gallo overrepresents the true value.  He had a notable injury history that had to be taken into account.  But if you cant judge Gallos time sign being traded you cant judge Mozgovs either.  When we shipped him off he was barely NBAlevel.  He was young and big but young big guys like him fall out of the league constantly.  Really the only players with onthecourt value we sent out were Felton and Gallo and rights to Chandler.  Where do you get the mil cap space loss?  The numbers I ran show mil.You put in some effort to show the things I left out that we gave up in the Melo trade but ignore the other things we got back Shelden Williams Anthony Carter and Corey Brewer.  Williams and Carter were expirings a little over mil total.  Plus they gave us some minutes Carter notably in the playoffs.  We waived Brewer immediately so Ill ignore him.  Hes just a cap hit.Do I think we got the best deal we could to land Melo? No and I disliked the trade for that reason.  But its not just a bs platitude that you need a superstar to contend in this league.  We werent going to go anywhere with Gallo as our second best player.  We needed to get a player like Melo and build around him and STAT.  The Melo trade was a rare opportunity to accomplish that.I think the part where we fundamentally disagree is whether a core of STAT Melo and mil player X which is really more like mil as it turned out to be with Tyson can be a title contender.  I thought they could be and more to the point I think they were!Thats not to say we were ever going to be favorites.  Not with Lebron still in the league and to a lesser extent KD and there was no way they were foreseeable targets.  But could we become say the second best team in the East?  Yes in fact we were.  That would put us in the position to meet the Heat in the playoffs get lucky vs them in series and the team should be in the finals.  Unfortunately our playoff run didnt turn out that way but to say we werent contenders is disingenuous.Finally I have some thoughts about thisgt The way the CBA is structured you cant get better if you have draft pick debt no cap space and no noteworthy young players.This is really just unbased theory but Im not convinced.  It is obviously very difficult to be the Real Madrid of the NBA and the new CBA made it even harder.  In a free market its pretty clearly better to build through free agency even overpaying for talent given that you have the money than through draft and development.  Draft pick x is always a bigger unknown than veteran y.  As is young developing project z.  Its frustrating but teams like Madrid and the Yankees can buy championships while the poor teams have to luck out and get Lebron our Duncan when that alltimegreat comes out every  years or so.If the NBA were more free the Knicks would have been at the top of the rich rankings before Prok.  If it is possible to use your money to your advantage we can do so.  So the question is whether its possible.  Im not sure and if so its obviously very difficult.  However the Nets essentially do so last year.  It didnt work out but they did put together the type of squad Im talking about.,NYKnicks,ci9eckt,1,t5_2rur5

I dont think hell be the next Pippen but a solid two way player is extremely valuable. Im hoping Phil and the triangle bring out the best in him offensively. If the PhilFisher combo proves effective we have a lot of guys shump THJ Larkin Early who could develop into a solid supporting cast for melo. I would say we are a year or two of development and the addition of a star big man Marc Gasol when he hits the market? or PG from being genuine contenders if still not nearly favorites. A lot of it will also depend on getting some cheap productive veterans.

1440842,0,t3_2alfeu,Cynics point of viewCarmelo Anthony Late prime star who is criticized for dominating the ball. Old school fans would call him a top  player in the league. Knick fans and a small minority of others might even call him top . People into advanced stats think hes more like th. Big concern is his age  NBA players tend to begin to decline around  which is Melos current age  and the Knicks just signed him for  years at an enormous price.Shumpert Early Larkin Hardaway Jr These are the only young guys the Knicks have. None really have star potential but Hardaway looks like hell be a rotation player maybe even a good starter. Larkin and Early are more or less unknowns. They could both be out of the league in a couple years or could become good players. Shumpert is very good on defense but incompetent on offense which probably wont change now that hes played three seasons. Theres a good chance hell be traded some time this season as his contract runs out next summer.Stoudemire The Knicks went all out in  to get Lebron James creating cap space for the first time in over a decade. James instead went to Miami along with several other targets and the Knicks ended up with Stoudemire at a maximum contract. He is a very nice guy and was once a top  player in the game. He also though had numerous serious injuriessurgeries in his midearly s which made him a huge risk for injury. THe Knicks couldnt even get his contract insured because the insurer didnt think hed be able to play another  years. They were predictably correct. Stoudemires body started falling apart in his second season in NY.Bargnani Bargnani is the prototypical Knick of the last  years. He was known for scoring a lot of points and playing on a lot of bad teams. Advanced stats people called him an awful player due to his complete indifference to defense and rebounding. THe knicks didnt care. He was a st overall pick. He made a lot of money. Hed been a  point a game scorer. For Knick front offices that made him a star. Unfortunately he became as ex Knick head coach Mike Woodson would say A big part of why we sucked last year.JR Smith Good three point shooter who might have been an all star if not for being insane. Takes a lot of stupid shots every game and no coach has ever been able to motivate him to play smart for more than a months span. Very much controlled by his emotions.Calderon Great passer and shooter. Terrible defender. Getting old. Just recently acquired.Dalembert Aging center who may end up the starter next year. Used to be a good defender and rebounder. Not sure whats left in the tank.Cole Aldrich Big white guy who languished on OKCs bench for several years before ending up on the Knicks where he also didnt get a chance  despite advanced stats guys yelling that he might be good. Had a nice streak at the end of the season last year.Other names that will be referencedJeremy Lin Came out of nowhere to save NYs  season. Ended up going to HOuston over the summer and some speculate it was because Carmelo Anthony and JR Smith didnt like sharing hte spotlight.Mike DAntoni Ex Knick coach who had a ton of success in Phoenix but ended up losing a feud with Carmelo Anthony and resigning which for the KNicks is code for being firedMike Woodson Another ex knick coach who had a ton of success early on basically because he wasnt Mike DAntoni and Carmelo was very motivated to prove that letting DAntoni go was the right move and so played his ass off. Was remarkably stupid when it came to basketball but was pretty good at getting the players to like him.Ray Felton Fat ass point guard who the Knicks brought in to replace Jeremy Lin. Played well his first year miraculously well actually and then fell right back to earth last year before being traded to Dallas.Tyson Chandler Great defensive center who the Knicks wore down similar to stoudemire with too many minutes and as a result became less effective over the last couple years. Still a very valuable piece the clear second best player on the Knicks until he was traded to Dallas in the trade that got rid of Felton and brought back Calderon and Larkin.James Dolan The single most hated owner in the sports possibly. Constantly interferes and has refused to ever rebuild the team resulting in their constant mediocrity. Attracted to shiny things like Phil Jackson or Carmelo Anthony as they seem to cause hte fans to momentarily forget about his incompetence.The Melo Trade Controversial trade orchestrated by James Dolan in early  which sent a first round pick the swap rights to a second first round pick Danilo Gallinari and Wilson Chandler among other assets to the Nuggets for Carmelo Anthony and Chauncey Billups. It led to the resignation of Knick GM Donnie Walsh who had done the dirty work of cleaning up the awful mess the team had been in.Stephon Marbury Eddy Curry Steve Francis Antonio McDyess Jerome James Zach Randolph Stars the Knicks traded for as part of their quest to never rebuild.

2158285,0,t1_cld77eo,Lin wasnt traded. He was on a shortterm contract when we first picked him up before Linsanity. That contract expired in the summer  but because of the way contracts work New York had the right to offer him a new contract before any other team in the league. Jeremy wanted to sign the contract immediately but Dolan told him to go out into the market and see what other teams would offer. The Houston Rockets offered a  million contract over three years weighted so the final year of the deal would pay Jeremy . million. This kind of backheavy salary is known as a poison pill meant to discourage the Knicks from matching the offer as it would put them over the salary cap and cost them an additional m in luxury tax for exceeding the cap.  All in all this was a phenominally infuriating decision for a variety of reasons. The Knicks make so much money its practically pornographic.  Dolan has a history of overpaying for terrible no good wasteful selfish players. The Knicks finally had a player willing to sign early to stay with the team instead of trying to wring more money from the team. Dolan told him to go find another contract and rumour has it that he said that he would match any offer of up to  billion dollars for Lin. Houston offered significantly less than one billion dollars for Lin and we refused to match. Raymond Felton was signed as a replacement.As far as other aspects of his ownership  Amares contract was pretty bad but thats a hindsight being  thing. At the time he was one of the leagues most electrifying exciting players. In his first year the Garden would stand up and chant MVP when Amare was really on fire.

2440368,0,t1_cmcf909,. record and winning culture play a huge role. the rockier the situation the less appealing it is for free agents. to convince players in their prime that are focused on the championship that a horrible bottom of the seeding team is capable of making a championship run is much harder to do when you havent shown evidence that you can win. thats a huge part of the reason why the knicks have put a priority on making the playoffs.. youre acting like dwight was in a good situation. the free agents were looking at are largely in good competitive situations everyone from gasol down to jackson. . you also cant expect free agents to gamble on their prime. anyone thats going to put us in place for a championship is basically saying they trust NY with their prime years to put us in a competitive place. if a team goes into a season saying their goal is to make the playoffs and misses it two years in a row in a weak conference that does not put that front office in a good light at all. Moreover teams may draft their core players but the vast majority of the roster including other top tier players are usually gotten through trade or free agency. we have our core star in carmelo and its our job to build around him. if the team is prioritizing winning during melos prime years then there is no time to draft a player and wait  or  years for them to develop into a top tier player. ,NYKnicks,cmdc29o,1,t5_2rur5

2456619,0,t1_cmf9ho6,No hes not. Hes a small complimentary piece. What will turn our fortunes around is actually having our entire roster on the court.  Calderon and Melo have hardly played together at all.  Put all of our pieces together and maybe just maybe have all of the good things weve done click into some semblance of consistency and maybe we have a shot. We wont be turning heads this season but Id say its not lost yet,NYKnicks,cmfc8wn,4,t5_2rur5
2481233,0,t1_cmginnu,they are different players. Calderon is a perimeter player excellent passer and shooter. Lin is an excellent attacking point guard.Lin and Melo are not great fits with each other since Melo likes to dominate the ball and Lin needs the ball in his hands to be effective. Calderon is a much better fit.I think the real fascination thing with Lin though is the political side of things. CAA which represents Melo Bargnani Smith Woodson and numerous other players from the Knicks past has had a ton of power over the Knicks day to day. They tried to pressure Lin into switching over to CAA and when Lin shunned them that seemed to be the real turning point The Knicks had already made a handshake deal with Felton and signed Kidd before Lin got the offer sheet that Melo called ridiculous. Lin was already gone IMO at that point.And I think youre naive if you dont think there was a very real power struggle in the Knicks locker room after Linsanity. You had DAntoni pushing to keep the ball in Lins hands and push Melo to the perimeter. Melo hadnt developed a good three point shot yet and struggled really badly. SToudemire talked all the time in that period about how we need to keep the ball from stopping whenever he was asked about the Knicks struggles basically parotting DAntonis post game interviews. Rumors swirled that DAntoni asked the Knicks to trade Melo before resigning. Lin surely aligned himself with DAntoni whose system was a perfect fit for his play style.The only way the Knicks resign Lin is if DAntoni wins that power struggle in which case Melo is probably traded JR Smith doesnt resign and the Knicks never trade for Bargnani thus keeping their  st round pick along with a couple second rounders nor do they sign Felton or Kidd.Its an interesting alternate scenario although Im not sure if the outcome is any different in the short term. Lin is surely better than Bargnani but a lot of the KNicks success was predicated on a highly motivated Melo and JR Smith both likely motivated by a determination to prove that they were on the right side of the conflict with DAntoniLinStoudemire.And yes Im reading between the lines here. But its fun and it definitely could be true.,NYKnicks,cmifowh,3,t5_2rur5

2517451,0,t1_cmn5j4i,Very true thats why this can be an issue but Lance is a much better player although he is having an off year so far. I like Lances game style much more than JRs. Lance tries to get to the paint and get contact whereas I think JR is kind of a pussy. JR always looks for midrange pull ups instead of getting to the paint for easier shots. I wonder if coming to NY would give Lance extra motivation because he is playing for his hometown.

Hes a small town kid and playing in Cleveland is less distracting then NY its no revelation our boos and booze are team chemistry land mines. Ultimately winning is the real factor thats led to his improvement.  JR is not any better or worse hes just in a situation where great play matters with capable teammates. When we traded Steve Novak for Bargnani we saw how selflessness turns into hopeless step back treys when the only open guy is Bargs at the  point line. Contrast that to Cleveland where he has a starting spot he arguably shouldve gotten after  is playing his natural position as SG instead of SF doesnt have to bail an offense out and its obvious he was capable the whole time. ,NYKnicks,co4mhb3,3,t5_2rur5

3292008,0,t3_2xtapg,Definitely possible given his history with Phil and Id welcome it. Im also happy to wait a while since the current coaching staff hasnt had much to work with yet. Obviously everyone understands that Fisher isnt to blame for the current situation but that should also be extended to Kurt Rambis who more or less has the same appeal as Shaw in that hes another of Jacksons former assistants. I dont think Phil is going to be firing anyone on the staff so soon and although in theory you could add Shaw to the mix having three guys on the bench who have been and could still be head coaches is potentially too much of a clash of egos.,NYKnicks,cp3ikiq,2,t5_2rur5

You could do so much worse than them I dont know why they would be a bad pick in your eyes.A guy like Porzingis who needs a lot of developmentthat would be sour. Not that he wont be a good player just that hed be much more likely to be regrettable pick than CauleyStein or Winslow. And then of course Mudiay seems like a great prospect Hezonja probably wouldnt work with Melo but would be fun and Okafor or Russell falling would be great.

5128062,0,t1_cv35cha,Honestly no way he becomes  over Patrick Ewing. The dude played  years for the Knicks and it was the most successful era weve had as a franchise outside of the s. Melo could be top  with a ring and make number  with two rings as the leader. If Porzingis becomes what he is touted to become he could very well take over Patrick in time by playing his entire career in New York and being successful. Melo probably wont ever be the best player in New York unless some miracle shit happens in the next  years.,NYKnicks,cv44gp9,0,t5_2rur5
5156497,0,t1_cv7ijg5,My point though is that he could play just as badly as Dalembert last year a lot of rookies do. Hes not going to be waived though because hes not  years old. The real issue to me is that the Knicks are playing in this weird middle ground where they want to win so Melo is happy and to impress free agents but they have this kid they want to develop at the same time and those two goals are going to oppose each other all season and Im pretty worried that fantasies about wooing a free agent are going to supersede Porzingiss development. ,NYKnicks,cv7jtk9,2,t5_2rur5

If Porzingis wants to be as good a scorer as he can why wouldnt he seek one of the top  scorers of the past decade?Besides its already happening. Porzingis and Melo played oneonone every day for a week or two. Melo was giving him solo advice and training on how to be an efficient scorer and hell continue to do that.

Tyson Chandler had very similar per stats his rookie year I do realize Tyson was  years younger. If WCS becomes a player similar to Tyson how good would a frontcourt of a young Tyson and Kristaps hopefully a bonafide allstar by then be in  seasons wow.    Winslow has the tools to be a solid starter in this league it may be a stretch to call him a future allstar but a solid starter nonetheless. McLemore could be a nice guy off our bench to give us some scoring. Again the cap room that would be created along with a young core of KP WCS Mclemore Galloway Grant would be dominant.

Someone is gonna pay him.AS to rubio that already go paid? why would you want rubio over a guy that had to prove himself better than he currently is? his level is not far behind a rubio but he is not getting  mil even with the new cap as he plays right now. and if he is we can get rid of him and look somewhere else instead of being locked with rubios retarded contract. winwin??!?!?!?yes  and his contract is running for  fucking years he isnt getting better actually he is declining his rookie years was objectively better than his last season. Thats not fucking good. id say thats done you are looking at the next bargnani type that scores  points a game and cash in  fucking mil a year on  shooting. Thats why i wouldnt touch that guy with a ten foot pole. I loved rubio when he came to this league but he lost everything that made him special and his shot still sucks.

Fisher is not going anywhere some people in this sub have some serious lack of understanding the game and sports in general.Like when you guys were goong nuts about Vujacic or Calderon playing over Grant and how can Amundson get playtime while Grant got DNPs. Teams dont work like that. You cant bench a player whos busting his ass just so you can develop a talent this is gonna guarantee friction in the team. A player gets the time he deserves if you mess with this rule things get shitty realy fast. You cant just say hey Calderon you are playing better than Grant but he is young so get fucked. Every player in the team is equal thats what makes a team what it is.But some of you gave real shit to Fisher for not playing black Jesus Jerian Grant who has been realy shitty in this system he doesnt have a clue about what he should be doing.As for Fisher I dont see what makes him so bad.. Like from the games I have watched and the team lost this season I was way more dissapointed at Melo that Fisher. Like yeah the team scored  point in a quarter but Melo scored  and he is the one getting payed  mil not Fisher. Give coach time give the team time. We are not a team that should be going way better than it is just because we got four good roleplayers in free agency. Our only penetration is DWill and I swear the only guard who understands what he is supposed to do is Sasha playing uptempo running the court and not abusing the ball just giving it to others.I think that Fisher should get time a year or more.

6274541,0,t1_cz2toe0,I agree that the short term deals have limited upside but I think that those contracts were the best Phil could do considering our terrible record last year and bleak outlook for this year during the offseason. I think that  mil for Lance is certainly realistic but it is alittle high. I would rather let another team have him at that price which is a bummer because I think he is a great role player. I think that if we give Lance a PO in the th year we should be able to get him at what Crowder got. Phil didnt sign Galloway to his current contract since we signed Galloway while Steve Mills or Dolan was still making the decisions. We signed Gallo to that contract because it was the most years we could give him at the minimum salary exception. I agree that buying proven talent costs more and I think that we should be very careful about overpaying someone this offseason. I like Batum because he fits very well on this team. He is a great playmaker for a sfsf and he might be good enough that we could start a better defensive PG. If we strike out on Batum Im not sure that I like Conleys fit because his level of play is beginning to decline and his contract would extend all the way to his age  season. I would be very interested in signing younger players whom we could develop. Tyler Johnson is a RFA and he could be poached. Bazemore and Fournei are both young enough to improve as well. ,NYKnicks,cz2ueve,1,t5_2rur5

6448303,0,t3_43xvnn,Im as bummed as everyone else is about how this team is playing but just for fun Ill try to talk us back off the ledge. Did we really even expect this to be a playoff team this season? We got a whiff and thats whats making us so disappointed by their play as of late but this is still a rebuilding year.. KPs stats and level of play were due for a correction others in this thread have pointed out that hes never played this much or this tough of a travel schedule etc. On top of that are we forgetting that hes a  yearold rookie? Hes learning more and more about playing in the NBA every single games. ESPECIALLY the bad games. The true test is if over the course of his career he learns from his mistakes and adjusts his play style while improving his fundamentals. It seems crazy that  weeks ago we were all praising Phil and now hes getting hate. This is a longterm process. Were seeing progress. Should this team really be better than it is? Our guard play is terrible and we just need more pieces. In the meantime let Melo and KP develop a rapport on the court let Fish get some experience and get better with his play calls and rotations and figure out what we have in our own FAs Gallo LT DWill Afflalo etc so when we do get those new pieces we know who to retain. Its unfortunate that we saw such flashes of greatness from Afflalo and DWill because it set our expectations too high for them. Afflalo  seems like hes always gonna be streaky like JR was. Well see if he fits in longterm with this team or not.,NYKnicks,czmam98,5,t5_2rur5
6448690,0,t1_czm7g6l,Taking away his starting job for poor performance would show KP and the rest of the team that nobodys job is safe.

Only guard to do well in the triangle is Afflalo because he ends up just crating his own shot.I personally think Grant would be amazing if he would just have a two man game with a big.

6746512,0,t3_482my9,First getting Durant to come to this team is a long shot. Maybe not impossible but unlikely.Second Im not sure how hed work with our roster. Wed have to push KP to C Melo to PF. Melo at PF seems like a good idea but KP at C seems problematic. Either way its going to create some issues. But on the other hand its KD and dat spacing.Third it wont fix our backcourt issues. It might worsen them. We spend all our space on Durant lose Afflalo. Galloway can start but our PG and bench will be black holes.If Phil somehow manages to woo Durant we cant say no. But we are going to have to make some adjustments. Meaning Phil and Mills are going to have to work the phones like MFers to make trades to balance out our roster.I think targeting Batum is a more realistic option that fits our roster better. Hes not Durant but hes a good triangle player unselfish can shoot rebound pass and plays defense. He fits right in as the third scorer with Melo and KP at . Also like AA he can play both SG and SF  giving us some lineup flexibility.Plus hopefully Batums paycheck will leave us some cap flexibility to sign another guard.,NYKnicks,d0h59kf,7,t5_2rur5

6835948,0,t1_d0r4s7a,gtWestbrook doesnt really work with Durant because both needwant the ball to play their style. Melo doesnt. Melo needs the ball in spots to make quick decisions passdrivekickcut. Melo is incredibly ball dominant. More so than KD. Maybe he would go back to being the more transition dominant Melo that was on Denver but I doubt it at his age. gtEasiest way to think about it is FIBA Melo. Thats the ultimate Melo he had elite talent around him. He needs that Star to dominate and get him the ball when he can be effective. Yes Melo is phenomonal with HOFers around him against sub par competition. Basically take the All Star team and have them face a D League team and Melo is amazing.gtWhen Melo gets the ball with a backpedaling reeling D he eats them up. That midrange isotriple threat game against a fluid D is his best. Westbrook breeds that. Durant doesnt quite play that way he likes the perimeter he likes to bring up the ball etc. They wont work together. Youre ignoring too many huge red flags and blaming their weaknesses on other people. KD brings the ball up because he needs the ball to create too. Just like Melo and Westbrook. Russell is a scoring PG not a distributing PG. Hes looking to get himself open more so than his teammates compared to a Nash or Paul type. Wesbrook is really a SG who brings the ball up.Melo is an older and less athletic version of KD. Westbrook would actually do worse with Melo than he has with KD.

Not an exaggeration by the way back when the Knicks were  under him that was actually improving his career winning percentage. Hes just one of those oldschool hardheaded idiots who doesnt know how to use his roster and doesnt know how to get the most out of people. Somehow he goes from a company guy through and through when hes an assistant at least publicly to an asshole of a headcoach who refuses to play any of the young guys even when theyre better than the washed up corpses in the shortterm and the longterm.

The Knicks will be competing with a lot of teams with a lot of cap space who have better rosters for a very very limited FAs.gtI hope they keep Kurt Rambis...I dont pay attention to the knee jerk fans and their emotionally driven nonsense. The coaching is not the problem right now and good franchises have a unified front office and coaching staff. You do realize that those teams also have really good coaches right? Rambis is simply a shitty coach and his tenure as head coach in Minnesota and his short interim as the Lakers coach shows that. The Knicks dont have a unification between the front office and coaching staff but rather Phil proxy coaching with this lackies who arent as good as a coach as he is trying to coach.

Thibs has run him down too much for the max.  I could be wrong but sounds like an expensive gamble unless we can make it  year deal which he probably wouldnt accept.Whiteside will go where the money is so probably back to the Heat or the Mavericks or some other team that has the money to spend.  Depends on how much winning means to him but the cash will come first.Dwight...nah.  When he puts the effort in he is quite effective but considering how much he doesnt seem to care at times a la James Harden style D Id pass if he asks for anything close to max.Maybe its too early to throw HG into the fire but perhaps hell be the starting center at some point anyway?

Additionally he looked healthy this past season but that freak accident with the ref sidelined him and our playoff hopes for a while.Second we didnt lose so much young talent in the Melo trade.

8086823,0,t3_4pz44a,Kevin. If you come to New York and play along side Melo and take this team deep into the playoffs you will become a god. This is the largest market in the country and they are starving for basketball success. No matter how successful you ever were in OKC if you are even remotely successful here it will be like nothing you can imagine. Right now your brand is hot and valuable but there is honestly so much room for growth. Lets be honest not that many people want to buy a jersey representing Oklahoma. Outside of the US hardly anyone even knows where OK is. But New York is different the national and international exposure will be like nothing you have ever seen. Your shoes will be on every playground in NYC. Here watch this video we had specially prepared for your. Puts in a video made by Spike Lee with a soundtrack of Public Enemy Nas and JayZ that shows the greatest highlights of the Knicks and the Garden crowd.This city knows basketball. To put it in perspective the crowd will not hesitate to boo for not boxing out. There is no other city with the basketball knowledge of this city. Maybe Philly and Chicago are a close second but that is it. They call this city the Mecca of basketball for a reason. Lets just both acknowledge something here. It will be an uphill battle but we are convinced with you DRose Melo and KP we will have a formidable core that can seriously win games. To put it in perspective. Three years ago we made a playoff run with Melo Tyson Chandler JR Smith and the corpse of Jason Kidd. The team we would put together with you this season would be significantly better than that team was and once you agree to come here can you imagine how many other players would be willing to come at the chance to play on a New York based dream team? You have given the Thunder a lot of years to put a team around you to win a ring and it hasnt happened. Now you have a man with  rings who is putting together something special. He knows how to win and he knows you can be part of something truly special. Both you and New York have waited a long time to win a ring not lets make it happen here. ,NYKnicks,d4p16lt,6,t5_2rur5

Something changed in him after the knee surgeries where he just stopped putting up good numbers. Maybe it was the teammates around him maybe it was his way from trying to regain his former playing style or whatever. All the numbers point to Rose not changing so I understand the argument from people who say that Rose is no longer good. They are hard to refute. All we can do as fans is hope that Rose being another year removed from a knee injury his improvement between the  halves of this past season and a fresh start on a new team during his contract year changes something in him where he facilities more and doesnt look for his shot. ,NYKnicks,d7l5qgy,1,t5_2rur5

There is an issue with the lack of knowledge of analytics with the people reporting on them which leads to misinterpretation. I try to be very careful when I explain an analysis to avoid misinterpretation of the data. For example when I run regression I have to be careful to not outright suggest a true causal relationship but also explain that the results are more than a correlation. Logistic regressions are easier to explain because you just mention log odds and people understand odds a little better. ,NYKnicks,d7o9fwy,1,t5_2rur5

There was rust and no specific preparation for the game according to Jeff. Didnt scout they just played basketball. I dont think there was much in the way of a set offensive scheme. They ran a couple plays but I cant imagine it was much of a set offense. they had good looks that didnt convert. Those will fall. No team shoots  from the field in a half consistently. KP asserted himself yesterday as a potential focal point. I think everyone saw that and it will show in the coming games. There is so much room for growth here and I think it will all happen over the next few weeks.

9425187,0,t3_59r7z6,You Rose people are seriously going to downvote an informative post about a player? Get off your fuckin horse. Allow someone to have an opposing opinion. Roses shooting form is bad and its unhealthy. It puts stress on his joint and knees when he lands. He really should think about changing it. A different sway in momentum in his lower body may actually help his jump shot. Compare his lower body motion to any decent shooter. None of them land like Rose doesPlus what Coach Nick mentions about the motion of his arm. It should stay straight when he shoots. One fluid and direct motion. The way he shoots in the clip is like hes flicking his wrist side ways when he shoots instead of letting the ball rolling off his finger. Its not good,NYKnicks,d9aph3k,30,t5_2rur5

9541586,0,t1_d9oibm0,Noah was not hurt nor was he in foul trouble and I was surprised he wasnt out there. I think Horn wanted KP out there to stretch the floor a bit. But KP is really bad at exploiting mismatches. He gets bullied out there by much smaller guys. When he is fronted he needs to push the guys out a bit toward free throw line and get a little separation so that they can lob it into him. He just isnt strong enough yet. There were a lot of possessions where he had mismatches but he didnt get the ball because there wasnt enough spacing for someone to lob it to him. Rose tried to lob it at one point but it just sailed over KP because there wasnt enough space.,NYKnicks,d9p75wf,2,t5_2rur5
9541815,0,t1_d9p7tu6,taking more shots will not follow current efficiency patterns. It willmay be diminished returns and probably would reduce his efficiency. Melo needs to take fewer shots and try to lead and get his teammates involved and playing better. If not we will just have another wasted year of excuses complaining that poor melo did not have a good supporting cast and therefore he is just unlucky. If Melo is such a great catch and shoot player than why are we not doing that more? And why cant melo do for us what he did during those wonderful first few months of last season? PASS!!

Rose can easily be a  ppg player but it is uneccesary when he is surrounded with gifted offensive talent which wasnt the case in Chicago in .  Derrick is a winner. Period. You cant win a championship funneling the O thru one guy. Short answer.

Its been a knock on him for a big chunk of his career and a few game winners dont turn back the clock on a lot of bad habits.

10012531,0,t3_5j04wv,gtWe werent getting the ball to those guys. A couple of times we dribbled away from them. Passed it away from those guys. Melos a great postup guy and if he has a small guy on him the ball should be in his hands.Team still looks like its figuring out the balance between isolation and ball movement. Part of the issue Ive noticed is how bad some of the guys are at getting the ball into the post. Melo has to come up very high to receive the pass. Takes more time and hes further from the basket.None of this really matters though when you consider the defense. Team is likely going to have to make a trade. It sucks because they all seem to love the team so much but Oquinn lance and kuzminskas might have enough value around the league to get us another shot blocker at the five or a lowend starting caliber defensive wing. ,NYKnicks,dbcntx7,1,t5_2rur5

10088860,0,t1_dbmky4g,The actual time to tank was the  season when Melo was an expiring contract. As much as we loved the  team they overachieved and instead doubled down by trading for Bargnani during the  offseason. The team should have tried to recoup lost assets from the Melo and Bargnani trade and gut the team completely. I cannot prove this whatsoever but I bet if Jackson came on before the trade deadline he would have gone full rebuild. And instead of that he was forced into bringing back Melo and the rest is history.This offseason the Knicks had two routes keep the  team essentially in tact replacing Afflalo and Williams because the opted out obviously or try to be competitive during the remaining years of Melos contract by taking a gamble on Rose bringing in Noah and Lee etc. Even though I would have rather have seen last years team with Hornacek as the coach I cannot complain about this current route at all because Porzingis playing meaningful minutes and playing with veterans has been great for his development so far. All the Knicks have to do now is manage their cap well i.e. no more  year deals that to players around  years old and draft well over the next year years when Noah Lee and Thomas are off the cap. They can do some minor moves like trading KOQ andor Lee for a pick while his value is up. Other than that the goal should be being competitive forcing KP and Billy to play meaningful minutes. Its a lot better for their development than sucking for at least the next  years. ,NYKnicks,dbmlg6t,3,t5_2rur5

KOQs one of my favorites and Id hate to see him go for several reasons but such a deal would certainly prioritize KP. KOQs likely going to make M a year once hes a free agent and thanks to the contracts of Noah Lee Melo and whatever free agent PG signs with the Knicks this offseason the Knicks wont be able to afford such a deal.

We also give up more points when he is in. His Net is not good.  You dont like RPM thats fine. How about other advanced stats? WS?

Carmelo does not do anything really well anymore. No defense bad and declining efficiency not a good or willing passer ...There is really no way to defend him anymore.

However he signed Melo gave him an NTC hired Fisher Rambis Hornacek signed Noah traded away Rolo one of his only good moves for Rose a bad move ... he keeps bringing in coaches and players and keeps hitting reset because of terrible underachievement.

I truly feel like people enjoy hating on the Knicks when they are down especially Knicks supposed fans. I never remember Melo getting this much hate before coming to New York. I understand that a lot of that is people feeling like we gave up a lot to get him.  At the time I thought that too but the Nuggets havent been that much better than us since the trade they havent been out of the first round since Melo took them to the WCF and none of the players we lost have turned into much.  Melo gets criticized for things that most other players also do and dont get nearly as much criticism as he does.

And the league knows this  how many LM reports have proven that the wrong calls were made?This is not getting fixed and I dont think it will be. Because those LM reports are just smoke and mirrors. So either the league has to start punishing refs that make blatantly wrong calls which is what happens in every other civilized country by the way.

There are much better ways to shop a player than how Phil is doing it. His tactic is basically offend Melo so much to the point he doesnt want to be apart of the team.

11000415,0,t1_deev14c,I have two different thoughts on this.. The Garden sold out last time we tanked.  It always will. Theres actually no pressure for them to rush though they always seem to think there is..  The Sixers have rebranded tanking as a multiyear suckfest.  For most of lottery history its meant changing course when the team sucks.  When Robinson got hurt the Spurs tanked and kept him out longer than necessary and made sure to not improve in the short term.  They got Duncan. The Celtics tried the same thing and failed so its no lock. But all you can do is lean into what your season has become and try and maximize your odds.,NYKnicks,deev4nl,15,t5_2rur5
11005269,0,t1_defeqiq,I truly very strongly believe trading away a pick that is  years down the road is extremely stupid. It is a dumb bet that will almost always backfire. Even if youre the Warriors you cant be  sure you will be a top  team in  right now Durant could leave Steph could get injured Draymond or Klay could move elsewhere because theres not enough money to go around. This applies to every team.We really just need to keep our picks. Sure if youre win now trade this years next years. But past that it is a losing bet. Unfortunately repeatedly trading our picks made it that that was all we had to give for Melo  because we had traded so many picks in the past.

11053512,0,t1_dektvrl,I think of it this way we want this to be the last year where the Knicks are at the bottom of the barrel. We have a few talented young guys and especially after this draft no matter who we get since were likely to get a top ten pick we should not be in the bottom  or  teams after this year. That means that in order for us to get a young point guard that we can grow alongside Porzingis it should happen now. Otherwise we will likely do a usual Knicks thing and try to pick some FA up who we will overpay because thats the current market for PGs in the NBA.So lets use your example and we take Isaac or Tatum. We still have Melo Porzingis Hernangomez OQuinn Lance Thomas Noah Kuz and probably other big guys. Adding another SF PF or C doesnt help us much even if we do offload some of those other guys. Balance is a key and with Rose likely being gone Jennings already gone and only BakerRandle still here we need a guard.If it were up to me I would draft a point guard unless there are like  guys ahead of the next PG try to sign some solid veteran to start aboveteach the young guy and then transition the drafted guy into the starting role after  years.,NYKnicks,dekwam0,2,t5_2rur5

Barring the nearguaranteed stars in the top  picks varies by draft nobody KNOWS who the best player available is.  This uncertainty only increases as you go further down the draft order.  What a team needs is far better understood..  We know that while superstar production can transcend system coaches teammates etc. e.g. Melo can get buckets anywhere anytime success for many NBA players can be highly situational.  A highly imbalanced roster e.g. the ers last year can set up players for failure and make it even harder to judge a players peak value in the right situation.Considering fitneed  should not be seen as completely illogical in a team sport where situation can and does affect player productionvalue.

11314102,0,t1_dfef9or,I agree with all of your points. Ball certainly has incredible strengths that warrant the attention hes received. His ability to get everyone involved and put his teammates in a position to succeed is second to none. Plus when hes in rhythm and has a good look at the basket his point stroke is one of the best in the class.With that said thats where I see the strengths ending. His lack of speed burst strength and creative ball handling are a serious concern for me. He never gets to the line and avoids contact like the plague once he does get in the paint. If hes just going to hover around the perimeter and can only get his shot off going left stepping back well beyond the line then its going to be incredibly easy for good NBA teams to contain him. On the defensive end hes going to be in the same class as Thomas Lillard Kyrie Rose. He was completely exposed by Kentucky as they were forced to hide him in the corner as far away from the pick and roll as possible. He just dies on screens and doesnt have the speed to recover. Theres too much working against him for me to think he has true twoway star potential.,NYKnicks,dfefov5,1,t5_2rur5
11314296,0,t1_dfefov5,Absolutely Balls aversion to contact is probably what I find most worrisome about him. The NBA boasts bigger and stronger athletes than what he is used to and they will no doubt attempt to lock him out to the perimeter via that disparity. His burst personally does not shout red flag to me though. I dont envision him being a John Wallesque sports car PG. I think his game is built on and benefits from playing at a very measured pace almost never overclocking. Normally I would find this troubling but he seems to use that slower more methodical pace as a vehicle for his vision limiting his turnovers. This is a huge deal in the NBA because turnovers often having a monumental impact in the pros.I totally love that Fox is as committed as he is to defending well but in honesty he does not possess special vision. Hes a solid passer it most certainly is not a chink in his armor but he also has a very specific advantage He plays on the better team. He finds people for good shots semiconsistently but there is no doubt in my mind that a substantial number of his assists are from teammates who can flatout ball just drilling shots Monk especially whose game is tailormade to outright excel at the college level.If youd like to discuss Josh Jackson with me as well Id love to. The more I see of him and try to understand how his skillset might translate in the pros the more I am locked on him. He is a doitall player and not just in the jackofalltrades masterofnone sense. His BBIQ is extremely high his athleticism amp frame are for real his vision is sneakily serious he is primed to be a true twoway player. I really hope Orlando amp Philly put together some good winning basketball in the last stretch run of the season so it helps our draft stock.,NYKnicks,dfeghb8,2,t5_2rur5

It just doesnt make sense given the fact that PJ wont be here forever and drafting a whole bunch of players around a system that isnt utilized anymore for a coach that doesnt know how to coach it is a dangerous gamble.

Dolans pettiness is untouchable but making it a race thing is just completely blowing it out of proportion to try to paint him as a racist.He already stopped influencing the organisation and left that to Phil as far as I know.  The stuff with how he treats fans and all gets brushed under the rug all the time.  He called a fan an alcoholic and Silver brushed that under the rug of hes from New York you come at him he hits back bullshit.  Unless he slaps the shit out of a fan that wont do anything.

Sounds like Phil had a conversation with Melo on Thursday and they agreed that it was best for them to move on. And Phil was honest and forthright in what happened and why. I thought the press conference was open and informative. I liked hearing about how he thinks about the direction of the franchise and I like that were bringing in new young guys albeit slowly that buy into a system. Watch the video if you havent the media really flipped this one more than usual in my opinion. The press conference was fine its the fact that KP is apparently unhappy is the issue. Phil needs to make sure that KP is happy and understands the direction of the franchise. ,NYKnicks,dgbc8cw,3,t5_2rur5

But The way the ending of the season happened  Jesus Christ.I feel like Phil Jackson has the potential to be a better GM he has done some great things with finding prospects. But... he has cut the passive aggressive stuff that worked when he was coaching but not working now.  Has to work better with coaches. The coach that he wants in his mind doesnt exist. Hornacek is capable of being an adequate coach.

11618510,0,t3_65ssnk,Yea same as before. Very little respect for Phil as an executive. The entire point of hiring him was to use the respect he commands to steady the ship and gain more respect among free agents. He hasnt done any of that. Hes scapegoated at every turn patronized his own hires and initiated confrontation with major players outside of the organization. Its been  years now too. Im not upset theyre not in the playoffs Im upset that  years later hes still complaining about culture and dissension after electing to press reset on the roster twice. Carmelo is not the problem. If Phil elects to rebuild and focus on young players and Melo chooses to stay for that thats his choice because Phil threw in that NTC like it wasnt anything. Melos age doesnt prevent the Knicks for starting the youth movement while reducing his role. It speaks to Phils arrogance that again and again he violates what is basic common sense to other executives. Side note this is hilarious in hindsight,NYKnicks,dgcyvur,18,t5_2rur5

At the core of his vision he explained was a longterm plan of developing consistency and excellence that would require years not months.I was clear in our meeting Marks says. I told them If you are looking for a quick fix or similar to what you did before Im the wrong guy.Prokhorov agreed to all of it as well as the hiring of Atkinson as coach. Atkinson a former Knicks and Hawks assistant who is known as one of the most innovative player development coaches in the game tacked on his own wish list implementing an uptempo style a staff of assistants fit enough to lace up their high tops and participate in full practices and a philosophy of spreading minutes evenly across the roster rather than relying too heavily on stars such as Lopez and Jeremy Lin. ,NYKnicks,dgj26iw,3,t5_2rur5
