I kindof like when I get into moods like that as crazy as it sounds. I end up writing for hours or talking to close friends for a long time and have some great insights. ,MeditativeMinds,d4ewpwa,1,t5_3cjl8
8169856,0,t1_d4yffi5,The technique Im practicing is Mindfullness Based Stillness Meditation. Essentially I sit half lotus and begin to be fully mindfull over my body and how each limb feels deeply relaxing myself. Then I become mindfull over my breath then my thoughts until eventually I hit a state where I am able to just let everything from feelings to thoughts to sensations come and go.EDIT Oh I get what youre asking. I dont really know how to explain it though when it happens it just happens. I just become able to look at a situation as an OBSERVER rather than a PARTICIPANT and I am able to be mindfull over myself.,MeditativeMinds,d4ys4zd,1,t5_3cjl8

8925709,0,t1_d7kcqb4,My girlfriend is very new to buddhism so its interesting to see her take on things when I talk about spiritual matters.My friend is not buddhist but a deeper thinker so hell occasion ask questions about aspects of buddhism that I just take for granted. He was skeptical about rebirth but after I shared different takes on the matter hes slowly opening up to it. These conversations made me think deeper and more carefully about these topics. I like this community here because I see real practitioners in the trenches of practice and can hear details about personal experiences. This has been enlightening and encouraging for my own practice.   ,MeditativeMinds,d7kqmcl,1,t5_3cjl8
9145035,0,t1_d8b5dhb,You have a point though. Im still stuck in an odd negative way of thinking. What I ment with longest is that a two hour session felt shorter than that half hour one lol. Came out so unbelievably negative though a bit more positive each day might be a good one for me,MeditativeMinds,d8b75x3,1,t5_3cjl8

9595508,0,t1_d9qxr71,Do you go to a planet fitness? They are notorious for not having real weight lifting equipment and catering to the casual gym goers. Im lucky that my gym has  benches with barbell and another room dedicated for olympic lifts. In that room a lot of people bring their own chalk and there is a lot of grunting there too.  ,MeditativeMinds,d9vuc3z,1,t5_3cjl8

Today I got  min in the morning then  min in the afternoon after a nap. I really like meditating after I get some sleep and my mind has been refreshed.  ,MeditativeMinds,dbs6l3q,1,t5_3cjl8
