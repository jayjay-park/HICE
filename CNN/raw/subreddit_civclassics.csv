10081427,0,t1_dblhsmb,Not at all but discord I feel will lead to more isolation and less communication throughout the community with each little nation having its own discord effectively private to the greater community as a whole,civclassics,dblmol7,2,t5_3fkqj
10151448,0,t3_5l3313,I like what you mentioned about new playersold friends but I think the way to fight this epidemic is rather than create a more expansive map is to actually fucking advertise so people outside of this niche community know what the fuck a civserver is.,civclassics,dbuq0ir,1,t5_3fkqj

10155114,0,t3_5lbb3t,This is a good decision Comrade.Alts where the backbone of CivCraft. It gave people so much advantages if they could buy alts it wasnt fun anymore. With this action. People will actually have to choose whatever they wish to do. Instead of just doing everything because nobody knows who they really are.So I am in favour of this great action! Well done Comrades and have a happy new year!,civclassics,dbv5080,2,t5_3fkqj

10228281,0,t1_dc2nglc,You could just put the logout clone in a hr vault and be completely safe. Also people want to use their alt to play in another nation and be politically separate from their main and having this logout clone is super dangerous for any account you actually play on. If you have to leave suddenly you no longer just have to worry about combat tag a nonissue because it only applies in combat you have to make sure your log spot is safe for  hours.,civclassics,dc3fli3,1,t5_3fkqj

11446838,0,t1_dftguzi,Over the past few months the admin team went from having time to spare for development to being hard pressed to fit in hours during the week. The number of manhours available to put into the project dwindled. This is because we are mostly of the collegeuniversity age with fairly intensive courses. I personally tried to put in five hours a week I dont know about the others.I think we all started to grow tired once we realised how much work actually needed doing after we found we couldnt just launch . again. Personally I was finally exhausted about a month ago due to the fact that for the past  months the map always seemed  hours off completion and after Id put  hours in another issue would arise whether it be glitch quality of life balance or aesthetic.I still have the map. Im reserving it in case anyone wants to pick up on it. I would be happy to collaborate with another team after exams. I am just reluctant to contact them until they are over as this years results determine whether I get the privilege to study abroad next year.,civclassics,dfthm9b,6,t5_3fkqj
