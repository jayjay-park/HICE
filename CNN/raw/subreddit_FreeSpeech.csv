3138390,0,t1_con2az7,Why does his purpose matter? The idea that we must not take things at face value but instead peel back a layer and judge the motives of a thing is the very idea that kills free speech. The idea that we even can is a lie. You dont end up discovering what the actual motives are you end up putting the person into a premade slot you aready had for them in this case the type who gets off on hurting peoples feelings. This is a tactic that gives you the moral high ground needed to label something as outside of the range of free speech because its morally wrong.This tactic can be used by anyone to discredit any kind of expression and it must be overcome. Ill never go to the guys sub because it doesnt interest me at all but to me its worth defending. ,FreeSpeech,conah8e,4,t5_2qt61

4231394,0,t1_cs2k4y7,the sub would literally post pictures of other redditors on their sidebar so the actual mods would do itthe first time i was shown the sub by my brother my sister in law was in the room and saw that some fat girl who made her own dress from rsewing was on the side bar and she said thats so sad she just wanted to show her dress and now shes being viciously attacked by this sub.  and then the users would swarm to the user in question and just start fucking attacking them.  and complaining about censorship?  the mods would literally ban anyone at the drop of a hat for going against hate.  its hilarious to hear people from that sub complain about THE VERY THINGS THEY ACTIVELY ENCOURAGED.  ,FreeSpeech,cs2kbei,12,t5_2qt61

4238282,0,t1_cs3azda,Well if you believe that natural laws protect peoples rights to those things because only some of those things are protected by the law here in the United States and some dont even apply. Taking photo without consent from social media does not violate any common notions of copyright law or even privacy law. These are pictures on the internet and social media posted with the understanding that it is a public environment. There is no consent required and I do not believe their should be.  Public ridicule and harassment? While it is true and correctly so that people are protected from harassment it must be assessed on an ad hoc basis. If someone has such a claim they should pursue it. One should not infringe upon another right when avenues to enforce rights exist its too restrictive of a means. As for public ridicule? I do not see a need for a protected right codified or natural for such thing. I do not believe that infringing on other freedoms is important enough to protect this. Further truth is an absolute defense for defamation. There is however the caveat of certain speech in the United States that is not protected and I believe that we have done a good job of defining that. I am not ready to qualify overweight people as a suspect class so many constitutional arguments for this protection dont hold up well. As for dignity? No one has that right it is something that is earned and is just as much about what other people think of you than what you think of yourself. These things are not freedoms I see worth protecting. Should we not be allowed to criticize Hitler publically? I understand the frustration with all of this as no one likes a mean asshole but as far as freedoms and individual liberties go I think it has long been known that there is a dangerous slippery slope when you get into this realm. ,FreeSpeech,cs3ctwb,0,t5_2qt61

If for example a religious leader who incites an already indoctrinated violent religious fanatic group of people to kill nonbelievers all the while handing out knives and guns to aid in the deed that kind of speech should be prohibited. ,FreeSpeech,d6rwxqj,1,t5_2qt61
