It becomes very difficult to be bike commuter simply because getting anywhere useful becomes almost impossible I used to bike commute in San Diego  I had to climb on to a bus just to complete my trip to work.From my experience the reason its more dangerous for bikers where there are fewer of them has more to do with the fact that if drivers live in areas where bikers on the road are rare theyre much less likely to stop and look out for them. If nobody uses the bike lanes cars are just going to ignore them after a while.

115900,0,t1_cermmfw,Heres the linked section Serotonergic changes changes from Wikipedia article Effects of MDMA on the human body  gtExperiments indicate that both moderate and high doses of MDMA or rapidly repeated MDMA exposure may lead to longlasting changes in neurons that make serotonin. Serotonergic changes have been demonstrated experimentally in the brains of all mammalian species studied with most studies involving rats. In these studies the brains of animals who are given high or repeated doses of MDMA show longterm decreases in all measures of serotonergic functioning including concentrations of serotonin tryptophan hydroxylase and binding of the serotonin transporter protein. Although measures of serotonin are decreased there are no decreases in the number of cells in the dorsal raphe which indicates that the serotonin neurons have not died. Limited studies attempting to stain and photograph serotonergic axons shortly after highdose MDMA exposure have reported that axons appear swollen and misshapen as if they might be degenerating. However few studies have attempted to stain and examine axons and with the measures commonly used in MDMA studies it is difficult or impossible to distinguish axon loss from decreases in production of markers of serotonin.gtAnimal studies show that there is recovery of serotonergic markers. However if axons are actually regrowing there is no assurance that they will reform their original connections. While rats show extensive recovery that sometimes appears complete some primate studies show evidence of lasting alterations in serotonergic measures. Human studies discussed below show recovery but these studies use indirect measures that may lack sensitivity for detecting subtle changes.gtIts not known what doses of MDMA would produce similar toxic effects in humans. This is because there are some difficulties in translating animal MDMA toxicity studies to humans. Firstly it is difficult to equate rat doses to human doses because rats metabolize MDMA twice as fast as humans and often larger doses or multiple doses are administered to simulate human plasma levels. Second if the neurotoxicity of MDMA depends on its metabolites Jones  it may be difficult or impossible to translate an MDMA dose between species since different species metabolize MDMA to different extents. Therefore it is difficult to say what dose in humans would produce the effects seen in animals.gtKeeping these limitations in mind comparisons of MDMA exposures can be made between animal neurotoxicity studies and human clinical studies. One uncertain estimate suggests that the neurotoxic dose may be only moderately higher than amounts given in clinical studies . or . mgkg about  or  mg. That published comparison was made based on data from rats.gtFurther comparisons can be made using monkey data. In a recent study by Mechan et al.  the lowest repeated dose regimen that produced serotonergic effects detectable after  weeks in squirrel monkeys was . mgkg given orally three times in a row every  hours. The peak plasma MDMA concentrations seen after that dose was    ngml mean  SEM range  to  ngml and the Area Under the Concentration vs. TimeCurve AUC a measure of overall drug exposure was    hrngml. In comparison . mgkg oral  mg in a  kg  person in humans produces peak MDMA concentrations of .  . ngml range    ngml and an AUC of .  . hrngml Kolbrich et al. . Thus a typical human dose produces peak MDMA concentration ... Truncated at  charactersabout | uklienknopper can reply with delete.

465919,0,t1_cft76dp,The idea of analog versus digital is basically a qualitative judgment. It provides no insight into deciding whether a given sound coming through a pair of speakers is one or the other. I promise you that if an AB test were set up such that a very high quality analogue tape was compared to a CD its unlikely that anyone would be able to tell the difference.However we do have a quantitative measure of the quality of a format and its called the signal to noise ratio SNR. Basically its the difference between the loudest and the quietest sound that the format can record. The higher the number the more detail the medium can hold. This runs counter to the idea that analog is infinite detail as often a digital recording will have measurably higher fidelity than an analog recording.One could propose that digital sounds are not an accurate representation of an analog sound because of some digital error but we actually have a mathematical basis for digital reconstruction that eliminates this possibility The NyquistShannonm theoremBasically uheshl is right. People enjoy vinyl because it sounds shitty  it can be distorted and noisy but it can also have just the right high frequency aspects that people would call warm so I guess people love it for similar reasons as to why they love vintage recording gear.I personally dont think my records sound better than digital recordings.

No more freezing no more product keys no more software that only half uninstalls no more browsing half the internet before finding the right software.The iPhone just works.Windows  has nothing to do with the rise of the iPhone and the rise of Android. Years of lack of innovation buggy software slow software are the real source of Microsofts woes.Realistically the only real improvement between Windows  and Windows  was the introduction of driver signing in Windows XP.,dataisbeautiful,cg9ehp8,1,t5_2tk95

617141,0,t1_cga8vh5,I ran on a running scholarship at my last school before I transferred. Can confirm.General rundown Hour for WarmUpCoolDownStretching Hours average for Workout  Hour for CoreIcingPreventative StuffTravel weeks are even worse. And unless you ran under  in the mile there was no chance of you getting a fullride to a competitive school. Youd be lucky for a couple thousand dollars because most programs have to split a few fullscholarships between loads of student athletes. At my school we had  for twelve guys. I earned  a year at a school where tuition was  alone. I ran the numbers.  weeks hours a week means roughly . an hour. Sure we had access to decent tutors but most were too exhausted to utilize them. First off its hard to emphasize how much running at  miles a week can utterly destroy your body. And  miles aint nothing for most toptier programs. Then theres the finite resource of time. Full time enrollment hovered around  hours so without even cracking open a book to study school was eating up over  hours a week. Some managed to do it at the expense of sleep but good luck maintaining your fitness on anything less than six hours a night average. Dont maintain your fitness? Then you dont perform well. Kiss that scholarship goodbye. Parttime job to pay your rent or food bill? Thatll be another  hours. So youre left with roughly  hours a day. Sounds decent enough right? But wait theres that seminar you have to attend and you still havent bothered to bathe eat drink or even account for the little chores that eat up the majority of your time. I dont want to sound like Im complaining I loved my time there although I did transfer for the sake of my academics. Its just that for  of athletes as your father will probably readily confirm its not as easy as some make it out to be. tldr unless youre an olympic class prodigy you may be better off with a minimum wage job than just being an athlete.  ,dataisbeautiful,cgaf4qf,4,t5_2tk95

The case for short term pain ending in death I feel is a different matter.  If you torture them and then throw them back in a cell they spend a significant amount of time in pain even after the torture has ended and they feel mental suffering before the next torture happens.  If you are killing them and they happen to hurt while theyre dying there wont be a languishing pain because theyll be dead.Im not saying we should intentionally seek to cause pain while killing someone but if someone is going to die ANYWAY then why are we concerned that their death might happen to be briefly painful?Again if we were talking about something like long term torture ending in death then I would agree but short term?  I dont see why were obligated ethically to ensure that their death is painless.,dataisbeautiful,ch780vo,-5,t5_2tk95

950495,0,t1_chbklby,I lived in Yuma for seven years until recently.  Although there are two tribes there the Cocapah and Quechan the almost  unemployment rate is not really attributed to those.  Mostly it is due to the seasonal nature of the largest industry agriculture. Yuma County provides  of the United States total winter supply of green leafy vegetables lettuce broccoli spinach etc and high percentages of other fruits and vegetables for our nation citrus dates melons etc along with other crops such as wheat and cotton.  During the winter months unemployment is much lower because there are many agricultural jobs. However the index is for yearround average employment and for the spring summer and fall months agricultural workers are without employment.  While some of them do migrate to other locations to work in fields such as going to Salinas CA most just stay in Yuma and collect unemployment unless they are lucky enough to find other employment until the next season starts.I was the manager of a hotel there and I can honestly say even with the extremely high unemployment rate it was still very difficult to find good decently educated employees for front desk and office staff.  Finding good hard working housekeepers however was a breeze.  When people are used to working extremely hard labor in the fields landing a job at a hotel cleaning  to  rooms a day is nothing.  Now I manage a hotel in upstate New York and I have the complete opposite staffing issues here!,dataisbeautiful,chcbv07,3,t5_2tk95

975629,0,t1_chdsgjt,From my point of view it was not clearly stated in the beginning what the point was. Conflating correlation based on randomness or omitted variables is perfectly fine for communicating the point that correlation does not imply causation as was OPs intent. Of course you can make a stronger statement by focusing on random correlation  we know these variables are not correlated at all. However it also makes the argument worse in some ways since you then have ventured into arguing that in this particular case there is no causation only a spurious correlation. Point being if you by correlation does not imply causation want to be agnostic about the particular case conflation is fine. Hope that made sense. Im not sure this is the reason for the downvotes insert causation joke here but that was what I thought at least.  ,dataisbeautiful,chf6s0d,3,t5_2tk95
975768,0,t3_259x4c,Hey nice work I like the site! Im glad it has started discussion about spurious correlation since a lot of people can not interpret correlation results correctly even in the scientific community.As udirtyratchet mentioned you can run into problems if correlation is done on absolute values of the time series. Why is this? Running a correlation assumes a set properties and is violated if a trend is common in both series have a read about unit root testing on Wikipedia. Another assumption is that they do not have autocorrelation. Taking difference can help remove both of these but not always i.e. autocorrelation with many lags.  An important consideration is how to correctly interpret high correlation. If it is used to determine relationship between two series then you can calculate the significance pvalue if you will of the correlation result. For example two sets of three data points can have high correlation but it is conceivable this is caused by luck. If one data mines a large number of series then chance of finding spurious correlation increases significantly. So you really should look at the conditional probability of a significant correlation given the number of data series you are mining.  So you have high correlation and pvalue how do you interpret the result? Dont forget that you are gathering evidence! One test doesnt mean the truth like the saying extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.  Then you start going into Bayesian statistics and thats a whole different ball game.,dataisbeautiful,chf7cgz,8,t5_2tk95

1110178,1,t1_chugp5k,gt Although most references to the Subprime Mortgage Crisis refer to events and conditions that led to the financial crisis and subsequent recession that began in  a much smaller bubble and collapse occurred in the mid to lates sometimes dubbed Subprime I or Subprime .. It ended in  when the rate of subprime mortgage securitization dropped from . in  to . in . In the two years following the  Russian financial crisis eight of the top ten subprime lenders declared bankruptcy ceased operations or sold out to stronger firms.gtThe crisis is said to have had had all the earmarks of a classic bubble with enthusiasm over rising stock prices replacing caution over shoddy business practices and concern over whether the earnings of the companies were sustainable. Loans were made to borrowers who were unable to pay them back. The subprime mortgage companies began taking unexpected writedowns as mortgages were refinanced at lower interest rates. Much of the reported profits turned out to be illusory and companies such as Famco went under. Along with the bankruptcies came a wave of lawsuits and complaints from consumer advocates who accused the subprime industry of engaging in predatory lending. The impact was slight compared to the later bubble.gtSubprime I was smaller in size  in the mids  billion of mortgages constituted a big year for subprime lending by  there were  billion in subprime mortgage loans  billion of which were in mortgage backed securities  and was essentially really high rates for borrowers with bad credit. Mortgages were mostly fixedrate still required borrowers to prove they could pay by documenting income etc. By   of subprime loans were some form of floatingrate usually fixed for the first two years.hurr durr politicalbanker elites forced them to take loans they couldnt afford!!! yadda yadda BS.gtMinorities willingly entered subprime mortgages in far greater numbers than whites and represented a disproportional percentage of foreclosuresIn fact id want the government to hunt down every banker involved with the subprime crisis and the poor people who took loans they couldnt afford creating a bubble.Strange that however i get complaints by people who exclaim that it wasnt the poor peoplewho got subprime mortgages fault just yadda yadda the bankers!. Even though i keep saying i want to hunt down both bankers AND those who took on subprime mortgages.

1159531,0,t1_chzz6vq,This data is probably more relevant than the overall murder rate.I can see how the trend was derived but its so slight and the data so incredibly variable with very extreme outliers that Im not sure it implies a direct causation there very well could still be an indirect one though. It raises some questions that would make it somewhat unreliable as a stat point to use for policy decision.For instance we can probably assume that the major outliers are countries that have to deal with some sort of armed conflict civil war fights against terrorist groupsdrug cartels etc. in which case the overall gun ownership rate of the citizens and gun laws in general wont change much to the reality of gun violence.Likewise its reasonable to believe these countries do have lower gun ownership rates but because their population is poor rather than because of restrictive gun laws.If you disregard the outliers the trend between gun ownership and gun homicide moves closer to being a flat line which would imply theres no significant relation between the two. Also its still difficult to say if the slightly higher rate of gun homicide in nonoutlier countries with low gun ownership is really caused by said low gun ownership or rather by the fact that these are poor countries which both increases homicide rate and decreases gun ownership rates.TLDR This data can be useful but it cant really be used on its own for public policy. It would need to be coupled with economic data and information about which countries are currently facing armed conflicts. Otherwise its difficult to say whether countries have higher gun homicide rates because they have low gun ownership rates or if they have higher homicide rates because they are poor andor going through armed conflict and have lower gun ownership because they are poor.,dataisbeautiful,ci02cxv,0,t5_2tk95

1199081,0,t1_ci4hsfm,I dont know about needlessly but I think the Soviet strategy of deep battle essentially called for them to sacrifice many troops defending against an enemys advance in order to weaken them and allow successive assaults to destroy the force they were fighting. An example youll find in that citation is Stalingrad. It wasnt like the Germans just threw themselves mindlessly into the city the Soviets CHOSE to draw them in there to wear them down.  gtIn operational terms by drawing the German Army into the city of Stalingrad they denied them the chance to practice their greater experience in mobile warfare. The Red Army was able to force its enemy to fight in a limited area hampered by the city landscape unable to use its mobility or firepower as effectively as in the open country. The German Sixth Army was forced to endure severe losses which forced the OKW to strip its flanks to secure its centre. This left its poorly equipped Axis allies to defend its centre of gravityits operational depth. When Soviet intelligence had reason to believe the Axis front was at its weakest it would strike at the flanks and encircle the German Army Operation Uranus.Maybe not needless the strategy apparently won them the Eastern Front it was VERY casualtyheavy. ,dataisbeautiful,ci4ijt4,5,t5_2tk95

Dont feel bad though. Its incredibly common. At least for men with  in  men having some form of CVD. You should consider taking a color acuity test like this one Note that getting any of them wrong can be a sign of color vision deficiency if you have a good display. Do remember that having mild CVD doesnt really have an impact on your life though and that its nothing to worry about. But it would probably be nice to see an optician if you score really badly. You are using some sort of setup where you arent getting the full range of colors. In the case of a phone it could be that being outside in the sun is interfering with your ability to distinguish colors on the screen.

1256553,0,t1_ciayh8a,I actually disagree with your logic.  The fact that a term is no longer politely used to describe a group does not invalidate it as a descriptor for the group.I wouldnt refer to a Jewish friend as a kike because the word though no longer part of our vernacular English has a history of derogatory use and and this is the key part is still offensive to many living Jews.  We remove words from common usage out of consideration for oppressed or minority groups.  In other words we acknowledge that they are offended by them and scratch them from use out of respect.  This is the premise for the cessation of use for these words  that they are offensive.   So by this premise if the word is still common parlance is irrelevant.  The only relevant question is  Is the word offensive to a substantial portion of people?We need look no further than the major news today that the trademark for the Washington Redskins team name was revoked by the courts.  The reason being that the term was deemed offensive by a substantial portion of Native Americans and therefor not eligible for trademark protection.  The prosecution produced studies showing the percentage of Native Americans that found it offensive in order to prove their case.  The fact the term Redskin as a derogatory term has almost completely vanished from modern American English was not even a consideration!  So if our premise is we remove words that are offensive any word no matter the current usage that offends a substantial portion of a oppressed or minority group should be considered for removal upon the request of the group in question.  I can tell you from personal experience that developmentally disabled people and their families are very offended by the term retard and retarded in any context.  My wife works in programs for a nonprofit that provides support for families with developmentally disabled children so we both have many friends in the community.Think of it this way if you went to a party and someone there had brought a developmentally disabled child would you freely use the term retarded to describe something you thought was stupid?  If not the term is probably offensive!And even if I were to agree with your point the fact is that many many people do still use retarded to describe developmentally disabled individuals.  They do it both because they dont know any better or they dont care that people find it offensive.So your argument fails on both points.  The word is still used as a slur by ignorant or hostile individuals and by the very premise of removing offensive words retarded is a prime candidate in that it is offensive to in my experience the vast majority of individuals with developmental disabilities and their families.On a side note thanks for helping me waste some time here at work on a nice internet debate that does not degrade into personal attacks and insults!  What a pleasant change of pace.  D,dataisbeautiful,ciaz6s8,2,t5_2tk95

All countries make a value judgment along that axis and any choice is defensible from a moral perspective.

Last I checked prostitution is still illegal in America I assume you are American like me.gtWhy is it ok to encourage women to treat their most inner parts as base tools for the sake of someones shallow desires whether or not they are ok with it whether or not they desire it themselves?Because that is what they signed up for. No one is forcing legal and regulated prostitutes into their position. They are okay with it. If they werent it would be rape and society is very strongly against that.It seems you are projecting your world view onto prostitutes. Not everyone thinks like you. Not everything thinks of sex as this super special thing that shouldnt be used outside of love. A good thing to realize is that people think differently than you. btw I could be completely wrong but Im getting the vibe that you are a Christian and that you think sexoutside of marriage is a sin. Ill reiterate a point if this is true. Just because you see it as a sin doesnt mean the world sees it that way. Lots of people are just fine with that.gtThough Ive yet to hear of prostitutes who enjoy the sex I dont doubt such may exist. There have been AMAs on Reddit from Australian prostituteslegal ones and they say that they love their job. That they didnt want to stop on their first day but management forced them out after their  hour day. I know it can be hard to realize if you have been in a sex negative environment but girls love sex.gtI dont buy that men are hopeless and that the oldest trade will never decrease in demand. Thats caveman talk and this discussion about yeah lets feed the beast to prevent it from irrational behaviour instead of taming it to be civilized and to realize theres more to being alive than primitive carnal nature is medieval. Can we as a people instead talk about what would really make people happy society healthy and generations to come safe and secure and free instead of settling for a tradeoff?This right his is the abstinence only education mindset. This is why I assumed you were for that.gtHuh? No. I believe that teaching boys to respect girls and girls to respect themselves they usually are taught to respect others already that then they can pair off and mate with less ill consequences.People can be prostitutes and respect themselves. Just because you have sex outside of love doesnt mean they hate themselves.gtIts about caring about each other that I think should be promoted.Awesome. So does everyone.

1603903,0,t1_cjhay66,New York has  reps. It could be split up into  or  electoral districts of about  reps each. I dont see how that would significantly deteriorate geographic representation. I stated this about large states in my first post.Again even in a group of about  reps that geographically covers say a few large cities and a decent amount of rural land the people elected would still proportionally represent the electorate. Even though the district elects say  people each voter gets only one vote. This means that all the rural people can elect someone who still represents their interests.I argue against purely geographical representation because in my opinion there is no reason to stick to only it. Americans like to think in a insideofthebox way as if tens of other countries havent developed other solutions. My point is that the effort it would take to fix gerrymandering would probably be just as much as implementing proportional representation and fixing the root of the issue single member districts.

1633840,0,t1_cjl3ex7,I disagree.     gt The metabolisms of our food sources have stopped by the time they become food sources. We arent leeching off of their metabolisms  were metabolizing them.       Sometimes we eat living things sometimes we eat dead things. Seeds need their macronutrients to germinate and we live if we eat them. Yes we metabolize them. Just as viruses metabolize us turning our amino acids into them. Viruses only reproduce in us if were alive but frankly they dont need that. It is possible to replicate viruses in vitro given the right starter chemicals and you can feed humans on synthetic substrates given right starter chemicals. I dont see how any of this is relevant to the discussion at hand and your point is simply wrong.        gt And in any case viruses neither leech consuming energy from a separate metabolic process nor prey metabolizing a living entity. They reprogram  they trick an entity into manufacturing more of them.       It is not helpful to ascribe agency trick to a chemical process. Its as logical to say viruses trick host cells as it is to say humans trick glucose molecules into feeding a primate instead of a plant. Lets stay away from arguments based on vitalism and striving from now on but keep in mind that if we go there the protein in a meat was for that animal and we reprogrammed it into our bodies and that works just as well for my side of the argument as yours. If viruses dont consume human energy or metabolize the stuff of humans what on earth are they doing? How can  virions enter a cell and  come out? It costs energy. It uses material. Both came from us.         gt  Imagine an automated factory. A virus doesnt tap into a robots energy supply and it doesnt break down the robots components into fuel  it changes the robots programming so that it makes viruses instead of widgets.          A virus does tap into a humans energy supply if you want me to break it down for you molecularly lets do it and it does break down the humans components into parts of itself quite like a human does with a plant or animal material.,dataisbeautiful,cjl3zmy,1,t5_2tk95

The creation of biofuels necessitates a pretty large input of energy which generates emissions. So the fuel you get is cleaner than gasoline but not that much cleaner and the process of creating it pushes the net emissions per gallon above that of gasoline. It is also less efficient in your fuel tank so you spend more money and burn more fuel to consistently fuel your car with E or whatever instead of gasoline.,dataisbeautiful,cjxqbuf,2,t5_2tk95

If they were it was simply because supplies had been bombed immediately beforehand. It was impossible to move supplies across the volga during the day and very difficult during the night. Soldiers were not issued supplies until they got across the river because if their boat sank while they were personally carrying their equipment they WOULD drown.

1962275,0,t1_ckpejba,Id like to point out that big spending big government Keynesian economic types have been in power the entire time this data is present. Reagan and Bush Sr. Were the first of new Era Republicans supporting big spending and big government with Reagan increasing the debt from  to  trillion and Bush Sr. Adding on another trillion. Clinton oversaw the biggest financial boom in modern history but failed to eliminate the deficit which is to my understanding why Keynesian economists support deficit spendingit can be paid back during bonus booms leaving office  years later with . trillion oh the debt. Bush jr. Further raised the debt to  trillion but his biggest contribution was tripling the deficit in his last year in office from  billion  in  to a staggering  billion  in  Obamas first year.Obama has been slowly decreasing the deficit he inherited partly due to a financial recovery but having started with the awful number Bush gave him on the last year this means the current deficit is still higher than bushes average  and the debt increased to  trillion in the first for years of Obama and has continued rising. My point is big government spending has been the norm on both sides of the aisle during this entire time. Correlation doesnt imply causation but being that economies changing are impossible to truly determine the cause of correlation is one of the more helpful insights we have. If big government spending caused an increase in quality of life for the middle class I would expect the middle class to be doing better since that has been the norm since Reagan took office. ,dataisbeautiful,ckpnmcv,1,t5_2tk95

I am concerned only with me and the few close others I do choose to care about. In other words Im selfish and only give a shit about myself.In regards to the thing about working free market. I admit it would probably be tough to find one that fits all the criteria. Im simply too fucking lazy to go trudge through the internet to disprove someone on Reddit. A free market is a theory. Nothing in life with that many real time variables works out like the theory says it should. Humans screw all our own predictions up. So Im not really concerned whether or not a free market truly exists as long as any market benefits the target audience its done the job it set out to do. In regards to my inability to distinguish..blah blah. I dont really care. As I said earlier Im not interested in making a useful contribution. Im simply here to rapaciously consume all that this world has to offer me and then die. havent had any trouble so far and since most likely the world will be plunged into civilization destroying conflict within the next...oh  years shit doesnt matter to me cause were all fucked anyway.,dataisbeautiful,ckskmty,0,t5_2tk95

If you look at the University of Gottingen for example it had the world reputation in the s that Harvard does now. That reputation has never been recovered and a large part of it is because the mathematics and physics departments were essentially banished.I dont necessarily think that Germanys medals were more impressive.

2226866,0,t1_clmu6v8,gt but again the key point there is that in those  days he won a major victory defeating the enemy he was made consul to defeat.He wasnt made Consul he was made Dictator. Dictator differed in many ways from Consul. His imperium and authority superseded that of a Consul he was unelected no one could veto him and he was not elected. If you dont know the difference between the highest elected magistrate of the Republic and the Dictator its not surprising the truth about Cincinnatus is so difficult for you to grasp.gtthe dictator had up to  months of power to deal with the issue and then the senate would decide what to do afterwards to check dictators potential power.No he was given a term of  months. He was under no obligation to relinquish power and had the opportunity if he wanted to continue in his position for the remainder of the six months. That he did not is evidence of his devotion to his country and his lack of ambition and it is what he is regarded for like Washington. The Senate couldnt check his power before the  months so he was free to do as he pleased. He chose not to. It is for that he is remembered. Im getting tired of repeatedly explaining this to you.gtyoure confusing  distinct points. He was remembered for being the ideal Roman citizen soldier lacking political ambition but not virtue see my other post for the quote. This isnt however because he merely resigned when the danger passed as allmost dictators did that. from up topNo hes remembered for passing up unlimited power when his time as Dictator was not over and the Republic was in reverent awe of him. Ive pointed out the parallels between him and Washington and demonstrated to you that this is what they were both admired for. gtEssentially your placing way too much emphasis on the fact he resigned a  month office early Neither I nor many historians are emphasizing this fact too much. That you place so little emphasis on it is your own error. Cincinnatus had the legal right to continue in office as Dictator. It can be said of him alone that he gave up office prematurely thus denying himself absolute power. This is getting annoying. You even said in your first post it was not just for giving up power that he is remembered for which is tacit acknowledgement that he is admired and remembered for this act. It obviously stands out. Ive not denied his civic virtue devotion to the Republic and desire for simplicity are traits hes admired for but obviously you dont want to acknowledge that his premature abdication of absolute power is also something that he is widely admired for Washington being among his admirers. Obviously nothing will convince you of that so I see no reason to continue trying. Youre welcome to discover that on your own but theres certainly no point in me continuing to attempt to enlighten you.Edit In case youre wondering other dictators did wield their absolute power past the existence of a threat in order to achieve their own goals. See below.His second dictatorship in  BCE was occasioned by fear of an impending war with Etruria but that war never materialized. Aemilius Mamercinus instead used his office to propose cutting the term of the censors from five years to eighteen months.,dataisbeautiful,clmvzgv,1,t5_2tk95

2232304,0,t1_cln9psn,That couldnt be any more wrong.  Lets go over the whole process. Lets say you want to protect wild horses This is an issue that was important to one of my friends who said the same thing as you about  years ago.Step  you register to vote.  When you register to vote you need to think long and hard about the party that you are joining.  Look at the last few elections and see where each partys main candidates stood on positions.  Align yourself with the party that you feel best represents you.  Maybe the republicans want to get rid of the land currently maintained by the government which could pose a threat to the wild horse population.  You would try to align yourself with the democrats who want to increase the reach of government in order to protect the wild horses.Step  Be active.  Every election year parties have caucuses.  At these caucuses they determine the partys planks for this upcoming election.  Issues that are very important to them.  By participating in this step you can help shape which direction the candidate you choose is going to go.  Now not every issue is going to be brought up and not every candidate is going to agree with every plank.  This is also your opportunity to bring up the Wild Horse issue to the people who will be running for office.  Express that you are very interested in this issue and it will be a driving force behind your vote.  The party will likely ignore the issue but the candidates will not.  You will have an opportunity to speak with the candidates and can get their real feelings about wild horses.Step  the primary.  This is the point where most people will agree you are choosing between  generic politicians from your party.  However there will be a candidate who aligns more with your views on important issues.  Lets take the state senate position.  You have  guy running who you have spoken to and connected with about wild horses.  You may have another guy running who says that it is a waste of our time and money to focus on the horses when the state is about to be declaring bankruptcy.  Maybe he wants to sell the land so that we can fund our schools better.  Bad luck happens and maybe the other guy wins the primary.  Well hopefully we can fight this in...Step  the campaign.  Call the opponent.  Let them know your feelings on this important issue.  Maybe the opponent hasnt aligned himself one way or the other and you can help persuade him that we need to protect these helpless animals.  There are other things we can do to generate funds for the state maybe we only sell land that isnt currently inhabited by horses.  The opponent or more like the intern of the opponent listens to your issue and raises it up the chain.  You start to fell listened to and you start to support the other partys candidate for this particular position.  You tell all of your friends clubmembers co workers anyone who will listen.  The republican that you werent going to vote for starts distinguishing himself from the democrat.Step  Voting II Revenge of the Ballot.  Its time for you to cast your vote and you have now found an important issue for you.  You have two candidates who disagree on how to handle said issue.  Even though the candidate your voting for doesnt care about some of your lesser issues maybe you dont care about corporate tax rate he does agree with you on this issue.  You vote for him and hopefully some of your coworkers and club members also vote for him.  He ends up winning.And thats how you save the horses.  Or how you make something really important help you.In  I worked for Rory Reid who was running for Governor here in Nevada.  He released a detailed education plan which amounted to giving schools more autonomy when it came to dealing with their budget and their hiringfiring decisions.  The opponent Brian Sandoval supported a different system and never gave out any real information.  I talked to many people who told me that it was just a generic politician but I was able to show them actual plans and show them things that made Rory stand out vs Brian Sandoval.  We still lost but in our partysystem the candidates are usually fairly different on key issues.And if theyre the same on a key issue for you think about the second most important and so on.  Both Rory and Brian were heavy antitax.  Both Rory and Brian were protechnology.  I mean there are a lot of similarities between people because at the end of the day they just want whats best.  However they had different strategies for how to get whats best.  I will be the first to admit that I am fully surprised by how well Brian Sandoval has handled the last  years and I early voted for him this time.,dataisbeautiful,clnkuwz,1,t5_2tk95
2235182,0,t1_clnx46u,right but the point that Im making is that its not clear whether or not the reason that war and illicit drug use are smaller than high blood pressure is because or is heavily influenced by the fact that high blood pressure impacts a larger population.Is it the risk that this poses to the average person that may or may not ever be exposed to the risk or is it risk that this poses to average person that is exposed to the risk.  Illicit drug use poses a profoundly small risk to my health given that I do not use illicit drugs.  But thats a pretty useless statistic for most purposes I think. Im more interested in the potential health risk that these things pose if and to what extent they exist in my life.,dataisbeautiful,clny1hv,0,t5_2tk95

2239640,0,t1_clohjs5,I know thats the point and I think I made that clear in a subsequent post that I knew that was the point but in practice his point is essentially disregardable because it never ever happens that way.The set of circumstances youre describing would involve a country with spectacular growth relative to other economies despite the fact that they have inferior legal infrastructure more corruption lousier banking etc.In short most of the things that make it easy to invest in a place are also the things that make it easy to grow a business in a place. So if you get wind that it takes  years to resolve legal grievances in Spain and  year in Germany you should take that as an extremely bad signal with regard to Spanish business in general and a correspondingly good signal with regard to German business.Not captured in all of the information he gave you is that Ill wager anything that the longer it takes to resolve insolvency the fewer pennies you get on the dollar as a creditor and the more you wind up losing as a debtor. Similarly while youre trying to resolve your legal grievance the business youve put money in has probably spent the four years imploding or doing something else dubious and the less likely you are to get that return you claimed even before we consider that international legal fees are insanely expensive.In short DCMs post is absolutely correct but its still baloney.,dataisbeautiful,cloifln,3,t5_2tk95

2448914,0,t3_2neget,A few things to add to the conversation.. you will never really know how many crimes are committed as some crime simply slips through the cracks. Some neighborhoods dont get patrolled a well as others ect. In this way what the graph is showing is a partial mix in my opinion of cultural indoctrination and systemic racism. Not all police racially profile but in order for there to be such a wide disparity some must. Another contributing factor in the racial disparity is as I said earlier cultural indoctrination. Growing up in a lower income household in a notsonice part of town isnt going to guarantee that you become a gangster but living in the hood listening to music about killing cops being consistently referred to as a thug or those people can all be contributing factors. I speak primarily to AfricanAmericans here but if youre looking for a good take on another race I suggest reading anything written by Sherman Alexie.. I would be interested to see what the races of the victims are. Ive heard that the mean racial congruence how many crimes committed by a race are against their own race is something like . If this is true then there should be a disproportionate amount of africanamerican victims as well. If there are not then youre looking at a racially charged system.

2585915,0,t1_cmw1u8m,I think you make an interesting argument but Im not sure that I agree with your conclusion that the recording industry and by extension the fashion advertising film and any other industry that needs to be hip is purposefully taking advantage of black people and cynically subverting traditional values for the sake of profit.  After reading your points I am more inclined to conclude that popular music fashion etc. usually comes from black culture and counterculture because people who most often buy into that sort of thing white uppermiddle class teenagers are usually not as exposed to black culture or counterculture as the people creating the music.  Record companies notice that white kids will enjoy the novelty and markets appropriately.  It is not so much as actively using black people but realizing there is a broad market for their music.Think about it  making black culture and counterculture hip for white kids makes sense.  White kids are inherently advantaged in American society.  If youre a goodlooking enough welloff enough white kid chances are you will see a reasonable amount of success in whatever industry you decide to go into.  There are not as many options for black people or mexican people or poor people so they turn to music and the arts.  The music they produce is novel for rich kids so it gets their attention.  Sure some level of cultural appropriation happens but I remain unconvinced that is a bad thing.  Im not sure anybody is right to complain when a subculture becomes popular and catches on in the mainstream.  Its the same reason why that super hipster you know listens to the superexperimental music even the other hipsters you know will not listen to  the music that is usually novel for most listeners is not novel to a super hipster because they have so much exposure to it.Sure hell and fuck are controversial.  But think about all the white noise these days.  Artists have to compete with an unprecedented amount of other entertainment and music options to get peoples attention.  Music has become more aggressive as a result.  There is even an interesting reaction to this reaction  now hyperminimalist music is coming into vogue like Rae Sremmurd although you could argue this has more to do with the increase popularity of electronic music and easy to remix music means more exposure... but thats another debate for another time.I agree with all the points you make.  At least not today I do not think there is any ill intention or evil on behalf of the record companies for popularizing music coming out of subcultures that typically do not get much attention in mainstream America.  There is money in novelty and record companies realize this.,dataisbeautiful,cmw47w4,11,t5_2tk95

2616507,0,t1_cn02ewt,I dont see it happening. Only if he gets fed up with his current team and carries them to  titles. People give Jordan  ok maybe  of the credit for his wins. Not that he doesnt deserve a lot of credit but he had an elite team. These days LeBron isnt given nearly as much credit and its held against him much more that he has good players on his team.   Honestly had LeBron won a title against the Spurs with the Cavs years ago hed probably had a much better chance. ,dataisbeautiful,cn046kh,1,t5_2tk95

Paid leave usually includes an aditional . loading extra pay above normal wage or salary. It is quite common for many businesses to close for two weeks over the Christmas to New Year period mid summer as schools are closed at that time for six weeks anyway.

The roads really do become gigantic oil slicks literally because long stretches of dry weather cause massive amounts of oil to collect in the roads cracks that are brought to the surface during a rainstorm.After about a week of significant rainfall there is a tremendous drop in road accidents in Los Angeles because the roads get all this oil drained out.

It is interesting to consider that taking a generation as  years  generations is all the way before WWII and is still before the immigration reforms of the s.  Also many Mexican immigrants really arent even though retain a predominantly Mexican culture and language because the treaty that ended the MexicanAmerican War not only delivered into American hands California Arizona New Mexico parts of Kansas Colorado Wyoming Utah Nevada and Texas but part of the unratified section that is kept in the spirit and historical realities allowed the people already living there to have the legal right of maintaining their language and culture mainly meaning Catholicism forever so even if they dont speakee their family may well have been here much much longer than yours.  Also not all immigrant groups shrink in that way.  The Irish for example have kept relatively steady birthrates in the US even before the First World War while the Jewish immigrants from Eastern Europe arguably the poorest and most isolated part of the immigrant population even including Chinese and African Slaves saw an increase at least during the late th century of child birth such that Jewish mothers have more children on average than the stereotypical Mexican or Irishwoman yet are also in a much higher income bracket on average and also much older an average of  years older than the average Mexican.      ,dataisbeautiful,cngl25u,1,t5_2tk95

There would be some people that had no representatives within a very large area and would never go there but the representatives would still be making decisions for them.Facetoface contact with representatives isnt very important. If I have a question I send an email instead of going over and sitting in the waiting room until they have time. I dont see how this meaningfully influences the quality of the representation.Representatives of expansive areas can make up for it by doing a monthly tour of their district although I bet theyll stop doing it that often simply because there will hardly be any people that show up....,dataisbeautiful,cnqw0qe,1,t5_2tk95

My specialization is numerical optimization of PDEconstrained physical systems. Ive been fortunate enough to work with colleagues and advisors who have the Nobelanalogue for our field NSF Lifetime Achievement Award. Does that make me or those people I worked with qualified enough to conduct research in climate change? No. It only makes us qualified to do research in whatever field we have specialized in.The same applies to this team at Berkeley Earth. None of those people are climate experts. Their academic achievements and degrees are all for different specializations. But you know I wouldnt even care about the fact that these guys are working outside of their field if they had actually submitted their work for peerreviewed publication. They havent. Nothing that Berkeley Earth has produced has been academically reviewed and validated by the experts in the field. They have completely sidestepped this crucial process. So why should I have academic confidence in their findings?If you want to blindly trust work produced about climate science by people who arent specialized in climate science then thats great for you.

Nevada saw some huge increases in housing prices in the decade heading up to the Great Recession and for various reasons around this saw a lot of housing built on spec and as investments. Which means lots of empty houses. This is fine with prices keep going up and there are people willing to invest in a home they dont want to live in. When prices started going down there was a huge glut in the markets in Nevada and the spiral down was even quicker than the one going up.This is what truly devastated the economy in Nevada.

2906467,0,t3_2tf7ks,Background on me Im a design engineer for a crane manufacturing company. I travel fairly regularly to our manufacturing facility to do testing. The facility is in Eastern Time and I live in Central Time. I actually show up around  but I dont change the time on my computer so it appears like I arrive around . I created the spreadsheet and chart with Excel to track my hours because I could. I created a macro that inserts the current time to the second into my selected cell I recently learned about ctrlshift to insert time but that doesnt do seconds so not what I want. Formulas and conditional formatting arent terribly complicated but make everything easier i.e. checks week day to sum hours and separate weekends. I have two more macros that run Goal Seek to find when I can leave for  hours days and  hour weeks. I dont actually report these numbers to anyone since I am salary and do my job well enough. All calculations include  hour days for vacation and holidays  days hrs total. Times are mostly accurate to within a few seconds it depends on how fast I put my stuff down and load the sheet. A few days Ive guessed so overall time is correct to within a few minutes. High spikes on Time out are when Im traveling and low spikes are due to in order sick snow network outage and vacation half day x.  I moved closer to work in midOctober but kept the same morning schedule so my arrival times became earlier and more consistent. Average hrsday .  Average hrsday travel .  Average hrsday home .  Average hrswk .  Average hrswk travel .  Average hrswk home .Average lunch break . min totals  Hours worked .  Hours eating lunch . . of my day  Days worked including vacation and holidays   Days spent at manufacturing facility  .travel includes only days that I show up early. I typically spend  or  days at the facility per week when I go.This sheet could be shared if anyone wants it but I havent put in the time to figure out how to do that well. If requested I could set up a blank file to share over the next few days.Excel sheet Some values in column F were modified. Any rows without data are clean and can be used. Macros ctrlq insert current time ctrle Goal Seek any value in column F to determine time out for  hour day ctrlm Goal Seek value in column G to determine time out in same row for  hour week. There are formulas in column G but I used cell formatting to not show value unless it is Friday.edit formatting added sheet,dataisbeautiful,cnyh03l,62,t5_2tk95
2908200,0,t1_cnyjre9,If you search there have been similar observations before although usually there seem to be more on weekends and it has been theorized that less background noise from human activities means more earthquakes can be detected.It could also be an effect from having a single large swarm that happened to occur on a Tuesday into Wednesday as the record is relatively short  if you looked at a year instead of  days it might even out.Or it could be because the OP used the  days previous data from sometime yesterday Thursday which would mean you are looking at data for  Tuesdays  Wednesdays .ish Thursdays depending on what time they did it  Fridays  Saturdays  Sundays and .ish Mondays again depending on what time they did it.

Using your senses has nothing to do with science your senses can fool you.  That is why you need a method of testing hypotheses by attempting to falsify them which is known as the scientific method.Peer review doesnt necessarily imply ties to a university or being published in any specific set of journals.  It just means that you are publishing the results of your experiments for scrutiny so that others can attempt to replicate them.  Scientific knowledge could not move forward without peer review without it there would be no reliable way to judge the validity of one scientific argument versus another because no one would be able to independently verify the results of a given experiment.,dataisbeautiful,co1j6zp,5,t5_2tk95

2942345,0,t3_2tuq0s,So have you looked into that whole arbitrary subset of posts vs. rest of posts thing I mentioned the last time you did this? Quote from last timegtI wonder if the relative volume of the posts plays a role here. Presumably OC posts are a small fraction of all reddit posts meaning that the nonOC post category has a ton of junk posts that bring down the average.gtFor example what if we compared the average score of DIB posts vs. the average score of the rest of reddit posts? Or the average score of any arbitrary subset of posts vs. the rest? Can we take a quick look at a few subsets just to make sure that relative volume isnt the real factor?The same issue applies here The volume of posts starting with so is very small compared to the rest of the posts on reddit.I really think you really need to address this issue before you can continue making these claims that some subset of posts does better than the rest of posts on reddit.Edit  OP created a useful chart to compare the distributions of the data. Here is the chart This chart is partly why I argue that the results OP is showing are spurious and caused by the relative density of the data hes comparing. Particularly take note that the medians are not that different at all suggesting that the difference in means are likely caused by the rare outlier posts that receive thousands of upvotes.Ill have more of my own results to back this claim up in a little bit.Edit  Here are the results of some arbitrary comparisons that I chose looking at a data set of all reddit posts from August .Comparison|Subset average score  error|Remainder average score  error|Subset sample size|Remainder sample size||||Post title starting with I vs. remainder|.  .|.  .||Posts to rpics vs. remainder|.  |.  .||Posts to gfycat.com domain vs. remainder|.  |.  .||Posts to businessinsider.com domain vs. remainder|.  .|  .||Random  of posts vs. remainder|.  .|.  .||Taking nearly any arbitrary nonrandom subset of posts on reddit and comparing their average score to the average score of the rest of posts on reddit almost always results in the subset having the higher average.This further tells us that the results that OP posted here are spurious theres something else causing these subsets to have a higher average and its probably not the fact that the post title started with so or that they were posted to rpics etc.Edit  Something occurred to me last night that might explain all of these x type of post does better than the rest of posts on reddit findings What if its the fact that the subset looked at are primarily image posts? Its fairly wellknown that images GIFs gfycat etc. do better on average than nonimage posts on reddit. What if posts starting with so are more likely to be image posts?

Also I own a jcw.Isnt the carbon buildup is a direct injection issue and not a Mini only issue? You have to have it maintained. Seems like the remedy is walnut blasting the valves periodically.Heres my c on Mini s after a year of ownership. Yes they need maintenance. Yes they need repairs. Yes that turbo . has its share of issues. Its worth it to me. I know what Im getting into and am willing to pay for the thrills. I also follow the maintenance schedule like its still free. Im eyes wide open and this is probably my favorite car thus far. Also if I didnt have this I would probably own an old M or something with super car like repair costs so the Mini doesnt seem too bad to me.

3074510,0,t1_cognkbx,gt Your argument boils down to the policy in the USA should be based on what benefits your extremely minority position and screw the millions of American workers who get zero vacation days because they dont have the bargaining power to dictate a single thing to their employers.No my argument doesnt boil down to that.  In fact to say this requires that you ignore the number of posts that have already been posted that show that the average worker has about  weeks of vacation time despite it not being mandated.  People think theyre powerless and because of it they dont even try. So it doesnt appear to be a large segment who doesnt have this.Note Im not speaking about myself in any of this as I said elsewhere I have vacation days and I have less than average as compared to others in the US.When you have to assume that Im being a selfish asshole in my debate sit back and just not make that assumption.  In fact when you start to assume that the other person in a debate is doing so due to nefarious reasons of any sort sit back and just not make that assumption.  Its almost never the case.Now that thats out of the way hopefully we can move past you assuming that Im just a selfish asshole. On this issue and minimum wage the fact that unskilled work tends to be part time and a number of other issues that affect the bottom of the barrel workers the problem is largely related to a lack of negotiating power.  Instead of putting a bandage over all of the symptoms of this problem using methods that go against the core idea of a free nation my stance is that we should attack the disease itself.  A universal minimum income would make this a moot issue.  All workers would then have the power to just tell an employer to fuck off if they refused to negotiate with them as theyd be sure that they arent going to just die if they leave the company.  Sadly everyone seems to line up for the bandaids that cause more issues in the long run such as increased parttime work but decreased fulltime rather than the cure that should cause less issues than it resolves.,dataisbeautiful,cogo5wn,3,t5_2tk95

This post was cross linked to a more religious sub without any bad intentions. Unfortunately however this greatly skewed my results. Noticing that a great number of respondents after the crosspost were choosing the neveronly when options I used a random number generator to keep the proportion of neveronly when options the same as the previous responses.. I then compared the gender breakdown and results to the first and last question and finding that they were very similar to the original group of responses before the crosspost kept my data manipulation. Here is the unmodified summary report  . I find it interesting that the socioeconomic statusmaternal health and adoption qualifier added  a piece and that the late term abortion qualifier added nearly . On the other hand there was almost no difference regardless of whether one used a contraceptive or not. . The option for all circumstances not including lateterm abortions unless there is a medical issue was not included at first until someone pointed it out which probably explains the wedge between it and the not including late term abortion option.  . There are many improvements I can make to this survey in the future. For one wordiness.  could have been check boxes if I was more wise. I could have also easily accounted for unusual responses with a simple religionpolitical ideology control. Another thing Im interested in considering is peoples opinions on financial abortion but thats for another survey . Generated using google spreadsheets.

Our justice system has taken on a quality of mass production due to the high volume of cases and low volume of lawyers judges and judicial administration. The result is that public defenders very frequently plea bargain with prosecuting attorneys almost regardless of the evidence. This becomes particularly problematic with drug crimes and charges of conspiracy where informants will inform on anyone and everyone to reduce their sentences. Often innocent people get caught up in such cases and if they are too poor to afford a lawyer not at all uncommon in these types of cases they rely on public defenders that essentially pressure them to agree to a plea deal or simply offer a plea deal without even consulting with the defendant. ,dataisbeautiful,cp2aso2,31,t5_2tk95

They really are outstanding.  The world is much more compassionate than it has ever been and theres just no way to deny that. Things that were commonplace not long ago are considered unacceptable horrors today. In the s no one would have even known that there was an Ebola outbreak in Africa. You see all these bad things in the news now and it makes you think things are getting worse are headed for disaster. But thats not an increase in occurrences of horror. Its an increase in the amount of information available. Violent death rates are in steep and steady decline across the world. Even among the poorest people. Famine is in decline. Epidemics are in decline. The world is safer now than its ever been. Even for the poorest people in the world. When I say its a great time to be alive I mean across the board. The reason Americans contracted Ebola is because they were there trying to help. Thats extraordinary compassion. Theres international outrage about the treatment of women around the world. This is not something people used to care much about. That doesnt mean things were better before it just means you wouldnt have heard about it before. When in history were people more compassionate? Saying just watch the news belies availability bias. Instead look at actual data. Poor people are getting richer and their lives are getting longer. Theyre getting more food. Theyre experiencing less war. Theyre experiencing less disease. Theyre getting more sanitation. These are all really good things.

3333333,0,t1_cp87f9g,In the way its being presented there yes it exists in the way its constantly talked about women being purposefully paid less than men like youre currently trying to imply then its complete fantasy.Just because something is parroted enough doesnt mean it has any real basis in reality or any actual meaning.The way the articles show it is just not even a remotely useful way of comparing wages  its adding up ALL male fulltime wages and ALL female fulltime wages and saying Men make more money overall so its a problem.There have been numerous studies that look at the wage gap in depth and if you account for the fact that men work more hours on average men work a lot more overtime on average and men tend to work riskier jobs than their female counterparts among many other factors then it quite clearly shows that there is no discriminatory wage gap and the differences are purely down to job choices.The gap as it is exists because there are differences in hours worked type of work field of work education tenure etc.If women are working less if they are working in less lucrative fields and if they arent doing a lot of overtime compared to men then of course they are going to earn less money.I dont understand how people can on one hand say that they want women to have the freedom to do what they want and then on the other hand complain that women are going into lesser paying fields that they WANT to do and act as if its an issue.The only way to fix the issue is to round up women into some sort of internment camp and force them into working hrsw STEM jobs against their will.There are studies that show that women arent less likely to get into certain fields and that they actively choose to go into lesser paying fields for a better worklife balance etc.There is a good paper called Do Women Choose Different Jobs from Men? Mechanisms of Application Segregation in the Market for Managerial Workers but I cant find a full copy of that paper at the moment behind a paywall you can see their conclusion in the abstract though.Source I find this topic particularly interesting and one of my favourite people to read is Christina Hoff Sommers a former Philosophy professor who focuses on contemporary feminism in the US she talks a lot about how feminism is moving away from what she terms equity feminism and towards gender feminism people are just simply refusing to accept that men and women can be equal but fundamentally different.Source This is a good read and normally once you started reading the sources too you end up going down the rabbit hole for a few hours.The reason the gender pay gap is oft parroted by feminists is because its an opportunity to sow division and try and imply that women are being treated unfairly in the workplace by allegedly receiving less pay but the reality of the situation is quite different.The gap is nothing more than a symptom of the choices people want to make and its not something that can be fixed without either forcing men into lesser paid jobs or forcing women into higher paying jobs.,dataisbeautiful,cp885a1,10,t5_2tk95

More recently gains in fuel efficiency have made it possible for airlines to serve essentially any citypair on the planet with direct air service as long as the market exists for it. Seth Kadish made this map illustrating the twenty longest routes with regular passenger service in the world today. Strikingly four of the top  and six of the top  involve the relatively small city of Dubai in the United Arab Emirates with nearby Doha Qatar accounting for several more entries on the list. These Gulf states have invested heavily in building up their own national airlines to connect themselves to the global centers of commerce and the airlines that have resulted are now transforming the aviation industry with low labor costs and a high standard of service.Data Source  Visualized by Seth Kadish,dataisbeautiful,cphx9de,1,t5_2tk95

You want empty RAM so you can load up more software into it as needed whenever you want without leaking over to your page file. Thats the purpose of RAM. If your RAM is  full then you dont have enough RAM unless you enjoy taking performance hits. RAM is more comparable to HDDSSD storage. If its full you need more space.Bloated software..........Yuck.Here is a good rule of thumb for the amount of RAM you need for a new system  bit more than the maximum that you would regularly need on that system.

Ambulancesemts Instead of untrained police officers arriving to take you tp the hospital an ambulence takes you to the hospital allowing you to receive care in the critical minutes immediately after help arrives. More recently you are more likely to receive effective care soon after traumathis is thanks in large part to better access to ambulances better care available in ambulences and better training for emts.  Advances in medical technology Once you get to the hospital you are far more likely to survive. This is true because of significant advances in medical technologies which make formerly fatal injuries treatable and recoverable. tldr  you can call for help wherever you are  you wont bleed outcrash on the way to the hospital  and you wont die nearly as often from knifegunshot wounds.EDIT This means that successful murders have dropped significantly. To round out my point  just because one type of crime decreases doesnt mean the overall aggregate crime rate however you calculate that drops. In this case I dont think you offer the reader the full picture unless you juxtapose murder and attempted murder rates during the same time period. EDIT  Goodness I didnt even look at the sources when I made this comment. The sources on the linked webpage are also somewhat erm lacking. If I did not know otherwise I would assume that the data as well as the analyses originate with Quandl CNN UChicago. In fact the analyses represented come from a CNN report and UChicago paper and the data comes from an organization called the US Disaster Center as found on Quandl. Moreover each relies on the same UCR Uniform Crime Report data from the FBI. As an aside although I suppose youre not obligated to do so mentioning even in brief the problems relying on the UCR raises would lend credibility and a bit of professionalism to the writing. But more to my pointI find this method of citation  namely using three words  negligent inappropriate and unrepresentative. It is negligent because the list of sources does not make plain what content references what sources. Further it fails to mention that the data comes from the the US Disaster Center which in turn somehow uses the UCR. It is inappropriate both because it does not duly list the authors whose papers you are relying on and because you invoke CNN and UChicago as sources for both your analyses and your analyses as you apply them to your chosen dataset. Thus the casual reader is left with very little information indeed and what she might glean is in all likelihood incorrect.  ,dataisbeautiful,cpzro54,5,t5_2tk95

3620058,0,t1_cq4wpac,gt I wasnt referring to the united states but moreso the scandinavian countries such as Norway Denmark Finland and Sweden.And those systems will only work in Norway Denmark Finland and Sweden for demographic reasonsThey dont have the logisitical or demographic challenges the US has in the form of diverse population huge landmass huge population etcgt The northernEuropean welfare states that many American progressives embrace as their ideal were until very recently very homogeneous places. Norway for much of its modern history had a small minority population of Sami in the north a few immigrants from neighboring countries and approximately a thimbleful of immigrants from elsewhere. It was historically not a liberal society on the subject of immigration and integration Its policy toward the Sami was fornorskning or Norwegianization and its  constitution banned Jews from entering the country a provision revived after the events of . But enjoying an economic boom and fearing a population decline that would undermine its socialwelfare model Norway beginning in the s permitted an influx of jobseeking immigrants from Pakistan Morocco Turkey and Yugoslavia. The result of that experiment was a general ban on economic immigration enacted in  with an exception for a few coming from other Nordic countries. Norways experience with the cohort from the s and s has been problematic Their employment rate has dropped from  percent to less than  percent their dependency on welfare has increased. Subsequent nonNordic immigrants partly the result of chain migration from the first cohort are less likely to work earn much less money if they do and are more heavily dependent on welfare than their nativeborn counterparts. Trust in Norwegian political institutions is no surprise on the decline.    gt The resulting resentment makes problems worse. Tino Sanandaji the Kurdishborn Chicagotrained economist who serves as a fellow at Stockholms freemarket Research Institute of Industrial Economics and who of course is a National Review contributor finds that immigrants in Sweden are eager to work but unable to find jobs. International comparisons have shown that no other OECD country performs worse than Sweden in terms of integrating immigrants in the labor market he writes. The unemployment rate is  percent among immigrants compared to  percent among the native born. The explanation is hardly that immigrants enjoy being unemployed. Studies show that unemployed immigrants in Sweden search far more intensely for work than unemployed Swedes but often have their job applications ignored. Due to low employment rates  percent of welfare payments in Sweden in  went to immigrant households. In Sweden diversity is not their strength. Homogeneity is.    gt How much of this is social and how much is biological is unclear  as indeed are the boundaries between the social and the biological. But in political terms Swedens more liberal policy toward immigrants may be judged in no small part by the Stockholm riots of  whereas the much sterner Danish model has enjoyed more success with its active culturalintegration campaign its insistence on Danish cultural norms and practices and its emphasis on economic selfsupport. Though much remains to be seen there is evidence to suggest that the Nordic welfare state is something that only really works in a society that is  percent Norwegian Swedish or Danish.    gt The striking counterexample is the case of Japan which like s Norway is concerned about a demographic trend  a baby bust  that threatens to undermine its welfare state. But Japan is a very closed culture and the country historically has not been very open to immigrants. As Zeynep Tufekci notes Hundreds of thousands of ethnic Koreans who have been in Japan through multiple generations for example do not have Japanese citizenship and can only assimilate if they more or less give up their Korean identity. Professor Tufekci writes as if that were a selfevidently bad thing  as if Japans rejection of multiculturalism and its insistence upon its own cultural identity were inherently malevolent. Japan places a very high value on Japaneseness and there is no selfevident reason for believing that it is wrong to do so. There are real benefits to diversity  and there are real costs.     gt In the United States were more like the Swedes than the Japanese. And thats a problem or at least a potential problem. Our current political trajectory suggests that we are committed both to relatively high levels of immigration and to a larger and more active welfare state with many on the Left pursuing an explicitly Nordic model. It may be the case that these policies are mutually exclusive.,dataisbeautiful,cq4wvwq,1,t5_2tk95

3647090,0,t1_cq7x2vt,In regards to the companies took advantage of people with low wages thats not opinion. I grew up in an area with a very long mining history. I grew up learning what it was like to work in a mine preminimum wage and prelabor laws. In a nutshell wages were so low that people couldnt actually provide for their families they were forced to buy everything from the company store because they were only paid in company script they had to go in debt at the company store in order to provide for their families since their wages were low and company store prices were high. This prevented the employees from shopping around for a new higher paying job since they couldnt leave their current job without paying off their debt to the company store. The only way to make more money was to take a more dangerous job in the mine. At some jobs the life expectancy of the employee was only a few years. Children worked in the mines as well since their parents were desperate for more income. They were frequently injured often permanently and often killed as well. Children as young as two worked in the coal breakers picking the slag from the coal. They would usually return home with bloodied fingers. The coal barons of the time by contrast were extraordinarily wealthy. Most of their mansions still stand today in the area I grew up. After growing up knowing all the while that these were the conditions that all of my ancestors had to live in I am now a shocked as an adult that there are people who actually want to get rid of all of the regulation that put a stop to that kind of mistreatment of employees. I suppose that a lot of libertarians believe they would be a coal baron and not a miner so they arent worried at all about a possible return to that kind of free market. Others I think are unaware of these kinds of abuses that took place and have an unrealistically rosey picture of what a true free market economy would look like.

California is in a drought and there is simply no longer enough water available for us to run an industry which essentially ships our water overseas for private profit.Yea meat and dairy use a lot of water but at least were consuming it.

3734089,0,t1_cqhj6d7,General aviation planes use their registration as a callsign so the no callsign claim is bogus. And GBVJT is a Met police airplane. Compare this article with this registration info They also have a second Cessna F GTDSA registered to the same shell company. The F seems to be a preferred model for reconaissance as  of the  Fs in private hand are registered to Reconaissance Ventures Ltd. Also GBVJT was previously owned by Grantex Aviation a company claiming to provide aerial survey. Interestingly GBWLF a Cessna F which was owned by Nor Leasing from  to  ended up at Reconaissance Ventures via a Blom Aerofilms Ltd.That leads me to conclude that this plane is equipped for optical aerial survey and that at least back then this was part of Nor Leasings duties. Lots of RVLs planes were formerly registered to Atlantic Air Transport Ltd in Coventry but I couldnt find any more information on that one.It looks like all of the british Fs are former government or military planes equipped with radar you can take a look at the interior of one of them GCVXN also owned by an aerial surveillance business. GMAFA and GMAFB are privately operated by Directflight for maritime surveillance fisheries patrol while GSMMA and GSMMB are directly owned by the scottish fisheries patrol. The last F on the list GUKAL is registered to Aero Lease UK but the adressing scheme the practice of listing two business partners as owners and using a MBE for their post box is very similar to Nor Lease so I think this must be another covert police surveillance plane.Theres also a not very helpful FOIAA request about Nor Leasing hereIsnt it funny what kind of information  minutes of google can get you?

There was little to no law against it and laws are still mild from what I can tell. Even in corporate offices there were plenty pirate installations of Windows. What really made piracy go WAY down here in the last few years was much cheaper OEM Windows licenses  streaming services Spotify Netflix etc  Steam We still have a high rate of piracy but it will go down only by offering cheap legal ways to consume the products. Just making it harder to pirate or creating new laws wont stop nobody. Let me give you an example theres NO LEGAL WAY to watch Game of Thrones in Brazil without buying an HBO combo with hundreds of other channels that would cost about  BR  month which is almost half the minimum wage.

3769972,0,t3_33l5sq,This really oversimplifies a larger problem and attempts to defeat the concept of the wage gap with very selective data. Edit While I admit confirmation bias exists this graph needs more data. It makes assumptions based on a number issues while selectively looking at data. There a a number of studies on wage gap that show more extensive statistics. I dont think one infograph has the power to refute those extensive studies.  For example the graph claims that men and women gravitate towards different careers without considering why. It fails to consider the socialization of young girls and boys. Yes women tend to work in lowerpaying jobs. However men are pressured away from lowerpaying jobs while women are pressured towards them. Example Many male nurse are teased even though they are very capable and necessary individuals. You can make similar comparisons when it comes to race. Do black doctors and white doctors make the same amount? Typically yes. However black men and women typically face more obstacles in higher education making it more difficult to attain the skills to become a doctor. This is lacking data therefore it does not have the power to persuade me from previous studies I have read. ,dataisbeautiful,cqm061d,-1,t5_2tk95

Are you saying Im at this point allowed to tell you that it is not for you to decide how I feel about this?. And in fact there are men who dont fit into the rigid roles our society expects of them and they are absolutely entitled to live in a world where they can express themselves as they are as long as it poses no harm to anyone. The thing is no ones saying men are never slighted generalized or hurt by society at large. In fact they are and there are plenty of ways in which our gender norms negatively affect men. Every human being deserves to have their identity respected and deserves to be treated equally. However and this is an important however the reason mens rights movements dont and shouldnt receive much credibility is because they fail to recognize that while men may be slighted and worse off in various ways they are far and away the winners of the genetic lottery especially straight white men. From the moment males are born they are treated in subtle but noticeably different ways that encourage being vocal smart and active entrepreneurs. Whereas girls are encouraged to be pretty creative and caring mothers and wives. Though its slowly beginning to change societies historically have and continue to view men as the protectors and breadwinners of families and this path is paved and nurtured for them throughout their lives so that by adulthood theyre much more wellequipped to get the jobs that will put them in those positions. Without the help of progressive educators who see and encourage in women the same they see and encourage in men women are left to fight expectations. To constantly prove themselves as equal they have to be vocal and this is where the stigma of feminism comes into play. Education and upbringing notwithstanding theres also everything that has to do with sexualization and objectification of women as well. Rolling your eyes at this will do nothing to change the fact that it is absolutely true even in the most progressive of countries. The media is oversaturated with images that are meant to be pleasing to straight men. Again these things are thankfully starting to change but at a dishearteningly slow rate. They still exist everywhere. Now this next point is super important so please take it to heart. When hearing these types of claims about male privilege as a male its very easy and natural to react defensively. Of course you havent objectified women and you dont think of them as inferior. But the point is this isnt about you. This is about men at large in your country in the world throughout history. When considering the lives of others we need to be able to criticize our own communities without taking it personally. As a white person this has been my struggle in understanding issues of race. And as a male this has been my struggle understanding issues of gender. I wasnt always a feminist and like yourself found feminists to be overanalytical and needlessly angry. But when I was able to step back from the situation and remove my own self from the equation I was then able to see that yea as a whole men are a lot better off than women and yea as a whole white people are a lot better off than black people. And moreover it was the men and the white people that contributed to that inequality over time across populations systematically institutionally. And it was then as if a light bulb went off. I saw the invisible structure. I heard what these people were telling me and suddenly it wasnt exaggerations and nitpicking but it was their real lived experiences. Things they faced that were entirely out of their control for which there was no sane reason they had to face them. And then I was able to put myself back into the equation and ask myself what things I may have been unconsciously doing to contribute to that dynamic and found that it was a whole lot more than I realized. And I so wish more people were able to do that because then wed be a whole lot closer to that more equal world. And quite honestly what does it hurt? How could it possibly hurt you or any other human to sit back and listen to the problems of others accept that thats their lived experience and do something to change it? If nothing else it would make these people quieter about these issues and then there would be less ideological battles and things would just be a little bit better.,dataisbeautiful,cqmo8tv,2,t5_2tk95

So what is acceptable for an  year old might not be acceptable for a  year old. Yes culture and views are changing that fast.Sex before marriage is still a taboo among most people in the age group of  and above. So is partying and drinking for people above  something I dont drink but it aint a taboo for me. So my mom who is right now  would never be comfortable with me partying and having premartial sex. She grew up in a different era and would never be comfortable with me bringing in girls at home.And this is why I now live alone. I pay my own rent and she takes care of my education and helps me sometimes when I am broke. Now that I am alone I have the liberty to do whatever I want to. What time I want to come home when I want to study when I dont etc.So there clearly are advantages of moving out and in most cases especially here in the eastern part of the world moving out gives you the freedom that you need Though house owners are very very conservative and might interfere in your personal life at times.,dataisbeautiful,cqn1vv0,1,t5_2tk95

It has been proven time and time again that the death penalty does not deter people from crime.Execute a criminal and there is one less criminal and no chance of recidivism. Whereas you have millions of people in US jails which hasnt deterred crime either. Meanwhile they continue to commit crimes and violence against other prisoners while in jail.I dont think the death penalty is necessary because it deters crime however.

Britain of article  Paraguayan War sfw gtSome historians of the s and s claimed the Paraguayan War was caused by the pseudocolonial influence of the British   who needed a new source of cotton during the United States Civil War as the blockaded southern states had been their main cotton supplier.  But other historians dispute this claim of British influence saying there is no documentary evidence for it.   They note that although the British economy and commercial interests benefited from the war the UK government opposed it from the start. It believed that war damaged international commerce and disapproved of the secret clauses in the Treaty of the Triple Alliance Britain already was increasing imports of Egyptian cotton and did not need Paraguayan products.  Sir Edward Thornton the British Minister to the Argentine Republic personally supported the Triple Alliance he was present at the signing of a treaty of alliance between Brazil and Argentina on  June  in Puntas del Rosario. Journalist Jose Antonio Saraiva later declared this to be the real start of the alliance suggesting that the British interest catalyzed the other two nations to mobilize against Paraguay.   William Doria the UK Charg dAffairs for Paraguay who briefly acted for Thornton joined French and Italian diplomats in condemning Argentinas President Bartolom Mitre involvement in Uruguay. But when Thornton returned to the job in December  he threw his full backing behind Mitre. gtInteresting Joaquim Marques Lisboa Marquis of Tamandar | Paraguayan War casualties | Lus Alves de Lima e Silva Duke of Caxias | Battle of Cerro Cor Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcqysxu oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecqysxu.

While free speech advocates lined up to defend their rights most US Americans did not.The WBC is often a victim of government censorship. IIRC they finance their campaigns by suing whenever a government illegally denies an application for a march or protest. Theyre regularly targeted by private citizens for illegal harassment and sometimes physical violence.The WBCs content of speech is not defensible. Their right to speech is. Yet no one is going to stand up and give them free speech award despite the fact that they are pushing back against government censorship despite the fact that they perservere against harassment and violence.Hustler v. Falwell is a standard in free speech cases. Who lines up to praise Larry Flynt? Who gave him an award for defending our right to speak?I believe in Charlie Hebdos right to speech. France does not. France censored CH on various occassions often for antiSemetism but never for their vilest insults of Muslims and Arabs and Africans. So I will defend Charlie Hebdos right to speak I will speak out against Frances censorship and I will also say that CH shouldnt get an award for free speech because while one can defend the right while criticizing the content one cannot praise a groups exercise of that right while ignoring the content.,dataisbeautiful,cqz1jqg,118,t5_2tk95

3886756,0,t1_cqyz0h2,Ive been a huge opponent of these defenders of free speech who choose to practice free speech by doing something that they know is going to offend people potentially to the point where some people might get violent.  Its the adult equivalent of the kid who does something because he is told by others not to and it gives them a sense of power doing it.  My take on this is the same as my take on a person going into a bear pit after being told by others not to go into the bear pit because the bears will probably get pissed and rip their fucking faces off.  They have nothing at all to gain from going into the bear pit and yet for whatever reason they go into the bear pit because they get a rush from it and of course then get their faces ripped off.  Difference is nobody looks at the bears and says theyre evil.  They look at the person and say What an idiotic thing to do.In my opinion if someone draws a picture of Muhammad for the sake of freedom they are accepting the potential consequences one of which includes being killed.  If they want to position themselves to be martyrs for freedom good for them.  I myself will choose another battleground to fight for my first amendment rights.,dataisbeautiful,cqzbo4n,1,t5_2tk95

3889470,0,t1_cqzl5ei,Yep i didnt realize it up till my last comment our outlook on the issue differs because of our national differences. Freedom of speech is so engrained in the american culture that even when it is under attack there will be many to defend it. In europe its another story thats why i tend to overreact when i hear a story like this. In the UK for instance no news media has reproduced any of the controversial cartoons so you end up with dozens of articles talking about drawings that arent even shown even the non offensive ones. The UK has already given up the possibility to ever represent the prophet mohammed in any shape or form. So this self censorship is in effect a limit on what we can say based on the rule of a religion that most people dont follow.

3892932,0,t1_cr00e8s,Energy storage is driven by the prices of commodity battery technology and is itself commoditized with no brand preference for the customers buying batteries at scale. Theres never going to be huge profits selling that sort of basic infrastructure component. Nor does Tesla even capture all of the gains of the battery business since they needed so much outside investment to get the battery factory going.Their car business is the primary beneficiary of cheaper batteries because Tesla has a monopoly on selling Teslas. Even if the Nissan Leaf and the Model S scale similarly in economy as technology improves nobody wants to be the guy stuck with a Leaf.I suspect Tesla wants the broader energy storage market to expand to give economies of scale to their actually potentially profitable cars. No matter how you package them  cells by themselves dont justify their valuations.The side bonus of the packaged energy product is that it has given Tesla mindshare and positive connotations as part of the climate solution despite the current product being technically unremarkable and of zero environmental benefit.,dataisbeautiful,cr0114b,5,t5_2tk95
3893316,0,t1_cqzxfs4,The problem is from a business standpoint rather than engineering standpoint its a huge risk.Tesla beet everyone to market with an all electric car with a few hundred miles of range. However all the big automakers are catching up. Toyota VW GM the three biggest carmakers in the world all will have electric cars on the road today and will have comparable range in the coming years. Not to mention Ford Nissan Honda Fiat BMW Mercedes Renault Mitsubishi Citron and Kia also have electric cars available today with longer range models to come shortly.Tesla has not yet had a fully profitable year. It has had the market mostly to itself yet it still hasnt been able to make a profit. If VW or Toyota sized companies wanted to they could lose money on their electric cars for the next decade and they still wouldnt threaten the health of the company. All of them want an electric flagship none of them need it to be profitable.Tesla only exists because investors have faith in it. They make a good product but they are in a massively risky place as the market is about to be flooded with choice in electric cars.,dataisbeautiful,cr02lnt,10,t5_2tk95

The real value of the company has to grow so much before it can meet or exceed its valuation and produce a return for investers that it is simply unreasonable. Combined with its market share issues it is likely that any competitor which just crush it until it can be bought for cheap. ,dataisbeautiful,cr0f1j0,0,t5_2tk95

Or because I have to shove my way past chairs to get to the kitchen from the dining room because that room is too small?  Or because I only have one bathroom so all of us trying to get ready in the morning ends up with each of us stepping on each others feet?

Since the pan failed homeowners covered it. Would have cost  to repair asis or  to modernize and do some great upgrades. Since insurance covered the k we shelled out the  to modernize. The master bathroom is much much MUCH better now  its cleaner modern the shower is built better...it definitely upped the value of the home. So while it was  out of savings the leak saved us  in the long run since we wanted to upgrade that bathroom anyways. So now we have a nice bathroom and added value to our house which is already increasing in value at a good rate since we live in a nice area and bought from a desperate seller at the very bottom of the market. ,dataisbeautiful,csao9cl,5,t5_2tk95

4310723,0,t1_csbdwi0,Sorry bro. Gotta stop you there. The issue with black neighborhoods is systemic. Laws placed since the end of slavery have caused more black incarceration than there were slaves. This is NOT an issue of blacks just not being able to stop killing each other that is ludicrous. Police are given incentive to target poor black communities due to the money they receive from the federal government for drug arrests.Poor communities without education or job security lead to illegal activity as a means for income. Black or White. So as a black man in a poor community you can either starve or sell drugs to make a living. That being said the drug business is cut throat and violent as there is no regulation. Police therefore target these areas because their rate of success will be higher.In response to there being more poor whites than blacks. No shit. Whites are  of the population.The real issue is the lack of black representation in government to make real systemic change. To change the polices that create incentives for police to target these communities in George Bushs War on Drugs that was never successful and has never ended.What you fail to mention are the communities of black people that have the opportunities to make something of themselves. How when given the opportunity black people take them and in countless cases become greater than anyone else in their field.You are unable to grasp the true nature of treatment of blacks in this country. Most likely because you are not black and your reality is too far away from theirs. It is amazing everyone acts like black people want to live in the ghetto want to kill each other and want to live in ignorance and poverty for eternity. But just like like east African tribes cut off from the rest of the world this is all they know.You cannot tell me that their is equality between blacks and whites in this country. You cannot tell me that the school you went to offers the same education to black child in Baltimore or Chicagos ghettos. You cannot tell me that you and I with the same credentials will have the same opportunity at getting the same job we sought after. If you really are hungry for the truth here it is but unfortunately many people are unable to accept it. ,dataisbeautiful,csbjmmg,-1,t5_2tk95

4316567,0,t1_csc76k6,gt  All this chart illustrates does is clear up the gross misconception that white on black murders are rampant.Does it? Because the number is based on the per M of the murderers race I think it distorts things in a biased manner.  I think it would make more sense to base it per the number of the victims race.  That way you could say that a black person is more or less likely to be killed by a black person.Im having a hard time wrapping my head around what these numbers mean.,dataisbeautiful,csc7db0,10,t5_2tk95

They are all super nice to you because they are trying to make a good impression on you to draw you to the religion.  And I was disfellowshipped for  years because I had sex with my girlfriend a couple times.  I was shunned.  My sister didnt speak to me for  years.  All my friends I grew up with didnt speak to me.  The people at the congregation pretended like they didnt see me there.And this is not a stupid circlejerk.  The JWs are a cult that have ruined lives even if they dont seem that way on the outside.  As a Catholic what happens to you if you decide you no longer believe in Catholicism? Nothing.  Sure your priest might try to convince you in it or something but there are no consequences for leaving.  As a JW if you try to leave they will take away all your friends and family from you.  Even if you dont actually want to leave but just have a difference of opinion on a doctrinal point they will do the same.  They will tell your family to have nothing to do with you all the while telling them that its the loving thing to do.  You are not allowed to leave that religion without consequences and you are not allowed to believe anything other than what the leaders tell you to believe.

4595081,0,t1_ct9qobb,You are addressing things I didnt even say and then made this lofty claimgt facts around your own bias and narrative.TCPIP wasnt even the first protocol of its type and borrowed heavily from Xeroxs UP and CycWe had networking before the internet. We had packet switching before ARPANET  I dont think you understand what the term packet switching means in fundamental scientific sense because you keep repeating your little TCPIP blurbs.My original statement about ARPANET just being basically resources remains factual and correct. ARPANET succeeded almost literally because of the massive amount of hardware and other resources thrown into it  not because it was truly ground breaking stuff. ARPANET was an aggregate of theoretical knowledge and improvements on previous design work from other groups and scientists. Again it just had the money to carry everything out. gtARPANET and GPS were all designed for military needs first. ARPANET was not driven by the need for any military applicationgtThe ARPANET was not started to create a Command and Control System that would survive a nuclear attack as many now claim. To build such a system was clearly a major military need but it was not ARPAs mission to do this in fact we would have been severely criticized had we tried. Rather the ARPANET came out of our frustration that there were only a limited number of large powerful research computers in the country and that many research investigators who should have access to them were geographically separated from them. Charles Herzfeld ARPA DirectorThere was an academic and scientific need.gt Technology is often driven by need.That need still existed with or without DARPA. The military did not need to be given the funds. I am not sure why you think that equates to leaving it up to private corporations to fund the RnD. ARPA gave BBN the funds much like NASA will award contracts to say Lockheed Martin to research and build things. Their military affiliation is unnecessary. Its extremely telling you have to debase yourself into emotionally charged rhetoric with lofty claims about the other persons motivations and biases while throwing out ELIesque version of this history. Copying and pasting wikipedia articles with selective highlights isnt a very good way to comprehend history. Itd do you well to read this book Where Wizards Stay Up LateEDIT You calling me biased given your submission history is extremely hilarious and hypocritical. ,dataisbeautiful,ct9svfz,0,t5_2tk95

4633869,0,t1_ctegssb,Almost exactly the same where I live only ATampT and Comcast are options. Comcast has better speeds but has data caps that kill some people I know in overages. I have ATampTs DSL service which is awful. The package I have is standard phone and internet with speeds which if Im lucky might get up to . Mbps. I live in a suburban area and pay over a hundred dollars a month for bad service plus extra for them to ping my line and tell me nothing is wrong. The reason I call them to test the line is because my connection frequently goes below kbps! Then they try to tell me that its my WiFi router which by the way can handle two can handle two conections at  Mbps simultaneously not the problem. Then they say to use a speed test service to check my speed because they are doing something with a direct connection to the server and I do it and I might get . Mbps. They tell me that is within their tolerations I pay for . Mbps. They tell me it must be my router not the problem and that everything on their end is good so they cant help me any further because it is my problem. So we end the call and my speed might hit . Mbps the rest of the day not good but not as bad as below  Kbps. A lot of the times that I go below  Kbps is when their is something like a snow day for the schools in my area or any other time everybody is stuck at home with nothing else to do. I am pretty sure the reason my internet sucks is because ATampT has like one server for the whole state and if more than five people get on at the same time it cant handle it. But at least their might be a light at the end of the tunnel Google fiber is coming to a metro area near me and ATampT just laid a bunch of fiber in my neighborhood and the neighborhoods surrounding it.

With cordless phones though people would only pull a phone off the charger to answer a call then immediately charge it back up by putting it back on the base.With a wireless charger like that people are more likely to start charging whenever and stop charging whenever.

Whereas news agencies all pretend to be entirely unbiased and fair while being absolutely biased and unfair. This makes them feel duplicitous and untrustworthy.They are comedians yes but just because something is comedy does not make it untrustworthy.

The goal of the party is the implementation of its planks.. No one is talking about changing the makeup of the party.  Sanders opinions are popular with a majority of Americans at least from what I can tell and insanely popular among Democrats.gtThe majority of its voters may be more Iiberal and thereby ideologically closer to Sanders but the party itself is mostly concerned with winning over voters closer to the center.In terms of policy its hard to find more of a centrist than Bernie Sanders.  Now of course thats absurd according to the popular narrative that Silver repeated as truth but the reality is that when you look at popular support hes perfectly mainstream.gtThats why Silver says Sanders is too far left  he has additional appeal to liberal voters but it comes at the expense of moderate voters.Only moderate voters that havent actually paid any attention to what he actually thinks.,dataisbeautiful,ctt814v,-2,t5_2tk95

It doesnt take into account more important things like content sentence structure word frequency etc.   Theres no connection between a FleschKincaid score and an audiences comprehension of a speech. As Gabe Doyle a doctoral candidate in linguistics at UC San Diego wrote gtGeorge Klare all the way back in  pointed out that most studies have shown that listener comprehension is not significantly affected by readability values from FleschKincaid and similar tests.  These types of analysis are usually but not always driven by politics.

During the s television had a lot of great shows  like the reruns on Nick at Nite  where it had a level of class with I Love Lucy The Honeymooners and the Patty Duke Show.ss TV is when the cultural revolutions invaded wholesome TV and sparked all sorts of shows like LaughIn Threes Company and The Jeffersons.The Golden Age was probably between s and s where the culture from hippies to blaxploitation to drug use where a generation of youth could identify and act out scenes from these shows. Carried over to the s with MTV maybe thats the Silver Age but cablesatellite TV and the Internet would soon water down all the networks reaches.Now with the fact that the FCC looks for a payout vs. censorship or wholesome shows its a freetoall of bullshit reality shows and laughtrack comedies.

4892352,1,t1_cuatwaz,Do you know what else is true?  Women are not having babies anymore.  Western countries are below replacement rates for the population.  Social support systems are set up depending upon younger workers being numerous enough to care for the elderly.  Italian society is collapsing along with other western countries.Its perfectly OK to consider deferral of reproduction in favor of career to be a human right.  I dont have a problem with it.It is also true that it appears to be unsustainable and the societies which make this choice face collapse.  Western nations must import immigrant labor that does not share these social norms.  One of two things seems to be necessary displacement of the social norms or collapse of the society.Patriarchy isnt a conspiracy of oppression by men.  Its a natural result of the fact that societies whose women work instead of reproduce are supplanted by societies whose women reproduce.  You cant will away physical reality because it conflicts with your beliefs.The modern social arrangement is something we can enjoy briefly before society falls apart thanks to prior success residual wealth under a different system.  Patriarchy is the enabler of womens free choice like it or not.It is possible but not guaranteed that technology will alleviate these problems.  Artificial wombs could do it.  If we manage to extend life expectancy out many more decades it could be practical for a woman to have a family first then a career later.  None really make such a choice now because their working life postreproduction is too short to justify the investments in high end education.You will also find exacerbation of the already emerging trend of men disinterested in relationships.  Men are biologically more comfortable being on their own.  They have to be to have been successful hunters venturing out into wild and dangerous lands.  Likewise biological programming on aversge compels women towards relationships for happiness.I absolutely adore feminism because it has made vagina available without reciprocal obligation.  Im free to live my life without responsibility to society a wife or children and still satisfy sexual urges.  Its a happiness maximizing regime for me thank you feminism but hardly seems to be working for women.  I am honest enough to acknowledge that I am extracting my present happiness from future misery of all and present frustrations of women however.  Failure to allocate my own resources towards reproduction means fewer to share future burdens  an increased and less happy load for them to maintain any semblance of society.  Removal of responsibility and social roles has consequences that should at least be acknowledged and usually are not these days even if we decide to keep heading in the same direction.,dataisbeautiful,cub7xoy,1,t5_2tk95

But that money doesnt go nowhere and continues doing good things for you often more effectively when used collectively than individually You might be healthy and employed right now but there is a significant chance that someday you wont be likely for reasons entirely outside your control. Having a safety net to reduce the amount of catastrophe that that could be is valuable to you even if you havent used it yet. Individual savings dont address that risk as well. Even if it were realistic for everyone to keep a few million dollars sitting in the bank for the day they get cancer having that money sitting idle is doing little good for the economy overall. Economies are driven by money in motion not at rest and a healthy economy benefits you. Yes I understand that banks lend out their depositors funds but that has much more limited and inflexible effects than government spending can. A stable economy with guaranteed governmental backing allows for much more confident use of credit and investment which in turn makes the economy stronger. That improves your job prospects compensation lifestyle technological advancement etc. A big service that the government provides you is protecting your possessions and lifestyle without it some of those  million people who are worse off than you would choose to show up and take it away. And this doesnt just mean the first surface of things like police it means again a social safety net so that fewer people end up in such desperate poverty that they feel they have no choice but to survive via crime. This is not something you could accomplish yourself by just buying a gun or even hiring a private security company its deeper than that.Im certainly not saying that all government spending is unequivocally good.

And getting into an argument about whos occupation does the most is like arguing who has the most disfigured dick. A member of the military is less likely to die than many occupations but would you argue that they dont have a dangerous job because of that? Not really.There are simply things we cant take into account with statistics. Most people do not have to deal with criminals on a daily basis. Or worry about their customers pulling a gun on them. And yes police fatalities are down. But is that because their jobs are any less dangerous or theyre training harder and being more careful.

5068350,0,t1_cuwllc2,I dont think anyone has a problem with income inequality for exactly that reason. Some people are bound to end up with more.What people have a problem with is that the income inequality right now at least in the US is in a positive feedback loop  that is to say that the inequality is allowing people to create more inequality. For example do you ever wonder why its so hard to get roads and bridges fixed? We built those roads in harder times. Times when labor was expensive and equipment and materials were expensive and productivity was much less than it is right now. We have a hard time fixing these roads because we lowered the tax rate on businesses and individuals who profit the most from them. Now when people ask please can we fix the roads? the media turns it into a well heres a regressive tax do you want to pay it?. Of course people say no because THEY dont want to be taxed. They arent even being asked the right questions. Heavy commercial trucks do far far more damage to roads than commuters. So why are commuters being asked to foot the bill? Because people who own the trucks turn that profit into political will.,dataisbeautiful,cuwxejq,1,t5_2tk95

5499315,0,t1_cwek1xx,gtI think people hate on Quantum because theres not enough fantasy. Bond becomes a real person not a cardboard cutout the villan Dominic Greene is a realistic person based on banal evil rooted in reality.You can say the same thing about Casino Royale though. The craziest thing the villain there does is cause a disaster to make profit shorting stocks. Its essentially one man with very aggressive loan sharks trying to pay off gambling debts which is about as banal an evil as you can get. Additionally losing loved ones and going through torture is about as far removed as Bond has ever got from the standard cool secret agent fantasy. And yet no one hated on that. Why? Because while it could stand to lose a few minutes Casino Royale was a great film with an effective plot good writing and strong action scenes. As well as being a film with good ideas  it was a film with effective execution. QoS was a film with good ideas too but they were executed poorly.gtIf you told me before hand that Quantum was about Bond protecting water rights in Bolivia from exploitative first world capitalists then I would have never seen it. If you told me halfway through the film that Quantum was about protecting water rights in Bolivia from exploitative first world capitalists then Id have never believed because the plot was all over the place. Thats why there was such an issue with it it wasnt so much a plot as a sequence of events haphazardly thrown together. The writers strike really fucked that film over but it cant take all the blame because the direction was particularly weak too. It had a strong opening sequence but then went completely downhill from there writingwise plotwise and actionwise as none of the scenes ever really hit the high of the first scene.,dataisbeautiful,cwel896,2,t5_2tk95

5574198,0,t1_cwnyskh,Thats only part of the problem. Switzerland not being a EU member has extremely high tariffs on many everyday items food gas etc. which is understandable to a certain extent because due to their extremely high wages they would be even less competitive than they already are. However that only explains a couple percent of the mark up VAT is less than half of the average EU VAT. Their biggest problem if you want to call it that is that there is no real competition in the market. Groceries are a big issue there.  Basically the whole country is run by two major retailers who dont really hurt each other too much. Occasionally they will stage a price war on some few products but other than that thats it. A couple of German based discount supermarkets have recently entered the market but their market share is comparatively small. However the biggest problems is neither customs nor the retailers its the wholesellers. Try buying almost anything in bulk as a company and they will ask for significantly more as much as double or triple as they would if you were a German French or Italian company. Why does it work? First of all you cant as easily say fuck you Ill get it from another country theres  other EU states and somebody will eventually sell it to me for the regular price and even if you do theyll bully their foreign colleagues into not selling you stuff. Secondly the Swiss put up with it for too long so the system is well established and the government has either ignored the problem or in some rare instances helped the vendors with their system.In short youve got one or two major retailers that wont move an inch other than for show one or two suppliers who are basically running a monopoly on certain products the government looking the other way and the customer himself who will just pay the price out of shere convenience theres some occasinal nationalistic bs around too which I can understand for local products. Given the rise in online shopping things are slowly starting to fall apart though. Obviously the small independent retailers are the first ones to suffer and they are screaming their heads off.  Its kind of a get creative or fail situation. ,dataisbeautiful,cwo149h,1,t5_2tk95

However I think youre leaving out some very important nuances of football here.  . When the ball is spot players have to line up around the ball but it is moved off the spot before it is snapped by the Center.  . The spot of the ball is only important in plays where a first down is in question. So in any play where the first down marker is more than several yards off the spot of the ball is quite irrelevant as long as its close enough.  The percentage of plays where a detailed spot is needed is probably less than  in any game.  ,dataisbeautiful,cwoharc,1,t5_2tk95

And invariably the accidents all cluster around the same thing. Every time. Mile marker signs. Its amazing. Everyone just miraculously crashes at mile marker signs. It doesnt matter if they are on the curve or on a straight way or on a hill. Its like the mile marker signs are super magnets that pull people off the road or throw them into oncoming traffic. So this makes my job easy because we can just point to the data and suggest they take the mile marker signs down and it should solve all of their problems. Or at least it would force the state police to give us accurate data about where the crash actually occurred.gt thats so interesting thanks so much for your comment!,dataisbeautiful,cwole9z,6,t5_2tk95

5581828,0,t3_3rhcf0,I have officiated football and I know that officials spot the ball on yardlines when they can intentionally.  It makes it easier for everyone from players too officials statisticians and announcers. If a first down starts on the a yard line like the  or  no one cares but on a play for the line to gain first down line  it will be placed where the officials see the ball downed. This get more important as you approach the goal line. It is called a mechanic and it helps the officials administer the game in a quick manner. For example if the drive starts at the   yard line the chains are set not even with the lines. Officials determining positions on the play statisticians compute stats and anyone else involved know has to do a simple extra step and work out a fraction. It does not sound like much but this is a game viewed on live TV. It must go quick and be done right Also think about how silly the first down equipment would look placed on a half yard line. It is a better looking product of everything is all squared up for the camera. You may look at this and think it may not be fair but note that the officials do it for both teams in every game. No one gains an advantage. ,dataisbeautiful,cwoz7cv,5,t5_2tk95

5600296,0,t1_cwr3rbb,gt The only problem I have with this is that the green house gasses could be increasing due to increased warming.They are to at least some degree but its more of a positive feedback effect than the primary driver. For example warmer temperatures mean more decay and less freezing in boreal forests which are a pretty big carbon stock. As long as its frozen it doesnt end up in the atmosphere. Not so when it thaws and decays.There are a lot of interesting feedback loops with climate change though some of them are hard to quantify. For example more warming means less snow which has a high albedo reflects a lot of light energy so you get a positive feedback loop. It could also mean more evaporation and in turn more clouds which also have a high albedo so potentially negative feedback there. But then clouds can also absorb radiation from the earths surface preventing it from continuing out into space. Very complicated but very interesting.,dataisbeautiful,cwr9qk5,5,t5_2tk95

5664137,0,t1_cwz4peu,I agree completely that most people lie in between. I think reddit overall is kinda antigun but thats besides the point. I think the people who lie in between are often the problem they choose a side often out of ignorance or emotion or rhetoric and not facts or reason. Thats happens on both sides of the debate. The thing about jumping through hoops is that they just keep adding hoops. Like I said its been a slow erosion of the A. Further gun measures are going to have no affect on crime but they keep adding them because antigun rhetoric convinces a moderate majority that its necessary. And youre right its not a huge burden for me to wait for a background check to pass when I purchase my hunting rifles. It only costs me a  tax and a wait period to get certain specific types of rifles. Its annoying and burdensome especially because Im kinda poor but its not a huge roadblock. But it definitely does infringe on the explicit second amendment right to keep and bear arms. Lawabiding citizens shake their heads at the law but go through with their purchases until one day another hoop is added or the door is closed completely. Take recent NY regulations for example. Youve got thousands of lawabiding citizens happily shooting their fun guns and propping their choice of firearm in the corner of the bedroom in the rare occasion that a bump in the night becomes a real threat. Then overnight their rightfully purchased and lawfully owned method of self defense becomes illegal because another hoop was added. Try telling some of the farmers of upstate NY that those laws dont infringe on their rights. And this is a civil right were talking about here explicitly stated in the second amendment and broadly connected to the natural right to life. Last I checked those rights have no preclusions. They are rights if you are black or if you are poor or if you are stupid or if you have an odd sexual fetish. The right to free speech is not precluded though there are limitations on how you use that right just as there should be for bearing arms. You may recall the legal parable of yelling fire in a crowded theater. Rights should be taken away only after it is proven that those rights were used irresponsibly. These rights are derived from the natural rights and shouldnt be regulated away for any passing reason. Its not tinfoil hat territory when you tell a law abiding citizens that hoops stand in the way of protecting themselves and their family of exercising their rights. ,dataisbeautiful,cwz6wcp,2,t5_2tk95

5699289,0,t3_3t68a0,There is a primary cause of this  and thats the structural wastefulness of our medical system.However the longevity is not an appropriate comparison.  There are other things that cause death that have nothing to do with a failure in the quality of medical intervention.  Suicide and homicide and such.Now do we tend to spend more for equal or slightlybetter health outcomes?  Yeah we spend a lot more.  But heres the thing that massive amount of money floating around the system is what funds the development of new surgical techniques and new medical tools and devices and drugs.America is responsible for a supermajority of new medical procedures and devices and drugs.  Developing a new drug costs  Billion and  years to cover the cost of RampD and rigorous clinical trials not only for the new drug but for the other  that failed to pan out due to inefficacy or dangerous sideeffects.The rest of the world gets to buy Americas medical advances with a fewyear delay at most for retail price.  They dont see the bill for the development of all these things.  Everyone elses healthcare outcomes around the world is only comparable to Americas because of this.If you removed all Americansourced medical devices and drugs from the last  years from the world and removed all externallyderived devices and drugs from America and then tried to measure the health quality thered be no comparison.TlDR This is true though the . years doesnt really reflect the quality of health outcomes.  America does spend a lot more for the same or slightly better healthcare outcomes.  But thats because America subsidizes the worlds medical innovation.  If you removed Americas medical science influence from the rest of the world and viceversa Americas quality wouldnt decline much while the rest of the world would suffer a significant step downward.  Thats quality they didnt have to pay to achieve.,dataisbeautiful,cx3jvo4,-6,t5_2tk95

5745078,0,t1_cx97h4p,Oh yeah Im fully aware of how dangerous my dog actually was. But honestly it all ties back to the truck vs small car analogy. Short story parents were walking our two dogs leashed around our block. One is a retriever mix and really chill the other a large lb Colby pitbull who was very nice to humans but would often be sketched out by other dogs. We took him to the dog park a few times and he did good however. A neighboring golden retriever is unleashed and roaming the owners yard. He sprints to greet our dogs. My now late dog Chopper immediately grabs it by the neck afraid its running to bite my mom. A  second fight ensues and the golden gets away with a scratch. Owner threatens my foreign parents with all kinds of stuff while my dad is trying to catch a breath from all the adrenaline separating our big ass adopted dog. Officer shows up asks my parents what they were doing and my dad explained our dogs were leashed on the opposite side of the street and the guys dog just ran towards and got its ass kicked. The officer got clearly mad as fuck that an innocent dog was hurt at the neglect of its owner. And it wouldnt have been so serious if my dog wasnt so strong maybe? Who knows. He dismissed my parents and fined the owner after they said. But what if a smart car hit the dog instead of being attacked? It ran loose on the street its possible right? Easy to stop in time its a light car  maybe it wouldnt kill it. But what if a ford f hits the dog because it cant stop in time? Thats kinda what Im getting at one is always scarier than the other how do you regulate it fairly?Like where do you draw the line with what you can let people own? Some guns do more damage than other guns but theyre still guns right? The fear mongering has to stop and best we can do as people is educate eachother on how to handle these things. I think thats the best way to harm reduction in every aspect not just dog ownership. I miss my dog every day Id give a my money to have him back and Im sure a lot of responsible pitbull owners feel the same.

5747721,0,t1_cx98xcb,Honestly! And m sure Ill be downvoated but I truly believe they are trained to fear dogs of any breed when they become mail carriers. So what happens is they come to the door or fence or what have you and are frightened and the dogs since that feeling. All it takes is for one of them to lunge at the dog or do something offensive for the dog to feel its being threatened. I have personally owned  pit bulls several from the pound and some street rescued and one purchased from a breeder. I have never once had any issues with any of them. To say they are born violent and need to be trained to be none violent is absolute garbage. Dogs arent born mean they become mean when they are owned by bad people who train them to attack or hurt people or other animals.I have never do any extensive training aside from teaching them to sit and stay and chase after a ball and recently I trained one to sit pretty. So we are clear the last pit mix puppy I rescued from the streets here in Central Mexico It had a broken jaw from being kicked or hit so hard it had ticks and flees all over and had been surviving on crickets. The owner used to beat her and use food as a way to get her to come close so he could punish her. After all that she loves other people though she usually is not fond of being around them and absolutely loves other dogs. she is very timid and not very trusting especially of men I am a man but she has never been violent or aggressive in any way towards people or animals. Honestly I think mail carriers should spend more time learning to stay clear of places with aggressive dogs its not as though people with aggressive animals let them roam free and its not as though the mail carriers have an obligation to deliver the mail there if they feel threatened. The worst thing they could do is enter a situation like that with fear and try to intimidate the animal. Animals are not as rational as humans and are far more likely to attack when they feel threatened.   rant         ,dataisbeautiful,cx9k77d,1,t5_2tk95

Lets bear in mind after all that this was one of the crappy amendments pushed by the Republican legislature. Its also completely hypocritical that the amendment to increase the threshold to  passed with . I think that the idea of having a more republican government in the sense of using elected officials instead of citizen voting is only good if theyre competent and trustworthy but the government in Florida is one of the most corrupt and incompetent in the country in my opinion. Maybe medical marijuana will pass next year but in the two year interim people will continue face criminal penalties for the use of marijuana to treat debilitating even life threatening conditions against the will of  of the electorate. That strikes me as deeply immoral and inherently undemocratic. Finally if over  of the electorate supports one of the crappy amendments referred by the Republican legislature and its consistent with the US constitution then I genuinely believe it should be the law despite probably disagreeing with it personally.In this era of legislatures polluted by sophisticated gerrymandering and unregulated campaign finance the last thing we need is to limit crucial checks on government overreach. That said Im a huge fan of direct democracy and I think Switzerland is hugely interesting and worth emulating. I even like California despite the flaws it shares with the rest of the US.

Net income what the owner takes home will run be about  or about K. Nonmanagement payroll hourly will run about  of sales. Thats .So the owner is making  per year. And his hourly staff is costing  per year.If the hourly staff cost goes up by  say from  to hour then thats an extra  in payroll. Where does that come from? If he cannot raise prices then it comes from the owners salary which was  and would go to . Thats quite a hit. Otherwise the owner would need to raise prices on his  by  to make up that  increase in salary. Now you think well  thats small. Surely that wont sink the operation But if that  increase causes a  drop in sales then the owner is back to square one taking a  salary cut to Kyear and the restaurant will likely fold.And remember if the operation could have already raised prices by  then theres a very good chance they would have done it because that would have put an extra K in the owners pocket. Now you might say Well every restaurant will have to raise prices by  and thats true. But isnt it also true that raising the cost to eat out will cause people to eat out less? If prices go up  by  will people eat out  less? Probably. If they go up by  will people eat out  less?

This sort of stuff is not uncommon in India.What Im trying to say is that the Hindu nationalists as regressive as they may be dont go around blowing innocent people up. Its like comparing evangelists to Islamic terrorism. Both groups are shitheads but only one groups scares you enough to not make cartoons about them. There is a big difference In the degree of danger each poses. The Hindu nationalists like the RSS for example are strongly against evangelical conversions taking place in India through crooked ways paying off people to convert and misrepresenting the religion entirely. Not to mention the kind of hatred the evangelicals preach against idol  worshippers Hindus. So youll see fights break out between rightwing Hindus and the evangelicals. The RSS sees groups like the Americanfunded evangelicals and extreme Muslims as major threats to India and Hindus. They also tend to have regressive attitudes on menwomenhomosexualsetc like their Muslim and Christian counterparts. But their methods are not as extreme as those of the Maoist and Islamic terrorists. Hell the RSS is widely involved in charity and relief work as you can see from their recent work in the Chennai floods.So essentially while both groups have extremists and pose a threat to rationalist everywhere you have to admit that there is a degree of difference in how they operate and what methods they employ in achieving their goals.,dataisbeautiful,cxpngr4,6,t5_2tk95

5977239,0,t3_3x9zbr,Money doesnt actually tangibly exist in stasis. I know as an econ major this is blasphemy in my program but hear me out. Money is intangible because it lies within the margins of transactions both in terms of bidding and trading. Money isnt a thing its a function in motion. Money should only be thought of in terms of differentials but cash is counter intuitive to this idea. You never have a certain amount of money you hold a set of agreements constantly in motion. Economists argue that it is not in fact a zero sum game but supply is inflated by demand brains interpret from a set of stimuli but curiously the set of stimuli expand almost arbitrarily examples are random bubbles. We invent new money when our priorities shift particularly when our technology demands expansion of resource accumulationutilization. This basically guarantees by classical law of demandsupply that money will eventually become near worthless as our technological abilities expand and eventually the only form of scarcity to circumvent is time which could potentially be done by altering how our brains perceive time. Think about it as our technology expands demand for money decreases in direct proportion to how well modern technology deals with scarcity. In the medieval ages people worked downright near slave jobs to make just a few shillings now people work comfortably for the most part to live better than kings did then. The trend is clearly lowering money demand relative to technological progress. Which brings me back to the initial point. Money not being tangible. You never have a certain amount of money because value is arbitrarily optimized constantly. Money truly never sleeps because its us communicating. ,dataisbeautiful,cy35bav,1,t5_2tk95
5978565,0,t3_3x9zbr,If you mean money then an infinite amount. The central bank will just print out more or to be specific any bank that lends out money will just create more out of thin air when you go to lend some.If you mean actually then there is less than zero money in the world since there is always more debt than there is money. Since the central bank  the privately owned central bank I should say  sells the money to the state for interest theres always more interest than money thus always more debt than money.But thanks. These images are all you need to show people that the monetary system and capitalism itself are completely artificial entities played with by scumbags on Wall Street in order to use money to generate more money out of thin air. The derivatives bubble is so large it is many many times larger than the entire world economy and if it implodes the Earth instantly goes bankrupt and then some.

But if you want an ELIIf your goal is to maximize the expected value of your moneyIf your interest rate is below  you probably should just invest in a low fee SampP fund if you have time on your hands e.g.  years. If your interest rate is higher but less than . you are still expected to make more by investing in the SampP but the chances of that plan not working out is higher.  Interest rate above .? Pay off your loan first!I made the plots primarily to give people more data to make the decision. It will still depend on how much risk level people will take.

Which one abused their power more? The chart doesnt tell you.I dont think the chart is useless because its interesting to see the overall historical pattern and the fact that EOs are less common than they used to be in earlier decades  but aside from that it doesnt really tell you much in terms of violations especially in a comparative sense.

Why is it a good idea for people to be less educated?Its not but a degree doesnt imply that someone is better educated it suggests that they are better qualified and it isnt the only way to access either education or qualifications. Its also comparatively expensive..gtThe point of a degree should be to provide you with the knowledge to get an entry level job or be qualified to attend graduate school which will land you a better job.Given we are talking about the UK here we are talking about further education and that really isnt just about getting an entry level job its about learning things research and furthering your education. It may also be about getting access to graduate jobs or it could be about continuing your higher education too.. What it is will depend on the degree and on the person but a university degree and the k you end up spending on it isnt just about getting a slightly better paying job..gtWe dont need more plumbers or construction workers. We need programmers doctors and scientists engineers.We do need more plumbers and constriction workers and programmers certainly dont need a degree nor do some scientists and indeed some engineers and scientists.. gtNo way around having a college degree for this. And yes there are people who skip the degree and self teach themselves programming but its easier to get the degree and some places simply want to see one. Frankly the bachelors isnt even good enough to get jobs that I consider to be real jobs anymore which is a job that will break k in a few years.Well if you redefine job to mean something rather different from what most people would and suggest that an income level that only  of earners in the UK attain should be achievable in a few years directly after university you may be living in a bit of a fantasy land. Sure that may be attainable by you if you are very very lucky its well over twice the average salary of Cambridge or Oxford graduates for example..  but it isnt for the vast majority of people even those with very good degrees...Again its a path that might work for you but it isnt the only path and again there are plenty of options. ,dataisbeautiful,cywlww4,1,t5_2tk95

6254790,0,t3_4163m4,Ive always characterized it as this Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump both effectively channel populist anger with the status quo in different ways. Conservatives are upset by the direction of the country and are tired of a republican party base that they see as not doing enough to push the agenda in their direction. So Trump comes in and basically eviscerates everyone on both sides of the aisle responsible for the way things are and people love him for it. He is channeling their anger and their feelings like no other candidate is. Bernie Sanders on the other side is channeling the anger of exceptionally liberal Americans who are upset by the complacency and moderation of the current Democrat administration. They see Hillary as a continuation of the status quo but want more liberal change. Full socialized medicine no compromise with republicans huge tax hikes greater income redistribution. Ill also note that Sanders supports are overwhelmingly white republicans the educated liberal type rather than an urban democrat.Neither of them has an even fleeting grip on reality if they think their agenda is going to actually be enacted even if they were to take office and all of their supporters basically flaunt the political realities of the presidency. But the two are doing a strong job of channeling populist dissent with the status quo into political support.,dataisbeautiful,cz0lo0e,1,t5_2tk95

6274177,0,t1_cz2sh7w,Yeah absolutely. There was a good guide I used that went into the basics. I cant really get into it right now because Im at work but Ill reply again when I get home. Honestly its a bit of a balancing act between how much you want to provide and how safe you want to be. I chose a good happy medium between the two but its up to the individual to make an educated choice. NOTE  You can sidestep this all if you get another IP from your ISP and change your DNS to say something along the lines of Thisisatornode.mydomain.com. Generally people do a dns lookup see that and go fuck it and move on.EDIT Since people are asking here are the links that I used to set it up initially. I want to reiterate that running a tor exit node thats not configured properly can cause problems. So be careful and do research what you are doing carefully. That being said relay nodes are much safer and still help out the network greatly. So if you are unsure  run a relay.I can answer any questions if you are unclear. Here is the guide I used to set up the node on linux. I cant help much on windows  I used a raspberry pi you dont need a huge machine for this. Here is a good list of what to do if you want to run an exit node with minimal risk I used the first guide to set up a relay node. Once the node was up I opened up ports one by one until I had an exit policy that was fairly restrictive. I think  is probably the most important port you can open up as that lets people surf  sites. But take a look at point  of running an exit node link i posted above. You will want to research what each set of ports does open them and then monitor. Getting another IP may be overkill but I do highly recommend getting a domain name that lets people know that you are running an exit node.Edit  udrinkmorecodemore asked me to edit in a config file generator. I didnt know about this but its a useful tool.  ,dataisbeautiful,cz2sx6x,14,t5_2tk95

Okc doesnt answer the whys they merely provide the data showing that statistically black women have a lower success rate with Okc. The data does appear to suggest that statistically black women are less attractive but we cannot assume that because they have a lower response rate than other groups. For example it could suggest that black women only message a very narrow subset of people that are spoiled for choice. The data doesnt show who they message and it cant convey what that communication is like or how they are perceived by the people they message. There are cultural factors too that are way outside the scope of Okc. Perception can be a bitch. ,dataisbeautiful,cz577vo,21,t5_2tk95

6309746,0,t3_420mv4,As someone of a minority group I do want to share my views on this.I am glad that this is finally getting some exposure. For a long time we have ignored the strong prejudice against people of minority groups in the film industry. It is not just the Oscars nominations that get to me it is when films like Exodus are produced and all of the lead roles go to White Anglo actors and actresses. At some point I truly feel like Americans need to call out this strong prejudice that exists in the film industry to where minorities cannot even get cast for roles that are supposed to play. In Argo for example the man Ben Affleck played was actually Mexican in real life and same with Pain and Gain starring Mark Wahlberg and the Rock the man Mark Wahlberg played was a Hispanic man who did not look white in any way.When stuff like this happens I think it is important for us to bring attention to the issue at hand. The fact of the matter is the film industry just hates people of minority groups and the nature of casting acting and choosing roles allows them to get away with their racism. People of minority groups can be athletes because that relies on pure physical talent politicians because that relies on charisma and winning voters over or musicians because that relies on making good music that people love. Unfortunately acting is MOSTLY about looking the part before you can actually play the part. If casting directors specifically refuse to give roles to minorities they cant break into the film industry. It is sad that as America grows more diverse Hollywood grows whiter and whiter still embodying the white male as the only fit to get flattering lead roles.With the way things are going right now I highly doubt that the racism in the film industry will ever end. I just wish that Hollywood would stop promoting itself as liberal and progressive when it actually takes a sharp bladed knife and stabs it into the gut of so many people of minority groups. ,dataisbeautiful,cz6uimh,-3,t5_2tk95

6353480,0,t1_czbss2q, is what the rich paid during the biggest economic boom in history and it trended upward.gt How can you justify taking  of what someone earned just because they made something for them self? Do you really believe taking  of the  he makes is justifiable?Theoretically the vote means that society can take whatever it likes though it could be extreme. But by proxy it could be justified.Also your dad worked very hard  big whoop so did everyone else including those under him. There were still rich people and people still made lots of money and people still made it big. Society put him there and everyone else too. Having to put back into the very system that sustains you isnt some grand evil its called responsibility. A responsibility you are free to embrace or leave if one feels strongly enough. But to claim to be punishing success? Thats a bold lie or grossly misinformed at worst. By that reasoning paying your electric bill is punishing success because you cant use that money to improve yourself in another way. No one is stopping him or you or anyone else from being successful  but that success is not some mythical onemanonanislanddoinitmyself bullshit and it especially isnt having other taxpayers subsidize your dads business because he wont pay a living wage for example. Yeah the poor and middle class are absolutely subsidizing a business at that point because the people not making enough to live still have to eat and have a spot to sleep... and nothing is free. Instead of the business paying its fair share fair share being what the country decides it is see voting the joe schmoes of the world get to foot the bill. You best believe thats welfare!,dataisbeautiful,czbtjfd,-4,t5_2tk95
6353711,0,t1_czbpy5n,US is no longer a leader in creating useful pharmaceuticals. Countries like the UK are making more progress with less money because the goal is to save on costs by actually curing things rather than private funding for medications aimed at creating a product to make a lot of money.Government funded RampD for cost saving preemptive care and cures is far cheaper than making a dependency product especially when foreign drugs are cutting into that later business,dataisbeautiful,czbuhmp,-1,t5_2tk95
6353734,0,t1_czbukt5,gtDont quote me on it but as it has been laid out it would not be Medicare as we know it now.  It would completely replace the system and you wouldnt have to pay copays deductibles anything like that I dont think hes discussed prescription drugs yet unfortunately.  There would be no need for supplemental insurance because what you need would already be covered.    Having studied and worked on the legal side of the healthcare industry I definitely can see how single payer would be cheaper with greater coverage.  The current system is so unbelievably bloated and wasteful.  We have middle men on top of middle men dipping their hands into the system selling insurance equipment and services and adding little to no value into the final healthcare product.    Provider groups are getting bigger and bigger buying up small hospital and medical centers to get more clout against insurers.  Insurers fight back and costs get driven up on both ends.  The consumer ends up paying way more for subpar service.  Some areas even have to deal with merged hospital and insurance providers a situation where no one provides the checks and balances and costs for consumers go through the roof.    Providers get paid more when recommending certain tests for patients which leads to overuse of health care and higher costs.  Providers bill insurance companies outrageous sums for equipment and drugs because they know that some people wont be able to pay their bills and try to recoup the losses elsewhere.  The list goes on and on and on but I dont have time to keep going with it.    In a single payer system the government has a very strong bargaining chip and the power to keep costs down.  If you look at Medicare the government gets the best rates from providers by a long shot because Medicare is the top source of revenue and has huge leverage.  So now instead of the hospital and insurer bargaining back and forth until the cost of a saline bag is  the government can say to the hospital this saline bag cost you . to purchase.  We are going to reimburse you . for it to cover the costs of overhead.    People can access the services they need and not the services that will net the hospitals and insurance companies the most money.  Doctors can feel free to practice what is best for the patient not try to upsell them on getting an unnecessary MRI or CAT scan.  People begin to use preventative care because cost is no longer a huge factor this cuts waaay down on the costs associated with remedying a health situation after its reached a tipping point.    Sorry this post is getting out of hand now but I hope I gave you some idea of the waste involved in this industry.  Feel free to read a little more into it if you can it will outrage you.

Why do you think Germany and Europe still has American bases  Europe obviously relies on American presence as a deterrent.  Thats why they can afford so many social welfare programs if America bailed and went isolationist all that money would have to start shifting to defense. But America wont bail since it has an interest in maintaining its hegemonyFrom Some believe that basing U.S. troops in Europe is a Cold War anachronism but forward basing U.S. troops in Europe is just as important today as it was during the Cold War albeit for different reasons. The U.S. military presence in Europe helps to achieve American policy aims in the broader Eurasia and Middle East regions. From the Arctic to the Levant from the Maghreb to the Caucasus Europe is at one of the most important crossroads of the world. U.S. military bases in Europe provide American leaders with increased flexibility resilience and options in a dangerous world. The garrisons of American service personnel in Europe are no longer the fortresses of the Cold War but the forward operating bases of the st century.Americas Interests. A safe and secure Europe is in Americas financial interest. Regional security means economic viability. The economies of the  member states of the European Union along with the U.S. economy account for approximately half of the global economy.A relevant and strong NATO is also in Americas interest. U.S. forces play a major role in the capacity building of key European allies. This has huge benefits for the United States. In  the U.S. carried out  major multinational training exercises involving  troops from  countries in Europe. U.S. forces also help European allies to prepare for missions such as the one in Afghanistan. For example a Georgian infantry battalion is fighting alongside U.S. Marines in Helmand Province one of the most dangerous parts of Afghanistan. The more America trains its allies to carry out challenging missions the more they can share the burden.,dataisbeautiful,czu0uk8,4,t5_2tk95

WHILST true its not clear that the real difference is that in the  years between  kids and  kids only  and a half kids out of a hundred will not smoke when previously they would have.So what vox is really saying since the other difference are even more negligible is that theres a .

Its for the same reason Tesla is experimenting with Battery swap technology. Battery swapping might be difficult for cars but it isnt for mobile phones. I could have a capacitor in the phone thatll keep the phone alive just until I swap the drained battery with a fully charged one. That way I go from  to  battery life in seconds. The phone could still fastcharge wireless charge. This is just an additional way to charge the phone that I believe many people today will appreciate. And remember this is a mobile phone.

There definitely wont be enough money when they leave the country because of punitive taxes. Then of course there wont be jobs for all these free college graduates.

For example a given sample of three s versus a sample of   and  would have similar averages but the sample with the  would have the sample furthest right on an IQ bell curve.To explain these differences we need to explain why one sample is more normalized that the other. It could be for evolutionary reasons i.e. Its very very frequently asserted that women are more normative in genera than men because their selective pressure was towards normalcy whereas male selective pressure creates a more aberrant dataset.

I needed a holdover to wait until either Google backed down and restored support or the rest of the internet or at least the sites I cared about updated their sites to be compatible. Of course Firefox is the obvious choice but I dont really like it and right around the same time Opera had been getting some really great press for its popularity in developing countries for being streamlined and functional even on older hardware with spotty connections.

Given that your looking exclusively at the New York area M in  and the rest of the world B in  may not have this extremely cheap great tasting tap water Im not sure a global statement like the case against bottled water is valid unless you work for a marketing firm trying to drum up business for the NY municipal water service or whatever they call it in which case validity may not be your concern.The gym comment was directed towards someone damaging the spigot not the undersink filter.And the only takes seconds to fill is a false as well.  True the act itself may take a short period of time but unless the drill sargent is screaming to move along then people will talk while they wait.

Poor people understanding how hard it is to deal with people trying to take advantage of you solely for your money would result in better understanding.

It also operates as a lender of last resort and sets reserve requirements.gtIm sure theres some reason they dont force lower interest rates for consumersWhat do you mean by this? The fed indirectly lowers the interest rates through the process I mentioned. This is expansionary monetary policy. This lowers interest rates across the board. They cant force anything except the monetary base the money the fed injects into the system and reserve requirements.gtI think I lack the economics center in my brainYou need a decent amount of economics education just to understand the basics what the fed does and why and how it influences the economy. You arent alone. There is a significant amount of people out there who out of ignorance are afraid of the fed even many politicians who should know better.gtHeres a question  where does the fed get the money to buy bonds?The printing press. This is new money. The whole purpose is to inject new money into the economy to expand the monetary base.gtDoes the commercial bank decide how many bonds it offers and how much a bond is worth?The free market decides the price of the bonds collectively. The interest rate on bonds is basically the price. If there is more demand for them than supply interest rate increases if there is an excess supply of them but no one wants them interest on them increases so people are more attracted to them and buy them. This is just like any product. This is not the federal funds rate though.The federal government or any countrys government decides how many bonds it issues because bonds are government debt.

Engineering education training and use was often compartmentalized. In dealing with what the National Academy of Engineering calls the  Grand Challenges in the st Century we are going to need a more integrated instead of specialized type of engineer. That requires new types of training and pedagogic structures from preschool through college graduate and continuing education. This is largely in teaching engineering in particular as team projects based around tackling some of these wicked problems. This will make a generation of engineers that think more like those cargo culty Architects thanx uAgentX  and other designers who regularly synthesize across multiple fields.

Although from the programmers point of view something like selectionsort or bubblesort is very easy to implement.

So the logn of other sorts will be significantly smaller until you get close to sorting a list of  elements.Of course radix sorts comparisons arent pairwise comparisons between elements theyre comparisons to the number of states of the radix.

7040086,0,t3_4c1n25,The data here is beyond shitty. . The chart commits the ecological fallacy. It presumes some relationship among individuals from group averages. Consider how many things youd get wrong by doing this. For instance states with a higher African American e.g. Georgia Alabama Mississippi population are more likely to vote Republican. Is it accurate to say that black voters tend to favor Republicans.. The concept of general intelligence measurable by IQ is utter dribble. Intelligence is really a bunch of different things  e.g. ability to manipulate objects visually shortterm memory gray matter white matter etc. These skills do not always correlate either. . There is an obvious omitted variable. Countries that are less developed may often be both more religious and less good at standardized tests like this because it is less similar to the activities that most people do on a regular basis and because they have less access to schooling. . There are at the very least many cases of highly intelligent people that were also religious. Many important scientists e.g. Mendeleev were motivated precisely by the search for God in the universe. An unusual proportion of Nobel prize winners similarly are Jewish. Even if they are not personally religious many were at least raised in a community of faith. . Different religions have different relationships with science learning etc. Even among Christians for instance Pope John Paul II argued that there was no conflict between evolution and Catholicism while many evangelicals disagree. Highly religious Rastafarians and Muslims are probably doing very different things in their embrace of God.Atheism may or may not be correlated with intelligence but the data here is not convincing. In some respects I could see less intelligent people as being more likely to accept appeals to community values and authority. On the other hand belief in a higher power may also reflect capacity for imagination which is an important element of creativity.,dataisbeautiful,d1ecmkj,15,t5_2tk95

High end items will often get a huge number of bids.For example if I know Im going to buy a new television  and its going to cost me X amount at Best Buy but I have the possibility of paying XY on a penny auction site up to the X amount why wouldnt I go in and bid as much as I could?

But now those few crazy people can connect with the few crazy people in each and every community in the world.

We dont know which of those crazy people is listening to the ISIS propaganda and might do something nuts. That makes people afraid. Maybe even terrified.Justin Bourque could also be classified a terrorist but is that what you want? More people being classified as terrorists? The main reason he wasnt classified a terrorist was there wasnt any group claiming credit for his actions and saying that what he did was a good thing. ISIS while a fairly loose affiliation still has recognized leaders and those leaders claim credit for the actions of the crazy people and continue to encourage more crazy people to do more of those actions.

7306968,0,t3_4ffduk,I get that this phrasing is popular but I think the term birthday specially when attaching an incremental number to it really should be reserved for the living. So in my opinion th bday needs to be changed to anything like th anniversary of his birth. I get it. Saying th bday is basic and nobody is really going to consider the person is  years old however it is just a peeve of mine. Also technically  was his th birth year not birth day. So the minting was far more in honor of his birth year than a birth day. One more thing if your bday is your bday right after you die why isnt your bday your bday before you happen to be born. It is precisely the same day of the year. It really is the birth day which I guess need to just be a single single day and I guess birthday should really technically imply birth date minus the year. Though I suppose birthday could also just mean the day on the week. The additional I variety the extra down the rabbit hole and confused I get.

7334668,0,t3_4fsa3w,Sometimes I think stuff like this is one of those correlationimplied causation mistakes. For example Id bet that people who regularly attend the gym are more likely to have retirement savings accounts than people who regularly eat at McDonalds. Does this mean that gym attendance equates to better financial health or is it the much more obvious reason that people who mind their physical well being are more likely to do the same with their financial while the opposite is true for the McDonalds group? I realize we live in this very weird era where the academic zeitgeist is that were all the same and equal and things like race doesnt exist but thats the sort of thing more apt to be believed by some college kid who hasnt actually traveled to other places and experienced other cultures. People in different places can and will be very very different when it comes to certain stuff. I guess the point Im driving at here is that countries with chaotic roads that concomitantly have chaotic governments are that way because the majority of the people themselves arent particularly orderly by nature. Conversely countries with orderly roads that have orderly governments are a reflection of the very different nature of the people who make up that civilization. We are not all the same.  Our differences are what make us interesting but its kind of annoying when the conversation drifts off onto cultural performance type issues were supposed to pretend stuff that doesnt withstand empirical scrutiny. ,dataisbeautiful,d2bwgfw,1,t5_2tk95

7426779,0,t1_d2m9h93,Thats a good question. Only the bestbiggest universities have access to most journals and even then youll probably still come across some older or really obscure stuff you might not have access to.  Some journals are so specialized that only a handful of institutions really care about them so if they arent packaged into a bigger publishing deal they can get left behind. Many university libraries dont have great proxy access so you need to be on campus to get institutional access.  Lots of people like to do research at home or in coffee shops and scihub is really easy to use. Doctoral students finishing their dissertations often go on filing fees where you dont pay tuition.  It helps out your PI a bit basically.  Sometimes this means you lose access to institutional access through your login making you have to be on campus to get papers.The funny thing though is that I find scihub to be a better way to access the papers.  Starting from the ncbi page its very easy to get the DOI and get a paper right away.  The proper way often involves slowloading pages pdf links that are hard to find and pdfs that open in weird in page viewers that suck.Its all very much reminiscent of ValvesGabens piracy is a service problem.,dataisbeautiful,d2mdkyw,259,t5_2tk95

As for how you think Trump will behave in front of other world leaders I dont think that he will do that. No one knows how he will behave once he is president and the same goes for any other candidate. However its still a perfectly good reason to not support Trump and I respect it.Im not arguing against not liking Trump. His plans are ridiculous at times and he certainly follows his Art of the Deal book in starting with a big offer before going smaller. Hell I even disagree with things like him being prolife.

Republicans in the south are often so scared of being primaried if they try to take down these things. A small vocal minority of only one political party is keeping up symbols of enemies of the government.gt If I have a confederate flag and just see it as a symbol of the south youre telling me that I support the confederacy and slavery etc... when I dont at all. Thats you attributing your own beliefs to someone else. No it is not. It is me interpreting a symbol as it was intended to be interpreted! You would be the one trying to change the meaning. Confederate symbols were invented to symbolize support for the confederacy that is what they are meant for.Likewise I could take a flag with an intersecting yellow hammer and sickle on a red background and decide to just see it as a symbol of hardworking Nevada Farmers. That is not what the symbol was intended for though and you believing I am communist or support the Soviet Union is not your fault it is mine. I am using a symbol that was invented to symbolise communism and trying to pretend it means something completely different.The confederate flag was never a symbol of the south before the civil war. Nor was it a symbol of the whole south during the civil warWest Virginia being just one example of southerners who fought against that flag. Those symbols always meant by its creators as a symbol of the Confederacy and the values for which it stood.Saying that it is a symbol of the south is being either ignorant or disingenuous. Either way it is not me attributing my beliefs to someone else it is me interpreting a symbol as it was intended to be interpreted by its creators.

The data is taken from cso.ie and is represented in a way that each person who died that year from drowning represents  milliliter of water. The pitch of the wine glass changes with the amount of people that died so the more people that died means more water in the wine glass which creates a deeper pitch from the wine glass when played. The last glass to represent  remains empty as the statistics for that year are unknown.

It was just surreal.Also as I point out on other threads a lot of people taken split the check as a sign Lets just be friends. Edit Quite a few people ask me about the Asian dating site in PMs so let me explain. I used OKC for  years early years I actually met some nice girls even if it didnt work out however they eventually implemented an policy that only unattractive women obese are always shown on top unless you pay strangely okc algo also considered Asian women to be unattractive and didnt filter most of them.. I think that was somewhat unfair. Match.com was always shadythey expected  month upfront and they also expect us to pay to get the girl to Guarantee read the message which was also shady as hell. Plus Match.com will cheerfully lie to you a girl is  more like to reply to your message when that girl havent log in  years.My Mom put my profile on redbeans.com and suddenly I notice I was getting a lot of hits. So I brought an membership and suddenly in one month I was getting dinner dates acceptance more than I got a year from okc. I was meeting college students teachers fortune  financial analysts engineers and I eventually found a few great girls. Most of them were very good looking and very smart compared to the hits on okc.Now most of you will think I am a salesperson for rb. Not so. There are downsides It is not free obviously.  It technically only work in major Chinese enclaves in Cali or NYC. Most of the girls in Connecticut are just grad school girls from Yale. In areas with no Chinese concentration it is practically worthless. But at least the site wont hide those girls from you and pretend there is a million girls ready as long as you pay first. The distance algo is wonky. They will group the girlsguys by state but not city so you could find the date is actually couple hundred miles away.  The site does offer an English version for stats but a lot of girls have profile only in chinese. So this could make things tough for you. Especially for non Asiansbut then a lot of Match.comokc girls have profile explicitly say they will not date Asians. As you could tell from number  there are very few Japanese or Korean girls that are on this site and almost all the white girls are frauds stolen pics from Russia etc. And you need to be wary of Chinese girls msging from China as well.

The proper response is to try to understand the role of these factors. This is a valuable inquiry which leads to some of the data that ubrewstertherooster is pointing out. We might follow that up by inquiring into the reasons for the differences in the distribution of genders.That the graphic does not answer all the questions the initial inquiry leads to does not make it disingenuous. If there was some claim in the graphic as to the why there is a gap then yes that would be disingenuous. But there is not. So we should be using this to discuss the reasons instead of attacking the graphic for not completely answering the question. Good data viz spurs further inquiry. If data viz is required to completely answer all relevant questions we would have no data viz at all.If anything this one particular grouping is sloppy but not disingenuous. Unless you are suggesting that the creator of the graphic systematically chose each grouping of professions in order to maximize the gap?

Lets pick  compass directions from Due North NorthEast East and so forth.  Now we have  really tall bars and  really tiny ones.  Obviously if you arrange them clockwise from North  Tall Tall Tall Tall short short short short you will have almost a quarter of  a circle right?    look Ill just draw it    lt see?  The ones where the tall ones are next to each other obviously make a much larger area than when they alternate with the short ones....so actually I think that youre wrong and order does matter But anyway I think the proper solution is simply not to draw the connecting lines and just have them as points.

7715835,0,t1_d3j7w5n,Incorrect. Content sites get paid by advertisers based on things like showing an add and they get paid more if the user clicks on an ad. Content sites also get paid when they contract with a vendor to setup an ad campaign with defined goals. The money flows first through showing an ad aka an impression. If an ad blocker blocks the browser from downloading the ad then that ad impression one for each ad on a page is not registered and the content owner is not paid. In addition since the ad is not downloaded by the browser user certainly cant then click on it. Content sites make money in many ways and a primary way is through advertising. Forbes pays employees and freelancers to generate content. If someone views it without advertising Forbes makes no money from the user. Period. There is no measurable additional benefit from someone simply reading content and not also downloading ads. Now you might say A user can share that article and some number of people who dont have ad blockers will see it so Forbes still makes money  but youre reaching for straws and trying to justify why some should be able to read content for free sans ads. There is no way to ensure that a user who uses an ad blocker will share a post and no way to track it. Besides those same users will probably see the same story shared by many others on sites like Reddit Twitter FaceBook and so on. Its not like any particular user using an adblocker but sharing stories is going to move the needle.  Basically its lost revenue to Forbes or any other content owner and  blocking users with adblockers is losing nothing except freeloaders. Thats precisely what they want.What content owners using adblocking blockers hope will happen is that adblocking users like their content so much they will allow ads or pay for a subscription. That way the content site still makes money. ,dataisbeautiful,d3j8kc8,1,t5_2tk95

7749163,1,t1_d3mzxr8,I agree with the lack of scale. The OP of the original post mentioned that This data was averaged every  hours of play over the last  months. Which doesnt really tell me a lot tbh. I know that it has been collected over the course of  months but the actual playing time isnt mentioned so I left it out. I dont agree with wasting ink on the bars as they display the data. I agree that the quotes arent easily readable when the visualisation isnt at  size. Personally Id have liked to change their angle to a smaller value but this wasnt possible in the tool I used. I certainly dont agree at all with lots of chart junk. The grid lines help reading the data and I dont see any other unnecessary details.I agree that a label on the bars with the actual frequency would be nice couldnt do that in the tool I used though. Personally I prefer the horizontal ordering of the bars over a vertical one I think its easier to compare the bars that way.Edit ok somebody made it with a vertical order and convinced me that it would have been better If this would have been a serious visualisation I definitely would have put the source on the graph but I just wanted to show how the original one was a really bad way to present the data and not write an article about it.All in all I made this in about  minutes with an online tool which had limited functionality and for that I am satisfied with it.,dataisbeautiful,d3n0tnv,2,t5_2tk95

Fielding IBAs and IOTVs body armor undoubtedly saved thousands of lives  your flack jacket wasnt going to do jack against an incoming round. We reinvented the HMMWV using it in ways it was never meant to be used but safer nonetheless  and we fielded the MRAP to protect our troops from increasingly deadly IED attacks.While the number of troops killed in our recent conflicts is low we must keep in mind that we also took a number of measures to keep those casualties as low as possible.

You need a specific reputable citation to show this.Even if you manage to show it was used this way you have not shown that it is used this way.FWIW there are about . mg of Al in a childhood vaccine x more than the amount of Thiomersal  micrograms.   The amount of natural Al in the human body is  mg or maybe  mg in a lb infant much less than in a vaccine.  Human daily intake is  to  mg much less than one vaccine meaning Al is excreted rapidly.Im not going to bother responding to your Al claims because thats a whole new rabbithole of dubious science.  Im merely pointing out that your current claims are rubbish.   prove that thiomersal IS an adjuvant  prove that thiomersal exposure in those few vaccines that still have it is a significant source of Hg exposure compared to say tuna.You have still not addressed the point that the amount of mercury in a vaccine is about the same as in a can of tuna.  The tuna Hg is  absorbed and is the more dangerous methylmercury not ethyl.If you spend hours and hours posting about mercury in vaccines you should spend much more time posting about mercury in tuna because people usually eat tuna many times a year.Besides the discussion is pointless because Thiomersal is largely gone from vaccines.,dataisbeautiful,d3uvb2f,1,t5_2tk95

7880937,0,t3_4n94kb,I collected all of this data in hopes of guiding me towards finding a fair price both for the seller and me and to select the right mileage car. I had been tossing up the idea of paying more for a lower mileage car my budget was not very strictly limited but ultimately decided to buy one that was in great condition with k miles.Through my search I ended up personally checking x ss before I bought one. Anecdotally I did not feel like any of the asking prices were fair. All of the sellers that I met were willing to negotiate their price down between . Some sellers had a pretty close price to average and held close to their asking price and others were asking way over the trendline for what I felt was a poor condition vehicle. Thus this data should not be used to set a firm price for any of you buyers or sellers out there. This does not take the place of an accurate evaluation during your inspection or test drive. Instead please just use this data as extra information and guidance on your journey.I only collected data through Craigslist ads. The information that I could gather was only from what was available in the ad. There are many things left out from ads so I did what I could here. I collected data on the following variables Year I only considered AP cars at first but I later looked at AP for the communitys sake Mileage Ext. Color Asking Price Seller private vs. dealer Location sublocation only considered CA and nearby states Hardtop included or no hardtop Stock condition for this I had to make my own assessment of how close to stock the car was with a scale I want to make an important note on mileage and asking price  both of these variables should have significant binning which changes the validity of analysis. For example a person that has a car with k miles might advertise the car as approximately k miles. Or conversely someone with a car that has k miles may advertise it as less than k miles. Also I found that it was common to negate the last three digits. I can only record the value advertised. People do similar things with their asking price due to the expectation of a negotiation. This binning skews the data distribution. Besides mileage condition of the car would have to be the singlelargest effect on the price of the car. However I didnt have a good way to collect and evaluate any statistical significance. Im definitely not going to go take a personal look at  cars. I did take a look at  cars I was considering to buy and I will draw some anecdotal conclusions on that at the end. Here are some variables not considered Condition! again however I did leave out any obvious outliers like cars that werent running or salvage title cars Int.

Yes it turns out that when you control for every variable that produces income the effect goes away. But that assumes nothing is influencing those variables. For instance you could probably use the same approach to find that IQ has no effect on wages either! Its not IQ its choice of major college attended grades achieved etc. Its absurd when thought about that way right? Or you could go back to a time when women were clearly discriminated against and find a similar result when controlling for similar variables. Was there no discrimination ever? We dont know how sexism and gender differences affect incomes and these kinds of bad science studies do little to advance our understanding. Its lazy and very political and has no place in this sub. ,dataisbeautiful,d45jqhr,2,t5_2tk95

I have not researched this area much it is quite taboo to even suggest that transgender or homosexual individuals might have these behaviors as a result of a neurological issue but I am inclined to believe transgender behaviors are the result of psychological and neurological issues. That isnt to say I think transgender or homosexual behaviors are malicious or that these individuals dont deserve rights. I just think the issues of gender run deeper than we currently know and that the correlation of suicide and depression is probably caused by a set underlying factors yet to be investigated.Edit Because I am being downvoted for suggesting research on transgender individuals for being different and that idea makes people uncomfortable I am copypasting part of my response which includes research that shows there are at least some differences and more research should be conducted Wikipedia has a nice overview of some of the research. More specifically twin studies have demonstrated significant concordance rates among identical twins  for males  for females. There are findings of differences in brain structure and functioning between transgender and cisgender individuals including differences in white matter volume and neurotransmitter receptors Additionally there are also differences between heterosexual and homosexual individuals including in structure neurotransmitters and hormones,dataisbeautiful,d48ugem,-6,t5_2tk95

There are no certainties in science. There are statistics and probabilities. A lot of this is based on modeling and those models are always being refined.Youre linking an article on the BBC about one group of scientists and their modeling as if it is conclusive. It may or may not be.I think climate change is real and I think its manmade. I cannot conclusively say anything else and I might be wrong.That said there are things that we do know enough to do something about.

8185018,0,t1_d50l73l,I think Reddit certainly loves the circle jerking but I fly for work about  round trips per month. I usually have a layover in every direction so thats  planes I take every month. If I had to guess Id say I see an awkward situation take place about every  or  planes. I think there might be some people who dont travel often or they are first time flyers who dont know the size of the seats or they just dont give a shit about others and that can cause awkward situations. Ive had several occasions and witnessed plenty more where someone large sits next to me and we have to keep the armrest up for the entire duration of the flight because of their bodies spilling over into my seat. Im an introvert so I dont ever say anything but I dont particularly like having someones body up against mine on a plane for a couple of hours. I paid hundreds of dollars for a full seat and I expect my trips to be as comfortable as those planes allow them to be.

Its lazy because it is women.If you had seen the movie and there was something else fueling your hatred other than the fact that the stars are women then I would accept it as a legitimate opinion.

Not just the retaking of the Holy sites  though that was the religious justification for the Crusades the actual animosity between Christians and Muslims at the time was due to all the wars fought on Christian land.This video illustrates it fairly well with a comparison to the Crusades themselves.Sadly people tend to forget about history and assume the Crusaders were the bad guys.gtjust to avenge a few wars almost a thousand years ago?A large majority of the worlds population follows religious doctrine founded thousands of years ago.

8293235,0,t1_d5e7ezp,Islam and christianity are nothing alike. This is the most ridiculous comparison imaginable and heres why. First off those backwards beliefs dont come from christianity. They come from african culture and african religions and sometimes rarely carry over although thats not even true because christian missionaries are extremely motivated to stamp out heretical beliefs like voodoo.Violet and evil beliefs in islam are entirely rooted in islam. There is no remnant culture that believes these savage principles and the principles are unique to islam. The ideas about aids and witchcraft are not unique to christianity. Thats how you know the origins of the backwards beliefs are distinctly different.And its not developing countries. More people have joined ISIS from Britain than from anywhere else. Native britons who were muslim not uneducated immigrants. An ISIS terror cell was just arrested consisting of a doctor a nurse and a lawyer. Osama bin Laden was among the richest people in the world. Finally its not the most backward half. Its the majority. MOST muslims want to impose sharia on nonmuslims. MOST believe that attacks on noncombatants are justified. MOST have support for one terror group even if they dont support the others. These polls ask muslims do you support X terror group? and pretend that the small percentage of positive responses implies small support for all terror. Thats like asking people do you like the giants? and concluding that only giants fans like baseball. ,dataisbeautiful,d5e7pa5,2,t5_2tk95

Certain parts are still pretty confusing to me.The basic idea I get from it is that the .gov website if you just go through that will give you some insurance plans to pull from. If you want something more specific you can go a private insurance group but it still has to be done through the healthcare.gov website. For example my employer offered me health insurance. In order to get their insurance I didnt go to my employers website. I went to the .gov website and typed in my employers special code. This pulled up their health insurance. I then got to look through their offered plans and select one. As far as I can tell the website functions as a conduit of sorts. Insurance offers go through the website and likely have to in order for subsidies to work as they should. If you have any questions about it the healthcare.gov website has staff that can take your calls  which is pretty awesome TBH.

Here is the basicsJefferson DemocratRepublican  Primary  support from South and west. The newly acquired western states slowly denominated the industry based federalist party.Jackson Democrat  Support came from south and west states. AntiIndian rhetoric. In political Science we would label this in the populistconservative category.Lincoln Republican  Support primarily from North. Considered progressiveliberal for the timeGrover Cleveland Democrat  Conservative Keep in mind the democratic party has been very traditional since Jackson. This is the only democratic president for half a century. William Jennings Bryan Democrat    totally changed the landscape. This is probably the election that will confuse the shit out of you. South and Rural states all pushing liberal ideas. This is the transitioning candidate that pushed democrats from conservatism towards liberalism. However he also was probably the closest thing to an evangelical candidate Scopes trial attorney and ProProhibition.William McKinley  ProBusiness Republican you can see the shift starting here in the republican party. They nominate the rumbustious progressive Teddy Roosevelt as vice president in hopes to sideline him and quell the liberal faction of the republicans.William McKinley is killed and the progressive minded Teddy seizes the reigns The Trust Buster. Taft    This is probably your first clear cut conservative republican. He served one term but managed to appoint  very conservative supreme court justices that would later battle and block many of fdrs new deal policy.  Election  After losing the republican nomination to Taft Roosevelt bolts from the party and starts the progressive party. The liberals of the republicans leave with him a lot of these voters would never return to the republicans.Woodrow Wilson D  This completes the liberal take over of the democratic party. A very stark contract to Grover Cleveland  years earlier who was very conservative. Everything beyond this point is bs with analysis. FDR just builds off Woodrow but is essentially from the same wing of the party. Reagan just builds off Barry Goldwater and Goldwater just builds off Hoover Coolidge Harding and Taft. And everyone has said it but the southern conservatives stuck with the democrats over party loyalty until the civil rights era. If you must know even during FDR they created the conservative coalition and battled the new deals implementation. Youll notice during the late s to the late s moderates seemed to dominate the parties. Truman Eisenhower Kennedy Nixon Ford Carter  None of these guys are ideologues but pragmatics. ,dataisbeautiful,d5vbpb5,1,t5_2tk95

My point is if their expectations are fair They ought to be being a govt. organization in a very developed country then you must be a very fit women running against merely fit men. Because i simply dont think your claims are valid That fit women press up as well and run as well as their fit male counterparts.i.e. the  millionth best male runner does not run the same times as the  millionth best female runner in the world in any distance or even close.Conclusion from an article about marathon runners Running is all about getting your foot off the ground. Youve just got  milliseconds or  milliseconds to apply the force to push you through the air so you need an enormously strong leg. Now Paula Radcliffe the worldrecord holder in the womens marathon is  kg. At her  kg she just doesnt have the muscle power that the men have. I think thats the differentiating factor.

That doesnt mean politics is how they could have made the most money though. And what makes you say the expenses scandal  well paid? Most of that was minor shit  it was out of order for them to be charing it to the government but its not like they were buying mansions or whatever.If youre an MSP theres a pretty massive chance youve got a degree and your parents have got degrees and so comparing their wealth to the average citizen is a bit silly.

This is demonstrated above when he says No to the question Should women be allowed to serve combat duty?  gt Should businesses be required to provide paid leave for fulltime employees during the birth of a child or sick family member?  DT No position stated. Of course. I would assume hed say no being the conservative he is but he wouldnt say that so that he doesnt lose voters.  gt Should every  year old citizen be required to provide at least one year of military service?  DT No position stated. Again afraid to get  year old voters and the parents of those nearing that age to vote for someone other than him so he doesnt take a stance. Yep lets see how that works out for him when his plan to put boots on the ground starts backfiring and getting American troops killed. Who will he resort to then? Mexican immigrants?

The reason these exist is BECAUSE of businesses like the ones youre describing the ones who need that software. Most often close businesses. Of course that only really applies for computing companies like IBM Dell AMD Intel. They make money by selling support along with things like helping set up servers for businesses and systems support as well. So the guys who own Linux Canonical they no longer have to spend money on producing their software and they only need a few programmers to keep it running finebug fixing if any employees really the people do it for them which means the money they earn on selling support doesnt need to go to RampD or maintaining employee salaries it can go into marketing and funding more support for businesses.As for things like GIMP being free whilst Photoshop isnt. GIMP is literally just a program designed by  people at the University of California as a project. Some other guy ported it to Windows it got popular more people helped work on it. Free RampD.In addition at the moment there a big notion going around that the patent system as it is now is pretty terrible. The life of the author plus  years? Ridiculous.

Or I thought I did. Because of that Sept.   the most popular birthday  seems wildly more common than January  among the least popular. Both may be relatively close in the raw number of births even though their ranks are far apart....last night I compiled a decades worth of nationwide birth data by month. Those data show that August in fact saw the most births during the year period. Each month is over . million births......there isnt much difference between months in the distribution of the births.

Eventually the march didnt happen but the Supreme court established the precedent that the government has no right to prohibit Swastikas and Neonazis from protesting.The idea is what government wants to do isnt the how right and wrong are defined because its clear American govt wanted to prohibit Nazi speech and iconography too but it was the founding principle of America that is the First Amendment which prevented that from happening.I consider antihate speech laws to be stupid.

8905949,0,t3_5281aw,This chart is one of the best visual explanations Ive seen of how the American health care system truly excels at fulfilling its design purpose. Keep in mind that our system such as it is prioritizes by design entirely different outcomes than countries that have  national health care systems. The American system is designed to maximize shareholder and other financial stakeholders returns to publiclytraded insurance and pharmaceutical companies and hospital systems and then to maximize financial returns for owners of other health care companies. In that system one of the measures of success is rising percapita spending with little change in health outcomes and particularly longevity. Given that increasing longevity is a particular threat to insurers financial performance flat longevity and increased percapita spending is exactly what one expects to see. In other countries the design priority is to maximize health outcomes in the most financially efficient way and so there the key success metric would be increasing longevity with flat to decreasing percapita spending. Given that the datas a pretty compelling indicator that the American health care system is excelling in pursuit of its key objectives.

8943454,0,t1_d7mu9kg,Im glad I took the time to respond to you because you seem actually capable of understanding whats at stake unlike most people I have this conversation with.I just need you to understand that we all knew and were in denial. There could have been an outcry. Gay marriage passed because there was an outcry. Hell jim crow laws died because of an outcry. But even when all the scientists cried out even when our hero Bill Nye tried to grab us and scream into our face there was no outcry over global climate change. It may have taken decades it may not have mattered but well never know because no one really cared.I need you to understand the sheer amount of denial in our society. Why do you think we consume terrible movies and shows and games and products at such an alarming degree? Billions of dollars constantly thrown at entertainment. These things are viewed as an escape a mental holiday. Why? Because everyone knows the world is fucked up. Everyone hates their job everyone hates the government everyone knows children are starving everyone with internet literacy knows that climate change is already here and will destroy us. Worse everyone knows that they we should be doing something about it. This feeling of total despair over being unable to act may be justified at first but it has lead to a society of consumption. The people are in denial and as problems get worse they only hide further. Unable to accept the horrors of the world they live in but unwilling to sacrifice to fix it the people fill their heads with fiction to ease the pain of everyday life in the dystopia. It is a cultural sickness.Once again I will admit that I am among the worst offenders of this. So many years spent telling people This isnt right and we need to change things being met with only what do you know and its fine fuck off has destroyed my faith in humanity. All we need to do is unite behind one idea and Id have thought money in politics would be a good one we can all agree on but apparently not. I cope with this by being somewhere else which is hopefully where youll find me when we all die. I too am a coward. Cowardice is the only way we know to live.By the way with things like Aldous Huxleys Brave New World on the table as a possible future for humanity destroying the entire race seems like a fairly reasonable alternative. Think if humanity shifted full global dystopia then escaped into space. We could be talking about a galaxy spanning system of oppression that lasts until time ends. Countless people brought into existence to be made as slaves to spend their lives suffering and then die. Worse yet if Huxley is right theyll be too stupid or brain washed or brain damaged to understand. A galaxy of happy fool slaves. If our choices are go into the future lead by evil and dont go into the future Im leaning pretty hard towards the bail on existence plan. I dont see how humanity will get its act together and every day it doesnt we move closer to having permanently lost from now until forever. This idea terrifies me. And what does America do about all this? They drop millions and millions on the latest terrible Star Wars and Nestle water bottles. In so many ways I feel like the humanity being destroyed by shifting the climate to entertain itself is not just appropriate it was the only way it could have gone and it may be the only way to contain the parasitic elements of our species. Can you imagine how many other worlds we could wreck? And what if we met technologically inferior aliens out there? I sincerely doubt we will treat them differently than we have treated our own.

8979838,0,t1_d7qzgxl,I think theres a point to be made that massive bond markets suck up investments which otherwise ought to be going into the private sector driving up the price of money for everyone else. In such a case the government must be using bond money very efficiently and effectively or else youre likely to see sluggish real growth high interest rates and an increasingly risky investment market. Oh wait...Theres real merit to limiting the national debt. It benefits businesses and individuals who present a low risk to creditors. Currently the governments main expenditures are social security medicare and the military these are the cause of our deficit and they arent great boons to our economy. Our debt isnt the result of a responsible forward thinking economic policy its a result of our inability to A raise revenue and B cut spending.Driving the debt to zero is for many reasons not a good idea. But balancing the budget has merit a reasonable surplus would even be good for a couple years. Dismissing Gore and others like him out of hand in favor of doing well what were already doing is shortsighted.  ,dataisbeautiful,d7r8mvw,1,t5_2tk95

9032483,0,t3_53yk6w,Edit misplaced my response to another commentI cannot see where you get that implication. I do not wish harm on anyone. I simply recognize that risk is a part of some professions. I recognize also that some professions are set up to respond to risk in constrained ways. That the respect and deference we pay to veterans firemen and first responders is in part due to the fact that we expect them to respond to risk in ways we would not expect from people outside of those roles. What I am speaking about is an observable change in the data that says police are responding to a reduced level of risk in an escalated fashion. Thats is the data and relevant to the topic brought up by the ops submission. This isnt WWII. We drafted people using the force of law to expose them involuntarily to a significant constant and intentionalfromtheenemy risk of life. Now we hire train and equip people to protect and serve in a job thats not in the top ten dangerous professions fishermen electrical linemen garbage collectors airline pilots and farmers do more dangerous jobs bls.  Some of you are asking everyone to understand that them killing a lot more people than they used to while getting shot at much less frequently is unworthy of comment. I am not saying police shouldnt protect themselves. I hope that clears the charge that Im being asinine.. Im saying they are protecting themselves differently than before in an opposite reaction to the change in real threat.  They have changed behavior in a way that ends up with many more people innocent or guilty armed or unarmed dead without a trial.  Thats a problem. And the only potential mitigating factor in explaining the change in behavior would be an increase in the violence directed at them. But its not there. In fact it dropped years before law enforcement started turning toward their guns so readily. You are free to believe I want cops dead. Thats your business.  But I havent said anything of the sort. I want fewer unarrested untried unarmed people dead. ,dataisbeautiful,d7xk813,4,t5_2tk95

But yes with our military industrial complex and establishment here I guess it is unachievable.Edit I am wrong to equate social democracy with Marxism but I still contend that most left leaning popular movements were undermined by corruption or by coupsinterventions and not because free markets are better. There is a foolproof system and that is to simply approach economics as an optimisation problem. In other words a resource based economy. An economy guided by the need to optimise our supply of commodities in order to prolong our existence as a species would be ideal in my opinion. Under that kind of a system resources would be allocated to things like space exploration rampd etc. We wouldnt be at the mercy of a market of consumers in order to decide what to do with our commodities. Just to give an example Capitalism led to the destruction of public transport in the US. The auto industry literally bought tram lines and liquidated them. Now we have sprawls of automotive cities in which you see giant cars each transporting only one individual to and from work. This is literally the opposite of optimal. There are millions of other examples of failures like these.

9298540,0,t1_d8um2i2,You really cant have capitalism and democracy. Like Albert Einstein wrote in Why Socialism?gtPrivate capital tends to become concentrated in few hands partly because of competition among the capitalists and partly because technological development and the increasing division of labor encourage the formation of larger units of production at the expense of smaller ones. The result of these developments is an oligarchy of private capital the enormous power of which cannot be effectively checked even by a democratically organized political society. This is true since the members of legislative bodies are selected by political parties largely financed or otherwise influenced by private capitalists who for all practical purposes separate the electorate from the legislature. The consequence is that the representatives of the people do not in fact sufficiently protect the interests of the underprivileged sections of the population. Moreover under existing conditions private capitalists inevitably control directly or indirectly the main sources of information press radio education. It is thus extremely difficult and indeed in most cases quite impossible for the individual citizen to come to objective conclusions and to make intelligent use of his political rights.It is referred to as the dictatorship of the bourgeosiegtIt is referred to as bourgeois democracy because ultimately politicians fight only for the rights of the bourgeoisie. According to Marx representation of the interests of different classes is proportional to the influence which a particular class can purchase through bribes transmission of propaganda through mass media economic blackmail donations for political parties and their campaigns etc.. Thus the public interest in socalled liberal democracies is systematically corrupted by the wealth of those classes rich enough to gain the appearance of representation. Because of this multiparty democracies under capitalist ideology are always distorted and antidemocratic their operation merely furthering the class interests of the owners of the means of production.gtAccording to Marx the bourgeois class becomes wealthy through a drive to appropriate the surplusvalue of the creative labours of the working class. This drive obliges the bourgeois class to amass everlarger fortunes by increasing the proportion of surplusvalue by exploiting the working class through capping workers terms and conditions as close to poverty levels as possible. Incidentally this obligation demonstrates the clear limit to bourgeois freedom even for the bourgeoisie itself.gtThus according to Marx parliamentary elections are no more than a cynical systemic attempt to deceive the people by permitting them every now and again to endorse one or other of the bourgeoisies predetermined choices of which political party can best advocate the interests of capital. Once elected this parliament as a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie enacts regulations that actively support the interests of its true constituency the bourgeoisie such as bailing out Wall St investment banks direct socialisationsubsidisation of business  GMH USEuropean agricultural subsidies and even wars to guarantee trade in commodities such as oil.gtVladimir Lenin once argued that liberal democracy had simply been used to give an illusion of democracy while maintaining the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie.,dataisbeautiful,d8unnbr,162,t5_2tk95

9333756,0,t1_d8z3lq3,I dont think it was a serious post. However feminisms impact could be attributed to two primary issues domestic violence support services and family courts. Feminist advocacy and laws have severely hindered a genderneutral approach to family violence resulting in lack of support for male victims and their children and lack of treatment for female abusers. It also keeps couples who are in mutually abusive relationships from receiving support services. This issues also ties into family courts where the domestic violence policies can be used against fathers or spouses to limit their contact with children or use the state to harass the falsely accusedequally culpable. Being a victim of abuse both at the hands of a partner and the state is a risk for suicide.In family court men are the majority of those paying former spouses alimony or child support. Those amounts may not reflect the actual need of the former partner and can result in poverty for the paying spouse. A large portion of deadbeat dads would never have been able to pay but are criminalized regardless. Poverty and a resulting cycle of debt and imprisonment are a risk factor of suicide.Again in family courts women are favored as custodial parents which can alienate fathers from their children. In addition mothers breaching custody orders are not as vigorously pursued by authorities which exacerbates this lack of contact. Poverty jail time for child support debt andor harassment via biased DV policies even further exacerbates the issue to the point where the father will never have contact with the children. Losing contact with children is another risk for suicide.,dataisbeautiful,d8z4e8r,7,t5_2tk95

Unless they show it Im still going to feel lonely and forgotten which is why I feel like killing myself. Logically you are probably right but why does it have to take killing myself for people to show they care. Im sure there is an easy answer that Im missing bc im stuck in my head and trying to figure it out is what has kept me from doing it.

9469477,0,t1_d9g41u4,The generic foods are often made by the same factory that makes name brand items but they get contracted out by various grocers to make their generic versions.The bigger issue is likely to be the fact that foods loaded with preservatives that dont expire for a long time and can sit on a shelf for ages are way cheaper than fresh food that expires and has to be thrown out if it doesnt sell soon after it is stocked. That sort of shelf life is part of the price of fresh vegetables and meat so poor people often cant afford to buy much fresh food. Theres also the issue of not having time to cook when youre having to work two jobs or get all the overtime you can muster to make ends meet. Buying fast food is cheap and time efficient but its also horribly unhealthy.,dataisbeautiful,d9gbhcy,2,t5_2tk95

9605218,0,t3_5cim2a,Change the definition of extreme poverty from . a day to . a day and prepare to be depressed. Edit formatting Edit  Wow more responses then I would have expected for a late night random post. Anyway I just want to clear a couple things up. First I wasnt trying to make a comment on globalization economics or anything of the sort. I was simply trying to demonstrate how adjusting the definition by even the smallest degree can have a massive impact on the number of people in poverty. Second I wasnt trying to minimize the success weve had over the last century. The world has made great strides towards ending poverty and those should be celebrated. I was simply trying to show that we still have a lot of works to do on the subject.Lastly there seems to be a lot of people going yeah but . is different everywhere. I figured this was a blatantly obvious concept and that people would assume the study accounted for it apparently not. The . or . or whatever dollar amount used isnt just based on the US dollar and us economic conditions. Theyre taking into account realities of the areas surveyed. Cost of living inflation local currencies so on and so forth then translating it into a single unit that is understandable to everyone. Heres an excerpt from the full  page report on their methodology. I know this is long but I thought it was important to leave the context if you dont care about this just quit reading now. gtThe first World Bank goal ending poverty is global and measurement involves adding up the number of poor people in all countries. Three specific components are critical to this aggregation. The first component is costofliving comparability across countries. The key information for ensuring this comparability is data to gauge purchasing power parities PPPs. The data are col lected through the International Comparison Program an independent worldwide statistical partnership that gathers data on prices and expenditures within economies. The comparison of incomes across house holds in different countries entails the use of exchange rates between local currencies the units of value used by household surveys. However the use of market exchange rates is not sufficient because market exchange rates do not accurately assess differences in purchasing power and are inaccurate in cap turing the costs faced by the poor. Despite the limitations stemming from the com plexity of a global exercise of this nature the PPPs fill this gap by allowing income com parisons in real terms while accounting for differences in prices across countries. Com paring prices across the world is a tricky en deavor because most products are not sold everywhere or even if they are the quality may vary considerably countrybycountry and regionbyregion. Moreover an every day product in one country may be a lux ury item in another. Likewise prices may also vary widely within a single country so spatial price variations should also be taken into account where possible. Because relative prices evolve updates of PPPs may be necessary so that PPP exchange rates are used reliably in price comparisons.gtA second key component of the aggrega tion of the poor is the definition of an inter national poverty line in PPP terms. Coun tries determine their own poverty lines mostly by means of a basic needs standard that is linked to a predefined consumption basket of essential goods and services or relative to an agreed position along the dis tribution of income or consumption for example  percent of the median national household income. The World Bank uses an international poverty line based on the national thresholds of some of the poorest countries. To account for changes in rela tive prices across countries over time the  PPP was adopted in  as the standard. This involved an upward adjustment of the international poverty line to US. a day in income or consumption expendi ture so as to preserve the real value of the US.aday line in  PPP that was the previous international line. Global pov erty incidence changes little as a result and progress toward the global poverty target for  is unaffected.gtThe third element in a proper aggrega tion of the poverty count is the treatment of the lack of reliable data on some economies and a range of difficulties in the aggrega tion of existing and available data. Hence for those countries lacking reliable income or consumption data or on which data are not available for analysis a regional average poverty rate is used. In calculating this rate available and reliable evidence is gathered on countries within the same region and then extrapolated onto the countries on which data are unavailable.,dataisbeautiful,d9x1fx3,447,t5_2tk95

Then the number of votes you get in the second round determines how many seats your party gets. In the  elections this was changed to a proportional representation system with only one round. This should explain the spike in voter turnout  people are more interested in voting if small parties have a higher chance of getting seats. But this new system led to cohabitation socialist president Mitterand had to appoint republican prime minister Chirac because more parliament seats were attributed to republicans than socialists. It was also the first time that the Front National far right party got seats at the parliament. So in the  elections the system was changed back to majoritarian representation and thats how its been ever since.As for the decrease in voter turnout since the s...

Hillarys failure to keep her facilities and personnel safe was hers and hers alone.. In your reasoning you think that quantity of casualties is relevant to the question of responsibility. Thats just stupid.. Your conclusion that I think everyone is either conservative or liberal is illogical and has zero basis.

Sending aid to a diplomatic station in distress is not an invasion and groundbased terrorists are unlikely to be able to do much against air support and our special forces could fast rope in and wipe the ground with the bad guys who werent all that sophisticated..

Trumpesque figure could very well win an election there.

Too bad you continue to fail at proving anything.Now back to decimating your attempt at an argument.  If you actually read the entire paragraph instead of misquoting.  He does not literally say that by the way.gt per cent of American judges are still white men. Thank God for that! Its only people free of socalled oppression  people who have no race gender or sexualitybased disadvantages and who can argue from Rawlss original position  who can truly sort through the evermore complex jungle of the progressive stack.The point is that you cannot argue from Rawls original position in progressive society where you are constantly told you are being oppressed.gtThe original position is a central feature of John Rawlss social contract account of justice justice as fairness set forth in A Theory of Justice TJ. It is designed to be a fair and impartial point of view that is to be adopted in our reasoning about fundamental principles of justice. In taking up this point of view we are to imagine ourselves in the position of free and equal persons who jointly agree upon and commit themselves to principles of social and political justice. The main distinguishing feature of the original position is the veil of ignorance to insure impartiality of judgment the parties are deprived of all knowledge of their personal characteristics and social and historical circumstances.This has nothing to do with race superiority.  This is an attack on the portion of progressive society that does not consider minorities free and equal therefore unable to maintain impartiality.So let me phrase this so you cant fail to comprehend.  The argument is that until society views minorities as free and equal there cannot be impartiality on that the part of those minorities from an original position.  This cannot happen  in the current progressive society because everyone except for white males are not seen as equal.I dont understand how someone as educated as you claim can really fail to understand this.,dataisbeautiful,danu8tm,0,t5_2tk95

9950592,0,t1_db4iqqx,gt and why do we shampoo it too much now?We think cleaning ourselves every day is a good thing. But with shampooing you are removing the natural oils that help protect and naturally condition your hair and scalp. Doing this also can increase the oil production so when you dont use shampoo for a few days your hair feels gunky. It takes a week or so for the over production to get back to normal after you stop heavily shampooing. Personally I stick to shampooing twice a week at the most on a normal week a little more if Im getting really dirty with stuff that water wont wash off. Usually just use water to clean my hair and scalp. Edit read some of this to make sure it didnt tell you that you were going to die from cancer.

Do you realize how many midwestern states it takes to equal Californias population? This may come as a surprise to you but immigrants dont simply enter into border states. Airplanes? Shocking I know. There are communities of foreign immigrants scattered all across the country not just California or Texas. I will once again remind you the the US is a collection of states. Its literally the name of the country. United States. By your logic we should just do away with congress yes? Remember theyre voted for at the state level. Should we just have everyone vote for all the congressmen so that majority tyranny is enacted in short order? What youre imagining is utopian and unrealistic. Want states to start seceding? Take away their voice. Popular vote is what small states want. Equal vote is what the small states want. The EC meets in the middle. Thats called compromise. I dont think you actually want what you think you want. Lets look at California. They need water. They are having to buy water from Nevada now. Nevada is a small state. Think theyd want to play nice with what would essentially become the nations bully in your no state votes for federal officials world?

10132955,0,t1_dbs8afr,We know carbon dioxide is a heat trapping gas due to its absorption spectrum being transparent to visible light emitted by the sun but opaque to the infrared light emitted by earth. Since co and other greenhouse gases allow the sun to warm the earth but prevent the earth from cooling itself off to space that keeps the earth much warmer than it would otherwise be. You can plainly see the impact of greenhouse gases on temperature in both the spectral flux at the top of the atmosphere and in the downwelling radiation from the atmosphere towards the surface.We have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide  since the industrial revolution. As a result we have observed an increase in the greenhouse effect as a decrease in co wavelengths escaping to space Harries et al.  Griggs et al.  Chen et al.  and a corresponding increase in cos radiative forcing at the surface. That shows a direct causeeffect relationship between rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and rising global temperatures. Not only does the radiative forcing increase from our greenhouse gas emissions dwarf natural forcings on the climate but the pattern of warming also fits the distinct signatures that we would expect from greenhouseinduced warming such as nights warming faster than days the troposphere warming while the stratosphere cools the tropopause rising etc. ,dataisbeautiful,dbsbv9g,3,t5_2tk95
10133407,0,t1_dbsbvka,You seem to have missed a few bits of uIlikeNeurons commentsgt the goal being that the production of fossil fuels will cease and companies will turn to alternative sources of energyOne can design a tax to end fossil fuel production but no economist recommends that as far as I know. Its usually not the idea behind a carbon tax. Its either supposed to correct prices due to negative externalities of fossil fuels or its supposed to act as an apportionment for cleaning up the effects of burning fossil fuels.Either way there will still be some profitable fossil fuel extraction under a carbon tax.gt it will take at least a generation for us to completely eradicate fossil fuel production and consumption.Possibly but note that the more we save today the more time we have for becoming a mostly COfree economy.gt alternative energy is nowhere near the level to keep up with the energy demand of the entire planet.The initial and main effect of a carbon tax is not alternative energy its energy efficiency. For instance transporting electricity is about  efficient. For any  kWh one doesnt consume one saves  kWh in production. And there are GWhs that could be saved by any industrialized nation for cheap.gt implementation of a carbon tax is purely voluntary unless you establish a world governmentYou missed the bit about border taxes.Sure any country can decide to not tax carbon. But if its going to export any goods to a foreign country with border taxes these goods will be taxed and the tax is collected by the foreign government. Of course any goods exported from a country with carbon taxes will get a reimbursement.gt If any nation chooses to not apply the tax it would be come a fossil fuel paradiseAgain youve been misinformed. ,dataisbeautiful,dbsdzex,4,t5_2tk95

10134884,0,t1_dbsjpy5,Its basically a continuation of the longterm decline in Arctic sea ice combined with a very anomalous decline in Antarctic sea iceThe NSIDC explains that this is strongly influenced by recent wind patterns in the regiongt When the westerly wind pattern broke down in November winds in several areas of Antarctica started to blow from the north. Over a broad area near Wilkes Land the ice edge was pushed toward the continent. Areas with southward winds were also located between Dronning Maud Land and Enderby Land and near the Antarctic Peninsula. This created three regions where ice extent quickly became much less extensive than usual Figure c reflected in the rapid decline in extent for the Antarctic as a whole. Interspersed with the areas of compressed sea ice and winds from the north areas of south winds produced large open water areas near the coast creating the polynyas.,dataisbeautiful,dbskvu0,2,t5_2tk95

But you only need them if youre doing some serious number crunching on very big datasets. Most of the time a decent laptop or computer is more than enough.. Is that a question?. The cloud instance? No. Theyre usually billed based on what you use but mine only costs a couple of dollars a month. R is free and open source though.,dataisbeautiful,dbszfwz,1,t5_2tk95

10143509,0,t1_dbtopaq,Youre absolutely right that people should have the right to choose for themselves. But Im teaching my children to live in the real world. In the real world men get tricked convinced or otherwise coerced into having kids ALL THE TIME. It really happens and most men put up with it. Im not in any way supporting it nor am I telling my son that he should support it. It just happens and he should be prepared for it. Ideally he wont have to but we need to prepare ourselves for the most likely future. Id be doing a disservice to my kids if I didnt tell them the hard truths about life. Maybe just maybe by warning my sons about situations like this one that are all too possible they can talk to their future spouses in an open and straightforward way about their expectations and viewpoints on when and how many children to have. I will also have these conversations with my sons girlfriendswives if the timesituation is right. Maybe if they know that I know that women often try to take the reins on this issue but that my son has very firm feelings about staying childfree it might help. If you want to raise your kids to believe that the world is the way it OUGHT to be thats fine for you. Im getting my kids ready for what IS. ,dataisbeautiful,dbtpbvj,1,t5_2tk95

10197285,0,t1_dbzk19m,I studied enology in university. We were shown some of this videos spanish enologysts failings. IMO a good enologyst can feel the diference between diferent grapes diferent addons sulfats flowers spices etc.  alcohol grade the witdh and shape of stripes coming down from the glass when you move it etc. He can determine if the wine is from that year or older. Although it is not exact science he can take the risk to say if its a cheap or expensive wine. BUT the price as OP says does not allways match the quality. When a good wine becomes popular the producer tends to buy grape from other producers to match the demand so this can affect the original wines quality standart. I think the problem is not the dificulty of detecting a good or bad wine but a good or bad enologyst.As my father used to say a bad wine is the one when you drink a second glass it does not taste the same you get acidity etc.,dataisbeautiful,dbzx31u,2,t5_2tk95

10200395,0,t3_5lyv8c,If you dont drink wine alot im sure you believe this. If you drink wine alot you wont believe this. Without looking at the study i cant really judge it but a . euro wine vs a . euro wine i wouldnt call cheap vs expensive. Also i dont know how they picked people half of these people might not even like wine. Generally when you start looking into click baity studies they fall apart. Regardless you can also not like the taste of expensive wine. Just because it is more money doesnt mean youll like it more. For example a Cabernet Sauvignon from two different wineries arent going to taste the same even if theyre the same price. The tastes have alot of taste variation within the same price bracketvariety. ,dataisbeautiful,dc09sln,1,t5_2tk95

It made my back hurt less made boring repetitive tasks more interesting and made time go by faster so I didnt become a zombie by the end of the shift. Also as someone who has driven high a lot I find your story about the guys driving in the wrong lane of traffic as baffling as I would if he was sober.

If the predictive models on the economic incentives of how weed and alcohol stay consistent as they are and are predicted to. People prefer weed over alcohol its actually pretty common for people to not like the feelings of both of them together. So in a population overall drinking goes down thus less drunk drivers.

10257217,0,t1_dc6oo9j,I mentioned it in a couple other comments but the lb LD stat is for smoking. When you consume edibles not only do you get more it actually metabolizes into hydroxyTHC which is about x as potent. Not sure how that effects the math...You also have to consider that since no human has ever died we have no human LD like we do for most commonly abused drugs. These can actually vary quite a bit between ratsmicehumans.Would it really be impossible though? Whats stopping someone from ingesting something obscene like a pound of THC? Besides money and common sense lol.I suppose that your body would likely green out and force you to puke it out long before it can absorb enough to be lethal. Still if youre really trying to kill yourself could take drugs to help prevent puking. Or use sublingual tinctures suppositories and skin oils which your body has no way of rejecting. Youd have to have a decent amount of money and reallly want to kill yourself. If you even can which we dont have any definitive proof of because no ones ever done it in the s of years humans have consumed cannabis. At least as far as we know.Lol I love how much thought were putting into something so pointless.edit the LD thing I was talking about with ratsmicehumansgt The LD of nicotine is  mgkg for rats and  mgkg for mice.  mg .. mgkg can be a lethal dosage for adult humans.

This would also allow the two lines to cross each other without having to change colour. The year labels shouldnt be at an angle either because that makes it unclear where for example the year  is exactly. It also takes a bit of looking back and forth to figure out how the yaxis labels and the legend and the data connect with each other.

German states thought being divided since the Holy Roman Empire collapsed was unnatural and sought to unify again. Alexander didnt regard preconquest Persia as an unnatural state. He saw Persians as enemies he wanted to conquer. He didnt regard himself as restoring anything.Each dynasty commissioned  history of the previous dynasty or dynasties and the succeeding dynasty after that plot an orthodox succession in the historical narrative.Chinese dynasties regarded themselves as part of an Orthodox succession in the Mandate of Heaven its not invented by modern China. The Tang dynasty regarded itself as the legitimate succesor to the Sui according to the Mandate of HeavenAll dynasties in China declared that their country was  selected a Chinese dynastic name and declared themselves to be the orthodox legitimate successor to the preceding dynasty and commissioned an official history of the previous dynasty. When a person founded a dynasty they declare themselves to be the legitimate successors of the previous dynasty and declare their state as  and declared themselves as Emperor  Huangdi the successor to the previous dynastys last emperor.TwentyFour HistoriesThe Qing dynasty regarded itself as legitimate successor of the Ming who were seen as legitimate successors of the Ming then the Yuan Song Later Zhou Later Han Later Jin Later Tang Later Liang Tang dynasty Sui Dynasty Northern Zhou Northern Qi Western Wei Eastern Wei Northern Wei Jin dynasty Cao Wei Han dynasty Qin dynasty Zhou dynasty Shang dynasty and Xia dynasty. That is the line of succession for the Mandate of Heaven as seen by each of those dynasties.During division the dynasty that won and reunified was the successor. When the Han dynasty ended it divided into three  Shu Han Cao Wei and Wu  Cao Wei beat and conquered Shu Han the Jin dynasty Sima family then overthrew and took over the Cao Wei state and conquered Wu so its traced back through JingtCao WeigtHan.,dataisbeautiful,dctt4wt,1,t5_2tk95

10492096,0,t1_dcw6ikw,I hope I didnt come across as too critical. As the layman observer I just thought to give some feedback on I guess what I feel like people would most look for out of data like this. Since Im not that versed in data visualisation I wouldnt be able to give you a suggestion for a different type of visualisation but I can suggest possibly thinking about what aspect of the data might be the most sought after rather than say focusing on some key aspects that you would like to better represent.In terms of this graph it seems like you wanted to focus around intuitive representation of the relations between countries by grouping them as such. However since you already have lines that tell you that kind of information there becomes a redundancy where people dont expect there to be multiple ways to show the same thing on a graph which is why I think its a bit counterintuitive. But hey thats just my opinion.I think if youre going for an uninteractive graph one thing I think we have to ensure is that people can find the country theyre interested in which automatically means nodes will have to be placed in worldmap format. At this point the size of the node and the style of the lines will carry most of the actual information. Obviously bigger node size means greater amount of weapons traded by an individual country lines can therefore be constant in size to be a bit clearer and instead use a spectrum heatmaplike colouring of the lines to denote the amount of weapons traded between two countries. The colours can also apply to the nodes as well as node size for more intuitive representation. You can then add a small key at the bottom to show a spectrum of colours and what range of values of weapons traded a colour would represent in general like this In this form people can immediately see by node size and colour who the largest weapons traders are they can find the country they are interested in by location and can intuitively work out roughly how much value in weapons they are trading to which country by line colour.,dataisbeautiful,dcxe0vq,2,t5_2tk95

10548893,0,t1_dd1wwin,Let me explain with an analogy.Imagine we have a bag with different colored marbles in it of equal size with a certain percentage distribution P of marbles having each color. Since the color is irrelevant to the selection process upon drawing balls out  we should  after a large enough population has been selected expect to see P represented in our sample. Simple enough. Now imagine we take some of the balls and make them a bit bigger  which somehow increases their chance of selection. If the balls made bigger are spread proportionally over the various colors  we should still expect to see P in our total sample  but with more large balls than small.Now  imagine we had only made the red balls bigger. Upon selection P will not be represented as we should see lots of large red balls and a smattering of small ones of different colors including red.The only option that skewed the results was the correlation between ball size and color. To apply this to trumps picks being qualified and willing to do the job gets one into the bag with some distribution P color is well color and ball size is favorability by Trump. The only way to skew the results to  white which  white in P   is to have a strong correlation between being white and favorability by Trump. This favoring of whites is called racism.The only other option is that P actually does contain  whites. Id argue this is very unlikely or to take a line from Trump  WRONG. You believe whites are just more qualified as if skin color had nothing to do with it. This we call white supremacy. ,dataisbeautiful,dd3u2pn,1,t5_2tk95

10606269,0,t1_dd9vnil,The current administration is pretty much on a path to fascism. Dr. Lawrence Britt has examined the fascist regimes of Hitler Germany Mussolini Italy Franco Spain Suharto Indonesia and several Latin American regimes. Britt found  defining characteristics common to eachgt. Powerful and Continuing Nationalism  Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos slogans symbols songs and other paraphernalia. Flags are seen everywhere as are flag symbols on clothing and in public displays. gt. Disdain for the Recognition of Human Rights  Because of fear of enemies and the need for security the people in fascist regimes are persuaded that human rights can be ignored in certain cases because of need. The people tend to look the other way or even approve of torture summary executions assassinations long incarcerations of prisoners etc. gt. Identification of EnemiesScapegoats as a Unifying Cause  The people are rallied into a unifying patriotic frenzy over the need to eliminate a perceived common threat or foe racial  ethnic or religious minorities liberals communists socialists terrorists etc. gt. Supremacy of the Military  Even when there are widespreaddomestic problems the military is given a disproportionate amount of government funding and the domestic agenda is neglected. Soldiers and military service are glamorized. gt. Rampant Sexism  The governments of fascist nations tend to be almost exclusively maledominated. Under fascist regimes traditional gender roles are made more rigid. Divorce abortion and homosexuality are suppressed and the state is represented as the ultimate guardian of the family institution. gt. Controlled Mass Media  Sometimes to media is directly controlled by the government but in other cases the media is indirectly controlled by government regulation or sympathetic media spokespeople and executives. Censorship especially in war time is very common. gt. Obsession with National Security  Fear is used as a motivational tool by the government over the masses. gt. Religion and Government are Intertwined  Governments in fascist nations tend to use the most common religion in the nation as a tool to manipulate public opinion. Religious rhetoric and terminology is common from government leaders even when the major tenets of the religion are diametrically opposed to the governments policies or actions. gt. Corporate Power is Protected  The industrial and business aristocracy of a fascist nation often are the ones who put the government leaders into power creating a mutually beneficial businessgovernment relationship and power elite. gt. Labor Power is Suppressed  Because the organizing power of labor is the only real threat to a fascist government labor unions are either eliminated entirely or are severely suppressed. gt. Disdain for Intellectuals and the Arts  Fascist nations tend to promote and tolerate open hostility to higher education and academia. It is not uncommon for professors and other academics to be censored or even arrested. Free expression in the arts and letters is openly attacked. gt. Obsession with Crime and Punishment  Under fascist regimes the police are given almost limitless power to enforce laws. The people are often willing to overlook police abuses and even forego civil liberties in the name of patriotism. There is often a national police force with virtually unlimited power in fascist nations. gt. Rampant Cronyism and Corruption  Fascist regimes almost always are governed by groups of friends and associates who appoint each other to government positions and use governmental power and authority to protect their friends from accountability. It is not uncommon in fascist regimes for national resources and even treasures to be appropriated or even outright stolen by government leaders. gt. Fraudulent Elections  Sometimes elections in fascist nations are a complete sham. Other times elections are manipulated by smear campaigns against or even assassination of opposition candidates use of legislation to control voting numbers or political district boundaries and manipulation of the media. Fascist nations also typically use their judiciaries to manipulate or control elections.Umberto Ecos list paraphrased from this essaygt The cult of tradition. One has only to look at the syllabus of every fascist movement to find the major traditionalist thinkers. The Nazi gnosis was nourished by traditionalist syncretistic occult elements.gt The rejection of modernism. The Enlightenment the Age of Reason is seen as the beginning of modern depravity. In this sense UrFascism can be defined as irrationalism.gt The cult of action for actions sake. Action being beautiful in itself it must be taken before or without any previous reflection. Thinking is a form of emasculation.gt Disagreement is treason. The critical spirit makes distinctions and to distinguish is a sign of modernism. In modern culture the scientific community praises disagreement as a way to improve knowledge.gt Fear of difference. The first appeal of a fascist or prematurely fascist movement is an appeal against the intruders. Thus UrFascism is racist by definition.gt Appeal to social frustration. One of the most typical features of the historical fascism was the appeal to a frustrated middle class a class suffering from an economic crisis or feelings of political humiliation and frightened by the pressure of lower social groups.gt The obsession with a plot. The followers must feel besieged. The easiest way to solve the plot is the appeal to xenophobia.gt The enemy is both strong and weak. By a continuous shifting of rhetorical focus the enemies are at the same time too strong and too weak.gt Pacifism is trafficking with the enemy. For UrFascism there is no struggle for life but rather life is lived for struggle.gt Contempt for the weak. Elitism is a typical aspect of any reactionary ideology.gt Everybody is educated to become a hero. In UrFascist ideology heroism is the norm. This cult of heroism is strictly linked with the cult of death.gt Machismo and weaponry. Machismo implies both disdain for women and intolerance and condemnation of nonstandard sexual habits from chastity to homosexuality.gt Selective populism. There is in our future a TV or Internet populism in which the emotional response of a selected group of citizens can be presented and accepted as the Voice of the People.gt UrFascism speaks Newspeak. All the Nazi or Fascist schoolbooks made use of an impoverished vocabulary and an elementary syntax in order to limit the instruments for complex and critical reasoning.Paxtons Delineation of Five Stagesgt. Disillusionment with democracy fascisms take their first steps in reaction to claimed failings of democracy  for the process to be studied here is the emergence of new ways of looking at the world and diagnosing its ills. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries thinkers and publicists discredited reigning liberal and democratic values not in the name of either existing alternative  conservative or socialist  but in the name of something new that promised to transcend and join them a novel mixture of nationalism and syndicalism that had found little available space in a nineteenthcentury political landscape compartmented into Left and Rightgt. Fascism joins the political establishment  The second stage  rooting in which a fascist movement becomes a party capable of acting decisively on the political scene  happens relatively rarely  Success depends on certain relatively precise conditions the weakness of a liberal state whose inadequacies seems to condemn the nation to disorder decline or humiliation and political deadlock because the Right the heir to power but unable to continue to wield it alone refuses to accept a growing Left as a legitimate governing partner  Every fascist movement that has rooted itself successfully as a major political contender thereby approaching power has betrayed its initial antibourgeois and anticapitalist program.gt.  Arrival to power  fascism has never so far taken power by a coup dtat deploying the weight of its militants in the street  The only route to power available to fascists passes through cooperation with conservative elites. The most important variables therefore are the conservative elites willingness to work with the fascists along with a reciprocal flexibility on the part of the fascist leaders and the depth of the crisis that induces them to cooperate  Neither Hitler nor Mussolini took the helm by force even if they used force earlier to destabilize the liberal regime and later to transform their governments into dictatorships. Each was invited to take office as head of governmentgt.  Exercise of power fascist leaders who have reached power historically have been condemned to govern in association with the conservative elites who had opened the gates to them  tensions within fascist rule also help us clarify the frontiers between authentic fascism and other forms of dictatorial rule. Fascist rule is unlike the exercise of power in either authoritarianism which lacks a single party or gives it little power or Stalinism which lacked traditional elites. Authoritarians would prefer to leave the population demobilized while fascists promise to win the working class back for the nation by their superior techniques of manufacturing enthusiasm.gt.  Radicalization or entropy the fascistic government descends either into authoritarianism entropy or becomes radicalized as Nazi Germany did devolving into ethnic cleansing.,dataisbeautiful,dd9yenf,96,t5_2tk95

Because unless you do that theres no way to prevent campaigning. Not people. Organizations. People already have financial limits for support and that should extend to any organization showing an explicit political bias towards a candidate movement or more.gtIf the guy above and his friend want to meet once a week and knock on doors telling people why they think Hillary is great or stand in a park with signs saying that then they are campaigning but you absolutely cannot prevent them doing that without preventing their free speech. And that doesnt cost money and if it does it should not come from any organization and they should not be compensated by any organization.You are doing a great job at deflecting from the original argument that organizations arent held to the same standard that people are and by trying to win the argument by applying proposed limits on organizations to people.But its not enough.You will lose.,dataisbeautiful,ddatrwg,0,t5_2tk95

Cherry picking and phacking are defined by filtering the facts to produce a biased dataset. You can give phacking a try yourself here to produce unbiased data that objectively demonstrates whatever relationship you want between the two American political parties and the economy.If you want to get philosophical I think an individual direct measurement might be the only fact that has the potential to be truly nonbiased. If you set up a visibility sensor somewhere and record the visibility it reports its probably safe to say that your single measurement of a specific value for that precise GPS coordinate at that moment in time is nonbiased. If you want to get something more useful though like the smog levels in the entire city of Beijing you would probably want to use multiple sensors across the city and combine their results. But you can accidentally or intentionally bias that based on where you choose to put the sensors when you choose to read them or how you choose to combine the readings. Multiple groups could determine the smoginess of Beijing and get different values that are all treated as objective facts.,dataisbeautiful,ddjegq8,8,t5_2tk95

10886564,0,t1_de2bcfh,I copied this from my posting I this thread.Automotive embedded software engineer here. I can vouch that software in cars are very complex on a system and individual part basis. Cars can generally have  separate Ecus with their own tasks. Every ecu is based on a microcontroller that has complex low level hardware drivers that change from year to year based on new microcontrollers. A standard bit micro Ive been working with has a  page specification on computer hardware and architecture. Each ecu communicates on complex communication buses like can and interact in tightly integrated ways. The specifications that go into the whole car picture are never understood by a single person because its damn near impossible.We also have to adhere to very stringent safety fault detection and fault management requirements. A simple ecu may have over  separate faults that are hardware or software based. Each fault contributes to faults in and between all ecus on a bus. Warrenty return minimization is where automotive saves money.We have to adhere to uds diagnostics which can be very involved with many outputs and testing services along with bootloaders and calibration sections. Dont even get me started on autosar.Cars cant fail. If you get an error on Windows you do an update. Cars have multi million dollar costs for a recall and possible deaths. You cant easily update firmware unless you plug each car into a diagnostic utility and perform a manual reflash. The code has to be perfect. Unit testing integration testing and strict standards and process are essential. Try being perfect on tough timelines and  requirements...Automotive is unfairly criticised by just about everyone who doesnt work in it. People like to think were dinosaurs that are slow stupid and obsolete. There are some very bad things in automotive. But Im always amazed we can produce cars for the cost they are how well they work. Some of the work isnt the most exciting sounding but it can be very challenging. My company had to let go  embedded guys who couldnt cut it. Some with  years experience.,dataisbeautiful,de2vdv0,9,t5_2tk95

There isnt that much travel between communities vs inside communities so you dont really need to look bigger than that.New born babies are protected by their mothers immune system for a while and then should be vaccinated so there really arent any new vectors as long as people keep on top of it. Its how weve eradicated some really terrible diseases. That was only possible through effective vaccinations. That golden theory has been proven and implemented. We just no longer have any really scary disease like polio to motivate people.There have been examples of diseases that are basically unheard of making comebacks in communities with high percentages of antivaxxers. ,dataisbeautiful,de2xhi6,1,t5_2tk95

Regardless the fair share is what is necessary for all people to have the minimum to lead a safe life and have an equal chance to achieve success. Anything less than that is harmful for society and everybody loses in the end. A super rich person also benefits from advances in science and technology and they also consume art and entertainment. Most of them use the same infrastructure that we do and certainly prefer to live in cities where they can walk on the street without fearing for their safety. A responsible state can provide all that and rich people should be happy to contribute to it. The exact amount of money is highly debatable of course but when I see someone who has tens of billions of dollars moving their money around to avoid paying one or two billion it just strikes me as highly immoral. Nobody needs or even uses that much money. That behaviour is irrational and should not be condoned by our society. ,dataisbeautiful,de90g6v,1,t5_2tk95

Bringing India into the mix because of its shared border and tense history with China makes that a total of  Billion in military spending by US Allies alone therefore a coalition led by the US would have roughly just shy of  Trillion dollars to expend based on preconflict expenditures   Billion. Roughly  times that of a SinoRussian Alliance.  I didnt include Iraq Brazil or Saudi Arabia because these countries would not play any major role in any conflict on any side.     Regarding manpower this conflict would be unlike any weve ever experienced before so conscription would probably be mandatory I looked simply at Manpower that is deemed fit for service www.globalfirepower.com.

10995542,0,t1_dedc5k4,I think the militarys point of view is along the lines of Well if youre this efficient then you dont really need that much money. Its hard to describe the thinking within the military. Its just for lack of a better word different. My view as a civilian is that if you become more efficient and save money then you should be sought after and rewarded in some way not penalized. I dont really know what drives that attitude from the military side but I know it caused a lot of chaos on the contractor end.We had to log all hours on every project we touched even if it was to go over and help a coworker for  minutes. We put that  minutes on that code. Cool the military wants to track who is doing what on each project. The problem is that lets say I had a project to write up the instructions for an add on shield for a machine gun that sits on top of the tank. My boss says there is  hours allotted for the job. Bill next to me has  hours on his job but hes almost to zero and needs about  more.Now I can probably do the shield job in  hours but my boss says if we dont use it all then we will not get as much next project as we ask for. So Bill wraps his project up and puts the  on my code but now its only Wednesday and Bill needs to come up with hours for the rest of his work week so he puts another  on my job. Remember hes not actually done anything on my job but hes billing it. So I do it in  hours plus Bills  hours he charged but shoot they gave my project . We have to use that time up so the next week I basically sit around twiddling my thumbs instead of starting the next project. Not sure what Bills doing probably billing somebody elses project or starting something new.Thats the problem. Theres no incentive to be more efficient. We could have saved the army  hours of paid work on that job if there was some incentive like additional contracts or performance bonuses but were not going to lose money we would get anyway. Yet the militarys view is Wow! You guys did such a great job its clear you dont need as much money on the next one as you say you do.Its just all around a wasteful process.,dataisbeautiful,deeb6ud,1,t5_2tk95

Whether its true or not remains to be seen. However there are definitely issues with pedophiles both in govt and Hollywood which we are trying to draw attention to.

Infowars is like Buzzfeed you get good and bad. Check the sources and judge each claim on its merits not its outlet. Even Trump has established that Obama is a citizen we dont disagree either. Crime rates in general have lowered but there is a major problem with inner city crime which is what we talk about. and more Terrorism and immigration are long discussions to have but we can disagree without entering the realm of craziness on either side.So now weve established how a lot of your gripes are either inaccurate memes that you dont like or legitimate issues to talk about but not controversial.

11046919,0,t1_deju3pe,The consensus on what constitutes a good nights sleep keeps changing. It used to be that we needed  hours and now Ive heard more along the lines of whatever leaves you feeling rested. In my case as a  year old and which has been the same for the past decade I function best on  hours. Any more or less and I will probably want to take a nap at some point. However I think my case may be special over the past few years due to multiple persistent spinal injuries in that staying still for a full  hours asleep exacerbates my symptoms. A polyphasic xhrday schedule has proven the best physically but worst socially.However until you have a fully matured adult brain you should very likely be getting more than  hours a night as I fear so little may negatively affect your development. Im assuming you sleep so little because youre up late at night browsing reddit talking to friends gaming and not being very productive right?

So in order to get a better job you also need to take a risk and drive your expenses way up.And even then in places where home prices are skyrocketing wages certainly havent risen x like home prices have.  There are so many costs that are far outpacing wages and its really choking out a lot of people.I make a decent salary and I know I am incredibly fortunate to be in this position but I live in a city that makes it tough to save even though Im well over the median income.  Fortunately I have the option of moving elsewhere and keeping my salary and I probably will at some point which will really help me out.This isnt a common position and more and more people are being divided out into low wage  moderate cost of living and high wage  even higher cost of living.

11227356,0,t1_df4ll97,That argument would be great if were talking about mods. Were talking about games in the title post. For the longest time most of the community couldnt even acces mods Considering the vast number of console gamersComparing Zelda and Skyrim dungeons is moot. Zelda dungeons are  of the time puzzles with very minor If at all combat instances. The other  are Combat bosses or tutorials. Skyrim dungeons are places to loot and explore that sometimes offer lore tidbits.Theres no dungeons in Zelda where quests take place. In Zelda dungeons are a reward for quests. I would also argue the combat is way different. Say what you want but Skyrims combat system is rather simple. Zelda certainly isnt Ds. But both Zelda and Witcher have dodging blocking and parrying as part of your main combat. Skyrim has a shield but otherwise youre just swinging your sword. I would definitely say that Zelda is a better game than Skyrim judging by release state.In Zelda it always feels like I have something to do. Im doing this big quest uncorrupting a dragon. Then step  inch over the line see a temple in the distance and go visit. Or a random person pops up and asks me to do his quest. In Skyrim theres a lot less of that. Obviously you can still encounter side quests. But Zeldas world seems a lot more interactive. Having a huge world doesnt mean anything if  of it is emptyNow the fucking witcher . That game is hands down on the same level or even bigger than Zelda. The combat is nice fights have actual mechanics. Skyrims goes as deep as this enemy is weak to fire! In Zelda you actually aim for certain parts of the body like the eyes. But in The witcher you combine your signs weapons gear etc. all beforehand and theres never a dull moment. Wether it be a power stone some chestgear etc.,dataisbeautiful,df4ltyg,5,t5_2tk95

The landlords property manager didnt like him on a personal level because of his background so on the day she was supposed to sign the renewal instead she shows up with a notice that says get out now.He calls me and I tell him since he has lived there over a year she needs to give him a  day notice. She refuses and says she will sue. He has his rent check literally in his hand and says here is Januarys rent Ill be out by February . She says no. She then makes a big show of offering his roommate to sign the renewal as long as he agrees to not allow my client to live there.Like I said. It was personal and ridiculous.So true to her work she files the eviction a week later. I fought the case filed every motion and propounded discovery. The trial court bent over backwards for the landlord and did everything in its power to break the law in the landlords favor which just forced me to file appeals which further delayed things.In the end there was a show trial where the judge suppressed evidence that would have made the case a slam dunk kept the notice issue from the jury and basically rigged everything in the LLs favor.So the LL won and got to eat k in attorney fees she tried to get them by motion after and lost and something like k in lost rent.All because she wanted to show off how big her dick was.

11388928,0,t1_dfmvqaa,Okay Ill try to explain that the way I interpreted it. So one poll askedgt Would you like to see gun laws in this country made more strict less strict or remain as they are?In   replied Total Satisfied  Dissatisfied want stricter  Dissatisfied want less strict  Dissatisfied keep the same  No opinionIm not sure this is the best measure or question as its a little confusing. I mean are there really  who are dissatisfied yet want things kept the same? This measure tells me that some peoples opinions are more complex or nuanced than the available answers allowed them to express. Statistics are only a partial representation of the truth.However this stat does suggest there are more people who want stricter control laws than less strict laws by a sizable margin  vs. . Then theres that  Total satisfied. Well theres no sliding scale responders could reply with only  general categories. It could well be that ths of this  are indeed totally satisfied but also that the other th is really mostly satisfied but might also support or be fine with stricter laws. But people with that kind of opinion werent given a could category to check there mark in.The second question wasgt In general do you feel that the laws covering the sale of firearms should be made more strict less strict or kept as they are now?In   responded with More strict  Less strict  Kept as now  No opinion.So this stat seems to verify that the two largest groups of opinion are that gun laws should be more strict OR gun laws should be kept the same. In the first poll  fell under those categories while in the second poll  fell in one of those categories. The much smaller opinion around  in both polls is that gun laws should be less strict.So lets make some deductions while looking at both polls. Lets take the minimums and conclude that at least  want stricter control laws while at least  support the current laws being kept unchanged. Combined this would account for  of the total while we can also conclude that at least  broadly agree with at least one of these groups. So somewhere between  and  of the total are probably in the gray area between groups. Maybe they even agree with one group one day and another group on the other but they probably do not hold the strongest opinions on the matter.And always keep in mind theres some margin of error at most it could be around . Even accounting for the largest feasible margin of error its still evident that those who support stricter gun control outnumber those who want reduced control by about  to . But also mind that a large group are at least mostly satisfied with current laws.SO! To your second comment! ... Yes that is interesting that people are less interested in stricter gun control than they were in the early s. Well I would theorize that the high support for greater control at that time was related to the record number of gun violence in the late s. Gun violence peaked in the United States around  and has been declining ever since good news right!?. In  the Clinton administration pushed Congress to pass the Federal Assault Weapons Ban one of the strongest gun control measures ever enforced in the U.S. With the ban or without it though gun violence has declined consistently through the Clinton Bush and Obama presidencies. The lower level of violence we currently experience I believe has affected and reduced the number of people who feel the need to enforce greater control measures.,dataisbeautiful,dfmwzul,1,t5_2tk95

11423884,1,t1_dfqrhuv,You dont know the answer? Yet you continue to argue.  Lets back up. What is the primary role of a st century government? Ill give you a hint it isnt to govern.  What is the primary purpose of the Constitution? Ill give you another hint it isnt to outline how our leaders should lead.You could say it the government is a mediator but leadership is not a required trait. All a st century government is or should be is a reflection of the people.  Currently the US government on all levels is just a reflection of corporate interests.  So unless you are a corporation you are not representative.The government does not run the country. The people run country and the government should just reflect us.It was not misandrist nor racist. Misandry is hatred of men as a man this is a not started. And it is not racism first I am white on a side note I am also wealthy and white though not yet old. Racism is the belief that one race is superior than another and again that is not implied to false away logically from what I said.  There was no judgment there was just an observation that at some point the people in government SHOULD necessarily be something OTHER than rich white and old.My statement was observational and pragmatic. That is it.  Yours the racist and misandrist is strangely also bigoted as you assumeinferredimagined that I stated something against men. And I didnt. You should learn to read. That may be why you dont understand what bigotry misandry and racism are. Or maybe just grow up. Not everything in this world you disagree with has a sharply pointed label.  In a lot of cases the majority it is just people that think more than you or in this case just have quite a lot more experience and perspective presenting you with an idea you are unaware of even the possibility of.,dataisbeautiful,dfqvwep,-1,t5_2tk95

11651193,0,t1_dggmvps,No not that. The activities of the US as a worldplayer are very different from those of the Netherlands. Im not saying the federal gov is doing either its best or the best it could do but in geopolitical terms its path is pretty clear cut.Im taking from George Friedmans work when saying that if the US wants to keep a power position its ultimately supposed to create constant upheaval in places of the world that are close to its immediate rivals. Take the Middle East to think that the US wants peace and prosperity there is childish in this view. The Russians have a stake in that area and its up to the US army to make sure the Middle East isnt left under the influence of Russia or other big powers for that matter. Boots on the ground are only meant to keep issues contained not solve them edit because it keeps the Russians  other local powers occupied making them spend money on tackling systemic issues.Taking the argument to its logical end a lot of money needs to be allocated to an agile and dynamic system of armed forces  money the US is willing to pay but others might or could not.This approach seems fair to me even if a bit bloated. The Netherlands doesnt play a similar role so Im apprehensive of comparing the two cases just by looking at budget allocation. ,dataisbeautiful,dggodro,1,t5_2tk95
