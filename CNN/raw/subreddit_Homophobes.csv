4415121,0,t3_3bb2wx,Straight guy here. I just wanted to say thank you. A whole bunch of us are very happy about the decision and have supported your rights the entire time. The whole Facebook thing is ridiculous to me. First of all most of my friends who rainbowed their profile pic dont really give a shit but want to show everyone that theyre not assholes and they have always accepted gays. Its just for show. Its like when a girl who has no friends and is bullied suddenly commits suicide and all of a sudden she gets so much love and support on facebook from all the people who never even talked to her.  Ive been hissed at called names and threatened by quite a few gays in gay town Chicago simply for walking and holding hands with my girlfriend who lived there. Ive been harassed by gay guys who would try to convince me to just try it when I would try and support my gay friends by going to a gay bar with them instead of the usual places we go and then I would be told I dont belong there and that I should stick to my straight bars.  I fucking know that there are a lot of people from both sides who are just complete assholes and are ruining this event for everyone. Whether its unnecessary protesting Its done people you wont change anything so why waste your time? or aggressive Haha I told you so.   ,Homophobes,csnbhen,1,t5_2zzih
