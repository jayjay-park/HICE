29087,0,t1_cehmeaq,She was way underpaid oh my god. She charged  for everything.She helped me schedule the day because Ive been to like two weddings and had no idea what to do. We met for dinner about  weeks before the wedding she taught me so much! She remembered all kinds of things I would never have thought about grand entrance specifically! who knew!. She ran our rehearsal dinner the night before the wedding her big quote was Im the boss you guys can leave her alone now. She was assertive but totally friendly it was great. She actually emailed me a few times making sure I didnt need help with anything else but I felt like I didnt know what to ask because I was so not experienced. Dayof she managed all of the staff. She made sure all the furniture was where it was supposed to be there was staff from the venue to set it up but we brought a few pieces ourselves that she set uppresent table guestbook table escort card table. She scattered the puzzle pieces we used as aisle petals the little hooks with succulents and sign that went across the aisle set up all of the tables the cupcakedessert table basically everything decor she set up. We didnt have proper flowers  heres some pix or anything but any decor she and her assistant set up. She also took a few boxes of the decor the day before so we didnt have to bring it with us the next morning.She kept everything on schedule and was the one with my iPhone actually playing the music and shoving us out on time. She also kinda ushered us out after so we were able to take photos without being bombarded. She made sure we actually ate and drank during the reception.She helped with all of the clean up packed up our cake for us and leftovers from dinner we were flying out at am that next morning the leftovers that nightmorning were a lifesaver. She passed out all of the tipsfinal payments and loaded all of the decor and such in my BFF and moms cars. I cant even tell you how relaxed I was RE getting things done that day. I always pictured myself setting up everything and getting it done myself because Im kind of type A lately oh nursing school! but I actually walked around the venue several timesthe bridal suite was on site so we got half of our makeuphair done at the hotel that morning the rest thereand she totally had it under control and there was nothing to do. I had this really strange moment where I just looked around and was like holy shit this is a WEDDING. Oh and my favorite of her selling pointsshe had me give her a list of who was allowed to have the mic. She got to be bossy for me that day so I could actually enjoy it. None of my family was stressed out at all having to get things ready literally the biggest burden any of them had was my mom stopping to buy some balloons to tie to our Up! mailbox that I painted and my BFF driving the rest of the decor with him that morning. That was it.She was amazing and absolutely the best money we spent. And Im a huge DIY cheap ass.,weddingplanning,cehqsbc,7,t5_2rv3t

Theres a huge bit of budget saved in buying a  dress as opposed to a  one.gt Flowers? But I like flowers.Sure if its nonnegotiable leave them in but if youre actually serious about budgeting then it might be worth considering minimising the use of them. gt The invitations including Save the Dates etc. that I like are a couple thousand dollars but Im betting I can get my fianc to design something similar and use one of his printer people to do that for us.Seriously? The invites and save the dates are a couple of thousand dollars???? Where ON EARTH are you looking?

279501,1,t1_cf9pe8c,I was explaining the reality of her situation which is . great and a couple people being annoying.  Thats not rude to remind people to focus on all the good or give some perspective.I find that jealousy is often the fallback explanation for those who want to stifle guilt they feel for their selfish spending.  I have zero interest in a giant ostentatious wedding with way too much food diamonds everywhere and a  grand cake.  Im not jealous of those who have them because I find that kind of spending to be distasteful.  Just because you can afford expensive stuff doesnt mean thats its a good or virtuous use of your money.  I see someone who spent k on a car and I think  how wasteful that money could have helped people but instead you spent it all selfishly.  I think Berkin bags are ridiculous and I simply would never buy one regardless of my personal income.  I dont feel any different about lavish weddings.  I just dont like conspicuous consumption and gluttony is not virtuous.  Personally if I won the lotto tomorrow I couldnt walk around with k on my finger knowing thats more than most people make in a year.  Some people can and I dont get how they can make the disconnect.  Maybe I have too much left over Catholic guilt but I dont see spending tons of money as being anything worthy of praise.  Spending is easy.  Being humble and thinking of better uses for money than diamonds and Crystal is harder.  ,weddingplanning,cf9qe93,0,t5_2rv3t

332956,0,t3_1xwinu,well having children changes someone  no doubt. the degree of that change is dependent upon how they deal with it. some women like my sister embrace it and  totally let it become their whole life. its kind of like the im more important because i have kids attitude that you mention although at least in my experience is more nothing else matters except my kid and my kids needs  so as you can imagine is very frustrating. my sister and I used to be very close but have drifted significantly. im moving crosscountry with my fiance. my parents say I should reconsider. my friends say I should give here another chance. my sister says ok see ya! could not give a shit. and its the same for the wedding. mines labor day weekend across the country. i demand that my fiance ask my sister to be a bridesmaid  and my sister acceptsthen refusesnow is unsure same thing with whether or not her daughter will be a flower girl. its just frustrating. now im not a woman less a woman with a child but i think its a pretty shitty way to behave. so ive talked with her about it. no change. so theres nothing really to do about it. i want her to stop being a bitch and be a team player. but she refuses. what can i do? nothing. i want her to get past herself for one weekend but she wont. what do i do? keep doing what i want because thats all i can do thats all i have control over. theres no point in appealing to her sensitivities because some people unfortunately just dont care.what it comes down to is that some people are just really selfish. and they feel justified in this selfishness because its on behalf of their children. its a scam really. i cant tell you how many times my sister has avoided important events with this baby excuse justification. like the holidays this year. probably our last opportunity to celebrate them as a family and bails with some baby excuse. on one hand i say to myself well i cant imagine how difficult it must be i dont have a child i wouldnt know but heres the caveat in my mind EVERYWHERE I GO I SEE PEOPLE WITH KIDS NOT LOSING THEIR SHIT! i mean when i was in grad school i had the distinct pleasure of becoming best friends with the single mother of two one child was an infanttoddler and you know what  still managed to not be a selfish bitch! Another few friends of mine who have children similarly dont let control their lives in that matter. hell during those holidays one of the saddest moments for me was when my fiance my mother and i were attending services and what do we see in the back of the room? new mothers standing in the back holding their children calming them down coming in and and out of the room to avoid disturbance. it was at that moment i became incensed because i saw how some mothers decided acting like an adult means something different than how it does to my sister. unfortunately.well that was a lot longer than expected. i guess that was more for me than for you. cathartic. anyways if youve read this much hopefully youll read a little further...I would leave your sister alone and wait or her to get back to you. In the alternative you could delegate the responsibility to your maid of honor thats what theyre there for. if shes anything like my sister she is she wouldnt really respond by calling mom   or anyone else for that matter  less her husband. Ive had more success getting my sister to stop being a crazy self absorbed you know what by influencing my brother in law. its always a tough call because in order to get what you want you may have to act in a way you dont  and then you have to decide if its worth it. sometimes it is and sometimes it isnt  only you can know. as far as what level should you be upset  red? orange? ? i mean its your wedding. and your sister is not going to show? i for one think weddings are such a huge part of your life. the one time when you get everyone that you care about it one room. this is not a th birthday or a barmitzvah where sure you have the people who are very close or local to the venue show up this is the big one. this is the event you have people coming in from across the country hell across the world. it shows you who your real friends are. like for me having my wedding across the country was a scary proposition because i KNOW that some people wont make the trip. but it is also telling because the ones that really want to be there will be there. so we will see who actually shows up.but yeah i would say the balls in her court. you shouldnt have time for anyone who doesnt have time for you. its just like dating or any other relationship. dont respect anyone who doesnt respect you. without mutual respect someone you are just being treated shitty. and thats bad for the soul. tldr your sister sucks as does mine. keep on keeping on and dont let this diva fuck your shit up.,weddingplanning,cffa562,5,t5_2rv3t

379963,0,t3_1yessl,Obviously Im not doing any of that yet but I like to help out but sorry if this is not in line of what you are looking for.  Most issues with vendors I see and due to the fact that they dont work the way you expect them to.  For example Im a computer girl I will always always always prefer email contact over phone.  If I had a vendor that would never reply my emails and made me call them all the time I would cross them out.  It doesnt work for me.Organization such as a clean list of services and what they charge you for it is key for any serious vendor.  I would not sign with someone who would list their services for me.Communication is also so important.  How are you going to trust the vendor if they dont even talk to you?I think that if you are paying and you put in writing contract usually that something needs to be this way it has to be this way.  Im sure I will be agressive with vendors when my time comes.,weddingplanning,cfk5cy0,5,t5_2rv3t

Facebook invite people so you dont have to worry about contacting each person to find out if theyre going or not. Make it a really laid back type of thing. The only thing you might think to provide are some drinks non alcoholic and a small cake to celebrate. You can just get a grocery store cake so it wont cost much but will still be delicious.

I always visit the area the week of the th of July and Thanksgiving so Ive had to schedule any vendor appointments during those times and try to get everything done in one go. Other than that Ive had to communicate with my vendors via email and phone only which has been challenging but manageable it at least gives me a paper trail which Ive had to fall back on a few times already.As far as traveling nobody in my family seems upset about having to travel but I think its because of the tropical location. Most of them are making a vacation out of it actually. On the other hand I feel like its more of an inconvenience to our friends especially those in the wedding party who have to be there early for the rehearsal dinner. Were trying to make things easier on them by paying for the hotel rooms. They are all acting excited for the wedding though so if anyone is unhappy about the situation then we have no idea about it.,weddingplanning,cfpfodr,3,t5_2rv3t

542275,0,t3_20cf5p,We have a tent but our wedding is this weekend and its relatively chilly at night ...and of course..spring..who knows about rain etc... So the tent was more for keeping everyone in one nonwindy place so that nobody was too cold once the sun went down. For you it seems like you will need the tent for shade which would be awesome since the bulk of your wedding is during the day. If you were having it start around PM Id say forget the tent but sun and or rain will not be your friend on the day. Everyone will either have to be walking around with umbrellas or donning giant sunglasses and squinting. I know tents are kind of ugly... BUT no one really notices how ugly they are once they are filled with tablesfoodchairs and you! I know its a sucky investment..our venue couldnt stake either. Just remember that the tent people may have to set up a day or two before and you will have to arrange with your venue about that to make sure they can let you otherwise you may have to pay another fee. Maybe there is another area of the wedding you could skimp a bit on...china? glasses? linens? chairs? flowersu are outside...dont need too many right? etc.. And if youre real lucky you can check to see if a bride who is also getting married in the same week would like to split the cost of the tent with you!Just think about what you would feel like in your venue without a tent if it happened to be a really hot or rainy day. If that area is very dry and if the oak really does provide great coverage than dont stress...but have a rain plan for sure! Good luck!!! Congrats!,weddingplanning,cg1wvnq,3,t5_2rv3t

550227,0,t3_20f1rn,I had so many ideas that got shot down by my family but Ive been able to cope with it by reminding myself that their reasons are valid. Idea  was an ice rink wedding. Our first date was at an ice rink and so were many dates after that and we got engaged after an ice skating date so I wanted to have that theme. I still think it wouldve been a great idea but my parents thought it was weird and were worried about all our elderly family being too cold.Idea  was to get married at the top of a ski mountain in the fall. But everyone would have to ride the chairlift up and most of my family is afraid of heights. So that one was vetoed pretty much immediately.So we got married at a beautiful hotel in the mountains and took all our wedding party photos on ice!

600927,0,t3_20zw1s,I dunno.  I am having a wedding at a winery at pm on a Saturday.  I dont see why anyone would want to take their kids to a winery at  pm on a Saturday.  Im doing the whole thing w the invitations where I just write who is invited on the invitation and if their kids name isnt on there I hope they get the hint because I dont want to put an arbitrary age limit out there.  I am inviting kids I am close with and the youngest is  and at an age where I know she wont randomly scream.  I also have an aunt with a special needs kid over  years old that definitively will scream and doesnt do well with baby sitters so I have to allow him and hope someone thinks to take him outside if he starts having a fit.  But I dont want to say no kids under  because that feels a bit tacky.  My problem is that I got engaged last September and am getting married in October of this year and ever since I announced my engagement I cant get together with a friend without her announcing she is pregnant.  If I allow babies there will literally be  kinds under  months old at my wedding and at least half under  months.  I just dont know what to do without alienating a bunch of friendsfamily.

616700,0,t1_cgad5og,I have to agree with the other advice... You need to ensure both sides are making cuts equally. I personally wanted flowers. So I put a large portion of our budget to flowers. I didnt want videography so we dont have that. Its all a matter of give and take. My fianc wanted good food and an open bar so he was at every venue meeting and had major input. The important thing is to not get stressed from the start. The two of you need to make these decisions together and he cant shoot down everything you like because that will seriously get you nowhere. Other than that put your DIY cap on and space out your projects over the next  months. You will still have a magical day even if youre wearing a sack at the court house because youre marrying your best friend! Besides the flowers  everything at our wedding is targeted towards the guests. We are playing their wedding songs throughout the night and ensuring that they feel welcomed and know how honored we are that they chose to celebrate with us. At the end of the day... Its just that. One day. You and your fianc have your entire lives together. Dont let one day cause you this much stress. ,weddingplanning,cgadbv4,6,t5_2rv3t

644718,0,t3_21is06,Sending hugs and support!  Sometimes people just want to make drama and are set on disrupting everyone elses day.  I agree with the other suggestions to just limit your contact.  Go to the bridal shower but leave if she starts making a fuss.  If you limit your contact you are also limiting the information she gets.  If she brings it up that you havent told her anything new about the wedding you could either just change the subject or you can tell her that you got the impression she doesnt care for your preferences for your big day because she is set on wearing the white dress and you didnt want to cause trouble.  If that makes sense at all.For the flower girls it depends on how much energy you want to put into it.  You could talk to the girls mom and tell her how important it is to you that they are a part of the wedding and would love if they could share the morning of the wedding with the rest of the bridal party getting ready.  Just be prepared for a fuss from FMIL although you could say the same thing to her and extend the invitation for her to have the stylist come to where ever you are if youre not going to a salon. Then she still have special hair she still gets that control but shes there with you and you can always give a suggestion to the stylist who may be more receptive to your opinion as you are the bride.  Just an idea depends on what reactions would be.Let her wear the dress if shes set on it.  Shell be the stupid looking one.  You can even see if your photographer could change the colour in the pictures if.  You can do amazing things with editing now. Good luck take care of yourself dont let her get the best of you! ,weddingplanning,cgdjzbe,2,t5_2rv3t

Sure enough monitoring my water intake and cutting out the chips made a huge difference.  It turns out my main problem was I was taking all of my time to take care of work and other people and details and didnt have any left to care of myself and had been walking around dehydrated for months.

You think I need to think about the message a honeymoon registry sends about me... I think you need to think about the message your judgement sends about you.  You think asking for money is rude.  I think letting a few dollars destroy your mood and good time as well as others as misery seems to always love company is rude.

My biggest worry is that if I dont get a digital copy and my photographer was to move or something it would make it harder to get copies of my photos.

If you need a polite reason why say the venue security needs them as a formality or something. Just remember that if you let this go this sets a precedent for whos in control of your married life at the end of the day as well. Oh you think something is important but FMIL doesnt?

Everyone can have their opinion and I respected the OP by not posting this as a reply as she was specifically asking about what to do to honor mothers. Me posting Mothers Day weddings are rude would not have been helpful to her.

843375,0,t3_23sg1l,We kind of threw our own engagement party and by kind of I mean we asked if we could use my fiancees parents home but we did all the planning. Came up with a guest list of about  people and we had about  show up. We just did evites to make it easy and asked people to rsvp just so we knew how much food to get. We did a beach theme for ours because we got engaged on the beach made all of our own decorations and such I enlisted my bridal party to help out painting one day. For food we kept it pretty easy went to bulk barn and got a bunch of candy like salt water taffy and such and I also made my own cake pops for it. We did vendor themed food of stuff you would find at the beach ie. fish and chips which we ordered in pretzels baked and corn dogs bulk from costco. For drinks we got a little keg of beer and also bought pop and such as well as a signature cocktail we came up with. We also had lais and a place to sign little paper boats and put them in the pool! It ended up being pretty low cost for it all around  for everything!. If you want to take a look ive added some pictures HERE Good luck with everything!

But it was so thin that it almost seemed fragile. If you can find it somewhere else and its a bit thicker go for it. But I ultimately decided against it because my engagement ring trumped it and its not even a very big ring and I think yours will too judging by your photo. Just be careful about buying online. I cant speak for other rings that are a similar style but that one in particular was verrryyyy dainty. I have seen rings similar to this on etsy. I think theyre called eye rings or bead and eye when it alternates that shape with a round diamond. Like this To answer your question I ultimately got my band from Helzberg.

This has to happen and with the highest up person in the hotel.  If you really really dont want to I strongly advise against it then Ill help you with the email more specifically than the items below.  Your first paragraph needs to be the summary of the email.  State your problem and the consequence no response from hotel staff is causing me to withhold payment until resolved a dedicated point of contact in hotel management is provided and meetings held to resolve the outstanding issues  Detail again what the consequences will be in the last paragraph and reiterate what you want.  Resolving a laundry list of issues is really fixed by them giving you a managerial point person who will be responsive to you.  Use bullet points to reduce wall of text of the issues youve got detailed.Its a very good email but when you get a lot of them youre going to skim it.  You read the first and the last paragraphs.That being said email is a very passive way to address a very significant issue.  You should have a face to face meeting with a specific management person in the hotel.  Not another worker bee but management.Otherwise youre going to keep having the same issues that you posted about a week or so ago with no resolution.  ,weddingplanning,chhymum,2,t5_2rv3t

1066617,0,t1_chp6o7h,If this was so important for your mom to be a part of your wedding then you messed up by eloping. But that is in the past the mistake is made and the best course of action is to tell your family the truth and stop pretending. Im very sorry to hear about your mothers illness but how will pretending to plan a wedding help? That may be what you always imagined but maybe it isnt what she imagined. So be honest with her. Tell her you guys eloped and say that if it is important to her to see you get married you would be honored to plan a vow renewal with her. Pretending to have a wedding is just a waste of money and time. The point of a wedding is to get married and you got married. So unless your marriage isnt real atop holding our for a real wedding. You already had a real wedding. ,weddingplanning,chpj1w2,1,t5_2rv3t

YouTube tutorials things like that really make things easier as far as application goes. Make sure you really get a good matte foundation and a setting powder to keep from having shiny face in the pictures and BRUSHES! Brushes make all the difference in how it comes out.

1099335,0,t1_cht4ng5,This sounds like the right advice.  Count the people you know will be booking there since they are in the party or immediate family you know needs a place and will stay there.  If the price is comparable to the other places most people will book there to be where the rest of the family is but I would count on those you know will book there and the rest of you have to accept as possibly be your own expense as part of the venue cost.  Then everyone who books there will be less expense.  If its too much to cover those rooms then look somewhere else.,weddingplanning,cht8zol,2,t5_2rv3t
1099945,0,t1_chstljt,I posted somewhere else that our wedding will be like k hopefully less but definitely over k and we have absolutely zero hookups. But when you include our honeymoon and my engagement ring that total goes up to over k. Then if you add in the traditional things that were skipping altogether like hiring a florist and having professional hairmakeup done it would come pretty damn close to the national average. Im skipping those entirely to save money but I agree with you that it would be much nicer to have someone else do flowers so I could just relax with friendsfamily.Traditional weddings are just fucking expensive. Catering is expensive booze is expensive the dresses are expensive. If you want a modest but standard wedding ie not a backyard potluck it adds up really fast.  And naturally things vary a lot.

Most everyone had a great time oohing and aahing at the dresses and taking pictures. Also I was reasonably fast at changing in and out so there wasnt a lot of down time for everyone.Also to add while i was changing i had family wander around and pull more dresses for me. Dress shopping isnt something people do every day so I think they will have fun Also youll probably hear a lot of people rag on DB.

Why not set aside a time each week make it the same day and time if you can where you can both sit and talk about it for minhour so its not overwhelming for him to make sure youre both on the same page for planning and what not. This way it may not seem to him of you asking or constantly reminding him to do things! Hope that helps and best of luck with the rest of planning! add on here!

Heres some things we did  Friend of the brides dad did the cooking for the buffetstyle wedding dinner. Other friends of parents and the parents themselves helped out to prepare food for the rest of the weekend. It was lots of cold salads and grilled meatsveggies!  Parents of the bride and groom grew flowers in the months before the wedding. We made all of the bouquets and boutineers the morning of the wedding. Those flowers were also used as the aisle decorations in vases and then moved to the picnic tables as centerpieces.   We all did our own hair and makeup.   The DJ was a friend of theirs playing music in the lodge.  The bar was wine and beer that the couple brought. When something ran out it was out.  There was no bartender  people just poured what they wanted.  Favors were little bottles of a seasoning mix that the couple made  like a BBQ dry rub.  People cleaned up after themselves  no hired hands to pay for. This couple didnt provide too many activities. Many people brought their own lawn games or board games but mostly people hung out kids ran around people swam in the lake throughout the weekend... just being at a campground is fun so you dont have to go overboard with providing entertainment.  Maybe have some balls soccer nerf etc around for people to play with... or some smores stuff if you will have a fire but besides that? People will mingle and have fun. In your invites you can remind people that camping is fun and that they should feel free to bring their fun camping stuff.,weddingplanning,ci4yzum,1,t5_2rv3t

1208880,0,t3_27y5x9,I had the same issue. I ended up buying my size  shoes  on the Davids Bridal website. It doesnt specify that it is a wide width but their shoes run wider. It was shipped to my door and came in white. Then I physically took them to the store and paid  to get them dyed Lapis darker purple. The bad thing is that you cannot try them on in the store because the selection is limitted and they hardly ever have larger or wide sizes. The bad part is that you have to buy them first before you can even try them but the store can exchange them for you and give you a refund if they dont fit or you dont like them. It is hard to envision the shoe in purple when the only pictures are white but that was really the best option for me. Also it was super on sale amp I couldnt beat that. They have other styles and other shades of purple dye. It does take  weeks to get them dyed though. I get my shoes back on the th and cant wait to see them. My bridesmaids all have DB shoes in Lapis except one that is having a hard time finding a more narrow shoe. She might end up with something a little different but Im okay with that. Id rather they be comfortable.,weddingplanning,ci5m8bu,1,t5_2rv3t

At best theyre going to be pissed and make it a miserable experience.  At worst they can tell you to leave.  Theres no good outcome when your wedding day rolls around and your venue realizes that youve been lying to them.I think youd be better off booking a place that doesnt charge differently for weddings.

I guess I can think of a few things that I wouldnt have preferred but they didnt really make much of an overall impact. A tree did give off a big visible puff of pollen during the ceremony and I thought to myself I cant believe Im getting jizzed on by a tree during my wedding. On the upside my SIL interpreted it as a fertility blessing and fanned it on herself. Heres hoping for nibling . Oh I woke up that morning with a rash on my face later spread I am thinking it was poison ivy but after a bit of concealer you couldnt even tell.For me the worst part was the nervousness in the morning. My mom ordered subs for lunch and I remember eating half of mine and then trying to figure out if I would prefer to eat the second half or throw up the first. I spent about  minutes between the first guests arriving and the ceremony pacing about the upstairs.The rest of the day completely blew all the badness away. The outpouring of love was incredible. The things I worried about were all fine... the beer was good the super simple flower arrangements were lovely the bunting that was such a pain in the a was totally worth it the food was delicious the band was good lots of people danced. Ive always thought of myself as cute I guess or attractive... enough and was nervous I would look silly in the hairmakeup I selected or juvenile in my short dress. I ended up feeling really beautiful and was surprised how much that meant to me. There was also an open mic deal for toasting that was extremely touching and cut off before it dragged on too much. We stayed up late sitting around the fire with the last stragglers some of my family and longdistance friends who hit it off heartwarmingly fast just sipping homebrew and solving the worlds problems.

Ill tell you what I did and maybe itll work for you. FH was going to be crazy busy at work until Xmas so we picked a later date that we thought would give us plenty of time. I started looking at venues just for fun and some of them were already booked for my date almost  years out! We ended up booking a venue pretty early. You should also determine the general number of guests and the budget because that will narrow your venue search. And as dangerous as the Pinterest rabbit hole can be it is great for getting a vision of the type of wedding you want or the details for the image already in your head. I went a little crazy and pinned everything I even remotely liked. But then as time went on I was able to narrow it into something more cohesive and deleted a lot of my pins.As for the bridesmaids thing I chose mine right away because Ive known them all for  to  years. My MOH actually lives in my city and its been nice having someone to ask for advice when I get confused she got married last year. I also sent a group email explaining they would be invited to parties but not to stress about flying out for them. I really just want them there when I get married. Everything else is gravy.

I bought some decorations on Amazon made some DIY lighting  we are planning on buying meat and alcohol at Costco and asking some people to bring sides. I think we will have about  people altogether so fairly small. I will probably bake a cake and we told people there was no need for presents since I didnt want to seem like we are giftgrabbing since we are throwing it ourselves. The reason we wanted to throw a little party is our engagement is going to be about a year got engaged this May and getting married next May and wanted to be able to celebrate a bit before next year since we figure the shower and BachelorBachelorette parties will be in the spring. Also surprise bonus its our dogs first birthday that weekend too! So we are going to incorporate that into the party as well. Everything will only be around  or so and that includes decorations that we can also use at the wedding. Were not really inviting much family since if we invited some we would have to invite everyone and we want to keep it small. So just our parents and siblings and some other close friends. Weve given ourselves plenty of time so not really stressed out at all its more fun for me to plan and its something closer that we can focus on than the wedding since that is pretty far out. ,weddingplanning,cj0dtr8,2,t5_2rv3t

1500843,0,t1_cj4eh0r,wrong. gtAlthough many exceed the minimum the bridesmaids required duties are very limited. They are required to attend the wedding ceremony and to assist the bride on the day of the wedding. Bridesmaids in Europe and North America are often asked to assist the bride with planning the wedding and a wedding reception. In modern times a bridesmaid often participates in planning weddingrelated events such as a bridal shower or bachelorette party if there are any. These however are optional activities according to etiquette expert Judith Martin Contrary to rumor bridesmaids are not obliged to entertain in honor of the bride nor to wear dresses they cannot afford. If it is customary in the brides area to have a bridesmaids luncheon then it is hosted and therefore organized and paid for by the bride. A junior bridesmaid has no responsibilities beyond attending the wedding.my maids planned a kick ass bridal shower and bachelorette and helped me every step of the way. did they have to? no way! was it awesome? hell yeah.,weddingplanning,cj4ekmx,8,t5_2rv3t

1562539,0,t3_2c5aww,I really havent seen too many MotherSon dances so it wouldnt make me think something is missing but maybe others would.  For us neither of our parents like the attention so my wife danced with her father for about  seconds then my mom and I joined in and about  seconds later the DJ was to invite all guests to dance with their kids.  It was enough time to spend a moment with our parents get individual photos with our parents but not put too much pressure on anyone.  Our DJ effed it up though and instead invited all married couple up at that point but I still think it was good plan.  I think it wouldve been nice for everyone to be able to dance with their kids plus it would get a lot of people on the dance floor.  We just played the song that my wife and her father was special to them. I think it was On the Street Where You Live.

1615319,0,t3_2ct6r4,Lets start with sex. I would wager that in even the healthiest most functional relationships there is good sex and there is bad sex. Stress can be a major mood killer for both of you and it sounds like there is plenty of stress to go around. So while a rotten sex life right now might seem dismal I would feel confident in saying that it will certainly get better and at some other point in your relationship it might get worse. But I definitely wouldnt worry that a sudden prewedding cooling off period is a harbinger of a life of bad sex forever.Now your FMIL sounds like a disaster. She sounds manipulative and abusive. On the bright side weddings tend to bring out the worst in people. It is a BIG planning event and even my warm sweet laidback mother has had poutyfits over me using silk flowers and online RSVPs. Throw someone with a more controlling personality into the mix and it can get very contentious very quickly.So while this family might seems superpsycho right now try to remember that in real life it is not likely to be so intense all the time. On the flip side of course she might maintain her current course but it will be easier to avoiddeal with her when youre not constantly talking about and planning for a big family event. Either way FH will probably have to step in at some point and lay down the law with his stepmother and tell her to back off of you...if he cant or wont do that I dont see it as a good sign but he might also feel a bit braver about it after the stress of the wedding has worn off.Obviously as a random internet stranger I am in no position to tell you what to do. But if I was you I would try to remember how things were before the wedding craziness set in since life is likely to go back to that after the wedding is over.Either way I truly wish you the best.,weddingplanning,cjis091,19,t5_2rv3t

That said when the big day arrives I currently anticipate having about kk that I will have left owing. I have a budget now that allows for me to pay off k worth of debt in  months following the wedding. There were time constraints and a host of other reasons that I did not want to put the wedding off. I would say dont let yourself feel pressured to spend x amount of dollars and dont spend more than you can afford. spend a lot of time coming up with a budget that works for you and your current financial situation and dont get pressured to spend more than that. I was comfortable taking on a little bit of manageable debt in my wedding process with the key word being manageable.

1660309,0,t3_2d6jel,Im so sorry to hear about your mom. My cousin whom I used to be very close to before he experienced the full onset of his symptoms has paranoid schizophrenia. I called him to confirm his RSVP and man... it was bad. Without going into too much detail I felt like I was not having a conversation with him I was having a conversation with whatever demons had taken him from us. I got off the phone and just cried because my stupid wedding was so low on the list of priorities he needs to have right now. He is also refusing to get help. There are good days and bad days and lately the bar for good days has been lowered.Does she have a therapist or case manager you can talk to? It turns out that my cousins case manager wouldnt approve of him coming to the wedding. He would have to travel to an unfamiliar location and be in a crowded room full of people he didnt know. These are both major triggers for paranoid episodes for him so his therapist said there was absolutely no way she could approve of him going to the wedding given his current mental state. Its possible especially if you mom has been rejecting treatment that it could be in her best interest not to attend.You are absolutely correct about not feeding into her delusions. Something we learned very quickly with my cousin is that the moment you begin severing the few ties to reality he has the more quickly he spirals out of control. In my cousins case the delusions are a source of panic and fear for him. Feeding and legitimizing them causes major panic attacks that can cause him to become violent to himself or others. Schizophrenia manifests differently in every person but I think in the vast majority of cases feeding the delusions is a good way to make a bad situation worse. From what you described your moms delusions dont seem to be frightening her which is good. However it seems like your FMIL does not grasp the severity of your mothers condition and seems to think that playing pretend will make it possible for everyone to enjoy their time at the wedding.Do not feel guilty about prioritizing your mothers wellbeing over the appearance of your guest list. If she is not accepting help the chances that shell be mental present during your wedding are slim. Hang in there. I know my situation doesnt equate to yours but if you need someone to talk to who has the experience of planning a wedding while worrying about a loved one suffering from schizophrenia feel free to PM me.,weddingplanning,cjog0gj,1,t5_2rv3t

I would check out those kinds of places because you can generally get a more inexpensive ring and make payments so maybe you can up your price a bit more if you had  months to pay it off.Heres a couple I found one and two They often have really good sales too!,weddingplanning,cjuwgl0,4,t5_2rv3t

I didnt have a cake  we did a dessert bar.  And I set it up  week before the wedding.  youre not even behind schedule with this one.  ring  go to overstock.com and note that there are literally hundreds of simple elegant rings for like  that will be at your door in days so no problem.  plus I dont even have a wedding ring.  He just gave me my engagement ring in the ceremony because i like it too much to muddy it with a second band.    Flowers die!  And fall flowers arent even in the shop yet.  A month out for flower shopping is plenty of time really.  I didnt even think about flowers until a showed up in the wholesale district at am  days before the wedding!  Linens you can rent easy peasy.  Or just buy cheap ones on amazon prime for  day delivery.  No one needs  months for linens.    I also didnt have a DJ thank you spotify!  But theres tons of them and youre getting married in offpeak season so I doubt this will be an issue.  You live in Jersey....you cant go a block without walking into a DJ!I think youre panicking over stuff that frankly shouldnt even be done yet.  I found wedding planning broke into longterm stuff like venue and then short term stuff like flowers.  You almost cant plan a lot of these things until you have a better head count.  Which if the invites arent in the mail you cant possible have.  Your have a list of things that are supposed to get done about  weeks or a month out....so youre actually in great shape!

But this is not the story about how we transported the entire buffet home in his tiny ass car in a downpour on one of the most dangerous roads in the country.I baked five kinds of cookies four kinds of cupcakes and because Italian Wedding we desperately wanted cannoli.An old college friend came to help with the cookies one day and then told me she couldnt come to the wedding. Whatever.Two days before the wedding my maid of honor came over to help me with the cupcakes. We had four flavors I fretted over the fact that we had to use BOX MIX for three of the cupcake flavors and of course on the day of the wedding the overwhelming favorite was the carrot cake cupcakes made from scratch. There just wasnt time. But what matters is that it got done my best girl was with me and she brought both wine AND her awesome mom. Her mom didnt have to do that.And then there was the cannoli.We walked into the kitchen at the venue to see sealed boxes of cannoli shells. I was upset until the dessert came outthe unsung HERO of my wedding filled them at the very last minute. There are several candidates who it might have been but we still dont know for sure. I want to give them a really nice gift.Edit Good on you for letting the vegetarians decide what they want to eat.

Wow that is probably the most childish and hilarious things I have come across on here. Also the fact that she is  YEARS OLD and acting this way blows my mind. She is an adult...well claims to be it seems. I would let her know sooner than later that you no longer wish for her to be your MOH since she doesnt wish to attend the wedding. Tell her of course she can still come as someone else said below if you want her to and perhaps if you can let her husband know on his own that he is still invited with your nephews.

Option  I would still have the dj play the song...do you really think she will decline your invitation to dance in front of everyone?Option  Just let her pick the damn song.  Its one part of the wedding she can have.  Give in on this thing and tell her to butt out for everything else.  Then she can feel like she had some say.  I understand this didnt work out I like your idea to find a instrumental version...which is what I did for the song I walked down the aisle to.  My husband wanted to dance to Warmness of the Soul by AX but thats not very pretty and when we cut out the reception we made it the song I walked to and found a beautiful instrumental version. Is Momma paying for this wedding?  No?  Then she doesnt get to make it Cinderallas ball along with the pricetag.  Good luck!! ,weddingplanning,ckpen6y,3,t5_2rv3t

Also based on my experiences with confronting racist language with certain family members it will help your position to recruit another family member they really respect to back you up. Likely the relatives using racist language will make light of your request in order to deflect and lessen their discomfort. This is when the family member they respect steps in and says no really. It wont be tolerated. It may seem harsh but in my experience without backup I dont get taken seriously. Even if they dont take you seriously right then addressing it head on beforehand will lessen the chances theyll make a scene when a bouncer reprimands or escorts them from the party.,weddingplanning,cl80ubl,13,t5_2rv3t

I loved being able to have a page with all our registries which were in the form of buttons to click.  I wanted to be able to have a question box where peiple could post questions about the wedding then we could respond.  i.e. what should I wear? Formal attire no white on the dresses. I also love love love the RSVP function. If youre doing a plated meal you could also add a function for them to select their meals.,weddingplanning,cl8awu9,6,t5_2rv3t

2119305,0,t3_2j7tv7,Congrats on booking your honeymoon!  We booked ours yesterday to Maui and I am beyond excited!!!P.s. We are date twins!   Congrats again!,weddingplanning,cl97k1s,3,t5_2rv3t
2119797,0,t3_2j7d9u,Hey first off congratulations on your upcoming nuptials! Seriously!  For FW and I planning has been a breeze knock on wood.We were engaged in early August and with in two months of my asking her and her saying YES! we have pretty much handled the wedding. Three days after I asked her she found her dress off the racks.  From what I have been told it was a discontinued dress from the designers original dress line that another bride had wanted made and paid for but her wedding fell through and she didnt pay the remaining balance on the dress. Originally it was a  dress but because it wasnt a current design money had already been paid on the dress and no one had tried it on for over six months they had it discounted to  and they dropped the price further just to get it out the door.  The Ceremony venue is a fullsized replica of the Hopperstad Stave Church a th century church was found and booked a day before we booked our reception venue.  It cost us  to book it and it is perfect for us as FW is of Norwegian viking decent and identifies with her familys history.  We booked the reception venue two weeks after our engagement announcement. They gave us a nice discount on the venue and its all inclusive venue catering security and two rooms to use from am until am the day of our wedding for getting ready for the wedding. Its a  year old building with beautiful architecture.  A few days after we signed the contracts for the venues we booked our  day honeymoon at Sandals Grande Saint Lucian Resort in St. Lucia  We leave for our honeymoon two days after our wedding.  Since FW wanted a beach wedding but couldnt have it due to immediate family members not being able to travel for health reasons her aunt has Parkinsons and my mother has lupus Im going to get our marriage license the Monday after our wedding and do a vow renewal on our honeymoon so she can have her beach wedding   Last week my FW took her mother and Matron of Honor dress shopping and they found the dresses within an hour of shopping. Im not sure the cost but I was told they were the first dresses they tried on but keep looking at others just to be sure. Photographer was booked three weeks after our engagement.  We went to a bridal show collected four photographers cards and emailed them all.  One replied back the same day and the rest took a week or more to reply.  We met with the one who replied back asked a bunch of questions looked over her work we had asked around with our friends prior to meeting with her and signed the contract that day. Told the rest that we found a photographer already because they replied back instead of waiting. Website is something I am handling since Im the Senior Network Engineer at a local IT company and well....computers are my thing   Im going all out with a dedicated server our own domain name a couple cute games trivia and a candy crushlike game an RSVP database which will keep guests from adding any more people to their invitation than we have set them up for and email alerts when someone RSVPs.  Also gives us a private website to see statistics and give us a list of those who have not RSVPed with an automatic email system to send out reminders about the RSVPs when we are nearer to our date and a final email letting people know that unless they RSVP they will be counted as a Can Not Attend which means no food for them at the reception nor a spot to sit...we are doing plated service for the exact number of people...no more and there will be no way for us to add tables or chairs so...anyone who doesnt RSVP but shows up anyway...well they will have to stand during dinner service or come back later for the dance. There is a very large marathon happening the day of our wedding so all the hotels are booking room for it already and they are not doing room blocks for wedding on that weekend.  However since I have connections with businesses in the area doing their IT support I just talked to a couple sales managers of some of our more posh hotel clients and they set us up with blocks of rooms for just over half their regular room price and we are not obligated to pay anything if the rooms are not booked by guests.  We also were given the honeymoon suite free regardless if we met the block minimum or not as well as a room for the wedding gift opening free room to use for the rehearsal dinner and reservations for the executive lounge for our brunch the day after our wedding.  Also the rehearsal dinner and brunch is going to be free.   Perks of being an IT guy  Save the dates were done by FW and I about a month after our engagement.  A little photoshop work on our engagement photos and we had our STDs done in less than an hour. Made them into post cards with information about the wedding room blocks and why it was imperative people book now marathon.  Sent those out two weeks ago. Invitations are being made now by FW. The officiant will be my old Youth Pastor from my church. He is a regular pastor now at the same church and he has known me literally since I have been kneehigh. A lot of prayer went into bringing her into your life both by your parents and myself!  He is awesome and it means a lot to me that he will be our officiant.A lot of other things have been taken care of but those are the major ones.  Like you the guest list has been the hardest part.  I have relatives I thought were going to say no actually book their hotel rooms already and seem very excited for this wedding.  I had to contact a bunch of people via facebook messenger asking for their address because I have no other way to reach them and only two havent responded yet.   The rest have given me their address and a verbal Im coming! Save me a seat!Ok I take that back.  My mother has been the hardest part...but thats a whole story we dont need to derail this thread with.  ,weddingplanning,cl99t9a,1,t5_2rv3t

2133466,0,t3_2jecgk,I am also from Ontario and I have to say that I really dislike them. It is essentially asking your guests to fund your wedding when they are already expected to bring a gift and probably a shower gift.This is probably an unpopular opinion but my thought on the matter is this if you cant afford to pay for it yourself you shouldnt be purchasing it. Asking friends and family to spend their hard earned cash paying for your wedding cake is not the answer. A smaller wedding cake is the answer. The last wedding that I attended was it out of town. Between the travel costs accommodation kennel for my dogs shower gifts engagement party gifts and a substantial wedding gift? I spent a lot of money. If I had been asked to bring a wad of cash to their jack and jill also I would be really annoyed. Ive also been invited to jack and jills before without being invited to the wedding and that is straight up rude and tacky. Just my two cents EDIT  I misread your post and realize now you were not asking for opinions.  At first glance I thought you were.  File this under unsolicited opinion.  ,weddingplanning,clb0dtd,-1,t5_2rv3t
2134876,0,t1_clb6l7s,Thats probably the best way to handle it. Regardless of whats right or wrong you have to think that the couple has literally a million things going through their head  days before the wedding and bringing this up again  even if just to ask for explanation  would be  more thing they probably dont want to have to do right now. Go with your SO and have a great time. Baby wouldnt have even remembered it anyways if its any consolation. ,weddingplanning,clb6u34,6,t5_2rv3t

2160188,0,t3_2jfxqt,Well we finally heard back rates are actually relatively reasonable only thing that concerns us is that theres no mention of other liquor options aside from wine. I emailed her back now to wait another week to hear back haha asking if were allowed to get a special events liquor license and hire a bartender specifically for that evening so we can have more than just wine or if they do serve it with their wine but just didnt mention it on the catering menu. However we have found another location that we are pretty content with and they are more responsive than this place so its likely well go with them.

2171525,0,t3_2jwtwb,First of all those preparties are traditionally hosted for you by someone else  in other words its not technically up to you.  I think the party YOU can throw is postwedding a celebration of the marriage type thing.  Essentially a reception but maybe after a time delay if thats better for you.I think it would be a little weird to have the preparties for a courthouse wedding because Im assuming that the people at those parties would not be invited to said wedding.  That being said I know circumstances can be all over the place.  You wouldnt normally have a bridal shower with people not invited to the wedding but my moms friends threw me a GIANT bridal shower that included very few wedding guests.  It was essentially all my moms friends and I think they all had a great time coming together to celebrate without ever having expectations for a wedding invite.  I can also see a situation where your family and friends understand the reasons behind the courthouse wedding but also are super excited for you and want to throw you parties anyway.  Of course thats fine!  I just would not press for the parties myself as the bride and Im not sure I would expect them.,weddingplanning,clfuoq7,10,t5_2rv3t

I dont want to scramble to call and track people down a couple of days before I have to call my venue I can think of a thousand other things I will need to do that week and calling people to see if they are coming is not one of them. Since you arent sending save the dates it also gives them time to make travel arrangements. Youll get one or two drop off possibly cant predict illnesses!. It also gives you some time to do some round   Group B invites if you want people who you were onthefence about inviting for space or budget limitations.

I think the source i was reading said that when shoes are dyed there is a protective lacquer put over the color once they are dyed so that the dye doesnt come off on anything. This also causes the shoe to be unreceptive to any future dye. Its probably worth asking davids bridal or another shoe store just to find out from a professional though!

We absolutely did not.I think something that is important at least for me is finding someone who will take your ideasthoughts and add to them and elevate them not completely change them.  We spoke with one planner who had planned more elaborate formal affairs than we wanted and he just kept spitting out fabulous ideas which were amazing just not for us.  I also felt slightly shamed for the elements he thought I HAD TO HAVE which I certainly did not want.  We ended up hiring a theater stage manager turned wedding planner because we really needed the most help with executionlogistics instead of ideas.

You have to narrow down the choice somehow and as long as you pick a place youre happy with dont worry about making the best possible choice.

Theyre meant to be parties thrown by friends to celebrate the bridemom having family members host makes it kind of gift grabby.

I would be bummed if I put on any party and a bunch of people couldnt make it and her hurt is totally fair but I just think and I could definitely be wrong that most people view a wedding differently than many other celebrations.  So where friends might find an excuse ok for missing a young childs birthday they wouldnt find it reason enough not to attend a wedding.  But ya know people are weird some times.

The grooms mum and sisters are also helping out but since no one is hostingcause they are holding it at a historical home everyone involved is paying instead of the host who typically covers the costs at least in my experiences that has been the case.

2345020,0,t3_2m6rz9,I would recommend looking into a hotel option like the Hilton Orlando Lake Buena Vista.  I stayed there last year to do Disney and we had a great experience.  We found that there were fewer children since most parents opt for the themed hotels or a significantly cheaper option.  Hilton has a standing arrangement with WDW to allow you in during the extra magic hours and also provides transportation to and from the parks on Disney buses.  The Hilton is also walkable to Downtown Disney if youre interested in the nightlife and dining options there.  The biggest downsides I can see to staying off property is that you cannot buy into the Disney Dining plan which can be a great deal if you plan it right and you will not have transportation from the Orlando airport to your hotel.  We opted to take a hertz shuttle to and from the airport to the Hilton.In terms of tickets I would recommend looking at the options available at Undercover Tourist.  For most ticket options UT provides some savings especially if you opt for the park hopper option which I would highly recommend.  I have had no issues with their tickets both times we used them.  ,weddingplanning,cm1k10p,1,t5_2rv3t

I have had a similar experience and my main coping mechanism has been to focus on the silver lining with no overlyinvolved parents fretting over every single detail of the wedding planning has been really stressfree and easy. It is a bummer to feel like your family doesnt care but at least you can avoid some of the drama of your mother insisting you do things exactly her way.But just to commiserate I totally feel you. My mom is happy about the engagementmarriage but she doesnt care much about wedding planning. I had to explicitly ask her to go dress shopping with me and come to fittings she bailed on the last one when she found out I had a friend coming as well. My mom refused to help with setting up the reception venue. None of our parents want to give a speechtoast at the wedding.

Reality is that I have a much younger sister who is still definitely a kid and I would have been the Worst Big Sister Ever and to my parents a hell of a jerk of a daughter if I did that. We ended up with My sister who is . Our three nieces who are like...   and . Best Mans son who was like  or . Random baby that my SIL and her wife decided to babysit during our wedding.Aside from the peculiarity of the random baby no trouble was caused.Heres how I would have spun it to people who were sensitive about their kids not being invited or at least heres something like it We did not really feel comfortable with the combination of open bar  children. That said we really hope you can come and enjoy an adult night out  you deserve it!They will likely counter that their child can handle being around drinking adults  whatever they can parent how they wish but that doesnt mean the kid gets to come. When they object you could counter that it is a liability that your venue is simply not willing to take on and that minors are unable to attend.,weddingplanning,cml52uz,1,t5_2rv3t

This way it isnt expensive... but here is the kicker My stepmom met my Dad at a pig roast and it is always a fun story.  Theres a sentimental reason to pick this kind of restaurant and so no one thinks twice about it being cheap.  Prices should run around  to  a person... so not bad!

You will have some guests who would prefer the more upscale hotel and are good spending night for  nights. You will have other guests strapped for cash or dont like spending higher ratesdont mind standard hotels who will book with the lowest price in the area. I recently went to a wedding and found the cheapest nice hotel and it was about  minutes away from the reception. I drank a bit but stopped drinking about . hour before I was planning on leaving so I could drive us back to the hotel. It worked out I saved money and everyone had fun.Also I dont know how many fun things I would do other than the wedding.

The main reason is we would much rather you attend our event as a guest instead of a vendor so you get to enjoy it rather than working.

Sorry in advance for the late night ramblings and wall of text.I found my dream dress online. . Obviously this was never going to happen. I didnt think Id ever get over it still have issues sometimes. It was the kind of thing where I even knew Id love it without trying it on because every last stitch was exactly what I wanted. So I go dress shopping and Im extremely underwhelmed by everything. I took my sister MOH and my mom. Found some fun stuff but no winners. I went again with just my mom and found an incredible dress! It was no dream dress but it was just funky enough for me to seriously consider it. I went home and couldnt stop thinking about it for  weeks. I was sure that was a sign it was for me. I was moving away from the city where it came from so the day before we moved my FH and I went to buy it he didnt see it. None of my bridesmaidssistersparents ever got to see me in it except the first time I tried it on with my mom. The whole experience sucked because I was stresse about moving in the boutique trying it on alone and I had realyl low self esteem because I was on my period and jest felt gross in general that day. Even in the pictures I took while wearing it bother me because I jsut think my facehair look bad even though the dress is gorgeous.Anyway a few days later while driving to our new home cross country I broke down in the car because I couldnt stop thinking about my original dream dress and I was terrified I made the wrong choice even though I could still never have that one. My worst nightmare is putting on my dress the day I get married and still be thinking about the one I couldnt afford. I keep telling myself I feel this way probably because the actual moment I purchased it just wasnt that exciting like on all those stupid tv shows. Who knows if its true? Regardless I picked that dress for a reason and to be honest its truly amazing and if Id never seen that first dress Id still have gotten it. My buyers remorse is fading. And it really helps that after expressing all this to my sister we came up with a plan for all my bridesmaids to come with me to a fitting as part of my bachelorette party. So that way we can all get excited about my dress together and Ill get that stupid bride moment everyone wants when they choose their dress. Plus this time Im going to have my hair and makeup done so I can be sure not to hate the pictures of me wearing it. I wish you the best of luck. I think you should keep your dress if you loved it enough to buy it. Maybe you can try what Im doing and have your mom come alone to your final fitting so she can have a special motherdaughter bonding moment with you? Also just try to calmly explain to her you loved it SO SO much you couldnt bear losing out on the great deal and you very much regret she couldnt be there and you didnt plan that at all! ,weddingplanning,cng0wxm,3,t5_2rv3t

2748685,0,t3_2riy0p,Hey Rochester! Live here and am getting married here. Im going to agree with uilostmyumbrella about Artisan Works. I know someone who had their wedding reception there and it looked absolutely beautiful and very unique. Another couple I know had their reception at the Museum and Science Center. The Memorial Art Gallery is also worth looking into.Some other places to look around would be High Falls. The Genesee Brewery is a popular reception venue. I believe La Luna Restaurant holds weddings along the falls as well. Its not Niagara Falls sure but its a cool area since the falls are right in Downtown Rochester.Edit called a venue by the wrong name!,weddingplanning,cngiif2,3,t5_2rv3t

No idea on the Sikh portions costs but for my venue its  food will be about  including tax and gratuities for  people my reception dress is  and my photographer my only expense in the whole thing besides makeup and accessories is . In total im guessing its going to cost in the k range but with two cultures trying to mesh its bound to be difficult.

Also... like in the other comment it can seem a little gift grabby.

You are trying to respond to this in a legitimate fashion but I think you are missing the point of me asking here for venue ideas its to see if anyone else has been married or has seen a wedding in this area and to share with me the overstressed partner of the bride things that others might know of that could be of use.We are doing homework but I was asked to find some offbeat or unknown venues out there in our county and after  or so hours of failing horribly at GoogleFuing this problem away I decided to ask Reddit for help. ,weddingplanning,cnhxaxr,1,t5_2rv3t
2763126,0,t3_2rphss,Wedding Videographer here...I also do photography for some clients. When you mentioned that you have people attending who may pass away in the next few years I remembered my first ever wedding that I photographed. The bride was the sister of one of my friends and already had  photographers but wanted me to do close up candid moments. It was at this wedding that the brides grandma had a heart attack and died at the venue. I know that the family watch the wedding video fairly often as it was taken on her last day alive so its a very special video for them. Now Im not saying that will happen at your wedding but if you instruct your videographer to make sure to get shots of those people who you want to captured on video it would be lovely to see them being alive and enjoying themselves. However you need to think if that K is something thats reasonable to be able to earn within a year if it is for you then great! Hire someone good and let them know who you definitely want shots of. Most video people worth their money will ask you anyway about the family members close and important to you.I hope this helps and good luck with the wedding!,weddingplanning,cni5nmi,1,t5_2rv3t

2776903,0,t3_2ruy8b,Hey Im sorry this has become a bit messy and painful and that youre having to make this decision.  Sounds like youre really struggling to do the best thing both for your fiances daughter the rest of your family and yourself.  This is not really advice because only you can decide whats best for you but I wanted to provide some support that yes what youre describing IS totally possible and for us it was the right decision and really fun.My partner and I have been planning a big fun wedding with friends and family for the end of May .  We also wanted to move in together and really wanted to celebrateformalize our own commitment to each other by having a wedding ceremony first.  So we filled out some legal paperwork and decided to have a mini ceremony with just us right before the holidays.I was a bit nervous about all this especially what people would thinkif they would still be excited to come to the wedding in May ... and our wedding commissioner was just lovely.  Listen to me andthenthecactussaid she said there is NO WRONG WAY to get married.  Weddings are fun!  Were going to have FUN and well have fun again in May.  And we did just threw everything together and drove out to the coast with a couple close friends for witnesses.  He wore a suit he already had and I borrowed my sisters prom dress from  years ago bought some babys breath and put it in my hair and gave roses to everyone for corsages or bouquets.  It was raining and we had beautiful umbrellas that made the beach photos look awesome.  Between flowers champagne and a little cake from the deli we spent about  on our little beach ceremony on top of the marriage certificate it meant so much to us and I wouldnt trade it for anything.And were still planning our big awesome ceremony in May giving everyone time to come across the country and make plans and be there with us.  Were going to dress up and say our vows again and share music and dancing and a bonfire and the whole day with everyone.  My thenfianc said if anyone was too grumpy to come celebrate our May wedding with us it was probably for the best!  Which can be hard when its family or someone you care about and you wish they werent grumpy but for what its worth so far everyone whom weve told has been super awesome supportive and excited.  They can see why we did it the way we did and theyre also very glad to come celebrate with us as its important to share that with them.  I was really worried about if I make this one special the next one wont be as special and Im so relieved that thats not how it happened or felt at ALL.  Its been really fun to have a little one that was just us with not much but a few flowers and special things and be looking forward to a big one that celebrates our union with everyone we love.In short Only you can know whats right for you just know that what youre describing is totally possible and can be really fun. If theres something to be learned from looking at peoplecultures around the world its that a wedding can happen in a ton of different ways decide whats meaningful to you and your fianc sounds like you have  both your daughter and celebrating with friends are important to you and make it happen.  Good luck Im sure its not as easy as it sounds but know you have lots of support from across the internet ,weddingplanning,cnjq315,2,t5_2rv3t

We did ours about  months ahead no reservation fee required and the rooms prices are locked in and a discount is applied.

Its amazing how many things show up that you want to include in your day.  Toss your best guess as to a cost then try to beat it!

2794781,0,t3_2s3111,I think the easiest way to communicate this while leaving it off the invitations which I advise so as not to offend is to just not register.

Working under the assumption that your guests are all intelligent adults they will be able to take the hint. Depending on where you are located Ive seen a few posts saying that registry info is common on Australian wedding Invitations it can be seen as incredibly rude and gift grabby and Ive even heard of people not going to weddings because gift info was on there. It can come off as Yeah it would be nice to have you but really we want you to come so you can give us a present.

Her aunt will be  when the girl now woman gets married and the aunt is indeed going to be the flower girl.  I think if your friend and brother are OK with those positions and wont feel insulted itll be fine.  Obviously dont as them to dress up like precious moment dolls unless everyone is down with that idea just to acknowledge and joke a bit about how yes it is indeed an adult filling what is conventionally considered a childs role but I can totally see a young woman walking down the aisle and tossing flowers followed by a young man bearing the ring.  To make it less childish looking maybe he could hold the ring on a nice tray instead of a pillow.  Add a square of nice square of cloth on the tray for accent.  If they totally OWN the roles I think it can look pretty damn royal.But if youre looking for opinions on whether there are other ways to honor these two people could they be your witnesses on the marriage document?

2811674,0,t3_2saiv7,First of all breathe!  Shelve the thoughts about the menu and bridal party and first talk with your FH about the bigpicture items like venue date and budget.  It sounds like you are an outdoorsy girl and you dont need to get in your head about having a traditional expensive wedding with all the bells and whistles.That being said you bring up some valid concerns regarding the experience of your guests.  If a large amount are from out of town you will definitely need to figure out a place for them to stay.  I was going to suggest having the wedding at your farmstead unless it is super far from the nearest hotel.  Even if it is it will probably still save you money to have the wedding there and shuttle people from a hotel.  The shuttles usually charge by time not distance.May nd is pushing it for booking travel but it can be done as long as you send a savethedate NOW.  You can even send an electronic one or just an email! to save the hassle of designing it.

2860961,0,t3_2svafr,I am financially independent with savings but also significant student loans still.  My fiance and I assumed we would pay for the whole thing ourselves and reasoned that we could each pitch in  reasonably.  He has a good job too and that amount would still leave us with a good safety fund like if one of us lost our jobs we still need rent money!.  Then we talked to the parents.  Both of his parents want to contribute and my parents came out of left field and want to split the entire thing with us where we would use his parents contributions to match my parents.  I had no idea any of that was going to conspire.  If you need somewhere to start be frank with both sets of parents and find out if theyre contributing and what and obviously be grateful if they are and understanding if theyre not.  That will help you decide ok from that point maybe  maybe  you can start talking with your FH about how much you guys can afford to contribute and work from there?  I dont actually know your sitaution so maybe this doesnt apply to you but I did a lot of VERY frustrating searches for a low initial budget just to find out I wasted my time nit picking and trying hypothesize ways to cut corners when really the budget was almost twice what my initial thought was.

2875313,0,t1_cnuslzv,Assuming the person above is trying to stir up drama and throw this person to the wolves lol. The Knot is traditional in their take on etiquette which means they are VERY against someone throwing their own shower kind of agree with them on that one most of the time. The Knot forums are also very strict on bridesmaid duties... on their forums they are always very adamant about the fact that the bridesmaids only real duties should be to show up on the day of the wedding in the correct attire sober and on time to be at the wedding. Any other duties such as showers and bachelorette helping with crafts or set up or planning are voluntary but not strictly required. If your bridesmaids offer or volunteer to host you a shower thats wonderful but they are by no means obligated to do so. Again I mostly agree with the Knot on that. I think most of us would want our bridesmaids to ask us if we want a bachelorette and I think that most bridesmaids would happily plan it as the reality today is that its generally understood to be part of the bridesmaid role but personally I think expecting your bridesmaids to plan both the shower and the bachelorette is too much especially for bridesmaids with children and families of their own. In my social circles its more common for an older lady who is more established financially to host the shower.. an aunt cousin family friend etc. Bridesmaids might help with some of the shower organizing but its not necessarily their job to do so.Anyways the Knot has become a really toxic environment in my opinion. I actually do agree with them on some of their etiquette issues.. some of the things our generation tries to do like crowdfunding weddings putting money poems in invitations honeyfund are pretty rude. But other aspects of etiquette can be outdated and really dont hurt anyone or affect the comfort of guests if they are left by the wayside and The Knot just goes nuts and jumps down peoples throats over the smalleststupidest thing sometimes. They have a really crowd mentality where if you dont follow their exact belief or something youre like a leper or something.,weddingplanning,cnux9jj,1,t5_2rv3t

There are subtle ways to get them involved that dont include matching dresses and standing up next to you at the altar.

I will say thisour caterer ruled. I actually got to eat the food I picked and that was a big deal for me and they balanced out the protein with vegetarian options at the stations I picked.

2918338,0,t3_2tk4gb,Sorry youre going through this it does sound frustrating... can I ask were you made aware of any of these policies before booking the hotel? Like did you sign a contract or did they send you an email with their policies in it or anything? If not I feel like you could argue to get your deposit back on the basis that a lot of this stuff wasnt clearly communicated to you. Cake cutting fees based on the number of people are unfortunately common.. if you bring an outside cake into a venue it is quite common for the venue to charge you a per person fee which accounts for the time they will need to cut serve and plate the cake as well as the dishes clean up etc. It does seem pricey and I get that it seems like an annoying unnecessary fee but at the same time I would say its quite common.  The keeping it afterwards thing sounds very strange but I wonder if it has to do with some sort of food safety practice or legal liability.The vegan food they are suggesting doesnt sound at all impressive considering the great vegan stuff that is available these days but is it possible that vegan food simply isnt this restaurants specialty and that by asking for vegan food youve put them out of their usual element so they dont have any great ideas of stuff to make? Gazpacho is delicious by the way but not that filling of course! I dont know enough about the pricing and what things are like in Finland in terms of pricing but wedding food does tend to have a pretty inflated price even for simple canapes!I do understand your frustration but it seems a bit like you should have looked more into the prices of renting the ceremony space and the food options and stuff before you booked? Personally I struggling to understand why you rushed into booking an entire hotel without confirming that the ceremony space you wanted is available what it would cost to rent it what food options there were and general policies etc. But whats done is done so I suppose your options are to maybe try to get your deposit back and look for a new venue or else keep trying to communicate with this venue and push them towards what you want. If you have some better ideas for the type of vegan canapes you would like to see perhaps you could suggest some so that they have an idea of what youre looking for? Ive had vegan stuffed mushrooms which were delicious vegetable tarts vegan sushi lots of yummy stuff. ,weddingplanning,cnztnp6,12,t5_2rv3t

We have a joint everyday account for billsgroceries that we put equal amounts in each week and a joint savings account where we do the same but the rest is our own money to spend. All household expenses are  each and we share a car together but have a motorcycle each that is considered our own. We each have a superannuation account that is our own and weve done our wills leaving the other as beneficiary. He is getting a big pay rise soon so will earn a fair bit more than me and if the pay difference gets even bigger we will probably go to pro rata share of bills rather than  or vice versa if I ended up earning a lot more than him. I imagine over time our finances will become more entangled but so far its working out great. His parents think it is super strange we dont share all our money though.

Even more specific wording would have a line on the rsvp for each guest e.g. XYZ  will be attending  sends regrets.yet another option is to provide a kids event  a kidsactivity table in a corner or in a separate room in the same building if I was the mom of a very young child I would totally appreciate the option to breastbottle feed in a quiet location or have a place to lay a kiddo down for a nap. Idk what your venue is like but the rooms that the bride and groom get ready in would be a perfect quiet space because youre not really using them during the ceremonyreception. my personal experience is that the lt crowd tends to do pretty well at weddings but the teenagers are the ones that get bored.people can be weird about their kids not being invited. can you feel out your local guests re their perspectives? ,weddingplanning,coeubmd,2,t5_2rv3t

Not to mention the day the best man was asked the first thing he said was Im going to throw you the best bachelor party ever so NO ONE just told him he had to do that. Not to mention Im not taking about my bachelorette at all and comparing your night to his is pointless. Everyone has a different idea of what they want. We have a large group of friends and every one of them who has gotten married had a big bachelorbachelorette night where  people attended and chipped in AT LEAST  each.

3160031,0,t3_2w89kw,Congrats!  The planning was a real chore and we used to joke that going through the efforts of planning was sort of like a right of passage to being a successfully married couple. If you can survive the planning you can do anything.  I think some people have a better time than others with it but it does become stressful to plan an event for so many people when you are new to it all. It was difficult to get vendorsvenues to respond initially within our time frame.  Things cost a lot even if you plan to have a simple wedding so that can be frustrating as well to work in a budget.  Our bridal party which ordinarily very nice created problems for us to coordinate and some of them made several promises they failed to keep. Our guest list was fine but some we invited didnt respond at all or couldnt rsvp until very late.I hope it all goes well for you and I can pretty much promise it is all worth it.

They arent really out to make a bunch of money on you feeding your vendors they are out to make a bunch of money on your feeding your guests. Its also a bit of a vendorvendor complimentary thing. They want other vendors to get fed because as a vendor they know that it is important to have food. Lastly if the caterer makes sure that the vendor is fed and the catered food is good the vendor is more likely to refer the caterer when asked. These vendors are working weddings all the time and being in the business the caterers want other vendors to think highly of them. ,weddingplanning,courv2i,1,t5_2rv3t

Falling in love is like owning a dog by Taylor MaliFirst of all its a big responsibilityespecially in a city like New York.So think long and hard before deciding on love.On the other hand love gives you a sense of securitywhen youre walking down the street late at nightand you have a leash on loveaint no one going to mess with you.Because crooks and muggers think love is unpredictable.Who knows what love could do in its own defense?On cold winter nights love is warm.It lies between you and lives and breathesand makes funny noises.Love wakes you up all hours of the night with its needs.It needs to be fed so it will grow and stay healthy.Love doesnt like being left alone for long.But come home and love is always happy to see you.It may break a few things accidentally in its passion for lifebut you can never be mad at love for long.Is love good all the time? No! No!Love can be bad. Bad love bad! Very bad love.Love makes messes.Love leaves you little surprises here and there.Love needs lots of cleaning up after.Sometimes you just want to get love fixed.Sometimes you want to roll up a piece of newspaperand swat love on the nosenot so much to cause painjust to let love know Dont you ever do that again!Sometimes love just wants to go for a nice long walk.Because love loves exercise.It runs you around the block and leaves you panting.It pulls you in several different directions at onceor winds around and around youuntil youre all wound up and cant move.But love makes you meet people wherever you go.People who have nothing in common but lovestop and talk to each other on the street.Throw things away and love will bring them backagain and again and again.But most of all love needs love lots of it.And in return love loves you and never stops.,weddingplanning,coutj4q,2,t5_2rv3t

If only one person is invited then I dont think their card should have an option write in number of guests. It may costs a little more to have two versions of an RSVP card printed but it could take away from these awkward situations. Also it sounds like youre pretty young and so are your friends. They honestly probably havent RSVPd for many weddings themselves or spend their free time reading up on wedding etiquette. They probably just didnt know that they werent allowed to bring guests since the RSVP card makes it sound like you can bring a date when theres a place to write in number of guests. ,weddingplanning,cp15llz,3,t5_2rv3t

I actually think the dress thing is understandable especially because generally you have to pay a big chunk of money and you might end up with something you hate. I have a  bridesmaid dress that I LOATHE a lot of money to pay for something I will wear once and its also three times more expensive than my wedding dress!. Being a bridesmaid is expensive. Also some women just do not want to wear dresses for various reasons including gender dysphoria for example.

You could provide buckets of flowers for them to choose or have everyones name and table number on a stem and they take it to the vase on their table.

3335380,0,t3_2ycrmu,At first a videographer wasnt even on our radar.  Then I saw the cinematic style of wedding video...and I fell in love.  I absolutely love where you have the voiceover of someone giving a speech or the bride and groom saying the vows and the images are edited together from footage throughout the day.  One of my good friends made an excellent point when I told her we were considering adding a videographer to our budget  she strongly encouraged me to do so saying that she has a photo from her reception where her mom is giving a speech and she my friend is crying but she doesnt remember a word her mom said.  Pictures are wonderful but they just show the image not the words that go with it.   I also started thinking about how everyone says the day goes by in a blur and you hardly remember any of it  this way we can go back and relive our day catching those moments we may have missed.  At first we were hoping to find a videographer for lt  in BC Canada but found that all the good videographers who produced the cinematic style we were looking for usually started at that price.  The videographer we chose we went with his top package  .  With this package he attempts to tell our love story and it includes   unlimited time on the day of coverage from getting ready til the end of the night   coverage from the day before me at the salon with my girls getting our nails done FH going for a round of golf with his dadbrother   interview of each of us separately for extra audio for the video    minute feature film in the style we wanted   full footage of the ceremony and speeches   provides microphonelighting as needed to ensure quality footage and audio are captured    cameras  one hell set up on a tripod at the ceremony amp reception and hell roam around with a second camera capturing footage from various other angles    free reeditHe had  cheaper packages  the cheapest had no audiovoice over  just footage from the day of.

3411013,0,t3_2zacjq,I was in a similar situation.  I had a girl who I was good friends with throughout graduate school we were even roommates and spent most of our time together.  Our friendship was a little rocky and we went through some fights but overall I considered us close.  When I started dating FH she was in a new relationship as well and was discouraging of mine because of our age difference and the fact that we were long distance while going on and on about how perfect her new boyfriend was.  She never wanted to get to know FH and when I stopped living with her our contact sort of petered out.  Still she was my closest friend from grad school.When it came time for the invites FH was pretty adamant about not wanting her there.  He didnt particularly like her and she has been known to not have a filter about inappropriate things.  I knew that if I didnt invite her it would be sealing the deal that we were not friends and I also knew that I couldnt invite anyone else from grad school without inviting her.So I didnt invite her.  I fibbed that our wedding is a little smaller than it is and she took it well and said she totally understands about guest lists.  We dont talk much anymore and to be honest I dont think that a wedding invitation would have swayed that either way.Anyway long story short I went through the same thing you did and my answer to Do I care if she speaks to me less because of this? ended up being No.  Especially given the size of your guest list I think that you are within reason not to invite her.  I think one question you will have to ask yourself is if you should make it a point to tell her or just not invite her.,weddingplanning,cph2wuj,4,t5_2rv3t

3472507,0,t3_30053v,I recently got married in my husbands home country in Asia in a traditional ceremony. Although my experience was overwhelmingly positive there were a few things that made me feel...out of place in a country where white people of European ancestry are a very small minority  Fitting into clothes and shoes. Im taller heavier and thicker than most women in the United States. In his country I am a giant. I had a hard time finding clothes shoes and even jewelry I broke a bangle trying it on over my big hands...  Having my hair styled. I had a stylist do my hair for the reception and ceremony. For the reception I asked for my hair to be styled loose and wavy since it is naturally a little bit wavy and I wanted to look like myself but better. But she had no idea how to style hair as thin as mine. She didnt put any product in it but was surprised that it didnt hold a curl at all. After an hour of trying to curl it it looked like I had straightened it and it had naturally tried to curl it a bit. I still liked the way it looked but she felt really bad.I know that these experiences are minor inconveniences in a trip that lasted two and a half weeks versus a lifetime of discrimination for women of color in the US. But I wanted to point out that the US is not the only country that focuses on the majority ethnic group in wedding advertising and the like. I know that in his country I represent a very small minority so it makes sense that advertising sizes and hairstylist training will suit the majority population.Now I know that the US has a large and growing population of nonwhites. But this has changed very rapidly in the  years or so that wedding industry as we know it has been around. I think its possible that the lack of minorities in wedding advertising is something that will change as the makeup of the US population continues to change.,weddingplanning,cpo3ads,10,t5_2rv3t

However her absence will just reflect poorly on her. Shes that family member. You get to have a lovely wedding without having that family member there and she gets to be gossiped about by every busybody great aunt and third cousin.

Anything in the category of rude I will always suggest that people not follow that path. They can do whatever they want though. I get it. Your alternative perspective suggests that people should be able to do something that is rude just because they feel its best or easiest for them and no one should judge them for that. My perspective still stands that if something is rude its rude. I know I cant stop someone from doing said rude thing but that doesnt make it not rude. ,weddingplanning,cpx690d,1,t5_2rv3t

3561895,0,t1_cpy1juk,Exactly. My mother actually gave me a hard time when I mentioned the center stone was a  carat.  I had to reminded her that the center stone of the ring I gave my FW was twice the size of the one that dad gave to her when he asked for her hand in marriage so she backed off. It was all dad could have afforded but she loved him and still does and was happy to get any ring at all.Later that night after dinner not one to let things go she said she was actually a little embarrassed over the size of the stone dad gave her on her original wedding ring in comparison to her thenfriends stones as was dad so five years later dad replaced her original wedding ring with a ring of two carat diamonds and every th year of their marriage he has added another  carat diamond. They just celebrated their th wedding anniversary.  She has TWO wedding rings now one in platinum and one in gold one with four carat diamonds and the other with five  carat diamonds respectively. They can be worn interlocked to form this stupidly large nine carat diamond monster that dwarfs her finger.   It isnt ugly by any means but just BAM! in your face even if you are not looking.Edited for words.  I suck at spelling.,weddingplanning,cpya5qx,2,t5_2rv3t

Men dont ever think theyll ever change their name. No matter who they marry or what they do with their life theyre always just themselves. Women on the other hand are willing to change our verbal identity just to unite with our men who would NEVER do the same for us.... I just cant. I just cant. So anyway I love articles like this. Especially when it reminds women that hey if you change your name when you wed what will you do if you divorce? Nobody wants to think about that  but are you generic thinking of your future married name as only temporary for the duration of the marriage.. or what? ,weddingplanning,cpz08a8,19,t5_2rv3t

Full disclosure I was never his biggest fan anyways bc I think the guy makes poor decisions. But it has hurt my FH that the guy he thought was his bff has become jealous and selfish even moreso than I thought of him originally and drop the friendship taking every opportunity to put down the process of planning a wedding in the first place. I mean hey I get that he got married at City Hall the day after he got out of jail for his drunken poor decisions but that doesnt mean planning our wedding will be a similar nightmare. FH asked him to be his best man and his only response was really bro? Its just been heartbreaking to see FH try to reach out and this guy be a jealous douche.  Similarly we had a couple of other jealous people just make rude comments. I consider it the fast track to not getting an invite.   How zen weve been about the process. Full disclosure I have anxiety and can drive myself crazy over stupid things at work.  But planning a wedding? Cool as a cucumber. The two of us have pretty much gone with the flow. We chose our date bc we loved the venue and they had availability that day. We chose a beachy theme and that has really set the tone for our wedding. Our planning process is go with the flow.

Because you seem to have a very unusual definition and I havent run across it before.Having food at a dinner party is fairly universal but Ive seen people in the sub get jumped on harshly for having a cake and punch reception when having a meal at a wedding is far from universal. If were going to define etiquette as only things that the entire planet agrees on it becomes meaningless.

3694772,0,t3_32pnpk,Well a subreddit like rpersonalfinance would say budget always . You set a budget based on what you know you can afford and you refine your guest list and your wedding as a whole based on that. However I would say its more of a combo. Overall you have to have some sort of idea of what you want. Its somewhat important to get a vague idea of what things are going to cost for a certain number of people to decide if that is something you can affordare willing to spend and then go from there. So if you know that you want your wedding to look a certain way and for  people that will run you about  but you absolutely cant spend that much then you have to change your vision for your wedding either in terms of the number of people or what you are going to spend per person and on the static items. Id say if youre trying not to go over  people talk to venues and say you are in the super beginning stages of planning and you would like an quote on prices for  person reception. ,weddingplanning,cqdffrx,4,t5_2rv3t

Wives were coming up to me telling me that I made their husband cry and he didnt even cry at their wedding. Bottom line is if you gotta cry then cry.

3741581,0,t3_339b1l,Overselling on budget is terrible and I have heard that some stores are very high pressure. I had a bad experience with that at an independent shop with no prices on any of the dresses so I actually turned to DBs because their pricing is so transparent. But I knew to look online and have a definite yes and no list before I went. If you dont do that I could see how it would be easy to have no idea what is worth what. That being said DBs definitely told me three different times that it was final but I think there is still some wiggle room there. I think she may actually be able to get the money back since she hasnt taken possession but at the very least she should be able to exchange for store credit. Not the best solution but if she gets her maids dresses there she wouldnt be totally out the money and their bridesmaid selection is pretty darn enormous. ,weddingplanning,cqirji7,6,t5_2rv3t

3745488,0,t3_339rkn,My fiance and I majored in Spanish so our wedding is Spanish themed. Our caterer is going to make a few Spanishinspired dishes to fit the theme. He already had paella in his repertoire so thats good but he wasnt familiar with any other Spanish dishes and there is nowhere nearby that serves Spanish food that could count as researchin Alabama everyone thinks Spanish  Mexican.Through talking and Googling I was able to suggest and he was able to conceptualize a few things that we think will be simple but essentially Spanish. However while pretty simple they are new dishes for our caterer. Is it reasonable to request that we get to sample his take of the custom dishes? What is your recommendationhow would you approach this?Were still fluid on the final menu but these are really the only two dishes we have that arent like add some olives and Spanish ham to the cheese plate Patatas bravas of white potatoes that have been cut into irregular shapes of about  centimeters fried in oil and served warm with a sauce such as a spicy tomato sauce or an aioli or both!.

You and FH can do whatever will make you happy! Im a big fan of tea so going for high tea sounds fantastic!Your family and friends will be happy to come and celebrate with you whatever ye decide to do.. Figure out a relatively accurate guest list.. Look at venues and check what their capacity is.. Check if the venues are licensed to do the wedding ceremony and if you need to hire a celebrant. all varies on where you live but the venue staff should help you outOnce youve that done everything else will follow. You can start looking at invite designs and pretty dresses all you want of course. Ive loved every second of wedding planning its so much fun!And if you need anything you can always come to Reddit or PM me Ill try be as helpful as I can!

3751048,0,t3_33djhb,No.  Besides you dont know the actual price of what the couple paid for.  How would you know?  They may have gotten a great deal or knew someone that worked there.We had guests that did not give gifts some gave huge gifts and some that gave smaller items.  Some didnt even attend and gave us a gift card.  Every gift I got made my heart swell and some made me cry.  The wedding was an emotional time for me it seems.  I cried at everything right down to leaving my parents house to finally live with DH ngl I cried  times that night.  Even guests that SIL invited chipped in and gave us towels.  I was so touched.How does one expect to get a financial return from a wedding?  I dont understand.  Especially when the budget and the guest list pretty much make it difficult to scale returns.One thing I learned from this sub is that no one is obligated to give a gift but it is generally polite to do so.,weddingplanning,cqjug1t,15,t5_2rv3t

Things will go differently than you planned no matter what you do.  Some things are out of your hands and accepting that will allow you to weather them as small annoyances with a smile as opposed to letting them ruin your day unnecessarily.  Ive been to a bunch of weddings with uneven parties and I actually think it can be kind of cute to have one guy walk with a pretty lady on each arm.

As others have said this may be fairly mild in the average person but if you have any tendency towards anxiety or perfectionism it just becomes that much stronger. What helped me was looking back on other huge life changes I had experienced and remembering that I had felt anxious depressed etc. before and during those changes too. Just give yourself some grace and just remember that your life story is your life story and your struggles are your struggles so try not to compare yourself to others who may not have the same struggles you do. ,weddingplanning,cqm71jf,2,t5_2rv3t

Your options will be somewhat limited but an off season wedding will help with that. Choose from what is available focus first on the things that are the most important and then work out from there.

3827275,0,t1_cqs6djk,Yeah were atheists but our Catholic friends still very strongly recommended we do premarital counseling. Not because were dysfunctional or that they were dysfunctional but because a counselor is a person who has spent years learning about relationships and has seen dozens if not hundreds of them up close and personal. No one knows our relationship better than we do but Im eager to talk to a counselor to see if theres anything that hasnt occurred to us yet. Is there something we just havent thought to talk out?

I think its not the best thing to do but noting adults only reception will a make it clear who is being invited and b allow people enough time to find childcare. Spelling it out is the best way to get your message across and avoid having to deal with your cousin brining her six year old because she didnt pay attention when she was reading the invites.

Does she want you to have enough items on the one registry that everyone can buy from it for both the shower and the wedding? Thats unnecessary because having a small registry is the etiquette approved way of asking for cash. From an etiquette standpoint the only other thing I would suggest you do is take the notice off of your website that says you would prefer cash because asking for cash is considered rude.

You can bring in your own bar and just pay  per each of their bartenders we had . This place is very DIY so I did all the planning.

If not I could see one of two things happening a she agrees that its too revealing and keeps looking or b you realize that what low cut on a something looks like and what it looks like on a  year old are a bit different maybe the cut works better for someone who has a less um perky bust?If she has tried it on and she likes it but you still think its inappropriate then you need to decide with yourself if its more important to be in control of how your FMIL looks on your wedding day or to have a snarkfree relationship with her.

4009196,0,t3_36dxnv,May I suggest a cruise ship wedding?  I too have  million family members and a cruise ship wedding was the answer to my invite dilemma!Like a destination wedding a cruise ship wedding means everyone has to pay for their own passage including room and board. Im having it on a sailing day which means that the ship will be out at sea so everyone has to commit to coming for  days which quite the commitment.  Also because food is free on a ship your reception is basically FREE unless you choose a higher end ship restaurant at an additional cost like head. All you have to pay for is the wedding itself  approx for the package and your rooms on the cruise. As an added bonus you actually get to enjoy your celebration for a couple of days not just  night that goes by way too fast. I invited over  people... every friend every relative  every person the parents wanted to invite  it was glorious!!! Everyone got an invitation!! Of course only those who truly wanted to come would spend the time and money.  The best thing is it didnt matter if everyone came the price of the wedding would stay the same. In fact the ship gives me more freebies if more people come!  Its so win win i just love it!!!,weddingplanning,crda1t6,11,t5_2rv3t

When we booked our room in the hotel the receptionist asked if we wanted to pay for the BBQ too? It takes the pressure off you to ask! Myself and my husband did a meal the second day too we paid for it but wanted to wait for numbers before we decided whether to do finger food a buffet or a full sit down meal. We didnt put it on our invite either as we didnt know what we would be inviting them too. We casually told people we would be staying around for food and drinks if they would like to join us. About  ended up staying and none of them expected a full  course meal again or for us to pay the bill.

4023921,0,t3_36j1zb,Hello fellow Pinay bride! Less than three weeks away and this is what Im struggling with  if they dont RSVP they want EXTRA RSVPs. Here are some things Ive had to deal with. Gave an invite to my dads friend who was practically an uncle to me. I receive a text from his SONHi Ive seen youve given my single dad one seat at your wedding  can me and my girlfriend come as well?Uh...yeah...I guess. I fold and tell him yes.Follow up text. Great! How about our driver? Does he get a seat too? Facepalm. Wait! We ONLY have two reserved seats guest and his wife. But my sondaughter want to come and take pictures at the beach resort Uhhuh. Thats why we are having this wedding. So your son or daughter can bring an iPad and take pictures. Three months ago from family friend Oh my daughter is flying in from New York! She can come right?Me Of course she can if shes coming all the way this is a girl I grew up with.Her And her husbands coming of course....plus the two kids.I know where this is going so I say...Me Oh good that means Ill be reserving four seats  one for you one for your other daughter and two for the couple. Being passive aggressive is a Filipino sport. This was to subtly tell her we are not having kids at the reception. Other Daughter also asks me if she can bring the BF. Whom Ive never met. But thats another storyTwo months pass. Her voicemail Thanks for the invites! Uhm...I see it says there are  reserved seats. But the kids dont have to sit in the chairs right?I lose my mind. My mom bless her heart! intervenes and tell her we are not having kids we do not know personally and under the age of  in our reception. Crises averted!Were still two weeks away so we will see. Twentyfive percent of guests are our friends and the  family members or my parents friends. My fiance was aghast but this is what marrying a Filipina and marrying in the Philippines means. His response Whatever makes your family happy. A true keeper ,weddingplanning,creygrx,4,t5_2rv3t

For example we did immediate family parents siblings grandparents auntsunclescousins and the bridal party plus their dates.

4167248,0,t1_crv71pv,When you say Ive paid for myself at every wedding are you saying you figuratively bought a ticket to the reception and if you did not pay to cover your mealattendance you would not be allowed to go? Or are you referring to the suggested wedding GIFT standard of you give as much cash if youre giving cash opposed to an item for the GIFT as you think your plate may have cost the couple? I have never heard of anyone be asked to pay for their actual attendancemeal at a wedding or reception and I would be completely put off Im  American and very nontraditional if I was expected to pay a fee for my attendancedinner that is literally like buying a ticket to a show. However I have certainty given the couple their WEDDING GIFT in the form of cash based off the amount I think they may have spend on me but even that is just a suggested guide and certainly not an expectation.I think a lot of people forget that you are hosting the wedding for your own personal life accomplishment no different than any other party and you shouldnt be trying to make money off the guests who are there to celebrate WITH YOU or make them pay for that choice. If you cant afford to host the party wedding amp reception for the amount of guests youre inviting you shouldnt be having the partywedding at all. While you may end up actually making money that is not the point of the day.

Its not only a great market but if you head towards the back they have a lot of street food stalls that are REALLY good. Try and get something really english like a scotch egg the scotch eggs there are amazing.If you want to see something in the west end but youre not that fussed about what theres a TKTS booth in leicester square that sells off tickets at a discount  its usually packed first thing but queues dwindle during the day.

Thats sort of like saying you like the look of a restaurant but you want to bring in your own food from another restaurant. I have seen exceptions like the wedding requires kosher catering. This can be very expensive as you might have to pay a fee to NOT use the venues catering as well as pay for the new catering company. ,weddingplanning,crvqmg3,9,t5_2rv3t

The sheer amount of choice was staggering. If I didnt already have clear guidance on her preference of style and colour I would have been incredibly overwhelmed.  I think I got pretty luck with the tailoring.  It was such a huge risk getting everything stitched over there but the quality and cost compared to getting it done locally in Toronto was worth it. There was much celebrating after...lol. ,weddingplanning,crx1g0s,2,t5_2rv3t
4183245,0,t3_38o00a,Mine has been SO easy so far because if all my wins. I am terrified something big is going to go wrong because all these huge things have gone right!First win. My father surprised us after we got engaged by saying he will foot the bill for the whole wedding and not worry about expenses at all! We were totally expecting to pay for this ourselves.  Our venue accidentally let me reserve October th in one of their venues. They dont rent their outdoor venues after . because of weather but because I had already put money down they let me keep in. So because of that mistake I dont have to worry about any other wedding in or around my venue for the whole day instead of just my alloted time so I can go up at sunrise to decorate if I want! I essentially paid for  hours but they said I can have all day! I used to sell wedding dresses and had been SUPER picky when it came to choosing mine. While I was complaining at a Girls Night party one of my girlfriends casually drops Oh my grandma is a seamstress and makes wedding gowns. She would totally give you a deal! So she is replicating a  Vera Wang for around a grand! SO EXCITED! That same girlfriend mentions that her mother is also a Florist and would give me a deal as well! We met a few weeks ago and this is turning out too good to be true! I sent out my Save the Dates a month ago and my Uncle contacted my father to ask if he could cater the wedding. He owns a Sizzler and wants to make it my gift! HOW IS THIS HAPPENEING!?!? One of my lifelong childhood friends mother does cakes and you guessed it she asked if she could do ours! Because she does them out of her home I get complete creative control and can even help decorate them! I am doing petit fours so there will be TONS to decorate. Aaaaand  and pretty sure my last. part one My fiance decided he wanted a very specific style ring. Well NOWHERE in Utah can we find a showroom with one to look at. I found a local designer that makes them but doesnt have a showroom and sells online only. I was complaining to a different girlfriend about this and funniest thing the man who owns the company banks with her. When she saw him next she spoke with him and he gaver her his card and said we can come in to look!! We made an appointment to meet him and look at their rings! part twoI was looking on Etsy for similar rings in a more budget friendly price and founbd one that looks EXACTLY like what fiance likes for LESS THAN HALF THE PRICE! AND THEY ARE LOCAL just a short drive to Northern Utah So we contacted them and set up an appointment to meet with them before the big name designer. As our wedding luck would have it ITS THE SAME JEWELER AS THE FANCY DESIGNER! So we are literally getting the exact same ring even more custom from the same people FOR LIKE  CHEAPER!part  While we were talking to him about Fiances ring he asked if I had my band chosen. I said not yet but had some in mind. He said I could have him custom make one alongside my Fiances! and even better I have an old cocktail ring with  small diamonds in it. He said he can just use the diamonds out of the cocktail ring for my bands! We really cant believe our luck! We have always been toldteased that wedding planning is terrifying difficult stressful expensive etc. So far its been so so easy that its almost scary. We have had a number of bumps some of them nearly qualify as mini disasters but we have been SO fortunate. TLDR The wedding Gods are smiling down upon us in every aspect of our wedding!EDIT Totally forgot to add we won FREE Save the Dates and FREE Thank Yous from the company we got our invites through!

4210533,0,t3_3938yc,I want to be friends with you because I am exactly the same wayit really eats me up inside to know if Ive upset someone even if I can rationally tell that theyre the one being illogical or overstepping etc. Im sorry youre having this stress  My thoughts about your mother are that if you want to maintain a relationship with your mother postwedding it might be a good idea to try to compromise at least a little. My husband and I are also not at all religious but his mother is quite religious and more than once pushed but to be fair it was only a gentle push for us to get married in a church andor have a priest officiate. Are there any religious passages that would fit with your wedding? I personally can appreciate biblical texts as important literature even though Im an atheistagnostic. Perhaps you could find a passage like one that doesnt mention God that would satisfy her but would be okay with you and your FH.As for the ceremony my only advice would be to try to ask her what the problem is with having the ceremony on the floor level. I realized with a friends wedding that a lot of her fights with her mother were stemming from her mother thinking her older traditional friends would find things like mismatched bridesmaids dresses weird. I feel like in your case because this is a weird thing for your mother to fight abouthave an opinion about her feelings might be stemming from feelings that its nontraditional for the bride and groom to be closer to their guests as in if you were getting married in a church you would be up on the altarraised portion. So one way to approach it could be to reassure her that its normal to have a ground floor ceremony. Another way to approach it would be when you discuss it with her you could take the tact of putting it on her to solve your problem. For example you have this problem where you will feel anxious standing up on the pedestal. You tell your mother that youd prefer to have the ceremony on the floor to help with your anxiety. She says Oh but itd be so much nicer on stage. Then you ask her how to solve your anxiety problem with having the ceremony on stage. When it becomes her problem to solve she may either surprise you with an awesome idea of how to have it on the stage while calming your anxiety or come to the same logical conclusion that you did that having it on the ground floor is much better.And for unsolicited advice about anxiety one thing that helped me feel less awkward about weddings was going to other peoples weddings. Even when the bride and groom are a little bit awkward it only comes off as super endearing and lovely because its their wedding and everything is so adorable and beautiful and wonderful. Like literally besides pulling a Ross and saying the wrong name during the ceremony any little thing that might make you feel awkward wont be. Youll be gorgeous and surrounded by the people you love!

4315223,0,t3_3aeh2y,Hey I feel your pain. My mom leading up to and even on the day of the wedding did some things that were REALLY not cool and fairly selfabsorbed. For example when we went to get our hair done on the day of she hopped in the chair at the salon first and took an hour and a half to get her extensions done so then our girl had to hurry for the rest of the bridal party so we could make it to the church on time. She also called me when I was on the party bus after the ceremony because she didnt like the way the hall was set up. At this point two of my bridesmaids said they would be on momduty for me for the rest of the night and run interference. Its unfortunate that some moms delegate their daughters to be the daughterofthemotherofthebride on their big days. It still gets me a little steamy to think about but stay positive!

The first thing he said Oh boy. Here we go again. followed by a discussion all about him and how hes so glad hes not married. I was pretty hurt that instead of sharing our excitement my dad acted like we should have known better this is the nd time around for both of us. We arent particularly close but get along fine so after the disappointmentshock wore off a bit I sent him an email explaining how excited we were and that we thought he would be too so his reaction wasnt what we expected. He has since become much more congratulatory. Hes coming to the wedding and even sent us a donation to help. Its obviously a different dynamic than you have with your mom but I share this story just because it illustrates that although it would be amazing if all parents were super supportive and as excited as we are parents feelings about marriage and weddings are often much more complicated. In my case my dad didnt intend to hurt my feelings but his first honest reaction was clearly about his issues with relationships and marriage. ,weddingplanning,csc7htz,2,t5_2rv3t

Our artist has mentioned that many guests will request that the artist add them to the portrait.  While we would love to have everyone in the painting we are having a large wedding and the wedding party and family and their SOs will be close to  people and thats probably where well cap the painted guests.

4371357,0,t3_3b0zzw,FMIL practically invited a whole town of people to the shower shes throwing. Shes been so touchy about the guest list for the wedding because she cant invite every single friend of hers. She initially said no shower in their town because they couldnt invite people that werent invited to the wedding. I didnt understand why that was a deal breaker because there would be plenty of people that are invited that could attend. But we agreed that if she felt weird not inviting people who werent inviting to the wedding that itd be best to just not have one. I guess she realized she only gets one chance to do the shower thing in her home town so now shes throwing one and told us upfront that people were coming that werent invited to the wedding. At the time she said it in a way that made both of us feel like she wanted us to add them to the guest list anyways to fix the problem she created. We simply told her that this shower was completely up to her and were going to show up and participate as long as these people knew they werent invited to the wedding. She said they knew and she got all misty eyed. FH shut down the conversation and has been dreading the shower ever since. So. Its happening. Theyre coming. But its on FMIL to deal with because she invited everyone and organized it. Blah!

To quote Shakespeare A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet.

The family history if you have kids is in their blood part of their genetic makeup and will always be a part of them. You may or may not be able to have children and the family line may end with you no matter what regardless of your name.

4382723,0,t3_3b7r0h,We are newly married.  He has a checking account that is only in his name but I have full access to it.  His name is on my checking account but not my savings.  We both have debt from student loans and we share it.  Pretty mush everything is shared.  It works for us but maybe not for others.We do have a budget which we sat down and discussed together.  Accounted for all of a bills first then decided how much fun money we would have how much into savings and how much extra goes towards the debt.  We have done fairly well at sticking to the budget.  My one tip here is to make sure you allot enough to fun money.  At first we didnt have enough in the budget for it because we said other things are more important.  We reassessed that this month because well it just wasnt working.  We were constantly thinking about how we no longer do many fun things because we didnt have the money for it.  Since we increased that by month we have been happier about it.  We can do a few more things and not feel like we dont have a life anymore.I would also suggest keeping a separate account for both of you that the other doesnt have access to.  that way you can use this account for presents for them and they wont know what you got them by looking at the bank account.  This is just my opinion on that matter and I know others think you shouldnt keep things from your spouse.  But I see it less as keeping it from them he knows about the account just cant see the activity and I still put it in our budget just non descriptive and more as a way to keep their presents and surprises a secret from them.  I think the biggest and most important part of all of this is to communicate.  Its helpful and if one of us has spent too much of the fun money then we communicate to the other about of thoughts.  Like hey were getting close to the end of our fun money for the month watch what you spend.  Or hey youre using a bit much on eating lunch out at work do you mind cutting back just a bit?  No hard feelings just talking openly.  We both realize that its only a budget things arent going to go exactly like we have on paper.  We may go over in fun one month but save in another category.  Its just a plan to try to keep us focused.  Nothing to do with finances at all but try to never go to sleep mad.  I wrote in my vows that I would always say sweet dreams and I love you before bed.  My uncle came up to me at the reception and said yeah well see how long that lasts.  I said it will last because I will make it last.  Been together for  years married  months and I have never not said those things.  He could tell I got frustrated at him for saying that makes sense since he basically just told be my vows were going to fail and he apologized but still said good luck keeping it.  Lol umm just cuz you dont doesnt mean I wont.  We work hard at our relationship and it is strong because of that.  His on the other hand is not.  He is disrespectful and picks a lot on my aunt.  We have fought maybe  times and have still never gone to bed without saying sweet dreams and I love you.  It takes work to have a strong relationship but it is worth it when all your friends tell you that they strive to have a relationship likes yours.  We just smile at each other and say thank you to one another.I dont know if any of this helped but I hope it did.  Also good luck and congrats.

All in the same envelope.Then they also have the option of traveling for the wedding as well.To me that would be the easiest way to deal with it rather than relying on word of mouth or putting it on the website where people might miss it. I also wouldnt put the no but see you in CT on the RSVP without any additional info either cuz then people could get confused.As far as small guest list goes maybe just send a separate invite to them with a wedding announcement and wishes to celebrate with them.

4478562,0,t3_3cfhub,What kind of celebration were you thinking?  If you want the more traditional Saturday version of a wedding where you have a ceremony in the afternoon and do a dinnerdrinkingdancing reception then I think you choose Friday.  Its going to be a lot easier for folks to get off work on Friday and plan for a relaxing night of celebrations than it woudl be to ask them to come to such a thing on a Sunday a work night.  If you value the presence of familyfriends for the whole event and are open to a probably lowerkey morningafternoon ceremony then go with Sunday.If you want the late night party but choose Sunday I think youre going to be disappointed at the turn out.  Some might still choose to take Monday off but I think its way more likely that folks in that situation would elect not to take any time off of work and just come for the ceremony and leave early.The trade off in my mind Do you want a traditional party with all your guests celebrating late into the night knowing that some folks wont make it bc of having to work or are you willing to have an earlier and likely more low key morningafternoon affair on a Sunday to ensure everyone can attend the whole thing and still be at work on Monday?,weddingplanning,csv6wdj,3,t5_2rv3t

4488208,0,t3_3ckjki,Yes! I was bummed about how the expenses added up so quickly but when I thought about all the local vendors and small businesses we are working with it stings much less. We live in an urban neighborhood and we can walk to our church and reception hall. Our photographers DJ and wedding planners live within a few blocks of our house. Our catering manager is the COO of the company. Even for the stuff thats not local  I bought my wedding dress from an indie designer so I cant be mad if shes in SF or NYC. My FH and I have tried really hard to create a wedding that reflects our values simplicity community and craft. I definitely realize its a privileged position to make decisions this way though.,weddingplanning,cswefv9,12,t5_2rv3t
4490162,0,t3_3cl87d,My FH told me once before he asked that I was being a little too intense about the whole thing  not the getting engaged part but rather trying to figure out whenhowwhere it would happen once I knew it was coming. Which in hindsight I was. Didnt take away from the proposal but I do wish that wasnt also something that is a part of the memory. Its hard but just take it easy. Itll happen when its supposed to and remember HE is getting engaged too. Even though its all about the girl typically he deserves for the moment to be just as much his as yours. So let him do it when it feels perfect for both of you  Good luck! ,weddingplanning,cswn9sh,7,t5_2rv3t

PRACTICE this a lot BEFORE the actual day. Practice in the mirror practice and have people take photos. It really works! Thats a good tip for ALL brides. That being said it looks like those photos are taken from what is generally an unflattering angle facewise for anyone. Your photographer will know better.

Every time we pay for something I think this could go towards a house or this could take x months off my payments. My mom also took out a small loan so she could give us money for our wedding. It was completely her choice. Ive been independent since I graduated high school and my mom always felt so guilty she couldnt help me with college.

4512755,0,t3_3cvje6,I work at a jewellery store where we offer a trade in with bridal so I see people upgrade for  etc year anniversaries especially from their old set to a new and bigger set. My FH proposed with a temporary engagement ring and then we picked out one together which was great. So the ring I now wear is my engagement ring not the first one he used but my current one. Dont feel bad about the sentiment. He would feel the same as that he wants you to have a ring that will last regardless of warranties or protection plans. My suggestion is to go in together again and see if you can find a new ring similar to the current one. Of not maybe see if there is another setting you would like. I know its frustrating when diamonds or stones fall out and Ive dealt with some people whose ring had been sent away for a longer period of time than them wearing it on their finger. Maybe look for one that doesnt have claws or as many. A semi bezel set with a low setting might be an option or possibly just a solitaire instead of lots of diamonds. Either way there are options. And again dont feel bad. Sometimes this happens to certain rings. We as jewellery store consultants want you to be happy with your ring. And your FH too. Im sure he would rather you have a new set than to continue to worry about your current. Good luck!  ,weddingplanning,cszhad2,6,t5_2rv3t

4540842,0,t3_3d9ac5,Woah some people are being very critcal of you! From your post it doesnt sound you like you are very demanding. Your feelings are hurt because she hasnt been participating in anything. I would be hurt too. Especially if you offer solutions to her excuses like offering to babysit her child. I suggest you talk to her. If she otherwise has been a great friend maybe there is something going on. I read that she is a bigger girl and has body image issues. I have major body image issues and I would dread buying a dress and being in the spot light. If she is having issues you can let her know that it is okay if she steps down. Maybe not fire her but give her a way out if she isnt capable of being a bridesmaid. I mean she hasnt even gotten a dress yet. If you dont want to lose her friendship try to be as careful as possible. You can tell her I have noticed that you have been busy and have been having trouble figuring out the dress situation. If you rather be a regular guest to avoid all of this I am  okay with it. I just want you to be comfortable and happy. You are still a very important person to me. Or something like that.

4632863,0,t3_3ef5nk,This is a sticky situation for me since my normal inclination is to say its your wedding there are no rules! so just do what you want. But in this case I dont see this going over smoothly by making special rules and treatment to certain guests especially since theyre all holding the same positions in your wedding. I know you dont want more children there but would that one little girl really ruin your wedding? If I had a child and my friend said Im sorry we dont want kids I would respect that. But Id definitely be hurt seeing other peoples kids running around like my child was singled out or I was not as good of a friend as the others with children. Its ultimately up to you and I think youre going to have a tough time with it but try not to let it take over your life! Just be prepared to have a solution where not everyone is happy because I really dont see how you can please everyone and yourself in this situation. ,weddingplanning,ctejidf,3,t5_2rv3t

4640759,0,t3_3eiqmx,There isnt really a feasible way to make that work not with that time slot and what youre wanting to do. If you had the chapel from say ampm that would be a horse of a different color.Typically you only have a cake and punch reception following a ceremony that starts after lunchtime but prior to dinnertime so like pm. Otherwise youre in meal territory  am weddings you have to provide lunch pm or pm weddings the same with dinner. Breaking up your reception into  phases is strange and its going to be kind of obvious that you all are ready to get out of there and start the real celebration at your ILs house. It would make more sense to use the chapel for photographs and your ceremony and instead of having some watered down version of a reception there just go straight to the house. Eat drink dance have cake. Unless this is all about certain people being invited to the ceremony but not the shindig at the house if thats the case well then... ,weddingplanning,ctfj98p,3,t5_2rv3t
4646821,0,t3_3elva6,I came into this post thinking ugh bad idea! But even after reading all the comments and coming into here feeling that way I cant think of a solid reason why its a bad idea. The closest I come and it is something you should be prepared for if you go this route is that guests might think its tacky or a gift grab.I think its a visceral mostly etiquettebased reaction that really doesnt consider how sweet your circumstances are. You want to be married to one another. You also want to have a big celebration with the people in your life but you cant do that right now. When I make myself get over my initial reaction I realize thats actually quite nice.I mean really why is this worse than a long engagement? If I wanted to break it down a long engagement where a couple saves up for a wedding is essentially saying we want to be married but we want the big party more so were going to put off marrying one another until we can do it big. I know Im boiling that down in a really overly simplistic way hell my partner and I are doing a long engagement and a tiny wedding! but the point is its not fair to oversimplify your situation either.I think your real concern here should treating the situation with a little extra delicateness with regard to guests. Its something you can even share via word of mouth when people find out about your elopementit wouldnt hurt to add that due to circumstances you two wont be able to do the big celebration for a couple of years but youre so excited to celebrate your love with everyone you care about! Because in the end thats what youre trying to do.If it were me Id do a big anniversary partyreception where people are aware of the formality of the event. I probably wouldnt do the whole ceremony but frankly I think vow renewals are a bit silly unless its been like  years or the circumstances are super unique.Be prepared for some people to think its tackyrude some people to think its cutesweet and some people to just want to party! I have a feeling if youre very up front about as much as you can be people will be more understanding.,weddingplanning,ctgann8,4,t5_2rv3t

If you are religious you can also have a banns sp? published in place of getting a marriage license. This would be done through your church  religious officant.  there are two ways to change you name in ontario. First you can assume your spouses surname. For this all you need is documentation that you are married. It will not change the name on your birth certificate. It will change the rest of your ID. With this you can also do a hyphenated name or a double barreled last name. The second way is to legally change you name. This costs money and will change your name on your birth certificate. It is also harder to change back if being married doesnt work out so well. Both of these can be done after you are legally married different parks have different rules. Some will not allow weddings at all others place severe restrictions such as no booze or music. You might find private parks would be more accommodating but harder to find. if they have a picnic area that can be rented out that might be ideal. Or a group camping area.  many people do a civil ceremony before. But its not required. Most religious ceremonies will also include the legal portion of the ceremony.  there are also rules about who can officate weddings. And this also varies by province. In ontario it must be a judge justice of the peace or a religious officant who is recognized by the province and religious organization. In quebec you can also apply to have a friend for family member officate for a small fee. These rules will be different in each province. Hope this helps ,weddingplanning,cttllhp,2,t5_2rv3t

I would solidly put this at a  on the crazy scale.  My FSIL assumed the same thing but she was in luck because my FH and I basically have no friends and I rather dislike my halfsisters so we are including his sibs in the wedding party.  Officially our only real wedding party member ie helping us with DIY and all the details and wahtnot since his sibs live on the other side of the country is our mutual best friend who introduced us Our Best Maid of Honor since we didnt want to fight over her.  Id just explain that you had already selected your party Ive always dreamed of having these long time friendsmy family in my wedding We dont want to have uneven sides and if we include you and your sisters we wont be able to match everyone up on his side I want a small wedding party so adding  to each side would be difficult and then see if shed be willing to do a reading add her own special touch to DIY if shes crafty help with music if shes musical etc.  Make her a part of the day in another way and then say and the best part is I wont make you wear the ugly bridesmaid dress!.

4879589,0,t3_3hpvx0,We knew from the get go that we wanted it small less than  for the ceremony and tops  for the evening reception. That narrows quite a lot of places as you dont want the place to feel empty. Then it came down to me wanting to have everything happen at the one venue. I didnt want to get married somewhere then move for the meal. I also wanted to be able to stay overnight at the same place. I also wanted to be selfish and not have it in a place like a hotel where non wedding guests would be able to stay. Once you have that sorted then its location which for us was somewhere that meant something to us as a couple. After all that there was only a few places left you end up knowing when you visit them. Budget wasnt too much of a worry for location. Thankfully the Visit Scotland website has a great list of wedding venues.,weddingplanning,cu9lyv2,1,t5_2rv3t

4914524,0,t3_3i7roi,What a great venue! And ahh yes tents. Have been doing mad research on these myself.When to book? Well first Id book your caterer. Many caterers can also coordinate tent rental for you and they may not have any cancellation fee for the tent. You also want to know from your caterer what power needs they have so you know if you need to rent a generator or not. If youre not renting tables chairs linens flatware generator etc from your caterer you may want to find an event rental place that can take care of all that AND the tent. So first figure out your caterer then figure out the other rentals. I would personally book the tent rental  months in advance of the date.Google event rentals in city name  or tent rental in city name . Get quotes from  places and carefully check their cancellation terms. Some will let you cancel for free if you do it by x days before the event. The ones Ive seen make you forfeit your deposit but allow you to cancel up to  days before the event. Make sure when you get quotes they includes delivery and setup fees and taxes. We were quoted  for a tent and then  for delivery and setup fees and  taxes on top of that. Dont be afraid to ask them for cheaper options if your first quote seems high.Also just wanna say that itd look pretty awesome if it was raining on top of a clear tent. So cozy!

4942644,0,t1_cuh3q7o,Because its common knowledge in our particular region that you dont even come close to an all white dress when attending a wedding. Particularly a floor length one. Its the same with any social peculiarityconvention in any regioncitycountry. Its just respectful and something to keep in mind. If you choose to ignore it and it ends up biting you in the ass you only have yourself to blame. Also I do think most people at least take the time to determine the appropriateness of their clothing choices before they go out. Not just weddings but jobs and interviews and family gatherings. You cant wear jeans to a formal interview just like you cant wear white to a wedding. ,weddingplanning,cuhk5ox,1,t5_2rv3t

They were this awesome bluegrass band and she couldnt wait for everyone to dance the night away to their country tunes. Problem is no one else except me was into bluegrass and no one danced at all to the band. She was really bummed. When the DJ came on for the last two hours and put on the typical cheesy s music and top s stuff everyone ran to the dance floor and stared getting down.A couple weeks back I went to another wedding with a band but the bride and groom were musicians and pretty much everyone at the wedding had music tastes in the same range. They had a really good jazzfunk band and EVERYONE was dancing. Seriously it was like we were at a show. It was awesome. A cheesy DJ at that wedding would have totally killed the vibe.I guess what Im saying is know your audience! If you know your guests will be into it a good band really takes it to the next level. If your guests have more varied tastes or youre just looking for a cover band a DJ offers more flexibility simplicity and are usually are less costly.,weddingplanning,cupp6c2,3,t5_2rv3t

5042675,0,t1_cuttdrn,While I completely understand your point I think it really depends on your bridal party. I got robes for my bridemaids just plain light pink silk from the knot shop.  of  of the girls I know will like them and will reuse them and the last maid I got her one anyways because I wanted all the gifts to be the same. Plus all the button ups I found were either too expensive or they were too plain.I would love it if I they wear them when their getting ready but Im not going to force any of them to and if they want to wear clothes under them thats fine too. If I were a bridesmaid I would love to get a robe too.My point is it depends on the people. As for OP I think its bull shit she wont be more accommodating. If I were you I would probably just get shorts and a cami that match the robe and just wear them anyways. I bet she wont notice and she does she probably will realize it looks fine. And if she doesnt then I hope shes happy with you looking uncomfortable with your butt showing in her pictures.,weddingplanning,cutu0i9,1,t5_2rv3t

Yes I am in the UK and it is seen as very bad taste to ask even bridesmaids to pay for their own dress.  Shoes its becoming more common for them to wear shoes they already own. It was the comment of well we dont mind where we stay can be a travelodge thats fine with us as if theyd already spoken about it before mentioning it. Im just going to ignore it for now and if they bring it up Ill just politely state that I dont want them to be tired on the drive on the friday and stress you dont need to be here for the friday night.

Like others have suggested make sure you know whether you are getting imagesfull rights to print them or if that costs extra. Ask about whether they edit. Also good to ask about what they do when the wedding day timeline goes off schedule. Most of mine said that they will stay as long as needed to get all the timeline shots even if goes over the coverage time. I also asked for photos from an entire wedding start to finish.

5078453,0,t1_cuxwjkf,It sounds like the communication issues go two ways. My husband and I are similar. Hell shut down and I wont tell him when things really matter. Were getting better about this though and what Ive learned is to stick it out when he wants to panic and back out of something that matters to me. Eventually we can work it out and compromise without drastic action.I think cancelling was a mistake. My advice is talk to the venue and see if you can get the date back hopefully without losing money. Then talk to your husband. Lay everything out logically and see if hell agree to rebooking. Tell him this is really important to you. Ask him what his objections are and be prepared with logical counter arguments. Stay calm and rational. Wanting a special day with family wanting the bridal shower etc are valid arguments. You sound like you arent telling him how much this means to you he needs to know this.Good luck. You can do this if you want to talk to someone who has had similar arguments feel free to pm me. Remember that you are important too you are an amazing and caring person your husband is a lucky man to have you. Once he realizes just hope much this means to you Im sure youll be able to work something out.

FH is also debating having an empty chair beside both his Mom and his StepMom with a single flower on each in place of his Dads. But well see.

The family and her friends rallied around here in the last months taking over all the typical mom stuff and last minute details...and just let her grieve. But they kept going knowing her mom would have been devastated if they postponed the wedding. Now is the time to ask for help from those not directly related to the situation. Your relatives yalls friends...anyone who can do things like make your place cards. Hopefully some of them will step up! Now its the time for an all call. A mass group text...a mass Facebook message something to get people together to take care of some of your more time consuming tasks that you have left on your list. If there is anything I can do from afar please dont hesitate to ask. Just at be aware that you wedding is going to be an emotional one. Prepare yourself to stand strong and be a rock for your FH and his family. Celebrate like no ones business celebrate in the way that his dad would have wanted to celebrate. Celebrate this new beginning and clear away a bit of the dark shadow that is covering this sad family.

I think if she is THAT insistent that you do it you could do it before the ceremony kinda how a father will kiss his daughter after he walks her down the aisle? Its not a goodbye kiss but its her last kiss before he gives her away so to speak. Maybe FMIL can do something like that. But to do it after the vows and before the first kiss?

5146982,0,t3_3lh068,We didnt have any issues with my parents as far as the wedding amp reception are concerned.  Im actually pretty close to all of my parents friends and already had the vast majority of them on our list before consulting my folks.  Now the rehearsal dinner... my fianc and I had originally planned on taking the bridal party parentssiblings and significant others to a local brewpub for a casual dinner.  Were talking less than  people.  But then my dad asked what our plans were and told me he wanted to switch to a much nicer restaurant and invite my aunts uncles cousins and grandparents too.  He was nonplussed when I explained that would mean inviting the same people from my fiancs family but ultimately Mom and I brought him around.  So now were hosting  people at an expensive restaurant with some significant help from my parents.  Four of them are close family friends that Dad couldnt bear to leave out.  I love em all so Im ok with it.We had a little more trouble with FMIL.  About a year or so before I started putting together our guest list she started dating a guy and things got pretty serious pretty quick.  At one point she added all six of his kids and their significant others and THEIR kids to the list shared Google doc and we had to explain that we didnt know these people well enough to invite them to our wedding and due to a variety of circumstances would likely never know them well enough.  We had to explain the same thing when a bunch of her bellydancing classmates ended up on the list.  I felt bad because of how many of my own parents friends were invited but I actually know those people and WANTED them at my wedding.  And FI has spent time with a lot of them too.  FI doesnt know his moms friends.  But to her credit FMIL accepted their removal as well.Where things got sticky is with FIs extended family  basically FIs grandfathers brother and all of his kids and all of their kids.  We were told that we had to invite them to avoid everlasting shame and dishonor and they fit within our numbers so we gave in.  There was SO much back and forth over these people.  It was like pulling teeth figuring out how many people there were and family isnt gonna work FMIL what their names were yes I need last names where they lived no I cant just send all the invitations to the one address you know etc.  We FINALLY got it figured out but not without a lot of angst chasing down RSVPs.

Anyone who is traveling from out of town I will call and ask them specifically if there is anyone they want to bring. Doesnt have to be a romantic partner but they have to give me a name in advance and I will send that person an invitation. I didnt think it was right to ask people to sit on a plane and get a hotel room but not allow them company for all that. All other single people are local and know a lot of the other guests they are not getting a  by default.

But really the most universally flattering and forgiving fabric will be chiffon so I would just expand fabric options.

You are still including them in the wedding party and you can mix up the photos so they are in some with your groomsmen.  You get the side you want and the brothers are in the wedding party.However if your fiancee has  brothers and still takes your sister that doesnt leave her much room for friends either.  My only recommendation is that if you do something else for siblings like readingsushers to do the same for all of them so you arent picking and choosing siblings.You could have the four siblings dressed like the wedding party but walk down the aisle separately and sit down...OR do that for the friends.  Etc.  There really arent rules about what wedding party folk have to do...you can always sit the siblings with family at the dinner.  Call them whatever you want honor them somehow and the family will have to accept it.,weddingplanning,cvb35zs,13,t5_2rv3t

How do you feel about this one? or Your face really lit up when you put that dress on! or You seem a little uncomfortable in all that tulle just making sure the focus is on her opinions and feelings.,weddingplanning,cvbgvr7,5,t5_2rv3t
5190983,0,t3_3lzzz3,After we first set a budget by estimating costs through researching stuff online we opened a joint account for the wedding. We both had some money saved up so we had an initial deposit into the account. Since Im a little obsessive after our initial budget I made a spreadsheet with low and high estimates for each aspect of the wedding and were saving up for the higher total estimate by contributing and equal amount monthly. Since costs come at different times of planning well be contributing up to the month of the wedding. Obviously Im hoping we dont actually reach the high estimate so any money left over well save or put towards the honeymoon. Keeping all the purchases from one account makes it much easier to track. Once weve purchased something or made a deposit I note it on the spreadsheet so I can see how that effects our total estimate. ,weddingplanning,cvbperm,2,t5_2rv3t

PLEASE BE SEATED. ltthis part was added because our friendofficiants have a history of forgetting to tell people to sit down leading to some awkward ceremonies Welcome to Maryland the Cloisters Castle and the wedding of FH and TerribleHashtags. All of you look terrific. My name is Chris and it is my honor to officiate this wedding. Before we begin please turn the volume of your phones up as high as possible so that when somebody gets a phone call during the ceremony we all know who to blame. Alternatively please turn off your phones as this ceremony will be unplugged. We have great photographers and we promise well share pictures! In this place we take ourselves out of the usual routines of daily living to witness a unique moment in the lives of Ts and FH. Today they join their lives in the union of marriage. To all their guests they are thrilled to share this moment with you. Over the years you watched them grow up went to school with them and worked alongside them. Because you are the ones who have supported FH and Ts and have known them so well it is only fitting that you are the ones to share this onceinalifetime moment.So on behalf of FH and Ts thank you. Thank you for your patience your kindness your generosity and your love. You set the example that allowed them to find their partner in life.Lets take them across the threshold from being engaged to being married together. A marriage as most of us understand it is a voluntary and full commitment. It is made in the deepest sense to the exclusion of all others and it is entered into with the desire and hope that it will last for life. Before you declare your vows to one another I want you to confirm that it is indeed your intention to be married today. Ts do you come here freely and without reservation to give yourself to FH in marriage? If so answer I do.Ts I do. Chris FH do you come here freely and without reservation to give yourself to Ts in marriage? If so answer I do. FH I do.Chris FH and Ts having heard that it is your intention to be married to each other we will now ask for FHs sister to read a selection from Les Miserable to discuss the nature of love and its creative transformative power.Reading  from Les Miserablesgt The future belongs to hearts even more than it does to minds. Love that is the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity. In the infinite the inexhaustible is requisite.gt Love participates of the soul itself. It is of the same nature. Like it it is the divine spark like it it is incorruptible indivisible imperishable. It is a point of fire that exists within us which is immortal and infinite which nothing can confine and which nothing can extinguish. We feel it burning even to the very marrow of our bones and we see it beaming in the very depths of heavengt What a grand thing it is to be loved! What a far grander thing it is to love! The heart becomes heroic by dint of passion. It is no longer composed of anything but what is pure it no longer rests on anything that is not elevated and great. An unworthy thought can no more germinate in it than a nettle on a glacier. The serene and lofty soul inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions dominating the clouds and the shades of this world its follies its lies its hatreds its vanities its miseries inhabits the blue of heaven and no longer feels anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny as the crests of mountains feel the shocks of earthquake.gt If there did not exist some one who loved the sun would become extinct.Chris I now ask for Ts sister to come and read from The Little Prince to reflect how that power of love respect and affection can tie two people together and wholly change their perspective on the world.Reading  from the Little Princegt What does that meantame? asked the prince.gt It is an act too often neglected said the fox. It means to establish ties.gt To establish ties?gt Just that said the fox. To me you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you. And you on your part have no need of me. To you I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes. But if you tame me then we shall need each other. To me you will be unique in all the world. To you I shall be unique in all the world . . .gt If you tame me it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life. You see the grainfields down yonder? I do not eat bread. Wheat is of no use to me. The wheat fields have nothing to say to me. And that is sad. But you have hair that is the color of gold. Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me! The grain which is also golden will bring me back the thought of you. And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat . . .VowsChris FH Ts I now ask you to declare your marriage vows. Please face each other and hold hands.Ts please repeat after meI TerribleHashtagstake you Future Husbandto have and to holdfor the most wondrous and terrible of timesfor the best and the worst of timesby day and by nightin sickness and in health.For I love you with all of my heartand swear to love you eternallyUntil death do us part.FH please repeat after meI Future Husbandtake you TerribleHashtagsto have and to holdfor the most wondrous and terrible of timesfor the best and the worst of timesby day and by nightin sickness and in health.For I love you with all of my heartand swear to love you eternallyUntil death do us part.Exchange of RingsAnd now we will exchange the rings.

That being said I think it probably will be best for your guests not to know you were legally married before hand to avoid awkwardness. You are having a ceremony whether legal or not so I dont think you need to send celebration invites if your other invites have already gone out. That will create mass confusion I think.

5265520,0,t3_3n3xiu,Last year I was a bridesmaid in a wedding with no MOH just four bridesmaids. It was kind of a disaster from our perspective. The four of us were split up across the USA and trying to coordinate matching shoes and dresses that everyone liked the bridal shower the bachelorette etc. with no one in charge ended up being a challenge. I probably sent and received literally one thousand emails over the course of the planning because no one was in charge and delegating tasks so each of us was trying to help and set up schedules and make plans but with no coordinator because we didnt want to bother the bride who was overwhelmed with other planning.I would recommend if you go the no MOH route assigning your bridesmaids each a task or two exclusively.

5305167,0,t3_3nmjwd,I think you really need to flesh out what you want. Your comments seem to indicate that you see marriage as a formality and didnt want a wedding but you also mentioned thinking it would be pointless without a party to celebrate. Why dont you go for the middle ground? Go to the courthouse and get married. You two have a nice evening and maybe a small trip. Then plan a big party where you have an iPod play some music get party catering much cheaper than wedding catering and some alcohol if youre up for it. It would be so simple to throw drinks in an ice chest and just have a backyard party. An acquaintance of mind just got married and the photos on Facebook show that they dressed casual for their backyard wedding and everyone just kind of hung out and chilled. It looked like tons of fun without the hassle and with a minimal price tag. You could easily take whatever youve already saved maybe put some money away for a month or two more I dont know what you have saved up and then throw a k party.  And for the people getting all touchy about OPs outburst it was labeled a rant for heavens sake. Stop trying to shame OP for being emotional and upset. Family drama real or perceived is enough to make anyone lose it from time to time. Most of us will have a moment where we hate it all and want to call things off because we had a bad day. Lay off OP and be the supportive community we are supposed to be. Thats what we are here for. Give constructive feedback and walk away.

Friends took pictures but they were also busy enjoying themselves and we hired this girl just for the sole purpose of walking around the whole day with a camera. The pictures looked nothing like the beautiful ones on pinterest. They look like the ones youd find in your parents album from the s. They will never be the focal point in our decorating. But you know what? I would do it again in a heartbeat. I prefer to decorate with art instead of pictures. And two years fyer our wedding we had a baby and most of the pictures of the two of us got replaced by ones with all three. In my home growing up there was always the one photo from my parents wedding and the rest changed as the family changed. The photos I have of my wedding captured the memories. I can look at them at remember all the fun and emotions. But I dont look at them everyday. I say this to give you a different perspective. If you think youll want to display your pictures and having glamour shots is important to you then yes spend the money. A good wedding photographer will most likely give you the best photos youll even have of yourself. Your friends will marvel at how stunning your wedding was. If that is important please spend the money. But if you imagine only one or two shots will be displayed in your home ten years from now. If youre OK reminiscing on the memories more than the perfectly set up shot. I dont see a need to spend thousands of dollars.,weddingplanning,cvq9n24,2,t5_2rv3t

Im a th year so Ill be in this lab with at least some of these coworkers for several more years. I think if you wont be in the lab anymore when the wedding happens it wouldnt be a big deal not to invite everyone especially if the ones who are invited are discreet.I dont think Id feel weird about my PI being at my wedding since I get along with him pretty well and there will be other people there who he could talk to FHs dad was my undergrad PI and they know each other a bit. I kinda suspect he wouldnt come but I dont know for sure. My main concern is that Ive only been in his lab for a few months so Im not sure if its too soon for an invite to make sense even though Ive known him for  years. Im also not sure if it would be weird not to invite him if I invite the rest of my coworkers.

5557032,1,t3_3r8hbv,Hell naw thats crazy.  My pictures are private... its up to me whether and how to share them.  I think thats insanely unprofessional.  I see in other comments that this photographer isnt alone but that doesnt change the fact that I think its a crazy practice not totally not OK.  Your sister should talk to the photographer about it.  My guess is that this is their standard MO but if your sister asks to be sent them privately first theyll probably be fine with that.  ,weddingplanning,cwlwfx8,1,t5_2rv3t

5566338,0,t1_cwm5sku,This! I actually have the opposite. My MIL is actually the chill one it is my mother who is the MOMzilla. Naturally I get emotional and irate when I have to deal with her control. We constantly argue over everything. Whenever I vent to people everyone tells me I should keep that oblivious attitude and just say ohh thats a good idea and just keep my mouth shut. In the end only so much they can do. I think people like your MIL and my mom just like to be heard and feel involved its hard to sympathize with those types but sometimes taking a passive approach is the best way. Play dumb and dont feed into their comments. I am slowly learning this the hard way. Good luck!,weddingplanning,cwn1zpz,1,t5_2rv3t

I was a moderator on their sister site the bump and I always kind of loved the snarky vibe that they had cuz it wasnt all puppies and rainbows about everything. If something was generally bad or controversial or your post was you being a brat you got real advice and nothing was sugar coated. Which for pregnancy and baby stuff is good cuz Im sorry some things that get asked or suggested are just completely insane for babies. However its also an entertainment factor. Anyways I dont frequent the knot thanks to the jack wads that run the forums. They completely screwed most of the regulars on the bump and are not a very trustworthy company. I wouldnt give them any personal info anymore if you paid me. It seems that even though they did an overhaul on their forums trying to rid themselves of bad apples as they put it its not working. ,weddingplanning,cwopbsf,22,t5_2rv3t

We had lunch shopped at tons of vintage stores walked around ate dinner stopped at a store for some wine and stayed up late talking in the hotel! We got brunch the next day before driving home.

5652915,0,t3_3sj8k1,We did a First Look and highly recommend it.  Two advantages to a First Look  .  It is a HIGHLY emotional day.  This is the only time you get with your soontobespouse alone during that day.  It is a private moment during a very public event.  The emotion will be reflected in the pictures and they end up becoming some of the best shots of the event.  .  Aftertheceremony shots are often among the least interesting pictures to look at yet they take up the most time as every permutation and combination of family members is arranged.  So any time you can save by getting pictures ahead of time can possibly save a lot of weddingday catastrophes as time runs out and things get rushed.  There is some resistance to the idea due to the romantic ideal of I want my husband to see me in my wedding dress for the first time as Im walking down the isle.  Yet youll be hard pressed to find someone who has done a First Look and regretted it for that reason.  ,weddingplanning,cwxssee,10,t5_2rv3t

5925124,0,t3_3we6ag,Story time! I was invited to a former coworkers wedding last year. It was in the spring so months in advance I went and found two peachycoral dresses one short and one maxi dress that was quite nice. Because of the color I took my time finding shoes and it ended up being way more difficult than expected. It was the day of the wedding and I panicked. I couldnt find a nonpatent leather nude heel to save my life so i bought a pair of black shoes and they looked awful with the dresses. I had to run out and buy another dress. I wore olive and black instead of coral and nude as planned and I was super bummed. We arrive at the wedding and as the ceremony begins I noticed the bridesmaids were all wearing mismatched short dress styles that were in the same exact color as the dress I bought. The maid of honor wore a maxi dress in the same color. They all wore the same nude shoes.I felt kind of relieved having not worn that! I feel like i would have either looked like a tacky coincidence or a bitter bridesmaid reject  but worst of all there is the prospect of being treated like part of the wedding party by the other guests especially in larger weddings. ,weddingplanning,cxwbccj,2,t5_2rv3t
5931086,0,t3_3vxi6e,If you do manage to find a park or something might I suggest saving up glass jars to put tea lights in? You can hang them in the trees make chandeliers out of them spray them with gold or silver paint andor glitter to give off a more intimate feel  the same can also be done with lace and ribbons... You can also use them in your centerpieces and even put tiny bouquets in them and hang them in trees etc. Dont underestimate the power of candles when influencing atmosphere and mood.I also saw a neat trick on pinterest where somebody filled an old wooden rowing boat with icecubes and used that to keep all of the drinks in so people could help themselves and then you dont have to pay for a bar etc.If you want to have cheap furniture you can make a crappy chair look fancy by draping material maybe lace or tulle over it and tying it with ribbons and flowers at the back. Then fancy up your tables with tablecloths and runners down the middle with nice place cards and centerpieces. Maybe even throw some glitter all over that shit  If you buy the flowers in bulk and then assemble the bouquets yourself its apparently loads cheaper too.I know this wasnt all specifically what you were asking for but I hope it helps!Edit  You can do tiers of cupcakes instead of a cake and also get your friends and family to take pictures and share them on an instagram thread so you dont have to pay for a photographer. Put disposable cameras on every table and set up a Polaroid camera on a tripod with props for adorable guest pictures. You can also ask your guests to being something for the wedding instead of buying you guys wedding gifts ie drink or serviettes. If you have any artsy friends you could ask them to design you some invitationsnamed place cards etc for a small fee.Sorry for the huge load of text I just cant help it when Im planning a similar budget friendly wedding!,weddingplanning,cxx3h8j,1,t5_2rv3t

If its going to fall mostly on your shoulders then you should plan whatever is going to be easiest for you. I know quite a few brides who also chose to do a very small elopement style wedding at wherever they wanted to honeymoon. And then had a bigger reception close to family at a later time or even a big potluck to celebrate. Weddings are getting less and less traditional these days so its really up to you!,weddingplanning,cy83hn1,1,t5_2rv3t

The most important thing right now is the health of her and her baby and making this time as stressfree as possible for all of us.  Maybe you could try pitching your reluctance to her again but spin it so its in her best interest?  Just say hey the unexpected could happen.  You might be on bed rest your baby might come early any number of things could happen hopefully not!!! that would add unnecessary stress to your friend.  At the end of the day your friend is acting extremely selfish.  You can still come of course just as a guest.

6021313,0,t3_3xrmtm,Honestly depends on your definition of destination.  We personally didnt really save any money by deciding to have a destination wedding getting married at sea on a  night cruise. The money we saved by not having a local wedding was offset by the expenses of us traveling and the cost per person of people who are attending. We also decided to pay for almost everything wedding related for our wedding party as they were already spending more money than normal just to come to the wedding. It was a personal choice you certainly can save money on a destination wedding if you budgetplan well.However what we did significantly save on is the amount of stressplanning involved. Every bride is different  I learned quickly that I did not care about the vast majority of traditional decisions. I didnt want to spend hours looking at chair coverings linen options etc. The upsidedownside of a destination wedding is a lot of decisions are already made for you. Additionally I was pleasantly surprised to find that for things I did care about the cruise line was happy to accommodate. One piece of advice if you do choose a destination  expect that people even very important people easily may not be able to attend cost cant get time off etc. We made a VERY short list of people  who we could not imagine getting married without them there and reached out to them privately first to make sure they would be able to come. ,weddingplanning,cy8x1td,1,t5_2rv3t

And I dont mean to sound really selfish but its our day ya know? Its a day for my future husband and I to celebrate our love and future life with loved ones and people who are happy appreciate and support us. She has a way of ruining things when drinking or sober but not as bad. She ruined my sisters engagement announcement and my college graduation party in one shot. She doesnt apologize for her behavior and generally just doesnt care if she hurt someone. I dont want that negativity on our day. Its not worth it to have her there just because she gave birth to me.

Long story short Dolly had just closed her bridal shop and was selling off the entire  line in her home. She is moving to an athome consultation style of selling this year. I arrived and tried on like  dresses. I fell in love with the first one I tried on which fit like a glove no tailoring required. I had gone by myself so I left after my appointment had lunch and texted pics to my mom and friends. I went back an hour later and bought it. I paid  out the door in cash.

You should look at when the local stores are having trunk shows for Maggie and see if theyll be getting Kamiya in for that.Also it always amazes me that no stores take advantage of the loan sample program.

The fantasy being sold is that youll find The One True Dress and your familyfriends will share a tearful moment with you.Except you already had that experience with your aunts dress!  Sure it needs alterations but the opportunity to make a family heirloom your own is far more meaningful than finding a random dress off of a rack.If you arent sure what direction you want to take your dress in by all means go shopping or just spend some quality time on Pinterest!. But be prepared for moderate to high pressure to buy a dress at your appointment and for the sales staff to have you second guessing your original plan of remaking your aunts dress.We both went a different route for our wedding attire  we got a dress and suit custom tailored for us dress in Toronto suit in Hong Kong.  Those were both unique experiences but we went alone and didnt try on a bunch of different styles so we never had that madeforTV shopping moment.  We loved how everything turned out and wouldnt have changed a thing!Long story short you do you!

I also noticed that their dresses felt... off I guess. Cheap almost. I went to Bridal Boutique in Lewisville GOTTA give them a shoutout and within  dresses I tried on I almost immediately realized that this was the one I wanted. My sister and MOH cried my mom and FMIL loved it and I didnt want to take it off. All together an awesome experience.

6276633,0,t3_41kmkc,Omg. This sounds so stressful. Im so sorry you are dealing with this.So it sounds like feelings are going to get hurt here because your parents expectations are so different from yours and your sister cant keep her mouth shut. So dont beat yourself up if some people get hurt. Youre doing your best. Also I know your family is putting a lot of pressure on you right now but you must stand up for your fianc and make sure you dont let your family ruin his wedding day for him. If you want to talk to your fianc about inviting more of your family do it because you want it not because your family is throwing a fit. You have to have a Serious Discussion with your parents where you say exact just you said here that you are only inviting  people to the wedding. Explain that originally you and your fianc had agreed to  so youve already doubled that and you will not go farther. Say that you understand they want the whole family to be there but its important to you that your wedding is calm and intimate and that your fianc feels comfortable. Remind them that this isnt a family reunion but your wedding and your fiancs needs are of critical importance. Do not let them continue to talk badly about your fianc that hes alienating your family and so on. Next time they do it shut it down immediately and say that you will not hear them say those things about him. If they continue walk away hang up the phone immediately refuse to listen. You must stand up for him. As for how to deal with extended family asking if they are invited and such. Stick to Were having a small wedding and sadly couldnt invite everyone we wanted. Then change the subject. Good luck dealing with all this. You can make it through! And in case it gets too tough  dont forget that eloping may also be an option.,weddingplanning,cz32z4e,26,t5_2rv3t

Is the ceremony area for your venue like a super giant spacious stage or something? If so I guess you could always fill that space with decorations or a smaller backdrop that would focus attention on you and your fiance. I went to my best friends wedding about a year ago and she had no wedding party and about  guests. There was nothing weird about it at all. I wasnt paying attention to anything around the bride and groom well except for when a boat blew its horn really loud in the middle of the ceremony I was too focused on the couple and their vows. ,weddingplanning,cz71xtw,3,t5_2rv3t

The cost of buying the bunting and fairy lights was soooo much cheaper than any where I looked. First time I set them up which happened to be the day before my wedding it was am absolute pain in the butt. So practice if you can or set them up well in advance. My positive the venue loved them that much that they let other people know who were getting married there and we ended up hiring them out about ten times each time more than paid for the cost of the drapes themselves. ,weddingplanning,cz8vpzq,5,t5_2rv3t

6329072,0,t3_429l5o,Yes. I especially feel like no matter how hard I try to make it easy for people there still has to be some form of drama. That being said my FH doesnt really get involved or have interest until it comes down to me telling him what decision Im making. THEN he cares. Which is sort of annoying because by then Ive done the research and made my decision based off that. Other than that its just the typical wedding party issues. Surprisingly he has more issues with his groomsmen than I do with the bridesmaids.  knock on wood I dont want to jinx it bc all the girls are coming over in a few hours and there is a potential for drama. As for my family they havent really seemed to care about any decisions other than the guest list.  It is kind of nice though because I dont have anyone telling me no or that they dont like something.

6347552,0,t3_42kyk2,Both sets of our parents are divorced so and heres what happened for us... My dad has always offered to help me with whatever I need throughout my entire life including my wedding so talking to him was easy and straightforward. My mom didnt offer any sort of help until after I had tried on wedding dresses.  She offered to pay for my dress and she was the last parent too offer help.  I didnt ask her at all because I know shes struggled financially her whole life. FHs dad offered to pay for the DJ because he wanted a specific one and also the deposits for the venue space. FHs mom offered to pay for the flowers.  I was originally going to ask her to arrange fake ones but decided against it because shes such a busy woman.  A few weeks ago she decided to write us a rather large check to cover more than just the cost of the flowers because she was sick and tired of spending money on her dead beat daughter while her responsible son was struggling so I guess that kind of counts as her offering?So all in all my parents volunteered their money without any prompting.  FHs parents were asked about what theyd like to contribute.If you want a more solid answer from that third set of parents you could try to casually talk about the wedding and what expenses still need to be covered while youre around them.

I went through the same thing when I got engaged.  Ive had women excitedly run up to me asking to see the ring they look at it and their whole demeanor changes  theyre like Oh. Isnt that cute. and turn up their noses.  Someone even complimented us for being so frugal.  Not to brag but the ring appraises for more than my  entry level luxury car I just checked KBB for fun  yep car is worth slightly less than the ring.

The first is getting married at port before the cruise guests come to port and witness the wedding then you go on the cruise as your honeymoon. The second is you get married at sea in this kind you have to pay for your guests to take the cruise.

Once it gets closer to the date and things get more stressful you dont want your in laws telling you how to run your wedding.  We kept our parents out of it and it was a fantastic wedding.  Once you let them in a bit there is a chance you will get bossed around.  Good luck and congratulations. ,weddingplanning,czl23zs,1,t5_2rv3t

She sounds like a disaster of a person. Being around narcissists is difficult but they dont change. Have your wedding. Invite your new sister. If she and hubby cant ditch their golf day they will look like assholes which has no bearing on you. Its the biggest day of you and your FHs life if she cant prioritize thats her dysfunction. Sounds like she would make it about her anyways. Try not to focus on this one rotten persons behavior and focus on all the cool fun beautiful stuff about your wedding.

6475659,0,t3_44c9l0,I kind of regret not doing an engagement announcement. Mostly because I wanted to keep a copy! I just left it a bit late. On the one hand it is a waste of money if you dont need to announce but a harmless waste of your mums money if she wants to do it. Maybe it isnt so bad to just let her have this one. But on the other hand youll know better than me if letting this one slide will have a knock on effect on her other attempts to take over the planning process. The latter notwithstanding Id probably on balance just let he do an announcement. Itll pass almost everyone by except your mum who presumably wants the clipping. If it was something like trying to change the dress or decor or something with a tangible effect on the day Id have more fight in me but not for this.

6503031,0,t3_44o2it,I was in this situation a few months ago. Knowing how quickly the costs of a wedding can add up my practical wedding vision involved a tiny courthouse ceremony siblings and parents only followed by a larger dinnerreception with a vow ceremony in the back room of a local Chinese restaurant. The private back room seats about  and they charged plate for a total reception cost of a little over K. FH wanted something more elaborate with a more flexible guest allowance. We looked at other venues for a more traditional ceremonyreception I looked into local working farms that hold similar size events the aviary the aquarium professional wedding venues and the state fairgrounds.  We ultimately settled on a lodge owned by a nonprofit which we are getting for a steal. We are keeping costs down by not hiring a DJ the venue has a sound system which Ill just plug my iPod into doing our own flowers Bouquet corsages and boutonnieres for  already done and borrowing matching linens from past weddings in the family. In addition I will probably end up wearing a white cocktail or bridesmaid dress as a wedding dress and having a dry reception not really an issue since almost everyone on both sides of the family is Mormon. We are ordering a small  cake to cut and the rest of the cakes are sheet cake ordered from a very nice bakery. We are paying some of my brothers friends to keep the buffet style food tables full and to set up and take down the reception. We allotted money to buy a necklace for all the sisters and a tie for all the bothers there are a shitton. The centerpieces and other decor for the venue all DIY are slated to come in underbudget. The combined cost of our rings including my engagement ring is less than  because who wants the pressure of carrying several thousand dollars around on their hand for the rest of their life. I designed the invitations and engagement announcements myself single color ink on cream card stock with envelopes bought on Amazon. FH designed and built the wedding website himself over the course of a couple weeks thank god for the techsavy. In addition to the DJ we are cutting some other traditional things from the wedding as well. We arent doing favors all of the centerpieces are nonfloral and my dress probably wont be a wedding dress. The reception will be dry and Im asking my FSIL to do my hair for me Ill probably do my makeup myself. There wont be a band and there wont be a big fancy cake but Ill be there and FH will be there and thats all that matters in the end. Our total budget is less that K and well probably have about  people turn up. Its possible I promise good luck. ,weddingplanning,czrynvu,1,t5_2rv3t

Even if you cannot do anythingpress charges in terms of actively keeping these people from harming others please make certain you get the support you need if not from a group then from whatever kind of extra help your own counselor can recommend. Sexual abuse is not a joke and it is not something that a lot of people have the strength to deal with before during or after or even if it doesnt happen to them.

I told him I couldnt put something like that up where my parents and older relatives would see it. My family was forced into internment camps during WWII like all other Japanese Americans during that time and we consider Jap a derogatory term associated with the racist views of that era. Not to mention I was absolutely mortified that this was going to be handed out to all his other relatives as well.To his credit FH of course felt terrible and understood and he spent a lot of his own money to fix and reprint all the copies of the calendar with a more innocuous tagline before they were distributed.

6578846,0,t3_45s4dl,Were doing DIY drinks and the most helpful things I learned wereFigure  drinksperson for cocktail hour  drinkperson for each subsequent hour. If you have a hour reception that comes to  drinksperson. That sounded like a lot to me so we scaled it back to  drinksperson given what we know about our guests some drink a lot most drink a little. Once you have that figured break it down into categories of beer wine and liquor or just beer and wine for you. To make things simple lets say  wine and  beer.You have  people x lets say  drinks   divided by    wine beer. There are an average of  drinks per bottle of wine so  bottles of wine. Then you can either buy  bottlescans of beer or however many kegs that figures to I tried to look it up for you but it looks like there are different sizes of kegs.We actually just went and purchased all of our alcohol yesterday so to give you an example... We have  guests and we bought  cans of beer  bottles of wine and  mL bottles of liquor. We didnt exactly follow the formula that I wrote above because like I said we have a pretty good idea of what our guests will drink and how much.Hope this helps!,weddingplanning,czzt1ic,7,t5_2rv3t

A couple reasons  The floor was some kind of hard material and that made it tougher If your ceremony starts at pm generally people dont arrive at pm they arrive earlier plus usually a bit of mulling about after so the standing time is longer than you think. Id think really hard about my guest list and if theres anyone with challenges that might have an issue that you could have a limited number of chairs for. ,weddingplanning,d007l2b,12,t5_2rv3t

Id recommend picking up the  A Practical Wedding books. One is more about background and thinking about the wedding and marriage and the other is more nitty gritty planning. Both are excellent resources especially given how much time you have. Write down all your ideas and try not to get too attached because you have plenty of time to change your mind a few times but going back to old lists a couple times and revisiting means you might see that a couple ideas have stuck the whole time. ,weddingplanning,d08e5gs,1,t5_2rv3t

6671726,0,t3_46zhi1,My mom is Jewish and my dad is Catholic. I was raised Catholic went to church and religious ed got confirmed etc. Its not a big part of my life anymore and its never been an important aspect of my wifes life so there was no question that wed do a secular ceremony. We asked a friend to officiate and he got ordained through ULC.During the planning my mom asked if she and my dad could walk me down the aisle per Jewish tradition. Growing up the extent of our exposure to Judaism was lighting the menorah during Hanukkah but okay mom and dad can escort me because I like the idea of both my parents being there with me.Then she asked about the glass smashing at the end of the ceremony she had researched it and found that a light bulb is better than a wine glass because wine glasses can be sturdy and not smash as expected. I agreed and then my mom  bless her  went on Etsy and ordered a custom pouch for it.I drew the line at the Hava Nagila though because the idea of being lifted up on a chair by our guests was a little frightening to me  About a month before the wedding my mom mentioned that my dad  who isnt a big sharer of feelings  was disappointed that we werent including any Catholic elements in our ceremony. I wished I had known this a little earlier but I also understood where he was coming from and I felt pretty bad that I hadnt really tried to make a nod toward this part of my heritage.So we tracked down an old college friend who wed thought had fallen off the face of the earth years earlier  turned out he was currently in seminary and was delighted when we invited him to give an opening blessing! So we basically had a secular ceremony ULC officiant secular readings and processionalrecessional music wrote our own vows bookended by Catholic and Jewish elements. Like I said religion has never been a big part of my wifes life but coincidentally her dad is Jewish and her mom is Catholic so it was nice to be able to include these religious aspects.

6680562,0,t1_d09zmxm,Hi!  We did not have a rabbi and instead had a friend officiate for a variety of reasons.  Fortunately that meant we got to write the entire ceremony word for word including the Jewish things that we wanted and excluding the others.  We did not do any blessingsnothing in Hebrew except for a few words thrown in like mitzvah and lchaim nothing about God.We basically just had a short explanation about the breaking of the glass like The groom will now participate in the tradition of breaking the glass which represents... and The bride and groom will now drink out of the same glass of wine which represents...  We actually said nothing about these things being Jewish traditions and it went fairly quickly so no big todo about it was necessary.  My dads side is used to this since my mom is Jewish and we didnt feel the need to overjustify anything since what we were doing wasnt overtly religious...nothing about a higher power so no Christians could really get offended.Good luck!,weddingplanning,d0abuo9,1,t5_2rv3t

6742043,0,t3_480hoh,. Photographer. This is what I do for a living. I charge a lot because couples expect a lot. In all honesty you dont need more than  images. Id slash my price by quite a bit if a couple said they only wanted the ceremony a handful of details and some reception coverage. Keep family photos to a small number. You dont need  group photos.  hours will get you great images to hang on a wall and remember your day by. Most people want those blogworthy recaps but if you notice theyre  images that can sum up the entire day. You can get quality if you dont expect quantity. . Decor. I stare at a couples centerpiece while taking pictures and then editing. I stare way more than your guests do and a month later I probably couldnt say if you had flowers or even what color your centerpieces were. Set a mood with candles or lighting but the small details will not be missed. It is VERY true that all guests will remember is if the food and entertainment were good. Focus on those two things. . The dress. Everyone dreams of the most beautiful dress and how theyll feel as though theyre in a fairytale. Try on as many as you can. Clearance sales Craigslist... Nobody will know where you got it or how much you paid. A consultant recently told me nobody cares about your dress.. You will be the bride and you will be beautiful because you will be surrounded by people who love you and the smile on your face is the only thing that matters. Some of the most stunning dresses my brides have worn and the ones I thought were most unique turned out to be bridesmaids dresses or prom dresses. In fact the most talked about dress amongst my circle of fellow wedding vendors was a light blue gown that fit the bride so well and complemented her features that it looked outrageously expensive. She had bought it at Dillards at the mall for . We still talk about it years later. My dress is pink because of this. . Dj You dont need a light show. You need someone who can watch a crowd and figure out what to play next to keep the party going. If you know someone who runs a soundboard at a church who may have some mobile equipment why not? Ask local schools who they hire for dances. Usually they are cheaper options and sometimes are parents who do it on the side. . Cake. Flowers. If you have a SAMs club or Costco join right now! I know tons of brides who have paid  for stemmed roses and filler and had leftovers. Costco has great flowers! Sheet cakes are just as tasty but so much cheaper. Bake a small round cake to cut in front of guests and serve sheet cake. Or cupcakes. Tiered wedding cakes are honestly a waste of so much money. . Invitations. WILL BE THROWN AWAY. Keep that in mind. I also design and sell custom invitation suites and cringe at the thought that my clients pay  per person and they will end up in the trash. Costco sells invitations. Heck print them at home on cardstock and wrap a gorgeous ribbon around them. Simplicity is elegance. . Favors. Not needed. I also recently worked as a coordinator for a wedding venue. I carried boxes of favors to the dumpster each wedding. Favors with the couples names or date were usually not taken at all. Edible favors were still quite abundantly left behind. You feed and entertain your guests. You are not required to give them a gift. I have attended hundreds of weddings from black tie formal to courthouse followed by Taco Bell and one stands out the most. It was in a backyard and the aunts made the food. They rented a dance floor and cafe lights which conpletely transformed the yard. Candles on every table created an elegant ambiance. I cant tell you what kind of chairs we sat on. I cant tell you what color flowers she had or if they were fake or not. What I can say is I danced my butt off because the dj played fun songs everyone knew and the entire night was wonderful because the bride and groom were so gracious and truly enjoyed their night. The bride did splurge on her dress and it was absolutely beautiful but she had it in mind to sell the dress immediately to recoup some of the cost. Her budget was  and her wedding album is just as striking as my brides who have budgets of . The little things add up. Do you need to spend  on boxes to ask bridesmaids to stand with you? That money could buy  roses to make your bouquets. Do you need  shoes when nobody will see them and they may hurt in an hour? That could buy  cupcakes. At the end of the day some things you might think are important just simply arent. ,weddingplanning,d0goo05,52,t5_2rv3t

6783721,0,t1_d0kz8eg,I didnt see anyone being judgemental in fact there was a lot of really good thoughtful advice here!  It seems every comment is sympathetic to your situation along with gentle reminders to put friendship before the wedding. None of us know the dynamics of your friendship and seeing the edit certainly adds another dimension but I hope you dont dismiss all of the good advice out of hand bc you are feeling judged negatively. People offering advice meant to ensure you maintain a relationship that is clearly important to you is hardly judgemental.  It sounds like you are bent on replacing her but I have to agree with PPS who advised against this. It makes he first bridesmaid appear replaceable and the replacement...well a replacement or standin. It sound like youve rationalized it by choosing someone close to you but if that were really the case why wouldnt you have chosen her to begin with?  The WP are your most honored guests not props. I am sorry this happened and I know youre bummed but I still agree wPPs who encourage you to put the friendship ahead of your wedding.

So instead of expecting him to care about everything or expecting him to guess which things I want him to care about I make it really easy for him.So like I know he could give two shits about what color flowers to put in the centerpieces but I wanted him to have an opinion on the Save the Dates so I designed three and we picked our favorite together. When we picked a venue I asked him to come up with a few things that he wanted he wanted water and mountains and I found things that had that.As far as doing things with his mom maybe ask to come along on those errands? I dont really think that him not consulting you on his groomsman gifts is super outlandish personally but you definitely should have had some say in your own wedding band I would be upset on that one. Im with everyone else here though you probably need to let him know how you feel. If he feels like he cant win with wedding things you could try framing it as I know you feel like you cant win at this so here is how you can win! Do these things with me!.,weddingplanning,d0nxjva,3,t5_2rv3t

6833860,0,t3_49ctxo,Im so glad you posted this. Tbh I dont get the whole we dont want strangers at our wedding movement!     Its very odd to me but maybe thats bc we have a large family and friend group spread out all over the country. It would have been impractical of us to attempt to meet each others entire invite list!  We met as adults so between the two of us there are  undergrad universities and  grad programs. Bc of these separate friend groups we each had people in our wedding party gasp! our SO had never met. Regarding family friends I feel like it would have been selfish and ungracious of me to try to keep my ILs family friends off the guest list simply bc I had not met them. This obviously doesnt apply to the couples I sympathize with who have parents trying to shoehorn an absurd amount of guests onto the list wo considering the couples budget but I think that is a guest list issue and not a we dont want strangers issue. A few single friends I know brought dates neither of us had met. They may or may not still be dating we dont care!  We wanted everyone to be comfortable and have fun and if bringing a date we didnt know ensured that we welcomed them. We didnt put qualifiers on our friends in relationships either  like only people who live together are getting invited with an SO! Or we only consider couples in a relationship if they are together for a year or more! Or if we havent met the SO they arent getting an invite bc STRANGERS!  I wish these examples were exaggerations but they are not. In any case being on the other side of the wedding where we invited people we didnt know the thing we each gained was more friends. Im now friends with the groomsmen I had never met and their wives and I really enjoyed meeting my SOs family friends most of whom added me on FB after the wedding. I feel like having people we didnt know rounded out the party nicely ensured our parents had people that were special to them there and grew each of our family and friends circles in a very positive way.  I certainly wouldnt recommend adding so many hat you have to change the venue and stress your budget but if you have room for any go for it. Our experience was very positive!

So if you do want to accommodate those who may complain it makes sense to do the opposite of this instead of having two full different menus.

6916692,0,t3_4ah3mb,My advice based on interactions with my own mother so your mileage may vary is to sit down just you and your parents and tell them that you are going to have a small wedding. Dont tell them that you WANT a small wedding because this opens you up to them trying to change your mind tell them that you and your FH have decided that the wedding WILL BE small. This situation is not one that will age well you want to take care of this as soon as possible. If your mother is anything like mine she as already promised invitations to several dozen distant family members. You may want to approach this the same way you would a kid who doesnt like eating a specific food. Talk about all the perks of a small wedding the lower cost getting to spend more time with your individual guests and lots of different options for venues! Avoid letting them associate any negativity with your intimatesized wedding celebration because they may get carried away and start to resent the situation. I would also personally avoid having the entire conversation be about the size of the wedding seeing as how they might fixate on that one point mix several firm statements about the size of the guest list in with some other conversation about the wedding. Talk to your parents about the food for the wedding what youre thinking of wearing a funny anecdote about your FHs family and hit the guest list point several times to make sure that it doesnt get lost in the shuffle or forgotten. ,weddingplanning,d10bw7o,15,t5_2rv3t

6972435,0,t3_4b5gwv,I was in your shoes this time last year and went back and forth for a good while about what to do. I had an outside beach wedding and in the beginning I was adamant about not getting two sets of chairs and having friends and family set up etc instead of paying for someone else to do it. We paid extra and had the rental company set up AND take down the chairs. No one wants to do this before the ceremony of after the reception. It was worth the extra money and peace of mind. We bit the bullet and got  chairs  chairs for ceremony and reception. Yeah it cost more but was it worth it? You bet. We had a very short ceremony and it was still  minutes long. I personally could not have asked everyone to stand that long. We did think about just doing for those who need them but couldnt bring myself to do that either.After invitations were sent out people did ask about seating for the ceremony and were beyond relieved when we said yes there will be seats for all since it was on the beach. Ultimately it is up to you but if you have it in the budget I would say bite the bullet and make sure your guests are comfortable.

Longer ones give you more time to save up and plan. But also more time to change your minds multiple times. Shorter engagements work for people who can afford it and who can mentally handle the added pressure of doing everything a little faster. Even before we got engaged I knew I wanted a New Years Eve wedding it just depending on the timing of when we actually got engaged. So then we had to decide if we wanted a year long or two year long engagement. I am not a patient person two years would have been absolute torture for me. ,weddingplanning,d1d5qop,2,t5_2rv3t

You never know how someone on the receiving end of an action will interpret that action kwim?  In this case her interpretation of not getting an invite could run the gamut from thinking it was an just an oversight to an outright slap in the face. Sending the invite saves you the impossible task of knowing how she will react. The way I see it sending the invite has the probability of more positive outcomes she declines gracefully she accepts and you guys repair the friendship and so on vs. not sending the invite which could result in anything from mildly hurt feelings to a spectrum of negative outcomes on the friendship. ,weddingplanning,d1dbnr9,5,t5_2rv3t

The book really helped ease my mind about a lot of things. You and your SO will have to compromise if he wants a lot of traditional things but all you need to get married is you guys and a license and probably the officiant and a witness. Everything else is fluff. Edit one thing I heard on the Facebook weddit group was a bride saying she isnt staying hidden away before the ceremony they will be out greeting guests together.

Talk to real people get suggestions etc.  My seamstress did a good job but it took forever to be done and she charged me much more than I expected.  Ive had friends get married since then and use other seamstresses and have great experiences.  But Im sure they did more research than I did before choosing one. That said Davids Bridal experiences vary a lot from store to store.  My store is amazing and I love all the women who work in alterations.  I wish I could go back in time and have them alter my dress especially since the only alteration I had was a hem and a bustle.  But I have heard bad things about a lot of DB stores. So it depends...

Finding the venue that meets all your needs and wants seems nearly impossible. Not to mention venues go like hot cakes as far as getting booked. They are forever changing their rates so be aware of that. That happened to us. We were in love with one of the venues we had visited and well only to find out after a few months their rates had went up. So they were now out of our price range. It took us a year to find our venue. It meets most of our needs and wants and is in our price range. So when I stumbled across this hidden gem I was in love. Not to mention this venue should be worth more than the prices they have set.

Im assuming that maybe they all seemed like they had no issues with the prices of the dress because no one wanted to be that one bridesmaid even though its totally legitimate and ok to be like Nope thats way too much money.Go privately to each one that hasnt bought it yet and just try to be open and dont make it a big deal if you want to spot them money and make sure its clear that youre expecting them to pay you back when theyre able to if theyre really sensitive this might make them feel better so they dont think youre just giving them a handout if youre worried about that that way youre just giving them a loan. Just be understanding like hey I know youre in a tight spot I dont want you to feel bad because of it but we really need to get these dresses ordered...,weddingplanning,d1qz5vv,2,t5_2rv3t

7161694,0,t1_d1s4mzy,Yes! If I posted the honeymoon registry link on my wedding website and said hey holes use this to get me stuff or else then Id say thats bad manners. DBut for crying out loud a registry is optional. Its not worth getting your underwear in a bunch over so you can go on and on about sideeyeing people. Dont agree with it? Then dont purchase from it and move on. Thats no skin off anyones back.I was never on board with the whisperdownthelane approach of not having a registry. I know my family and my husbands family we would have been inundated with What do you want?!?! That wasnt going to work for me. Being direct  with a small traditional registry and a honeymoon registry  worked out perfectly. In the end I agree you have to know your crowd.

7176341,0,t3_4ds9wg,We invited  people and offered online RSVP only we have a wordpress site so we used a plugin to grab RSVPs and modified it to our tastes except for  people who we identified as technophobes mostly my grandmother and her friends who we sent RSVP postcards to. As of the deadline we only had  people outstanding and those were because they were in the well I just dont know yet camp. Theyve now all RSVPed.I highly recommend online RSVPs because theyre cheaper for you easier for guests who never send mail I literally had to go hunt down a post office mailbox when we mailed the paper RSVP for a friend of ours and allow you to do easy realtime tracking of the ones you havehavent received.The system we used let us associate attendees so when John Doe typed in his name to RSVP hed also be asked about his wife Jane Smith but they couldnt add their children as extra guests and I also used the format to build in complex questions like food allergies whether they plan to take the trolley weve arranged between the two locations and whether theyd like a reminder email which will have addresses times and parking info.,weddingplanning,d1tvudp,3,t5_2rv3t

7177982,0,t1_d1u10dj,If I recall correctly they both need to RSVP so invitee could say yes and guest could say no.  But when you load your guest list itll organize by the name of the first person in that household and also how many are in the household so you can see a whole family at once.  Ex Dr. Jane and Mr. John Doe.  Jane goes online and and types in Doe.  All Does including her sister Sarah Doe show up separated into families.  So she sees Doe Jane City State Zip with her and Johns name listed below it.  In a separate row she sees Doe Sarah Sarahs location and who was invited under that family name.  I also set it up so that for folks who had whole families the main person was Doe Family.  Because I had many Doe Familys e.g. lots of folks from my dads side of the family having the location info was helpful although I think it was overkill bc the system lists all family names under the main name anyway so you totally know which Doe family you are supposed to click on as a guest.  Anyway.Jane clicks on her family link.  It brings her to a page to RSVP for herself and John each having a different button to click on in order to RSVP so she can easily say she is coming but John cannot make it.When you log in you see Jane Doe  family group has  person attending the ceremony and  person attending the reception.  When you click on the family link youll see both John and Jane listed.  If you click on Jane she pops up as a yes for both ceremony and reception.  John shows up as a no if you click on him.  Sorry for the convoluted word example but I cant find a better way to describe it without pictures.  I will say that I uploaded a few fake guest lists first and played with them both from the admin side and also from the side guests see.  That way I could figure out the best way to set up my excel file to work with the system and that was really helpful.  You can easily delete all guests so these test names dont gunk up your actual guest list once you get to that point.  Hope that helps!Edit to add I just took my template and modified it for the Doe situation above.  PM me if you want me to share the excel CSV file with you.  I dont like posting publicly bc google drive knows my real name. But Im happy to share with folks who request it.,weddingplanning,d1u2l2d,2,t5_2rv3t

7314783,0,t3_4fk5o4,Since no one has said it yet my advice is not to tan. You said you have olive skin which Im sure is the opposite of pasty to everyone but you! I bet its gorgeous and healthy since you said you use sunscreen. And if youre on certain medications like birth control tanning can even create hyperpigmentation on your face that could last until well past your wedding.     If you want to feel better about your skin you could invest in some quality exfoliants and moisturizers! Neither risk the cancer or wrinkles. ,weddingplanning,d29n3gd,24,t5_2rv3t

7316202,0,t3_4fim0z,My grandmother both grandfathers and step grandfather have all passed away. FHs grandpa has passed as well. Our venue use to be someones manor back in the day so they have a library that they tend to host cocktail hour in. We decided to personilize the cocktail hour roomlibrary to have pictures of us growing up as well as pictures of our grandparents who have passed. I was ridiculously close with my grandmother and the thought of her not living long enough to see me walk down the isle depresses me more than anything else. I was fortunate enough to introduce her to my FH when we first started dating and she loved him like her own grandson. So we figured having pictures of our grandparents as well as pictures of us growing up with other family member as well was the best way to honor them. I also wanted to set up empty chairs with their own place setting card on the plate during the reception but our wedding is ridiculously expensive and would cost over  to have empty seats its a bit ridiculous i know for no one to actually sit in them. Hence the pictures during cocktail hour. ,weddingplanning,d29swkr,1,t5_2rv3t

7319682,0,t3_4fltjy,Mother here. My daughter is nearly two and I still breastfeed her for reference. A one year old is a LOT easier than a newborn. You can leave them for quite a while if youre still breastfeeding and for however long you want if youre done with it. My daughter at one was only napping once a day and feeding for comfort throughout the day at random intervals but it wasnt like she required it to survive and I needed to be with her every second. If you want this girl as your bridesmaid please dont let having a baby stop you from asking her. It does hurt being excluded from things just because you have a kid. Yes she will have to probably work around a few things and might not be able to come to the entirety of every single event but you should be picking a bridesmaid because you want them there on the day to have your back not just to be at every party and be present  of the time because youre getting married. I know in an ideal world youd love to spend all that time with all your bridesmaids but Im sure she would like to be hanging out and partying instead of the insanity that is motherhood but her priority will always be with her kid first. So be aware of that.If you are concerned maybe just talk to her and say Id love you to be a bridesmaid but I dont want to put any pressure on you by doing that. How can we figure out a happy medium that works for both of us?,weddingplanning,d2a74dr,9,t5_2rv3t

It can be hard to envision when youre much smaller than the sample dress because they have more poofy fabric but a lot of that tule can be removed and flattened out. If you have a dress youre unsure of because its poofy ask the assistant to help you flatten the skirt to get an idea of what it would look like without some fluff. Its a pretty common alteration so it shouldnt be too much unless you remove it all.Also one more story of that crazy sales lady. I gave her my price range and she immediately goes omg I have the perfect dress for you. Youre petite and itll look amazing. it was a huge ballgown btw. Its about  out of your price range but I just have to show you because youll LOVE it!  uhh what? No. Then later when I see a dress that actually matches what Im interested in I ask her if I can try that on. It was honestly at the upper limit of my budget but still in it and she goes oh you cant try that on its out of your price range Im like and that  dress ill love wasnt?. She was something else haha.

I started off being cool with him watching porn.  I really think this stemmed from trying to be a cool girl.  He always felt bad after watching it lower selfesteem less motivated less empathetic depressed and he was by no means addicted.  I cannot imagine the emotional toll that could have.

7452072,0,t3_4hd57t,I am on a similar journey I was growing it out for so long to have it pretty and long for my wedding then I realized a few things.  I hate long hair on me  I dont have the patience to style long hair and  I will only be trying to look like someone Im not on the day I should look however I fucking want to. My hair was long enough to French braid I got it cut off into a long pixie in November and because it grows maniacally fast it makes a  ponytail that barely holds any of my hair because of the layering. And Im happy. I want to stay true to who I am on our wedding day not to the long haired imaginary version of me who is elegant and classic and uses the phrase romantic updo. ,weddingplanning,d2p952m,6,t5_2rv3t

Im working hard and am terrified of wedding day arms. Second you have so much time and these photos do not need to be THE PHOTOS.  Plenty of people do a second round and it sounds like you may benefit from this not free but potentially feasible option.  I hired a dear friend who is a dance photographer to take ours and we went full weirdos in them.  We wore collared coats I mean it was chilly but still.  We stood next to countertops and leaned in.  I nixed any pose that seemed likely to cause me body image concernshowever real or unreal they are they are yours and you can respect those feelings while still getting beautiful photos.

I have to take all rings off for obvious reasons and I do it immediately before wrapping my hands at the gym and put them in my zipup pocket of the gym leggingsshorts Im wearing so they can go back on again the minute Im done and have washed my hands.This day I wore my old shorts without a pocket. All good I have a jacket with a zipup pocket that I leave in my gym locker so I put it in there. Must have been chatting to people while leaving the gym walked the few blocks home via a supermarket next door to our apartment building. As I get home I take my keys out to get in the building and as Im waiting for the elevator think of my rings. Only my engagement ring is in my pocket. My wedding ring is nowhere to be found. I accidentally put them in the same as my keys and its fallen out.I panic heart racing and start looking on the ground all around me. It isnt there. I run out where I pulled the keys out of my pocket as I left the supermarket. There in its tiny shiny glory is my wedding ring. On the ground on a busy street where at least  people must have walked over or around it. I profusely thanked whoever was looking over me that day.,weddingplanning,d2tyrmk,5,t5_2rv3t

One thing I have personally seen from an agency photographerThe wedding party was running way behind in getting to the reception but their time was up. The photographer took a couple of shots as they exited the limo grabbed their bag and left. No grand March. No first dance. No cake cutting. No father daughter dance.

7535819,0,t3_4ijk1b,I have never seen this done and it is intriguing. The big challenge would be having the dress stay on and have support because some dresses with corset backs use the corset as the major support. The seamstress might have to add boning for support and straps since the illusion panel would not be solid enough to hope up a strapless gown if it is originally strapless. Youd also need a way to open and close the dress to get in on and off. This could be done with buttons up the illusion panel. Otherwise a hidden side zipper if you want the panel solid but that seems like a lot more work.

Whether or not she gave you money doesnt really make it okay to extend invitations without having a conversation with you and your FH first. Because she didnt do that it feels both kind of sneaky and entitled on her part. She didnt ask you for a reason  probably because she knew there was some chance youd say no. I think youre justified to be upset and want to vent. Since she hates confrontation Id try to first see if you can make it work for your auntuncle to attend as proper guests. That way if it doesnt work you can explain to your mom that you tried to make it work but unfortunately shed have to rescind the invitation or youd be happy to talk to your uncle yourself and explain to him the situation.

The key as always is to compromise. Show your mom nice photos of those bag boards and quirky weddings that make them look elegant. Invite her to your pinterest board.

Im glad you are going to be attending counseling and hopefully he can come further in his realization that this issue is absolutely not one that should have been mulled over or second guessed. He should have point blank cut ties with this socalled friend. As youve said hes not at that point but I hope for your sake he will be soon. I also hope through the counseling you can gain more validation that your discomfort and anger at the situation are completely justified. Laying all cards on the table here youre right when you say that the outcome wasnt perfect. The mere fact that he and his friends have excused Mikes behavior in the past and that hes remaining friends with himeven in the loosest sense of the word means he does not think the things that occurred are deserving of serious contemplation or measures. It is an insult to you and the apparent womanwomen? before you that have been victimized by this person.

A few would ask for their slices to go!,weddingplanning,d3tokb8,1,t5_2rv3t

Do you want to do that or would you rather be in the moment enjoying your daughters wedding?If youre the kind of type A person who enjoys wrangling little details even when you could just be relaxing and enjoying a special time Id say you could probably act as point person for everything yourself. If you want to be able to sit back and enjoy it rather than keeping an eye on the time so that the caterer knows when its time to begin serving hire someone.FWIW Im hiring a dayof person mostly because my mom is not great at these things and I dont want to be the person remembering where the cake knife is when I could be enjoying my wedding day. So if you are prepared to step into that role and know you will enjoy it not get stressed out it wont lead to bickering and drama etc go for it!

I think it makes you look taller and the more open neckline is more flattering than the kind of crewneck look that the tulle on the Maggie has. The bodice could definitely be altered to have a great custom fit but youd be hardpressed to find a seamstress that could make a skirt less flared. The Maggie reads as a dress for an older bride in my opinion. Just my honest two cents! You will of course look stunning regardless of which gown you choose. ,weddingplanning,d436rf5,24,t5_2rv3t

My FSIL shes marrying into my husbands family next weekend!!! tested a couple of places and found one that made her look like her but sunned not her  Cheeto powder. If I ever need one done Ill be making the trip to her girl for sure.You should definitely also do what uFuturePiePants said about the long sleeves amp sunscreen.

Especially if she has some real way of knowing this. Could you just... not? Only give people dates if they have a named person to invite. Doesnt have to be ultracommitted couples just no blanket bring anybody invites. And since this guy isnt her boyfriend voila how on earth could you have known to invite him?

8079740,0,t3_4pvngh,Im not concerned with the moment of walking down the aisle theres not too much tradition floating around our wedding anyways. This is the only kindof con that I can think of Id love to hear any other thoughts though.I only recently thought about a first look last week. Our ceremony and reception are in the same place. I have a pretty serious anxiety problem on a daily basis and my partner makes everything better when Im with him. I know Im going to get hella nervous right before the ceremony just because of the amount of attention that comes with walking down the aisle. I would love to be able to have that somewhat private moment with my fiance just to calm me down enough to enjoy the damn thing. Plus that might be the only somewhat private moment we get until the whole thing is over outside event means not a lot of private places for us to escape to. Well be balls deep in guests right up until the very end.,weddingplanning,d4o8kzd,4,t5_2rv3t

8085047,0,t3_4pyrhq,I would never select a venue where providing my guests with booze would be that expensive.  But then an open bar was a priority for my FH and I when planning our wedding so Im a little biased. Its nice that youre doing a champagne toast but is there any way you can pay a set bar tab that will switch over to a cash bar once its reached? For example you could pay a k tab upfront and then once that threshold is reached the bar switches to cash only.Otherwise Im not sure. An open bar certainly shouldnt be expected but at least where Im from it kinda is. I went to a wedding a couple years ago where they had a cash bar plus a small keg of beer and a few bottles of wine to share between  people. The beer and wine lasted all of  minutes into the reception. It was kind of lame IMO.Edit Just reread my post and it may have come off a little harsh. Im not trying to make you feel bad especially since you came here looking for reassurance. Just being honest. But unless youre very wealthy planning a wedding is all about prioritizing based on your budget. So if an open bar wasnt one of your priorities then its totally fine. As others have said just let your guests know ahead of time so they can bring cash!,weddingplanning,d4ou07t,9,t5_2rv3t
8086996,0,t3_4pzasz,I got married last night and I will let you know now after it all happened that the stress was TOTALLY unnecessary because everything that I thought we absolutely HAD TO prepare for never really came up and things that I never would have thought about happening to cause drama did.  For example I wasnt going to serve hors doeuvres during cocktail hour. The entire wedding was outside and it was going to be like  so I was like what the hell could we possibly serve. We went with kettle corn because we had a country wedding or whatever and you know what? The night before my MOH wouldnt stop eating it so I hid it in a closet and no one ever put it out. No one noticed or cared.  However we kept blowing fuses causing the electricity to go out every  minutes or so until about  PM when they came to fix it. So theres that.  It helps to have a timeline of things laid out so you know what needs to be done when. Anything not on the list is filler and youll have to accept that shit will just go wrong and its  out of your control.  I have a good monthbymonth list of you want to borrow it.

When we got our photos late I flipped unflattering poses weird framing you could tell we were feeling awkward and every time I looked at them I was so pissed. I maybe had  or  I could use.It was July when this happened to us and our wedding was in October and I actually found a photographer who had just moved here so she had great rates came with her husband as a team and seriously redeemed everything. I told our original photographer Id take half our money back in return for my silence on review sitessocial media and booked the other photographer immediately.If I were you I would talk to her about how you feel dont be hypercritical but tell her you dont look like yourselves and you feel  you werent given any guidance on posing and when to smile and need to be engaged more. See if shell offer you a reshoot or if shell work with you to make it right. Id also be shopping around for another photographer and see if you can find someone you click better with.Good luck!

We insist on permanency on duration on continuity when the only continuity possible in life as in love is in growth in fluidity  in freedom in the sense that the dancers are free barely touching as they pass but partners in the same pattern.The only real security is not in owning or possessing not in demanding or expecting not in hoping even. Security in a relationship lies neither in looking back to what was in nostalgia nor forward to what it might be in dread or anticipation but living in the present relationship and accepting it as it is now. Relationships must be like islands one must accept them for what they are here and now within their limits  islands surrounded and interrupted by the sea and continually visited and abandoned by the tides.,weddingplanning,d5cak24,1,t5_2rv3t

8282721,0,t3_4swy76,We got legally married before our destination wedding because of the legal process being easier at home than in Mexico. We were honest with our families but were very clear that it was not a wedding to us and we were just there to sign the papers. We wouldnt tell anyone when we were going and didnt invite anyone because we didnt want it to be a day. We just wanted it to be appeasing the government and strictly formality. We didnt want it to be a big deal at all because we didnt want it to take away from the specialness of our actual wedding day. We literally did it the week before we left for Mexico and went at lunch time from work. Very not special lol. Would it help your family be less upset if you didnt do it so ceremoniously in a botanical garden? By doing that picking a beautiful place to have a ceremony youre giving it importance and treating it like a wedding even though you fully intend to have your wedding later. Ultimately you have to do what you feel comfortable and what makes you happy but I can see how your family might be upset with the way youre going about it not just that youre doing it in general. Youre creating a moment and excluding them from that. In their eyes. Please dont take this as judging from me at all just trying to shed light on their possible perspective. ,weddingplanning,d5cwe2e,7,t5_2rv3t

8284980,0,t3_4sxau5,We had an elopement style ceremony on the Friday followed by a big reception on the Saturday. I changed because I was terrified of dropping food on my dress. Im always dropping food on myself so it was  guaranteed to happen and there would have been no time to get it cleaned before the reception the following day.For the postelopement meal we booked a private room in a fancy restaurant and it definitely wouldnt have been weird to wear my wedding dress there.

8287175,0,t3_4szl06,From where Im from getting a plus  means you get to bring your own guest whether it is a romantic interest or a friend. Ive been the plus  to a couple of weddings a few years ago while I was still single and taking dancing lessons. Some of the guys from the dance school took me to weddings as their plus one even though there were no romantic interest because we danced well together and could have fun. At all the weddings the brides never seemed to mind. In fact all of them greeted me by name and thanked me for coming. And that is definitely something Ill be doing at my own wedding. Find the names of my single guests plus one and go up to them while doing my rounds and make them feel welcome even though I might not know them. Its making your wedding so much more enjoyable for your friend because lets face it you probably wont be spending that much time with your friend that day. ,weddingplanning,d5dgf0m,2,t5_2rv3t
8287560,0,t3_4szgxh,We went in . The trip total cost about  excluding a hotel because we stayed in my FH family owned apartment. The flights were the bulk of that however we ate and did whatever we wanted. We were there for about  days. That included a side  day trip to Nikko. I would highly recommend a trip outside of Tokyo!! We stayed mostly in Tokyo and took a day trip to Mt. Fuji as well. The trainssubway system is AMAZING and can get you anywhere you want to go plus there is plenty of English so you can get around pretty easily. One of my favorite places we went was Oedo Onsen. It is like a bath house theme park.  We are going to Paris later this year and got an Airbnb. I would look into that especially since its so early you will get a really good one. They can be much cheaper than hotels and you can get a really stellar location. We are staying  nights and it only cost  and we are super close to the louvre. ,weddingplanning,d5di5h3,1,t5_2rv3t

Seating for dinner was in Vaults  and  dancing was in Vault  Vault  was the bar. For our first dance everyone just stood around the outside of Vault  and watched before joining us on the dance floor. Because there wasnt really room for everyone in any of the Vaults we opted to do speeches at the end of cocktail hour  so again everyone was standing. It worked out well nearly  months later and were still getting compliments from people. ,weddingplanning,d5djnyj,3,t5_2rv3t

8289016,0,t3_4sz8o9,Photographer here  I think whats going on here is all editing style  technically the images look totally competent and if she was shooting in RAW they should be  recoverable.  Its a stylized editing technique that a lot of people really love and is pretty popular right now.  It looks better in some lighting situations than others.   The super high contrast is what makes your eyes look dark.  As a photographer here is what is probably happening  most of us prioritize skin tone over background.  By making your skin look bright and nice she sadly sacrificed the background.  Shooting a sunset wedding on the beach and having both good skin tones and showing the background is hardimpossible unless A  youre on the east coast facing due east or B  You bring in artificial studio lighting which looks pretty cheesy.It sounds like maybe you just didnt pick the right style for your wedding but I dont think these photo are bad.  All professionals I know would be HORRIFIED to have you and your husband look so dark even if that background shows like the guest cellphone shot.  Some photogs might shoot that way but only really dated ones.Another possibility is that you didnt see enough of her work?  Youd be shocked how easy it is to put together a professional looking portfolioblog with the best  images youve ever taken but its really important to make sure you see entire galleries of their work so you know what a whole wedding looks like and make sure you like how their photos look under different lighting conditions.I would reach out to her after you have cooled down and in a friendly way.  Express your concerns and see what she can do.  Just by dropping highlights a couple stops boosting shadows and lowering the contrast in the images she should be able to get it way closer to what you want.  There might be a fee though  this could be some serious extra editing time.  If this is her style and youre asking her to deviate wildly from it thats usually covered in most photography contracts and youll be SOL if you take her to court.,weddingplanning,d5dopcg,13,t5_2rv3t

You could also have the bridesmaids stand a bit farther from you to leave a Space where she should be standing. Make sure to let her parents have a heads up though so that they can prepare.

They have a lot of great resources for people looking to officiate weddings though including this page where it talks about the requirements for each state. Wisconsin doesnt seem to have any requirements for ministers although they note that in the past ministers have been asked to show proof of ordination which you can print out from their site or you can pay a small fee for a nicer copy from them which helps to support various charities. ,weddingplanning,d5k52pw,2,t5_2rv3t

For some of those huge cakes covered in fondant and flowers and designs it can take a week to put together. Generally youre making the fondantgum paste decorations first and then baking the cake later on but its not unusual for a very large cake to be baked and sit in the fridge for several days. Then its soaked in sugar water to moisten it up again. This is why my husband and I opted to do a smaller simple cake and lots of little mini desserts. ,weddingplanning,d5usfp9,2,t5_2rv3t

My mother graciously offered to cover the hotel room for us the night of our wedding Sunday to Monday and there will be a brunch Monday at the hotel for those who are in town but not leaving right away.  While many family members are staying in town for several days surrounding our wedding to turn the long trip into a mini vacation we are going no contact for the whole week following the wedding.  We are going immediately back to the county clerks office that Monday after lunch to get the marriage licenses and get my SS card Drivers License and bank account with my new name if possible because its very difficult for me to get time off during business hours.  Then we are hiding in our apartment all week watching movies and not going anywhere after I get home from work.  The weekend following the wedding were going to a friends family lake house to be alone and not deal with anyone just us some movies and games a grill a deck overlooking the lake and no phone calls.  Were most grateful that when people ask us what were doing in lieu of a honeymoon and we respond were not talking to anyone for a whole week and spending the weekend in hiding everyone has been very supportive.,weddingplanning,d5whe95,2,t5_2rv3t

Here is the current FCO advice on zika and travelling  ,weddingplanning,d61fu9r,3,t5_2rv3t
8479285,0,t3_4vsp0t,Okay  so Im going to answer this as a recently reformed wedding grump with a capital G. So take this WHOLE thing with a big bowl of salt. For the record Im with your husband on this but I do empathize with you. That magical wedding experience in your head doesnt exist. Real weddings quite possibly will involve some combination of compromises and your mom not crying but instead making a snide comment about how your dress is too slutty and the DJ playing the wrong song for your first dance and realizing you went k over budget without even knowing where the  is going. Yeah weddings are great because you get MARRIED! And that makes them magic  otherwise they are stressful parties where a lot of people including us have vested interests and different desires and things go wrong and the saving grace is that youre married at the end. Im not saying youre wrong for wanting these things and theyre certainly very normal. But these big picture perfect moments come with a lot of baggage pressure and . Also I dont think people in general  ie people who are not currently planning their own wedding  care much about vow renewals. Like if my friend were to have a  year vow renewal I probably wouldnt go unless I were living in the same city. So I think its going to be doubly hard to pull off this big event with all the enthusiasm you are looking for from your partner and your family and your friends because to everyone else its just not the same. And your guest list might not be  people traveling from all over the country to be there to celebrate  it might be  people. I really really agree with uIwillslapyou that you should sit down and figure out what you really secretly deeply want that you havent gotten. And find another way that is not throwing a big wedding to get it. Pinterest centerpieces away! Go regular dress shopping with your mom! Throw a big fancy dinner party! Plan a charity event. There are lots of ways. And most of all enjoy that you are married to a real gem ,weddingplanning,d61gc5i,3,t5_2rv3t

Its also a REALLY common last name and Ive worked in medical records and banking for years and years obviously not at the same time so I know what kind of complications common last names can cause.

That is a lot  Ive only seen a per person package cost rather than a per drink cost. If it were a pp drink package which Ive seen thats  for  people rather than . Insane.If location is negotiable we went out to Leesburg to a vineyard. Its  for the venue rental but that includes all tablechair rentals an outdoor ceremony and day of coordinator. We have to buy the wine from the vineyard but its BYOB for all beer and liquor which is going to save us so much. By my calculations we will spend K on wine and  on liquorbeer for  people.

Its not common for British women to wear rings with huge rocks on them and I know BIG weddings like you see in the U.S are not common place in certain European countries. Seriously do NOT feel bad about not paying for make up for your bridesmaids or for not buying your FFIL custommade cuff links. Yes some people do that but other people just write personal and sentimental Thank You cards to their parents. Others have a BBQ wedding potluck etc. some forego bridesmaids all together!,weddingplanning,d6txe4q,3,t5_2rv3t

The color for Watters is Pomegranate and it was the closest shade I could find to other big retailers like DB. The other color that is close is Claret in the Jenny Yoo dresses We ultimately decided on them because its cheaper to rent and they send you two sizes just in case.

8731264,0,t3_4ze8gb,The flash on those are actually pretty decent but if you try to take a photo in near pitch dark at night its not going to focus because itd be too dark for the lens to focus on a certain point. The viewfinder is quite narrow which might pose problems for older people with bad eyes. Selfies will be a hit or miss depending on how many people in the photo. I went to a wedding where it was just left on a table and guests were asked to take two photos leave one and keep one. It worked well but honestly I think the amount of films you have to buy would eat into your budget. Buuuut having been a polaroid enthusiast since a teenager I suggest you try buying expired films. They are usually cheaper. Your photos will still come out but the colors might be a little faded depending on how expired the film is. It wouldnt really affect anything unless the film has expired for many many years.P.S. dont shake! It might damage the photo.

It seems like it would fit in seamlessly with the texture!Also if you get a bustle and hate it you can always unbustle it. Or you could start out without it bustled and see how the evening goes.

8762924,0,t3_503jnr,Im actually of the opposite opinion to other posters. Its a bit of a cautionary tale about A lists and B lists and picking a venue that cant hold your guest list. You invited them by sending them an STD but since they didnt receive an invitation they may have forgotten to tell you theyd been able to change plans and attend until now  or they assuming they were on the guest list were trying to make it work and only just figured it out. Your wedding is coming up so I imagine youve already sent out invites but its probably a bit far away for you to be able to pretend the RSVP deadline has passed and youve had to give final numbers to the venue and caterer. Is there any way to fit them in? Has anyone else RSVPd no?,weddingplanning,d710z71,35,t5_2rv3t

8764536,0,t1_d717z2d,I generally would do it now.  Allinclusive venues will include them so you book both in one shot with those.  If youre booking a separate venue and caterer I would try to book a caterer immediately after the venue.  Good caterers get booked early and you dont want to run into an availability issue.  It will also help you figure out how youre allocating your budget.  If DC is anything like NYC vendors start booking up to  years out because of the higher demand.  Our venue which includes catering was available but there was another that wasnt available for our first choice date we booked  months out.  ,weddingplanning,d7188za,3,t5_2rv3t

Also staying at the venue overnight in November just to get a feel for the place and generally enjoy ouselves. Biggest cost so far is the venue. Aiming for  day and  evening guests and its  not including hotel rooms for immediate family. Im paying for my parents  brothers rooms because my Dad gave me the entire wedding budget with no strings. I estimate around k on rooms for them  us and our travel plans as above. Surprising costs are suits and bridesmaids dresses.  bridesmaids and  groomsmen but we want dads matching suits. we are looking at around  for just this so I am trying to cut this down as much as possible without compromising on quality  style.I am tracking everything via wedhappy and have accounted for k which includes venue some rooms cake band my dress rings. it doesnt include anything for the honeymoon and I am hoping to get an estimate in the next few weeks.

8809601,0,t3_50te58,I feel this. A friend of mines wedding is coming up in October. Shes the first friend in the immediate social circle to get engaged so I think shes got an inflated idea of how important it is but shes also a very selfish woman as is. The entire year leading up to the wedding has been her asking for the friends to do practically everything for her.  Im going to hop on your rant thread to rant myself She never even asked people to be bridesmaids she just released a guestlist and denoted us as bridesmaids. Im just a fill in bridesmaids to make the bridal party even as Im not even a close friend and honestly would have been happier not being a bridesmaid but she didnt even give me a chance to say no. She did the same thing for the MC She has had event after event. Engagement party then a party to plan for the bridal shower then the bridal shower a  person affair that she insisted we prepare a waffle bar a mimosa bar a yogurt parfaits bar a ceasarbloody mary bar and have Mason jars for fucking everything.  The bridesmaids have had to pay for all the decorations food etc. She is unemployed and her parents and boyfriend are paying for the wedding. Shes absolutely refusing to do any planning for her bachelorette party on principle. So when we ask her what the plan is she doesnt know and says we have to figure it out Shes asking the MC to coMC with a guy the MC doesnt know. So now they have to get together to plan out their MC stuff together just a big inconvenience  Shes asking another bridesmaid to sing a song with her SO for the first dance. Okay theyre both musical so thats alright I guess. Except she wants the bridesmaid and her SO to coordinate this effort with two of the groomsmen playing guitar. One of the groomsmen is this bridesmaids ex. Its again super inconvenient for them to have to all get together to practice and also really awkward  She has told as opposed to asked the bridal party to do everything from assembling invitations to making centrepieces to planning how to design the guestbook table. Shes the unemployed one she has nothing but time! And when we cant help because were busy she gets angry. I just got engaged a month ago and Im a well organized frugal and simple person. Im not having an engagement party Im not having a bridal shower. Friends are already telling me theyre excited for my wedding because this girls wedding has caused nothing but stress for everyone. Im competetive to a fault and Ill admit Im excited to have everything be so much more chill and for people to appreciate that fact.,weddingplanning,d76slal,38,t5_2rv3t

8826816,0,t3_510zrt,Is there any chance you can quietly run away and elope before the wedding? Just so that you can have your marriage start the way you really want? I know a number of couples who got hitched on the down low but then still went thru with a full wedding with a ceremony and almost! no one knew they were already married when they said I do.Also the fact that youre not wrapped up in getting the PERFECT dress and EXACTLY the right dress and only these exact invitations means youre light years ahead of most brides. If youre not deeply invested then planning will be that much easier. I hope there is a friend or two that yo can sit down with speak honestly about your feelings and get their help with planning. Then its a chance to spend time with friends more than anything.I hope the day winds up being a fun one.

Because even if you dont take a picture as long as youre able to find out the designer and style namenumber of the particular dress you can find a picture of it online even if its on a model and still go have a cheap knock off made. I have heard of some stores withholding even the designer until a purchase is maid to avoid this but that sounds excessive. I only went to one store with a no picture policy and I knew from the moment I walked in almost that I wasnt going to end up buying my dress there so I didnt care. My mom had a lot of fun watching me try on gigantic heavy white dresses though and not being able to walk right.

Since the little baby is just a goopy little infant with no mobility and little wiggly toesies they would just have to worry about it not crying during the ceremony and it wouldnt as be as possibly disruptive as an older baby or toddler.At the same time if theres a little goopy infant with no mobility and little wiggly toesies chances are that the entire family is just going to want to take turns sitting with it passing it around taking pictures. I mean all I want to do when I see a baby is pick it up and watch em wiggle around and be their little baby selves.

Might even ask him to come to our house and photograph us hanging out on the couch playing video games making coffee playing with the dog etc.A good photographer will make you look great even if you think youre not photogenic. But it might make you feel better to maybe go out and get your hairmake up done professionally that day? buy special new outfits?Also have you met your photographer yet?

9160350,0,t3_55rrmn,I do think Sept nd is pretty close to the th but people get married all the time. Especially May June September and some places October. Her wedding should not be higher priority to your parents than yours but it is a destination wedding being planned before yours so I can see the sense of obligation they may feel to her and you may run into issues with other relatives being able to attend both close together.Techically September is summer still and October is fall. October th is about  weeks after your cousins wedding and a different season and feel. I think you should just put your foot down on the date you want. I personally would pick Oct th but either one honestly will be fine.Wording idea Mom and dad I understand you are concerned about the dates being close however fiance and I are not willing to delay our wedding for another. We are having ours X weeks away out of respect for cousins wedding. We know it will be expensive to go to Hawaii but we do not expect you to pay anything and will plan a wedding within our means and any help you offer will be extra.

9167870,0,t1_d8e017s,gt The plus side is that since it wont be your wedding there will be even less pressure on people to accept if they dont want to.This was pretty much the whole point of my post. I think I was confused by your comparison to a group vacation because Im not comparing it to a group vacation Im comparing it to a destination wedding. Which is why I totally understand your conclusion that unless its immediate family you probably wouldnt go to a destination wedding either but was confused when I thought the implication was you would go to that but would categorically not do a group honeymoon unless it already gelled with your preferences. Apples to apples I think all of your concerns as you noted apply equally to a destination wedding and actually I would be covering more of the cost via this friendmoon than a typical destination wedding would and I think what Im trying to get at is whether calling it a friendmoon would be less imposing than a destination wedding in such a way that if a person has all the concerns you do about a particular type of vacation and they are all concerns I expect people to contemplate they would feel free to come or not come as they see fit. While I would of course love everyone to come Im actually not trying to impose on them at ALL which is why Im not even doing bridesmaids or anything of the sort and just want to make it as easy as possible for someone to just relax and have fun if thats something they want to do.  gtIts true that we dont need a justification Ive never met anyone that does. It sounds that maybe your friends do wish this kind of vacation but need this kind of push and help or reading your other comments maybe this is how you interpret their attitude. My group of friends almost unanimously with the exception of my two law school girlfriends who I go on girls weekend trips with regularly loves to banter around the idea of travel and are always open to ideas but never actually implement anything unless I take the lead because I am the planner friends jokingly refer to me as their travel agent if that puts anything into perspective. Apart from my wedding Ive personally never found enough motivation to be the planner for a group event like this for actually all the same reasons you would be hesitant to go I prefer much more independent travel am not much of a leisure resortgoer like more cultural or adventure experiences prefer cheaper options like Airbnb and have a pretty extensive list of places I want to go. But all of those things would make a person group event much harder for example an AirBNB rather than a hotel would mean that every meal needs to be decided planned shopped for and cooked for and so to try to minimize that kind of stress I thought allinclusive which I dont normally do would be best.In other words count yourself very lucky to be able to regularly do large group travel ha!

9183327,0,t3_563ice,Awesome!!  I went to my friends wedding many years ago and he married a woman my now friend of Indian decent. From what I understood from her white is more commonly a color of mourning in her parents culture so a white wedding dress didnt quite make her feel right. She was marrying my very caucasian American friend and her parents assumed she would be wearing a white wedding dress to fit into her husbands customs.  But! She found a freaking FABULOUS ruby red dress with gold embroidery and beading. She was gorgeous! She didnt tell her family at all. Then she walked out in that red dress and her family lost it!  They cheered and some of them cried.  It was really beautiful.  Anyway not telling anyone worked out so well for her!  I think unless you want to avoid guests wearing a red dress then it would be a stunning surprise! ,weddingplanning,d8g1yno,19,t5_2rv3t

So I just have everyone sit there waiting for her to arrive meanwhile Im not dressed. Finally I get a call shes almost there so I go to another room to put on my dress and it doesnt fit! I have my entire guest list all my family and FHs family sitting in the next room waiting for a wedding ceremony and my dress in no way fits me. I woke up shortly after that and to be honest I laughed at myself and when I told FH he got a good laugh too.

9202028,0,t3_56diuu,There are a lot of different considerations that go into selecting a venue... Your Guest List Venues for large events tend to look different from venues for more intimate events. How many people are on your guest list what kind of atmosphere or event might they enjoy? Budget Your venue will take up a pretyt significant part of yoru budget especially if youre looking for something more than an empty box. How much do you have to spend whats teh least and whats the most? Amenities What does your ideal venue offer? Are you looking for allinclusive service that takes away some of teh hassle s of planning or do you want to find other vendors on your own? Do you want an outdoor ceremony space or will you be having the ceremony elsewhere? Bar service? PA? Beautiful setting for pictures? There are a bunch of different factors to consider. Location Where is your wedding? Close to your family? Close to your partners? Close to where teh two of you are now or at some other destination?

Tell him straight up that you have been bending over backwards trying to make him and stepmom feel comfortable.  But your only job on your wedding day is to get married not run interference all night to make sure that your mom is never within  feet of them. Unless there is a genuine security concern its time for everyone to stop this th grade bullshit and grow up. Your mom is invited to the wedding that is not going to change.  It is becoming exceedingly obvious that these requests for accommodations are not actual requests but rather sly ways to try to get you to give up and uninvite your mother because it will make things easier. You may need to tell him directly that he and your mom are both invited and you are not going to pick sides by uninviting someone.

I know that they didnt like the idea of it and mentioned it once. But on the day of the wedding they didnt say a word cried through the ceremony and were generally very happy. If you kindly and firmly tell them that you are having your friend marry you they should respect that. Let them know for your marriage to feel more official to you it means having someone you know perform the ceremony not a stranger.

Would your wedding party be invited to their wedding? That is the biggest conflict probably.  I wouldnt stress so so much about it but be aware that the overlap guests may not come.

Since youve let another jeweler work on it though it is likely you voided any warranty jeweler A may have had on your ring.Your best bet is probably getting your stone reset by a more reputable jeweler either B presumably or elsewhere. Get a warranty on any more purchases or work completed if you can.,weddingplanning,d8smtpb,5,t5_2rv3t

9352227,0,t3_58lmig,Your bridesmaids are your guests of honor.  Their role is to show up to your wedding on time in the appointed attire.  Thats really it. No one is going to be as excited about your wedding as you and your Fi. Tough fact of life. That said if you two are having problems or trouble with your relationship then you need to address it like an adult and have a grown up face to face conversation about it. Now that said  days before your wedding is not the time for that conversation.  Theres not a lot of information given here but it really doesnt sound like shes going to go off the rails at your wedding or do anything to spoil your special day.  days out you have plenty of other things to focus on and to be honest this is a waste of time. Its something that can and should be addressed after the wedding. Again theres not a lot of context here and although it sounds a bit odd that she didnt come to the rehearsal dinner if I knew one of my friends referred to me as a complete bitch without a legit reason I probably wouldnt go out of my way for her either.  It sounds like theres more going on here than what youve laid out but tbh her lack of enthusiasm and criticism of your planner are hardly friendship ending moves. Focus on your wedding and all the fun activities surrounding the weekend. Address your friendship issues at a later date. Happiness and excitement especially during a wedding weekend is extremely contagious. Chances are shell catch the bug and yall will have a wonderful time. Let this go for now and enjoy what is about to be a very special time in your life! ,weddingplanning,d91gnfk,10,t5_2rv3t

9431758,0,t3_59unt8,We just directed everyones attention to things that were cooler.  So for reference we got married in a brewery.  Unlike a vineyard its a lot more unpolished and definitely not a refined space.  It didnt bother me that we didnt cover it up until I started looking at some of the photos snapped of the event after the fact and comparing them to some of the amazing wedding photos here.  There were some amazing things in the venue like this huge wall of aging barrels the brewery etc.  But there were also some industrial touches like a huge  story garage door wall for deliveries and a x foot fenced off water pump with literally a chain link fence around it right when you enter.  We didnt put a lot of money into decor since it was just for the one use and instead faced tables in a direction so it was harder to see those things.  Yeah it kinda sucks looking at pictures of weddings here for people who had magical spaces draped in fairy lights and flower strands and then seeing the garage door behind me when I was walking down the aisle...but the day was perfect and I try to focus on the positives of the venue and how much I value the savings.

Id suggest booking a florist if you havent already...especially since our date is the day before mothers day! A florist who wasnt a weddingonly florist actually turned us down because of that. So your options might be a bit more limited.Do you already have a dress?

9520408,0,t3_5b7dh3,My health and wellness advice I do it part time for a living is to say pay attention to your diet. Cutting out all if you consume processed stuff and sugar will help. Stick to protein veggies fruit and healthy fats. These will keep you full satisfied and fuelled for the workouts but also abs really made in the kitchen that is to say diet makes up more than half of shapes your body. So keep an eye on that as well as workouts as it can make a massive difference. Not sure if that helped blush but thought it maybe could help someone possibly. ,weddingplanning,d9mlcip,3,t5_2rv3t

9545024,0,t3_5blu4l,hi Im from germany too and already married just had our first anniversary! I liked that we had matching metals and matching over all appearance surface finisch edge but it would really look akward if we would have matched the thickness. I have rather small hands my husband has Wurstfinger so I got a thin band with three little diamonds set inside the band and he a thick one.By the way I was really surprised that his was more expensive than mine. Apparently just the heavier weight of the gold used in his ring bigger size thicker band was more expensive than those three rather small diamonds. We would have opted for bigger ones but then I would have had to take a thicker band which I didnt want.edit as an afterthought In my opinion each of you should pick a ring heshe is comfortable to wear his entire life. I would never want to look at my ring and have mixed feelings. Yes its just a ring but it symbolizes so much. I would want to wear it and I would need my future husband to understand that. Both of you should find a way to get closer to each of your visions compromising along the way.,weddingplanning,d9pmdwz,5,t5_2rv3t

I didnt do a first look and dont regret it!When I started walking down the aisle my eyes locked on him and we both couldnt look away.  He looked so handsome and it felt so DAMN REAL him standing up there and me walking down with my dad towards him and his family.  He started tearing up which made me tear up and the feeling of my heart swelling and filling up my chest like that was just amazing.  It made me tear up the entire rest of the ceremony but I still dont regret it!It made photography and getting ready logistics a bit harder we didnt get a chance to do us photos until cocktail hour so missed all of that cocktail hour and had to find separate bride and grooms get ready places but I still dont regret it.  ,weddingplanning,d9q3v3i,1,t5_2rv3t

The only problem is that despite not changing my name on Facebook and generally making it pretty clear that Ive kept my last name we still get mail and checks to Mr. amp Mrs. husbands last name. Not as big a deal since our bank is pretty chill. We just got one check out to my first name his last name without him included on the check so that might actually be an issue.

My maiden name is replacing my middle name which Im not a big fan of so I dont think I will feel a loss of identity like I was initially afraid of. Also it is something that was EXTREMELY important to my fiance and part of marriage is compromise and we are both doing that because Im taking his name and we are getting married a little sooner than he initially wanted so that my name can be changed before I graduateget licensed which was important to me. And honestly I think the biggest thing that changed my mind was our discussiondecision to give a future daughter or son my maiden name as their middle name and it was surprising how much I liked the idea of passing my name on in a way.

She was my maid of honor but she was afraid to give a speech and said that she wasnt going to do one and I cried for days. I dont know what I would have done if she refused to be in my wedding. I think if I were in your situation I would feel a complete shattering of trust and it would irreparably damage our relationship. I just dont think it could recover because even after apologies and forgiveness you still feel like you cant trust that person.I am not a wedding person and I am not sentimental and I dont think weddings are the most important day of someones life. But sisters are important. My relationship with my sister is just as important to me as my relationship with my husband. The idea that she wouldnt be there with me on like... the one day where we focus on the important relationships in my life? What. The. Fuck.People seem to be trying to find an explanation for your sisters behavior that paints her as a decent human being. I actually dont think her reasons matter because if it was just about the duties she could have talked to you about that.

9811303,0,t3_5fr8v2,My friend had her bridesmaids do mismatched as well and it worked great! She didnt tell them get a bridesmaids dress she told them get a knee length dress and sent some suggested styles so they knew the general feel to go for e.g. lace allchiffon crisp and structured? etc.. Also since she told them mint instead of green they were all able to find dresses that anyone with working eyes and an understanding of what the color mint should be would look at and say yes that dress is mint  so even though they were all different brands they all fell within the same shade range. I think even if some of them do pretty much get the exact same color you can shift their standing order so someone they dont match with is in between them.Good luck!

As for the dance your FH should be the one telling them its not happening. Since its a joint decision. Although that is one tradition I might consider keeping just because its about honouring those people and their place in your life.

At the time I was specifically looking for a halo ring with a small gap between the main stone and the halo and a plain gold shank and this one from Gene fit the bill! It was surprisingly hard to find a ring like that on Etsy back then lol.If youre curious about budget breakdown I got my moissanite directly from Charles amp Colvard for about  and the ring itself  including setting my stone  ended up costing  from GNGJewel for a total of  or so.

My sister is wanting a fairy tale traditional wedding for under K. If she had it her way it would cost her nothing because I cant get her to budge on some of her expectations.

Was able to find her a botanical garden within her budget but it wasnt pretty enough?!?!? So we found an outside park that has a beautiful garden during the season and then a event hall nearby.She wants a fancy photographer but I suggested maybe finding someone who is just starting out and needs the exposure. That is a huge risk but you can always review their previous work or hold a trial photo shoot before committing to a person. Edit this was addedShe wants amount of food but I told her that you either shell out for caterers or cook the food herself.

10181248,0,t3_5lmozz,Ive found most of my friends are really understanding about prioritizing family with these kinds of wedding decisions because family dynamics get really freaking tense around weddings.  Fun story my cousin initially announced that since she and her sister never got along she was having her life long best friend as MOH instead and my aunt freaked out and declared she wouldnt come if sister wasnt MOH.  She was still very upset when my cousin finally compromised that they would be coMOHs and shed rather her friend signed as witness.  It was months of crazy drama that I wont elaborate on but it caused a rift in that part of the family that still gets torn open again sometimes.  Your friend might be a bit bummed but if having a close relationship with your sister ruins your friendship that would not be a good sign.  Friend dynamics are a completely different thing than family.  In that way youre very lucky its your sister so its not like youre telling her look our friendship sucks and I have a new best friend now and shes more important. If you talk more about how youre so excited to have her there for you and be a bridesmaid and you just have to put family first on some things and this is one of them I like to hope shed be understanding.  ,weddingplanning,dby3n3p,1,t5_2rv3t

Please understand that they have just been told that they failed to pass on the most precious gift they could ever give you and they are probably heartbroken by that fact. That being said remind them that marriage in the Church is an oath to the death to live a good Catholic life and have a good Catholic marriage and that you swearing that oath would be a lie and grounds for annulment. They would be witnessing a lie and thus helping you commit sacrilege. Were you my child I would commend you on your integrity and then politely refuse to attend because a baptized Catholic is required to marry according to proper Catholic form in a Catholic Church unless a dispensation is granted and thus it would only be the simulation of a sacrament which is also a sacrilege so please be prepared for that if it comes to it. You are acting in accordance with your conscience which is a noble thing but they have to be allowed to act according to their conscience too.

So yeah its more about knowing who you are what you want and what you value accepting that and not being afraid to say This is ME  take it or leave it without apology to any potential partners.I would caution you to really examine what you and your FH have in common besides being students because that was a big problem for me. Also you might try engaging people when they tell you youre too young because it could be their way of broaching the topic of a concern with your relationship without putting it in the words they want to use.Other than that the whole pushingmoney thing doesnt really go away with age.

10202560,0,t3_5m15h6,I was one of  MOHs in a wedding and the brides thing the whole time was no one had to give a speech if they didnt want to. Im not saying I took months but I spent a few hours putting something together for my close friend. The MOH on the other side refused to speak and my friends bride opened it up to her whole party. In the end another person gave the speech but figured it was something that could be winged and said some things that my friends now wife was not thrilled with. I dont think your friend would say no to you but I think she should want to put the effort into something that is meaningful which I am not sure shes up to considering the hen. The friend that is planning the stag amp hen are you close enough to him for him to maybe do one for you both?

Lucky me I got a TERRIBLE case of folliculitis on my face a year and a half before the wedding and the medicines that were treating itpreventing reoccurrancetrying to fade the deep pitted scarring on my face made me extremely sensitive to the sun.

And planning a wedding with a wonderful family who gets along is WAY different than planning a wedding where everyone hates each other. Its just one of those things you cant control even if youre a calm laid back person you cant control the dynamics of everyoneeverything involved. That said weve had a really easy time of planning. Having a small  person brunch wedding is the best decision we made. Most of our things are either purchased already or picked out and waiting to be ordered. My favors are the one big thing I havent ordered. Still trying to decide between two options!Ive also gotten SO MUCH FREE STUFF from work. I knew I would get some stuff but I was surprised recently by all the stuff my boss donated to me. He gave me  pairs of slippers I work at a hotel to add to my welcome bags since our brand changed the type we use so we had leftovers. I also got first aid supplies toothbrushes toothpaste makeup remover wipes and a bunch of other stuff. That saved me a LOT of money so that was nice! I also just found a really awesome petticoat for my tea length dress for  what I budgeted to spend. ,weddingplanning,dcg50uo,23,t5_2rv3t

In fact the more expensive the photographer the less likely they are to accommodate stylistic requests because they feel that they know best and will not be willing to give you a product that they do not feel is their best work.

You have a vision for an auxillary part of your wedding  an important part but not THE important part. Youve built it up in your head for so long that now it seems like a huge deal when its not as straightforward as you thought itd be. Its your choice to get upset as you want but it doesnt have to throw a wrench in your planning. This isnt your venue burning down a parent passing away the day before the wedding fighting with family over allowing children or not... Its just where you put your makeup on. I promise that however you choose to resolve this your day will be magical. Your pictures will be gorgeous. You will have a great time hanging out with your maids. Dont panic.Check VRBO HomeAway and even just search rentals city name. Dont write off hotels either  I have seen so many photos from friends and strangers who got ready in hotel rooms and theyre all gorgeous.

I was the sixth person in line for rentals at the park service office and got my first choice date.Im also going with a nontraditional dress that only cost a little over  and probably wont be complicated to tailor just needs the bust taken in a touch. FH is wearing his own trousers with a fresh Oxford shirt and a tweed vest that needs a bit of tailoring. Were doing silk flowers which I bought during Aflorals Black Friday sale. And minimal decorations because the venue is a lovely rustic vintage building. And selfDJing.My big splurge is catering and its going to be a waffle bar. Because people dont typically do brunch weddings the caterer was not in a terrible hurry to book and seems more excited about planning a wedding than I am.

10520915,0,t3_5qioi7,It looks to me like you are having the same problem with the comments in this post as you are with the wedding guests. You want people to behave one way and you seem to get angry at them for not responding the way you think they should respond. You have a couple of options here. First one and the most polite one is to suck it up acknowledge that you shouldnt have given him a plus one and take comfort in the fact that it sounds like he is having trouble finding someone to come with.Your second option is the super rude one basically revoke his plus one. While your logic for giving him a plus one and trying to take his plus one makes sense many people feel like the more the merrier towards weddings. If the majority of his friends are marriedhave SOs doing this draws attention to the fact that he does not have one. Some particularly sensitive people may feel like they are being punished for not dating anyone. Back in my single days when I was the only one of my friends that didnt have a SO if a bride pulled this on me I would have felt like my single status was being called out. When you are the only single person being around friends is okay but you do do a lot of standing off on your own while the couples dance and have couple time. Third option lie. Make up a relative or some other person your mom and dad just HAD to invite last minute. Ask him if he will need to use the plus one since you are having spacing issues and are polling some people who were given and guest who will have friends there to see if they wouldnt mind giving up their plus one. Be fully prepared for him to say no and accept the answers.Its a sucky lesson but it is a lesson dont assume people can read your mind. ,weddingplanning,dd0nqx3,9,t5_2rv3t

My FH and I had an issue because he was bending to his mother with something she wanted that FI and I agreed to the opposite of months prior. The fact that FI was bending and trying to please her even though he knew that deep down it was not something him nor I wanted caused a lot of unnecessary fights.

But your post has a lot of unnecessary information and leaves out others.Basically your dad is paying for your wedding  and its an expensive one. You have hotel options for night or a cheaper night hotel plus other options in the area. Your FIL is complaining to your FH about having to pay for  nights and for  rooms despite the fact that no one told him to stay all  days or that he had to pay for  rooms. His children could pay for their own rooms and FIL is just as well off as your father and goes on more expensive vacations frequently so you know its not a strain on him. Your FH is now feeling guilty. Thats really the only info I think you needed to add. That stuff about you paying invoices and stuff I think is what setting people off? Anyway I think its rude of your FIL to complainunfair of your FH to try and make you feel bad. Its totally on FIL that hes spending that much.

I picked out a solid green and a solid grey.  Solid green is paired with grey patterned fabric and solid grey is paired with green patterned fabric and they are sewn with a mauve thread.  This way I got to pick out a few different patterns to keep it interesting for myself in the future.  I couldnt do paper I just couldnt.  I saw one example of a paper napkin where the menu was printed on it which i thought was genius use of a paper napkin.  We are doing buffet so that didnt make a ton of sense.

A few months later we were on a cruise with my parents and grandparents we were seated at a table with a couple from Australia and the wedding came up as the couple was congratulating us my mom who had some drinks interjected with Their wedding is going to be terrible.

But the bit that Im looking at constantly the band on either side of the setting is still white gold. If I examine it closely I can maybe see some spots shining through on the sides? Meanwhile I havent once cleaned it or polished it so maybe its just dirty. Idk.Either way find out how much it would cost to plate it.

Im sure shes hurt by that but shes not said anything.I just dont tell her anything until the decision has been officially made and theres no changing it. Shell criticize less if its a done deal. Oh but have you looked at x venue? Its much nicer than the one you prefer! ltsomething that didnt happen to me because I had already paid half the nonrefundable venue balance when we told her where the wedding is. I just state things as they are with no room for opinion or change. Its not super easy. You have to hide any fucks that you give. Best of luck to you in this venture.

10813814,0,t3_5umrei,Were in Canada so its a little different. But I really liked the comment about supporting vendors who demonstrate your values. Vote with your wallets and all that This is something weve absolutely been thinking about through the whole planning process. Both my partner and I are queer and he is gender nonconforming. So it was really important to us that our vendors not just be tolerant but be supportive of lgbtq couples. Our photographer definitely is and part of the reason we chose her is that she features a lot of same sex couples. My partner is still deciding to what degree he wants to display his nonconformity through femme attire so it was important that we have someone who can just roll with that. Our caterer is a new immigrant who is very environmentally conscious and uses local ingredients. Our other food vendors are part of the multicultural centre in town. There are a lot of other little choices weve made decided to rejig so we can have my SIL officiate with a secular ceremony that does not reference gender both my parents walking me down the aisle since I couldnt convince my dad not to walk me at all were doing an indigenous territory acknowledgement etc.  But I think these are way less important in the grand scheme of things than actually fiscally supporting people who demonstrate values of caring and inclusiveness. And as a side note I caution against just...tacking politics on. If it affects you or people you love it will already be a part of your day. ETA Really?

I would lose any money I put down because they told me I was being invited for that day and then told me I didnt make the cut.

For me Im looking at it more as an opportunity for some people who will be at the wedding to spend time together and get to know each other before the main event. Were having brunch at my friends house no gift opening amp no games. Ive been to lots of weddings mid s and have strongly preferred ones where I got a chance to get to know some of the brides other friendsfamily before the wedding itself.  Whether thats through a shower bach party bridesmaids etc it makes the wedding a lot more fun for me. YMMV obviously but Im really looking forward to seeing some of my friends who dont know each other get to meet and hang out together. I hope that since I wont be opening gifts the atmosphere will be more Im so excited to share this experience with all of you and less the point of this is for you to give me stuff. If your friends or family want to host a shower for you you could stress that you want it to be a casual event that doesnt put a strain on the host and where no one feels that they have to bring a gift as the cost of admission. ,weddingplanning,de68zh8,2,t5_2rv3t

10936053,0,t1_de7qy24,That is a bit harsh for no reason. It doesnt sound like he is taking advantage of her or being childish it sounds like he just has emotional limits and doesnt want to talk about wedding planning every day or care about the details. Thats completely ok and nothing wrong about that. She specifically said he does things he is supposed to like go to vendors and such. Honestly it sounds like wedding planning is taking over their lives and it is more stressful than it needs to be. Dont really blame him for not wanting to talk about the wedding all the time and for long periods of time. Theyve got other things to do. ,weddingplanning,de7z6k8,6,t5_2rv3t

10991936,0,t3_5wyh0q,Ok lets start with the introvert thing.  Im a pretty extreme attentionhating introvert as well but having been married before I can tell you that this is going to be a lot easier than you think.  Preferring smaller gatherings doesnt mean you wont have a great time at a large one celebrating you and your FH!  I promise you this will be some of the easiest small talk of your life.  You just need to say hello to everyone thank them for coming and graciously accept their compliments.  Prep an exit strategy if you need to extricate yourself from a conversation.  Something to the effect of Excuse me I need to go say hello to generic relative.  Dont forget to save room for cakecheck out the candy barsave me danceget a photo in the photoboothgrab a favoretc.!  After youve said hello and thanked everyone youre free to spend the rest of the night with your nearest and dearest chatting or dancing!  I would have a short talk with the groomsmen about toning it down a bit for grandma not cutting them off.  Its a family event not a kegger.  Theyre adults so Im sure they can make sure they behave respectfully.  Try not to stress about this.  Stop worrying and think about all the parts you know youll enjoy.  Think of seeing your FH for the first time.  Think about marrying him.  Think about getting to spend time with all of the people you love under one roof.  Think of the happiness on your fiances face when he gets to spend time with the ones he loves.  Its going to be lovely.  Enjoy!,weddingplanning,dedwg71,5,t5_2rv3t

10999337,0,t3_5wyh0q,I always thought I would have a courthouse wedding just the two of us honeymoon and a small backyard reception with like  max when we returned. But then I got engaged to a Jordanian lol. A typical wedding can have  people easy. Ours will have  guests I will probably know  of them. The plus side is FH is awkward like me so we will just be awkward together the whole night and let everyone else do their thing haha. We will have to greet as many people as we can individually though. Ugh. Oh did I mention we are then having a SECOND wedding in Texas with mostly my friendsfamily who cant travel to Jordan. Yep. That will be around  and will be more casual so closer to what I originally envisioned. Dont get me wrong Im excited for both but I just laugh at how different it is from what I anticipated lol.    As for your issue just to play devils advocate if you had the wedding your way or without all of FHs friends would he enjoy it as much? Its hard to compromise I think because then he would have to pick and choose certain friends and family. Who is footing the bill? If money isnt a big issue I would just say go through with it and follow others advice about setting expectations with your FH and remembering that no matter what happens its your day and everyone is there so support you!,weddingplanning,deeqpre,1,t5_2rv3t

There is absolutly nothing wrong with that however it would be polite to let your guests know ahead of time that it is a nonalcholic event and that the only food there will be desserts and small finger food.

It will be in Las Vegas on a rooftop at sunrise just the two of us plus an officiant and photographer. Quick and easy with a party later this summer to celebrate with close friends and family. The bhldn one feels a little longer than I would prefer but is pretty nice otherwise. The needleampthread one I adore but I will need a sweater or light jacket for the chilly morning air.

It depends on your crowd but I have seen people leave after a sparkler event and not as many people get back on the dance floor too.If you can swing it I would do it closer to the end.Also just a note.

I am however replacing it with a shorter first look with my dad. Im an only child and a total daddys girl and I know my dad will get emotional so I want to have some time just us my mother most likely as well so he has time to get emotional over seeing me and wont feel like he has to hold it back like he would in front of guests. Also I plan to get as many pictures as possible done before the ceremony so basically all of the ones that dont include FH and I together.

I could have had my step dad but I am not close with him as they just got married two years ago. I was going to have my FH walk me down but I decided I wanted that moment where he watches me walk in. I decided to have my mom walk me down the aisle and she is so thrilled to do this. Would you consider having your step mom or mom or step dad and step mom walk you down?

11089677,0,t1_deoplhh,Good question! I did not order the dress in a size down even though my goal was to lose a lot of weight between then and the wedding.This is primarily because it wasnt worth the risk if I didnt actually lose the weight I planned to lose. I actually broke my knee shortly after picking out the dress which restricted my mobility for several months. Fortunately I was able to lost weight after my recovery! Anyway its much harder to let out a dress than to take it in.Additionally that is what the alterations department is for! When I went in for my first fitting the dress was way too big. She took it in substantially but you would never know it didnt come that way because she did such an impeccable job. Another helpful aspect of my dress in particular is that its a corset back so even if I still lose a little more weight after the final fitting I can just pull it a little tighter and it still fits.,weddingplanning,dep074q,10,t5_2rv3t

11096524,0,t1_depp84s,Yeaaa... so originally we wanted to hire just one of his associates that would have been in our budget. BUT at the end of our initial phone call hes like you guys seem cool and I would like to personally photograph you. We said youre out of our price range he said hed be willing to barter for some marketing help which is what I do for a living and hed knock off some  if we did something awesome in the engagement shoot  he also said that his talent is beyond same old when it comes to shoots. So here we are... I AM a little wary that we might not jive. Maybe I led him on because when he asked us what kind of backgrounds we have I said I worked for the Circus School but only as an administrator. Yes I learned basic aerial skills but Im definitely not in that kind of shape anymore and declined to be photograph with aerial silks squeezing my thigh fat. My FH works in a recording studio but its just a room with a couch and a mic stand  also very cool but perhaps not engaging enough for a shoot.

11097256,0,t3_5ygnxz,Im a contra dancer and I think this is a great idea! But of course I might be biased...I would say take a look at what percentage of your guest list will be dyedinthewool contra dancers. Theyre the ones who are going to keep the energy up and help convince people to come try it. I would say that youll probably only get at most as many couples as there are experienced contra dancers at least at first. That said contra is a very beginnerfriendly dance so if your contra friends can sell it to the rest of your guests it could be a blast.I would also suggest maybe using the Spotify playlist as background music for dinner and then going wholehog for all contra for the dancing portion. I mean youre not party people but youre contra people and contra dancing is like a big party so let that be the personalized version of a party for you. You could probably do contra for  hours too because the newbies might take some time to get into it and people can take breaks between songs.,weddingplanning,depv4if,2,t5_2rv3t

Making forms on Squarespace is way easier I got really frustrated with Wix. It turned out beautiful though! Also some questions require an email so if you have techfree people you may consider Squarespace. If you decide on Wix and need any help let me know! Id love to lend a hand. Both of these sites you have to pay for. It cost me  to get my site up and running but that included hosting for a year and a personal domain name. What information did you include?

But unless your circle is just super into theme or costume parties I wouldnt worry too much about tying a theme to your engagement. Just throw whatever birthday party youd throw anyway is it fancy cocktails and dressy outfits? bonfire and smores? garden party and cafe lights? lawn games bbq and beers? and then at some point pass out champagne and say youre giving a toast..... which can be your engagement announcement.,weddingplanning,dew2wnb,5,t5_2rv3t

11165238,0,t1_dexj2p1,Im going to preface this with saying that your post is the most absurd outlandish and insulting post ive read in quite a long time. That said lets break it down.  It is not a personal attack to tell you that youve misused misogny as an attack because you didnt agree with me and consequently devalued its meaning. Which again you continue to do.  It could not be a more absurd and downright vacuous claim to say I say that I tried to make my own opinion more important than the mostly woman here. The leap of logic it takes to come up with that is big enough to make it downright laughable. Its clearly a I come from a different viewpoint qualifier and in no way unless you are actually illiterate to be read as my opinion is more valid.  You have absolutely no idea what my experiences are or anyone elses in this thread. You do not know what ive experienced or others. Youve assumed that because I am male and others are female that they are more qualified to comment on whether or not one sentence that simply states he doesnt want her to wear a certain type of dress in front of her family is an indicator that the relationship is abusive. Its both a CLEARLY AND UNDENIABLY sexist view that youve assumed these things about me and others. That doesnt even describe the absurdity of some of the accusations ITT.  Lastly its quite clear that you are a bigot and a sexist. Youve tried to label me one when its undeniable that I havent been one using the words as an attack in such a way that makes them meaningless. Then youve discounted my viewpoints and pushed others forward based on sex. You are a textbook example of a bigot. I would repeat to you maybe instead of looking to tear others down for expressing their opinion judging them based on their sex and offering uninformed viewpoints on others lives you should look inside to see why you are clearly harboring such prejudice to others. ,weddingplanning,dexkgcy,1,t5_2rv3t

The thing is that you didnt really tell her not to come and also she pushed you to the total end of your rope.  I would write an email to your dad easier to get your thoughts in order but a call works too and tell him that you were just really pissed off at her constant abuse of your free last minute babysitting.  Its totally totally out of line for her to expect that of you.  No question.  She abused your willingness to help out and you finally got mad.  As you say you were NOT free and while the world doesnt revolve around your wedding taking ONE NIGHT to work on it isnt making the world revolve around you.  Also neither does it fucking revolve around her kids.  I would explain the feel free not to come thing in the context of being insulted by her comments that the wedding wasnt important.But really I think the important thing here is the abuse of babysitting privileges.  Wedding aside that shit is really not OK and her emotional blackmail when you try to say no one single time is really out of line.

11208687,0,t1_df25n1h,I had a budget wedding under k for  people and I will be the first to admit that there is no secret to having the perfect wedding on a budget. I think it all boils down to what you are and arent willing to compromise on in order to save money. For example my dress cost  off the clearance rack at Davids bridal and required no alterations. While the dress was very pretty and I felt beautiful wearing it it was by no means my dream dress It was however the dress that I could afford. My venue was owned by the county and had very low rental rates compared to traditional wedding venues. We had the ceremony and reception at the same venue to cut costs. Our wedding started later in the evening so that we could get away with serving heavy hors doeuvres and desserts instead of a full meal stated in advance on the invitations and no out of town guests.... I know this doesnt work for everyone. Our menu was big enough that you couldve made a meal out of it if you wanted to though. We had meatballs and chicken salad cheese and crackers fruit and vegetable tray and some other goodies also. It was definitely my dinner that evening! And yes my family did help out with some of the food but all of it was stuff we could have easily purchased at a grocery store if we needed to.We purchased our tables cloths and bowls for centerpieces off Craigslist and then resold them on Craigslist after. We used a premade playlist and an iPhone instead of paying a DJ.We had fake flowers. I know some people hate fake flowers but we werent that picky about it so it worked for us and saved us a lot of money. We also used an amateur photographer we were her very first wedding and she gave us a very good price because she had no experience and was trying to get her foot in the door in that industry. The compromise here was that our wedding photos were not as professional or creative as those of some of our friends. But we arent big picture people so it was worth it to us to save the money.So there are ways of cuttings costs for sure without calling in a lot of favors. But is your wedding going to be Pinterest perfect? I guess thats up to you and your tastes. Mine was not. It was a beautiful wedding and Im happy with how it turned out though. Im glad we didnt go into to debt over it and only spent what we could reasonably afford at the time.,weddingplanning,df2hq0b,10,t5_2rv3t

The runnerup is a very infashion dress that  sorry!  everyone could wear. The unique dress on the other hand makes you look a lot skinnier and it has a very royal and timeless look. Parts of it actually look a little bit like Queen Elizabeth II.s wedding dress. I really like the embellishments and on the train and on the side.

Sit with your FH and talk about exactly your expectations wants needs for this wedding. And also listen to his. As a partnership you have to decide what is reasonable to do. If you cant come to a conclusion where both of you are happy with what you get vs the sacrifices you make you should reconsider how you communicate and discuss things before continuing on this marriage path.Does everyone NEED a plus one? If people arent in a yr relationship theyre not getting a  to ours. We have a hard venue limit of . You do not have to consider children. Youre well within your right to make it an adult only event. Keep in mind this may increase the no RSVP count. You could have it in a location where you can offer child minding services or just go with the nos. We are NOT inviting extended family. My maternal uncles are cuntbags and despite reaching out a few times over the last  or so years none of my cousins have wanted any contact. So nope to them. If you dont feel close to someone dont invite them! Your Dad may be an exception if youre after a closer relationship with your halfsisters.Dresses these days comes in heaps of colours that arent white. Also you dont have to have a wedding dress. Try evening dresses or things advertised as prom or bridesmaid dresses. So many options. Weed bar going to take some legalities to work as many venues will go OH HELL NO.

Ive been planning since November   for my October  wedding partially because Im insane and everything that can be done must be done as early as possible  and partially because even cheap weddings are pretty damn expensive and were paying for everything ourselves and I have some daysweeksmonths where Im super excited and others where I think if I look at one more insert whatever we need to plan at that point Im going to scream.  When I lose the excitement  I give myself a break. Pick up a book play a video game  binge something on Netflix for a couple days or a week or however long it takes. Usually I know its time to take a break when I start thinking something along the lines of eh  fuck it  this decorationvenuevendorwhatever will be good enough.

11436336,0,t1_dfs3wef,Yeah  is really lucky!! We had a lot of people not RSVP yet from FWs side and FMIL kept asking if there was anything she could do to help so I just emailed her a list of everyone from her amp her husbands family who hadnt responded and the RSVPs just came flooding in that evening! Since I knew I wanted to have the numbers in before the walkthrough we were also proactive about sending people reminders the week of the deadline. I feel like it took about one million years to get one of my parents to send their friend with a family of four a text to just see who was coming but that helped. And I just sent textsfb messages to a few friends who I knew were probably coming but just hadnt officially responded on the site.

11436991,0,t3_639n32,Step  Ignore the noise until you actually get something concrete like an STD invite or even email from this guy.Step  If its a go and FH chooses to be in the wedding party be firm in setting boundaries around what you are and arent willing to do and pay for.  You dont HAVE to participate in expensive bachelor parties.  You dont have to stay in the pricey hotel if its outside your budget.  Im sure theres something more affordable nearby.  If FH does want to be a groomsman then you might have to pay for the clothes Brad picks but thats about it.Personally I would be lobbying hard for going to that family reunion.,weddingplanning,dfsdea0,33,t5_2rv3t

11445260,0,t1_dft871y,. Theyve never met because OP lived  miles away and it sounds like her FH doesnt talk to Brad very often. Per the post her FH was telling brad that he got engaged LAST YEAR. So obviously quite a while since they spoke.. Because OP is asking her fiance for information instead of the couple getting married! My fiance has some friends he hasnt seen in quite awhile who dont know any of the wedding details yet and if they had to guess where the wedding was it would probably sound similar if they guessed and didnt actually ask the guy getting married. I agree that Brad should communicate but I dont think this small thing means his wedding is a sham. My opinion is that OP is making a mountain out of a mole hill. Shes the real drama queen. All this could be cleared up if she just talked to the couple getting married.,weddingplanning,dftb65z,0,t5_2rv3t

11450067,0,t3_63f8qq,Going traditional has a lot of positives in my opinion. I think it takes the guess work out of everything or the need to try to stick to some sort of off beat theme. Everything is pretty cookie cutter but that might cause you less stress if you were to try to do something different. I think there is also a timeless aspect to a traditional wedding with a simple romantic theme. If you look back on any wedding that was more traditional as opposed to off beat you notice you cant really pin a trend or time to the pictures. Its really a catch  you either get hate for spending too much and doing all the traditional stuff or you get hate for not being traditional and doing something different. Also your mini rant reminded me of the episode of Portlandia where they are trying to do some hipster trendy wedding lol! ,weddingplanning,dftutdz,7,t5_2rv3t

11457976,0,t3_63ju52,First and foremost your wedding sounds awesome! Youre celebrating with  people in Hawaii! That beats a DJ in a random banquet hall any day and you are absolutely going to have a blast! Think about it if youre going on vacation with your  best friends youre not going to be bored right? Now multiply that by its going to be amazing!Nextyou have all the elements for success in this situation youre with your closest people youre in a beautiful destination spot youre celebrating. Just throw in some alcohol and youre set. Your guests are going to have a great time! Will that great time involve dancing? Maybe maybe not. I think the best scenario is just letting it happen organically. Focusing too much on getting everyone dancing is going to be stressful to you and disruptive to the good times that everyone will be having naturally.Thirdyoure throwing an after party at your rental house? This just keeps getting better! Here I would look at the logistics of how everyone is gettingleaving there. Are there taxis ubers or other transportation options so your guests can get from your house to their hotels? What about renting a shuttle from the restaurant to your house? Also you can check with the rental company on the noise restrictions to get a handle on what makes sense from this standpoint.Fourthok wait. You just said youre considering inviting another  people. Thats huge! Thats double your current guest list! Does that mean there  people that you wanted to invite but havent? If there are people you want to invite and you have the room to invite them it could be worth taking another look at your guest list?,weddingplanning,dfur540,8,t5_2rv3t

If you want to go a little fancy put a flower or pretty clip in your hair or some nicer jewelry. That dress is pretty not too busy or distracting especially because the base is a darker color. ,weddingplanning,dg42wcq,4,t5_2rv3t

I work over close to  hours a week my fiance works shift work so does my another close friend...thats no excuse. So clearly things were building up and I unfortunately was the one getting the brunt of it. Then I was left with the hard decision of weighing out the pros and cons of keeping her as my MOH or asking her to step down...and either way I knew I was in a shit situation.I wouldnt call my friend toxic...but maybe thats just the optimistic side of me that maybe things will change once she gets help I dont know...however im sorry that its been such a roller coaster for you. But if her parents are the same way its not surprising they wont acknowledge what she did she learned it from somewhere... and theres nothing wrong with having your guard up...I know I will if we ever get to that point.As much I dont wish this upon anyone...yes its really comforting to know im not alone and can vent to someone whose been in a similar situation!

You are already married so you cannot get married in a legal sense again. I think in your circumstances the family will understand why you got married in Canada and you can still have a non binding ceremony if you arent religious then you could book a humanist celebrant to do it at a place of your choosing no legal requirement means you can have your ceremony anywhere and do whatever kind of ceremony you want. ,weddingplanning,dgo7sj3,3,t5_2rv3t

We had to do our preCana and the only thing they said about kids was if you are blessed with children will you raise them in the catholic faith? IF we had kids. We dont plan on it though and our priest knows this. We even mentioned how we were both confirmed in th grade and how wed want any theoretical children to make the choice for themselves when theyre older and better informed and educated not automatically like we were catholic schools. They were totally cool with it. You dont absolutely HAVE to have children or swear to or whatever. ,weddingplanning,dgpdmpr,8,t5_2rv3t

If you have a buffet theyll need to announce the orders the tables go to it etc. If youre having speeches theyll need to get everyones attention and introduce the speakers. Even if youre not having formal stuff like that youll need to tell people where the desserts are and invite them to help themselves or whatever  a bunch of our cupcakes didnt get eaten because there was no announcement telling people to take them not that I minded I went to town on those bad boys later on!I wouldnt have someone MC just to spruke the guest book but I think it definitely helped  whenever our MC mentioned the guest book I noticed  or  people going up to sign it and the resulting guest book had tons of notes that might otherwise not have been there! Also its a really good activity for people to do when theyre bored or dont know anyone. So yeah would definitely recommend seeing if theres a friend  member of the bridal party who would be down with helping out with whatever announcements youll need.

I wouldnt have wanted him to come if it was going to cause him undue stress so Im glad he stayed home and look forward to seeing him another time. Im sure your friend will feel the same way about you missing her bachelorette.Anxiety is a very hard thing to conquer. Dont feel guilty about missing the bachelorette. Is the bride closer to where you live? Maybe you can do something special with her close to where you are as an alternative. Not necessary by any means but might be fun and might make you feel better.Edited to add that NO bride who plans an international bachelorette should be offended or overly disappointed that some guests cant come. Its totally fine to plan that but you have to expect that some people wont be able to attend for a variety of reasons and be willing to deal with that.,weddingplanning,dgrix4p,1,t5_2rv3t
