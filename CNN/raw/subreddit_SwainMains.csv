4285644,0,t3_35cw5g,HiIm an S swain main climbed from silver to plat now with mostly swain only and his build order is what makes him succeed.My three key items are Rod of ages first boots and zhonya. These must be rushed asap! Once you get your zhonyas this is your powerspike!In this meta we have alot of double ap combs ap top and mid so i tend to build abyssal as my fourth item great mr ap and reduces enemy magic resist.My last two items are entirely situational usually its rabacap then visage. If im against an AD team comb i would build Will of the ancients instead of abyssal then frozen heart instead of visage. If im doing really well i sell my boots for liandries for the final push mid. The reason for this is as followsAs Swain my job is to burst one of their carries and zhonya thats the beauty of playing the champ. You can do this from around the th minute mark thats average time i have zhonyaroa and boots. W the enemy first if you hit ult straight away and qe combo. You can ignite if you want to burst them and leave.However sometimes there are hard fights and this is what i do every game. When we are v mid i simply flash ultqe and ignite the enemy adc or mid then zhonya. That will kill them for sure regardless of their shields. This will make the fight as a v and the enemy team will be in a mess you will also be full health from your ultimate.This is the best way to play swain pick up those few kills with your combo i always play him with ignite but i can understand why you would play him with tp it just doesnt work with how i play him.Try this method for a game or two and i promise you will succeed when i was in silver  i got placed vs plat s and i destroyed them.Good luck!,SwainMains,cs8po0i,2,t5_32zku
6668362,0,t3_46ujd8,I prefer Thunderlords but both work nicely. Your build is the industry standard for birdman but going tank after Zhonyas might not be the best. You could try just going bruiser AP Liandrys Rylais Abyssal are all great on him. Mechanicswise Im not aware of the recent developments after his unfair W nerf but Im pretty sure its still max EgtQgtW. Try landing a Q slow before W if you find theyre dodging them. Or try W behind them then EQ them when they walk toward you to dodge it. ,SwainMains,d092e7s,2,t5_32zku
7340514,0,t1_d2ck7n6,Ive got another one Why isnt there a feedback thread on the PBE forums for him while smaller scope updates like Annie and Fiddle did get one?Getting some context behind his changes in said thread would be awesome.,SwainMains,d2ckeia,1,t5_32zku
7351702,0,t1_d2dtyng,Oh thats better than what I thought it did. I thought they just turned it into a delayed single target skillshot. Makes waveclearing before  much easier.,SwainMains,d2du6vk,1,t5_32zku
7484218,0,t1_d2srnp0,Q should only be targeting visible champions. If its not hitting like a Evelyn thats seen by a pink then we have a bug!,SwainMains,d2swx7e,1,t5_32zku
7579081,0,t1_d33dey6,I dont really think swain needs any additional damage. I always end up top damage in the games im in. Just a rocky lane. I know youre considering a slightly faster W trigger which would help a ton. Aside from that and the changes being made I feel like the only other problem he has is heavy dash champs. Not every champ can be good at everything.,SwainMains,d33pebv,2,t5_32zku

7898075,0,t3_4mkstr,I take it every time on swain I find it better than flash because you can stick to targets easily and escape better. I never felt the need to build rylais because they cant escape from you anyways with this.,SwainMains,d43tfoo,1,t5_32zku
8772988,0,t1_d7280jc,What elo is this? Just because you get kills doesnt mean its more efficient than playing someone that protects an adc that scales harder than you late game. tpghost on a support is incredibly selfish. Im pretty sure this is somewhere where you wont be punished for having such a weak immobile support with unreliable cc.Edit you were against a morde support too cmon bruh.,SwainMains,d72ag4m,1,t5_32zku
9357377,0,t3_58o1sa,In a game with tanks enemies I would switch liandrys and Rylais for rabadons and void staff which will give you way more damage.,SwainMains,d9245gx,1,t5_32zku
9666335,0,t1_da4jk5d,Well yes but the scope and timing of the rework hasnt been announced yet. It may not be until the end of the year even.,SwainMains,da4ktvx,1,t5_32zku
9783307,0,t1_dai7dj5,Yeah I maxed E because it guaranties maximum damage output. Anyway If you want to focus on wave clearing. W is a good choice. Just make sure you are not against champs like Fizz.The case I always choose W over E is when I face Lux. Her  barrier absorbs all of my E.I have all of his skin but I like his new classic splash lol.,SwainMains,daj089l,2,t5_32zku
9802687,0,t1_dal9yrq,IMO tear is pretty unnecessary since Swains passive  dorans  catalyst all provide a lot of mana sustain. Much better items out there that you can replace Ryalis with. But if it works for you dont let me dissuade you.,SwainMains,dale4mb,1,t5_32zku

10005028,0,t3_5ii8t1,Ive been following Quas recently since he plays a pretty good Swain top and in most of his games he goes RoA  Zhonya  Abyssal very very very often and after that it depends on how fed he gets he might go RabadonVoid Staff for the ultimate AoE damage and heal he might go Liandys for more sustained damage but he almost never builds Spirit Visage he focuses more on having balanced damage and survivability not full tank or youll do no damage nor full damage or you wont have time to abuse Swains strength.,SwainMains,dbbomur,1,t5_32zku
10032736,0,t1_dbei60x,Do you take scaling cdr or flat,SwainMains,dbfaizj,1,t5_32zku
10049761,0,t1_dbhe7y1,Most teemos go onhit nowadays so they do mixed damage. Itemize according to situation if youre ahead just buy dmg and defensive items against the fed enemies. For laning get visage components and maybe mercstabis. I wouldnt go visage second item personally as I find I run out of mana faster then my enemies can kill me or I can kill them with only roa for mana. Swain is a short range drain mage but in the end he is very simply a mage and needs ap to do his job. Usually the safer I feel about my skill in kiting and entering teamfights from flanks the less defensive I build.I usually complete roa and zhon before looking to complete visage or other items but I do get defensive components early if the lane isnt a complete landslide. ,SwainMains,dbhicin,1,t5_32zku
10098894,0,t3_5kgwwj,Vlad is an easy matchup build roa and morello and anything you want really. Dont let him hit you with his ablities respect his range. Poke and harass him when his abilities are on cd also take ignite and make him cry.,SwainMains,dbnwesl,2,t5_32zku
10146226,0,t1_dbu03ca, agree. SV is a noob trap for new Swain players. Swains healing scales with AP so the single best way to heal more is simply to build more AP. If you need MR then Abyssal is far better than SV since it gives you damage and healing rather than just healing. I only ever go SV after Abyssal if the enemy has multiple fed AP champions or I have multiply fed carries on my team in which case I can just focus on peeling since they already do enough damage to win teamfights. ,SwainMains,dbu21i1,2,t5_32zku
10147315,0,t1_dbtf2oo,Whenever Im over  cs a game it normally is easy enough to get an S. ,SwainMains,dbu74wp,1,t5_32zku
10450864,0,t3_5mgxe0,I think theres a few things to do especially in bronze that can get you the better end of the trade. First I would ward the bottom mid lane bush. You can see if they actually are roaming bot or just recalling there. As soon as you see them roam you spam ping bot and push your lane asap. If youre  you can even ult the wave into their tower. Now unless they get a double kill bot they miss out on enough cs and more importantly xp to where the roam is not worth it. If they dont get the kill then they pretty much fall behind immediately and you can push the lead. It all comes down to punishing the roam by pushing the wave into their tower as soon as they leave lane.,SwainMains,dcspcwu,1,t5_32zku
10698975,0,t1_ddjf63n,actually i just remembered that i have a low level NA account so if youd be interested in that just let me know D,SwainMains,ddjipzb,1,t5_32zku
10751379,0,t1_ddope20,I feel that when playing against tanks like poppy maokai and nautilus for example rumble would be more useful since his dps is higher than swains,SwainMains,ddox7sn,1,t5_32zku
10941872,0,t1_de8iu3b,Um Im sorry but no. Those three do not absolutely dumpster Swain. You may have to play a bit more defensive early until you get ult but you can definitely go even or ahead against any of them. The only way theyll absolutely dumpster you in and out of lane is if you just carelessly facetank them. Let them push the wave and freeze at tower. They cant harass you as freely as you can them as they are all melee characters and rather squishy too.Fiora Is only mobile so long as she hits her Q on something. Kite from range harass with E and save your QW for when she tries to jump on you. Stay near walls so you can hug them if she ults you. Youll be able to stop her procing the heal that way. Irelia Has to get ahead to do anything to Swain really. Also needs to get resets on Q to stay mobile. You should be able to harass her in the early laning phase at lvl to lessen the threat of an all in. Like Fiora harass with E save QW for peel if she jumps on you. Its important that after shes used her Q assuming she didnt get a reset keep on harassing her to keep her from healing back up with her W.Riven As shes the only freely mobile fighter of the three mentioned just play defensive until you get . If you still cant take her on then once again just play defensive farm and scale to your mid game strength.With all three of these matchups your item build should be something along the lines of RoAgtArmguardgtTabigtZhonyas. grab boots Dark Seal and Cloth Armor on your first back. Not only will Zhonyas prevent you from being bursted down hard but Tabi passive also works against OnHit skills Fiora QIrelia Q. In fact just from the way the enemy builds you can change it up to gain small advantages here and there. If they arent getting early hexdrinkers then you can go Ruby CrystalBlasting Wand for your first couple RoA parts. There is far more flexibility for Swain in these matchups just have to learn them and play accordingly.,SwainMains,de8ks51,0,t5_32zku
11058857,0,t1_delgpp7,Im sorry but I just dont get this explanation and I play a fair bit of Yorick. Every decent Yorick player knows he can outtrade most toplaners lvl  and will always try to fight you looking for first blood. How is he kiteable when he can slow you and simultaneously gain bonus MS? He just has to wait until you blow your Q then he can run at you freely. How can you freeze lane against a Yorick when he can just use his ghouls to push the wave and break any freeze? Unless hes really far behind freezing against Yorick is laughable. Yoricks Ghouls have  HP at lvl  assuming he is not using any HP runes or masteries since ghouls scale with his max health while Swain has  AD so it takes  autos from Swain to kill  ghoul.  autos with Swain slow attack speed. Your Q is single target so it wont immediately kill or slow all his ghouls.basically what u want a yorick lane to be is a farm lane thats constantly frozen in ur territory so ur jgler can fuck him and u can zone himexactly my point. Without your jungler Swain doesnt win this lane and you can very well lose it since Yorick can easily force fights against immobile champions once he has  graves. Also he doesnt have to go Zzrot first he can just sit on negatron and build Triforce. Dude no offense but Im skeptical that youve ever played against a Yorick as Swain. If you have the guygal was probably first timing Yorick and has no idea that Swain is ghoul chowder. ,SwainMains,deli4s7,1,t5_32zku
11482926,0,t3_63w287,Situational at best. Only reason I see to build it is to act as a secondary frontline in teamfights as needed. ,SwainMains,dfxl5vi,1,t5_32zku
11580025,0,t1_dg8i6hf,Ok Ill give it a go. Is proxy Singed the only way to go or can he lane normally?,SwainMains,dg8lp2l,1,t5_32zku
11670613,0,t3_66dvfl,Ive always had my pocket picks but I havent consistently played sr since two seasons ago when I hit plat one tricking swain most of the way up. But prior to that I played many and sundry champs. I do however also play a lot of aram so I feel like my capacity to play other champs has actually become a lot broader in scope compared to say ss. And even then its totally worthwhile to pick up new champs to counter things that hurt to play against as swain I still prefer kennen against riven for example or even the occasional karma malphite or teemo depending on matchup at least top lane. Mid lane is a different animal than top and I actually try to avoid picking swain mid as he struggles against a much higher range off champs and the ones I personally struggle against are different usually than the ones others do. For example I find syndra an easy matchup whereas most hate life against her. On the other hand I struggle immensely against a half decent orianna or tf when I should in theory be able to wreck them so I tend to pick other champions like veigar or ap kog in those cases. Same goes top lane I have less issues with rengar and even jayce sometimes than I do against irelia or nasus. The problem is mostly mindset if you think youre gonna do poorly on any non swain champ youre gonna do poorly. ,SwainMains,dgivokx,1,t5_32zku
11777598,0,t1_dguyjkc,I dont feel like most of the champ reworks have been QoL changes rather I feel along with many others Ive talked to that a lot of the reworks fail to maintain the feel of the champion and instead just place in something that looks the same visually and has the same name. I used to play champs like Quinn Tristana and poppy but now I dont because I dont actually enjoy their new play style sure thy might be fine champs now but they arent the champ that used to be there. Honestly I think riot is doing a good job with itemization changes and new champions and I wish they would focus on that instead of reworking old ones. Also balancing used to be done with numbers tweaks instead of ability reworks I wish we would go back to that.,SwainMains,dgv10t2,2,t5_32zku
