They probably wouldnt but the science would eventually damn them just as it did cigarettes. Ah the Carman study that claimed higher incidences of severe stomach inflammation. which can be viewed here Looking at their methodology we find the following. ampgtStomach inflammation was scored by the attending blinded veterinarian as a result ofexpertise obtained from numerous pig autopsies and a classification system developedas a result of an earlier preliminary study on pig stomachs.So they determined if the pigs stomach were inflamed by looking at it.  This is apparently wildly inappropriate and unscientific. According to Dr. Robert Friendship a swine health management specialist . ampgtit was incorrect for the researchers to conclude that one group had more stomach inflammation than the other group because the researchers did not examine stomach inflammation. They did a visual scoring of the colour of the lining of the stomach of pigs at the abattoir and misinterpreted redness to indicate evidence of inflammation. It does not. They would have had to take a tissue sample and prepare histological slides and examine these samples for evidence of inflammatory response such as white blood cell infiltration and other changes to determine if there was inflammation. There is no relationship between the colour of the stomach in the dead bledout pig at a slaughter plant and inflammation.So considering that the major claim of harm in that paper seems to be built on faulty science theres nothing to suggest that it actually supports the case for GMOs as harmful. ,conspiro,ceg6ove,1,t5_2x2ck

I took exception to this definition and another family member went on my side.  Then next we were looking up the exact definitions.Apparently I am actually agnostic as defined by the word and I held my line on that one.  The hard line atheists seem to like to swell their ranks.  Just look at the difference between the subscribership of ragnosticism and ratheism.  Im basically agnostic and I could really give a shit about talking about that all day.

Physicians were already using the caduceus as their symbol before that. More properly they use the staff of Asclepius the Greek god of healing but the two symbols were often confused. The staff of Asclepius has one serpent the staff of Hermes has two. The symbol of the caducus represents HermesThoth the god Hermes as understood by the Egyptian occultists during the period Egypt was ruled by Greeks. Thoth was a god of wisdom and the Egyptians associated Hermes with Thoth. The serpent has long been a symbol of immortality because it is able to shed its skin and thus appears to renew its life.The caducus represents to occultists wisdom immortality and freedom from disease goals devoutly sought by alchemists. Mercury for the Greeks Hermes is the central figure in European alchemy because the element mercury was so central to their preparations.,conspiro,cel08rt,1,t5_2x2ck

By the officer staying in that room created a hostile confrontation and this is the training officers get.  This couldve been handled much better.,conspiro,cerxuv7,1,t5_2x2ck

Over time however it seems that the ancient Seven deadly Sins were a much better idea then it was initially given credit for. For example why do a lot of people especially young people get into fights Alcohol not withstanding ? Pride. They get angry when their pride is hurt. They could just walk away and let it go.

They recruit young impressionable minds and nudge them to do things. This kind of organization isnt limited to one group though they do this across the world and give the impression of organized groups. In Russia you have the Chechens in China you will have the Uyghur terrorist. Uyghur people are Turks who live in China they are obviously a minority group which combined with their Arab heritage gives them the perfect MO for a terrorist group.The attacks on tiananmen square  are just the beginning of their operations in China. Israel is demonozing Arabs en mass because who hates the Arabs more than the Zionist pigs? Well it seems now most of the world hates them and guess why? If you understand where Jihad comes from it makes zero sense for them to go after the targets they are going after. But they want you to believe that terrorists indiscriminately bomb everyone across the world because of some insane drive to kill all non believers which isnt at all true and isnt at all what Jihad means. The Yemeni hospital massacre for example is a complete setup. No practicing Muslim would ever do that in the name of Allah. But you go on the internet and look for the videos of the massacre and you will see a whole list of comments damning the Muslims into hell. Even Arabs fall for it and they start to become disgusted with Islam because they dont agree with the incredible disgusting things that are done in their name.What they dont understand is that these attacks not only divide the world against the Arabs but it divides the Arabs among themselves. It creates extremists and moderates. The extremists are those who do not fear to fight the NWO the moderates are those who conform to western culture and practice Islam in a mostly passive and symbolic manner. They will never stand up for injustice because they are afraid to be labeled terrorists. In essence they will be passified in much the same way as the west is passified into inaction. ,conspiro,cewqn9o,1,t5_2x2ck

214349,0,t3_1wj3n2,thflrinsanity original reddit linkOne of the most often cited arguments of those skeptical of global warming is that the Medieval Warm Period  AD was as warm as or warmer than today. Using this as proof to say that we cannot be causing current warming is a faulty notion based upon rhetoric rather than science. So what are the holes in this line of thinking?Firstly evidence suggests that the Medieval Warm Period may have been warmer than today in many parts of the globe such as in the North Atlantic. This warming thereby allowed Vikings to travel further north than had been previously possible because of reductions in sea ice and land ice in the Arctic. However evidence also suggests that some places were very much cooler than today including the tropical pacific. All in all when the warm places are averaged out with the cool places it becomes clear that the overall warmth was likely similar to early to mid th century warming.Since that early century warming temperatures have risen wellbeyond those achieved during the Medieval Warm Period across most of the globe.  The National Academy of Sciences Report on Climate Reconstructions in  found it plausible that current temperatures are hotter than during the Medieval Warm Period.  Further evidence obtained since  suggests that even in the Northern Hemisphere where the Medieval Warm Period was the most visible temperatures are now beyond those experienced during Medieval times. This was also confirmed by a major paper from  scientists representing  scientific institutions around the world in .Secondly the Medieval Warm Period has known causes which explain both the scale of the warmth and the pattern. It has now become clear to scientists that the Medieval Warm Period occurred during a time which had higher than average solar radiation and less volcanic activity both resulting in warming. New evidence is also suggesting that changes in ocean circulation patterns played a very important role in bringing warmer seawater into the North Atlantic. This explains much of the extraordinary warmth in that region. These causes of warming contrast significantly with todays warming which we know cannot be caused by the same mechanisms.Overall conclusiona Globally temperatures are warmer than they have been during the last  years andb the causes of Medieval warming are not the same as those causing late th century warming.Source,conspiro,cf2uxjq,1,t5_2x2ck

234602,0,t3_1wr1bm,Sabremesh original reddit linkMy honest advice would be to think twice before choosing  for your paper. Firstly because it is such a huge subject that an essay could not possibly cover all the issues. Your teacher probably wants to see how persuasively you write but not to be bludgeoned with facts.Secondly because all the evidence demonstrates that  WAS an inside job and the arguments that it wasnt are so flimsy that your essay will inevitably appear one sided.There are many simpler issues where you can cover the controversial issues in a more clearcut fashion. It might even be a wise move to choose a subject on which YOU are personally divided  that way there wont be any unconscious bias when you write the paper.,conspiro,cf52e6n,1,t5_2x2ck

I mean at this point even if you had a mass awakening the production requirements to sustain society dont exist outside of those who already control them. In many ways at this point anything you do to the system ultimate only harms you. The plutocrats are completely isolated from any harm that could befall them. Even in a scenario where the people somehow take back some power and oust TPTB they will just retire to some villa and leave a broken society for some one else to fix. So should our focus really move beyond stopping them and move more towards surviving whats coming. Because you cant really stop whats already been done. ,conspiro,cf8y5lf,1,t5_2x2ck

We have made a large number of terrible habits socially unacceptable we can take this one more step and truly change the outcome for mankind.It only takes a consensus that psychopaths in positions of power just dont work.They have always been there but we didnt understand them. While we didnt understand their mindset they became responsible for the deaths of millions and yet more millions. This situation has weighed down mankind now for thousands of years. It has to stop and it can be stopped  the same way we have stopped many other bad behaviors by simple social rejection and a new attitude that does not allow the most powerful positions to be occupied by malevolent personalities.We simply cannot let the least sensitive the least caring and the most aggressive lead us into our destruction for nothing more than a tiny bit of endorphin or dopamine or any other pleasure giving brain chemical  being forced into the consciousness of the kind of leaders we have always had. For them one tiny dram of pleasure is worth the lives of any number of other people.Psychopathic leaders have no compunction against trading the world our world for a nano gram of endorphin or serotonin or dopamine.

279606,0,t1_cf9pljt,RaspberryJam original conspiracy comment linkPlease give this one a shot. The official reports are fraudulent and they dont reflect reality. The computer models NIST used are fabrications created to fit what they were trying to prove rather than what actually happened. At the end of the day you can believe whatever you want but I truthfully believe that if you watch the Toronto Hearings you will change your mind. This sound arrogant but after having seen that specific documentary I simply cannot go back to the official story. Theres just so many things that dont add up.NIST themselves have admitted that WTC collapsed at freefall acceleration. They claim that this is consistent with their model but that is a lie  their computer models do not show this. And how is it that the Twin Towers which were hit by planes collapsed in the exact same manner as WTC which was not hit? Their story does not make any sense.Again you can believe whatever you like it makes no difference to me one way or the other. Im asking you as one human being to another please try to find the time to watch the hearing. I wholly believe that if you give it an honest shot you too will see how the official story does not make sense. This isnt about you agreeing with me this isnt about me convincing you of something this is about the truth. It really is that simple.Please do not take offence to anything I have said. I am not attacking you personally. I am not trying to be condescending or act superior to you. Im not playing ego games. This is just something I really believe in.Have a good evening and good luck in your endeavours. ,conspiro,cf9qsd4,1,t5_2x2ck

I definitely dont agree with the system of criminalizing drug abusers either and Ill take a minute to watch this video. There are plenty of examples worldwide that countries that treat it as a health issue garner much better results. My biggest question and I hope you can answer this with some good evidence why should we pay our hard earned money to support someone who would rather spend his time and money getting high rather than being a productive member of society? Again Im not saying to disembody the welfare system as more privileged people it is our responsibility to help out the less fortunate but wouldnt it be a better idea to give more to those who would do well with it regardless of whether or not they can give back rather than those who just want to game the system and be lazy? Not trying to say this in an emotionally charged way but Ive personally seen plenty of people who are poor and should be taken care of because they are doing their best and just cant make ends meet but there are also those who are an unnecessary burden on our system and just try to game it,conspiro,cffcgo8,1,t5_2x2ck

This battle has been going on since at least Roman times. Those who rule have been winning this game for thousands of years. But it seems easy fast access to information and the expansion of the mind by todays complex modern lifestyle has been really giving the people a chance lately. Their plan has been written about for at least a hundred years. It is always a strategic consolidation of power. You can call it new world order or globalization or what ever.. I have come to the conclusion that psychopathssociopaths are the problem. Understanding the characteristics of this will put most of todays problems in a more realistic logical perspective.Sociopathic behavioural traits  When they decide what strategics steps to take they will look at the people as nothing but live stock in their people farms.

The way shills go about doing this is spewing misinformation and discrediting the character of the conspiracy theorist.Once the character has been discredited as crazy or such then no matter how much truth the conspiracy theorist uses it is useless. Stage two is to then further attack the conspiracy theorist by pointing out the fact that they know about shills. But they do it in a way to discredit character more. They claim that the conspiracy theorist must have a persecution complex to think that theyd ever be of enough importance to actually be attacked.They cant lose with that strategy. It means that when they are called out then they call us out. There are many other ways of spreading disinformation. Lying. Only responding to certain claims while ignoring others.

They dont want to sell at only a  dollar profit they too have seen it go to . So theyre going to ride out the storm.Bitcoin is a long term gamble.

My guess is that the FBI killed this guy because he might have known that the Tsarnaevs had been in contact with them or some other intelligence entity. They arent releasing any information because if people figure this out theyll know that the govtintelligence community was really behind the bombing. Thats kind of selfexplanitory. Imho the larger deception is a very important issue to address thats why I mention Sandy Hook and the various connections however outlandish some of them are to the bombing.,conspiro,cfs7wla,1,t5_2x2ck

Japan was a little slow to industrialize but still had plenty of technology Karakuri dolls were essentially the start of robotics and those were being made in the s and ancient Japanese construction techniques made large structures earthquake proof long before anyone in the west figured it outthey also invented the modern seismograph. Europe led the pack in the  arts and medicine but let religion stand in the way of progress. A lot of post WWII innovation came directly from what Germany and Japan were developing during the war. You can credit them with most of the advancements in propulsionaerospace in general medicine and modern pharmaceuticals.
