2810908,0,t1_cnnexbs,My attitude towards alcohol is much the same as yours. I enjoy a glass of wine at night but if Im feeling anxious about something Ill reach for it more out of coping than to just enjoy it. As long as I stay cognizant of it I know when to stop. Also alcoholism runs in my family another reason to be cognizant.  I rarely drink hard liquor or drink to drunkenness and I dont use any other drugs. I dont like the feeling of being altered or losing control of myself. ,hsp,cnnlb3m,4,t5_2sf60
2845111,0,t1_cm4i920,Man I can relate to this a ton! Most people think Im introverted and maybe I am. But I derive a lot of joy from being around and talking to others. I forget to give myself time and space to clear my head and think. Then when I do socialize I just beat myself up way too much thinking I offended people or was too opinionated or did not consider their feelings enough. It is super tough at times. For me its worse when I need to socialize so badly but worry and beat myself up so much that I cannot enjoy what would otherwise be a fun experience. I am reading a book on anxious attachment style which helps. All I can say is youre not alone! And youre right other people probably thought nothing of it at all,hsp,cnrhl2j,1,t5_2sf60
3528873,0,t3_30lsl2,Ive been called cold before and it hurts. Its hard to explain to people that Im very emotional I just dont show it. While I may appear calm on the outside the inside is anything but. Growing up I took my cues from my Dad who I now believe is also HSP and he never showed much emotion. So thats what I learned to do. I also had a mother amp sister who were always telling me to take a chill pill and making fun of me for being emotional over things they thought I shouldnt be emotional about.So yeah I relate like a lot. The only advice I have is to cultivate relationships. It takes awhile but once people get to know you they will know youre not a cold person.  ,hsp,cpuikoh,2,t5_2sf60
3865729,0,t1_cqwx5g1,Great! Thats good to hear. Yes weekends used to feel like I had a two day hangover and only recovered enough to make it in to work each Monday rather than having any resources to enjoy myself at the weekend. Its definitely not to do with weakness its just different people can manage different types of work. For example friends who are more sociableextrovert etc would never be able to cope working from home. Theyd be as miserable as a hsp would be in a busy office!

To be honest to say it straight away Im struggling with this myself more or less every day so I do not have an answer or method for you to make these things go away. Shit sometimes memories of events like that completely overwhelm me for the best part of a week a time in which I struggle to feel happiness or anything positive at all.However I wanted to tell you that hearing this come from someone else does something for me it makes me feel a little less alone. So thank you I guess and thanks also to uthrowawayblaaaarg for similar reasons.Although Ive known about the concept of HSPs for a good  years now and been reading other peoples experiences on their struggles for almost as long Ive never felt itd be warranted for me to share some of my own.

4844888,0,t3_3h6yem,I supervise staff that have emotional conflicts pretty regularly and I often need to take on the role of peacemaker. I loathe conflict and am known as the cool head in the office so I do my best to provide guidance to others on how to play nice. As exhausting as this is Ive become more and more resilient and also pretty effective based on feedback from upper management. There have been days where Ive known I was dangerously close to my limit. So far Ive managed to deal by staying mindful that the moment will pass and at the end of the day Ill be able to retreat to the sanctuary of my quiet home. ,hsp,cu58gbk,6,t5_2sf60
4868742,0,t3_3hiobg,Ive learned to embrace the short days of winter and now I love them. They key is to rethink the darkness as being cosy. Winter is the time of year to snuggle under a blanket with a good book and a cup of hot cocoa or Scotch or to bingewatch great TV shows. Its also a time for hobbies and projects. Most of all winter is a perfect time for reflection.Winter has also become my favourite time to be outdoors as theres more quiet and solitude than at other times of the year. For example beaches that are crawling with people during the summer months are often completely empty during the winter. As an added bonus beachcombing is best in the winter when the storms throw stuff up. obligatory plug for rbeachcombing  Starmoongazing is also waaay better in the winter.Spending time outdoors during the few daylight hours is critically important. Exercise fresh air and natural light are all important for good mental and physical health so get every bit that you can. If you live in a city try squeezing in a short walk at lunch most days and a longer one in a park on the weekend. The more natural and quiet the setting the better. Youll be amazed at how differently it will make you feel about winter and yourself.,hsp,cu88px8,3,t5_2sf60

4940740,0,t3_3ika89,take good breaks and manage your input during the day.If you are less arousedstimulated then you might not be as tired.How i knowHow i used to spend my weekday Get up dress hastily inhale a cup of coffee and get out of the door within  minutes of waking up. Get on the train stand for an hour  rushhour...no seats available while trying to ignore the horrid morningbreaths perfumes aftershaves and deodorants of my fellow commuters. Work for  hours lots of coffee short breaks behind my desk because i love my job Get on the train again stand for an hour again now ignoring the sweatstink Be greeted by wife and son. Both happy to see me but at this point im too run down and overaroused to enjoy their company and im no fun to be with either. After dinner not enjoying too tiredirritated my son goes to bed i fall asleep while watching a series with my wife and wake up just in time to go to bed. After  or  hours i wake up.Almost everything in this scenario led me to more stimulationtrain work lowers my capacity for stimuli coffee or prevent me from offloading the tension short breaks no leasure timeHow i spend my weekday after i recognised myself as HSP Get up early take a good breakfast low carb keeps my energylevel higher and a few cups of herbal tea while reading or doing some thinking on my projects    sets my baselevel of stimulation as low as it can go Take the bus to work    Takes half an hour longer but it is not as busy and cramped as the train.I can sit down and even sleep if i want to. While at work  i take my breaks almost religiously.         again lowers or resets the stimulationlevel  I often spend my lunchbreak taking a nap.         i find a powernap minutes max is the ultimate stimulationreset  I also eat well during the day.        a wellcaredfor body will have less reason to get exited and not as easily overaroused Take the bus back home.

5109860,0,t3_3kzp0l,I can relate but slightly differently. I always thought of myself as highly empathetic and I always thought that was a good thing if I can tell how people are feeling they will confide in me and I can help them. Now maybe because Im at a more difficult part of life stressfully trying to transition from uni to a career all my empathy does is stress me out and I hate it. I project other peoples negative emotions on to myself. For example my S.O. Is feeling stressed and sad because of reasons not directly related to us but I find myself being consumed by stress and sadness on his behalf as well as my own and I hate it. I wish I could just block it out but I care about him and sense these emotions and I cant help projecting them on to myself and shouldering that burden.Im finding it really hard to see the pros of this as well. I wish I was less sensitive,hsp,cv1xheg,4,t5_2sf60

5455381,0,t1_cw8val2,Try and make friends with as many people that have heighten sensitivity as possible so your felt sense has something to balance it self off of.  Over the last few months Ive joined a bunch of HSP business groups and Ive been in contact with other HSP and the change Ive noticed is when Im around lesssensitive people I feel secure in the knowledge that I have a whole community of HSP that Im part of.  Its odd its almost like when youve got others that are like you thats got your back you can deal with anything.Youll find your way the key thing to remember is to be kind to yourself.  Sometimes HSPs are hard on themselves because thats what lesssensitive people do to them and the HSP starts the accept that as normal.  When I meet people that try that with me its shield up and I project hostile energy towards them without saying a word.  x out of  theyll back away from me without saying another word D,hsp,cw8z643,1,t5_2sf60
5565312,0,t1_cwm6nh5,I can relate.Its almost as if you can feel their way of behaving. You can sense and take sensing with a grain of salt its more like experiencing their behavior very clearly what is beneath the actual behavior.It makes gauging people rather easy you can differentiate between a person whos grumpy because thats his personality and a person that normally acts normal and is just grumpy today.I agree with the exhausting bit really. A lot of people have an act going on and you cant just act on what you feel the person is like beneath the behavior. That only gives you responses where they have no clue what you are talking about especially when those people dont know that their behavior is an outer layeract.Compare it with looking at a painting. You can see all of the intricacies of the painting and when you comment on it to a person who cant you get called out on it.,hsp,cwmxein,5,t5_2sf60
5835840,0,t3_3v3e0a,I was in the Navy from  and received an honorable discharge. I was a grape on an aircraft carrier who worked below decks in the pump rooms. Specifically I worked in our maintenance shop and ended up with EM and IT qualifications in order to work on our automated pump rooms and fueling stations. I was also on Aircrew so I stood regular watches in helicopter sorties as an equipment operator and rescuer. I did two tours in the Persian Gulf during war time and participated in the hurricane Katrina rescue efforts. I suffer from treatment resistant PTSD and I cant see a future for myself right now. Yes PTSD from resceuing people and being on constant alert for  years so if this happens to an HSP without seeing actual combat imagine what would happen to an HSP who does. Personally I would recommend avoiding military service for HSPs unless they can lock it up and tough it out. Which if that were the case then they probably arent a HSP.,hsp,cxkltbc,3,t5_2sf60

7570884,0,t1_d32p3cm,WOW! Thanks vikingladywizard friggin awesome name btw haha for your insightful reassuring and thoughtful response! I guess you are right! You cant really lose your sensitivity cause I guess thats just the way you are wired! Actually cause you mentioned that ones sensitivity can be expressed in different ways I did notice that I am more sensitive when it comes to my inner life and my own personal world of thought now and I am more in tune with my spiritual side too ... so I guess you could say that my sensitivity shifted from the outside world to the inside one? And like you said my depression and the antidepressants I take do certainly play a role in how my sensitivity changed or maybe even is kinda suppressed.Did anyone else here experience their sensitivity to express itself in different ways throughout their lives?  ,hsp,d32rto2,1,t5_2sf60

9921516,0,t1_dar5il2,on the one hand youre right...it gives people a context with which to understand your actions or reactions.on the other hand it can be perceived as relinquishing responsibility to act within social norms...and so can be seen as dickish to some.i dont tell too many people...only the closest people i can trust...because to me if there is a problem to be had and thats really debatable its my problem to deal with. if i tell my closest friends it is only to share with them a part of my life that is challenging at times and how it might put me in situations that only friends can understand and support me through. i wouldnt tell my boss for instance or my casual coworkers. theyll be looking for the behavior after that and it will only make my sensitivity to the situation more acute. HSP means being sensitive...so the more i know that other people know the more awkward everything gets.so i minimize the awkwardness by telling myself it is my challenge to deal with.,hsp,db0sr27,1,t5_2sf60

My family is full of nonhsps or hsps who are so numbed out and dissociated from their feelings that they just dont get it or empathize with sensitivity it....  They try but theyre often making comments like dont you think that meditation stuff is making you way too sensitive? nah mom its helping me cope with the massive feelings I pick up from the people in my life!..but I digress.My recommendations . Expectationintentions check. Sweet sweet hsp. Im gonna provide you with a resource below...you might have already clicked on the link you sneaky sneak!...but first I highly recommend you do an expectation check in first. Not to keep your expectations in check but to make sure you get out of this conversation what you feel you need. So question what do you want the result of this conversation to be? what do you hope happens? This is just a goldmine for personal growth to figure out what youre needing and how to get it even if your parents cant ever understand you the way you want to be understood. Look at those expectations and then ask questions if youd like some guidance around this message me! I live for this guiding hsps to growth stuff  . Open your heart big time. As a sensitive we dont just feel intensely we radiate our feelings intensely too. So go in radiating love. As much as you can go in accepting your parents for where theyre at loving yourself as a sensitive loving them as not sensitives and grateful for what your relationship with them has taught you despite the struggles them not quite understanding you has created. Do whatever you gotta do to get to a place where you feel like okay I love me I love them lets go. . I encourage you to show them this video . Thannnk you for trying to educate more people on HSPs. Its so necessary not just for us hsps to feel understood but for people who deny their sensitivites to wake up to the fact that being sensitive is a real thing and a beautiful thing and not just an evil way to manipulate people feel bad about their sortofmean comments by being too sensitive.

10823567,0,t1_ddp8hel,I definitely agree with this. As long as youre not harming others or yourself do whatever you need to do to grieve. My grandpa passed away fairly unexpectedly this past October and my boyfriend broke up with me within a week of this. I was devastated and I really had to put my daily life on pause for a bit. It took me a month or so maybe more to really get over it and I had to give myself time and space to grieve. Its not always a pretty understandable process for onlookers but thats ok. It doesnt have to be something others understand and nobody grieves the same way as anyone else. Its all about what you need to do to work through your pain. I highly recommend seeing a therapist though. Even just having someone to openly nonjudgmentally listen to your feelings can be healing. Best of luck. ,hsp,ddwdi8c,1,t5_2sf60
