1199822,0,t1_ci4kdbv,It is multiple cores because you can use both at the same time. It is just not a physical core. It is still using the same resources as a physical core.The same can be said for Bulldozer based CPUs as well. As they are technically  or less modules. Which is pretty much the same thing as Hyperthreading. They also share the same resources.Windows considers them cores and uses them as such. So im going to call them cores.You could have just mentioned you have an FX chip. I am well aware of their product line thank you.Unless you are running an APU faster RAM isnt going to do anything you will notice. If youre lucky youll get a whole extra  FPSA RAM Disk is the only thing using all of that speed.You also contradicted yourself.gt Ram speed doesnt impact gamesgt Especially in newer d optimized and capable gamesAside from that not making sense. Games are not going to take advantage of faster RAM. Here are some benchmarks from  months ago average FPS tells the whole story. You are also talking about optimization when this game is far from optimized in any way. Though to be fair if any game was going to take advantage of faster RAM it would probably be this one ill give you that. I still dont think it would be a meaningful difference though.,landmark,ci4ljv2,2,t5_2t0o4

1723620,0,t1_cjw6tdj,IMO death shouldnt be meaningless and a slap on the wrist like many MMOs in todays market. Death should have consequences. Part of the fun in adventuring for me is knowing that I might not make it back with all my belongings. It makes you pay attention more and feel more connected to your character and experience. However you also dont want to make death extremely punishing. Losing hours of playing time ala vanilla EQ is just too archaic of a system now. I thought Minecraft handled death pretty well. Once you died you lost your experience and the items on you. You had a set amount of time to recover your items and a portion of your experience. This insured that the more you explored the more risk you took on. You always had the option to return home and drop off your loot. Thus if you died and were unable to recover your stuff it was mostly due to poor planning or negligence. This made exploring truly feel adventurous.,landmark,cjwfd5u,1,t5_2t0o4

The game I paid for in advance is clearly not going to be released now  at best well only see abysmal notevenclosetocomplete form of Landmark launch simply so the investment management company can keep the cash from remaining preorders.At this point Im assuming theyre only going to keep SOEDaybreak around as a skeleton crew to maintain current services until they sunset EQ EQ etc. and then sell off HZ to the highest bidder.

3389027,0,t3_2z09vw,The complaints about DX isnt about visual quality but about performance. When they made PS they chose DX to get a wider audience but didnt realize that users with cards only supporting DXup to geforce  which is now  years old will never get decent performance with the goals of k players on a single map they had in mind. They tried to optimize for a wide spectrum and lost on all ends in the process on low end because...its low end and on the high end because DX just isnt compatible with todays hardware. The same problems are present in landmark too all forgelight games are CPU bound. DX has better multithread and memory management and it would have made the devsand our lives easier.  Thats not to say going DX magically would have solved every problem DX and mantle aims to do that by reducing the CPU overhead that all forgelight games suffer from. Question is will the devs rewrite the games to utilise the advantages? Some say that since they are now independent from Sony and if they choose to port the games over to Xbox they are forced to do so and the PC versions may get the same treatment in the far future. ,landmark,cpekqrp,3,t5_2t0o4

No question it has come a long way and I do think that one day itll be a great game for someone who really enjoys building things. I know a lot of builders already really enjoy playing.Ill give you your constructive criticism. The problem is that Daybreak is trying to make a game that caters to a broad spectrum of people so they can make more money. Whats happening is theyre losing faith from a portion of their fans because everything but the building is really disappointing. It was a mistake to try and make this anything other than a builders game. Allow building under ground or revamp entire resource mining system. They have split what little community they have by forcing adventurers under ground and builders above ground.Ya know what really scares me the optimization especially as it paves the way for EQN. I run a pretty solid rig and have to go on medium settings  can you imagine when EQN comes out and there are thousands of people combat and destructive environment the server is gonna crash.
