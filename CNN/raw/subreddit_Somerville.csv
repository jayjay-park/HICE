3207328,0,t3_2wsy4t,FYI You cannot use space savers  claim a spot in Somerville. Some people who I generally refer to with expletives do but its illegal and the space savers might be collected and thrown away by the city. If you simply meant claim by parking there awesome carry on. Might have to walk a ways but spots exist. Things will hopefully be better in a week as well.Digging out more spots is of course a noble task but theres not all that much more room on the even sides of streets so unfortunately not much that can be done until the emergency is lifted. Its hard to find places to put snow from the deeper piles.Could preemptively dig out the odd side but I think the city has been planning to plow some of them before lifting the ban so it might be futile.Also be sure to read up on the snow emergency information and sign up for Somerville alerts  to know when things change.For example currently theres still a snow emergency meaning no even side parking but residents can park in city lots but theres a list of  streets with the even side ban lifted and school and library lots are closed to residents during the day. Things are getting complicated.,Somerville,coufsks,7,t5_2r7a8

4293711,0,t1_cs9lioa,Well the people who arent used to leashing their dogs are the Czech people you referenced not residents of Somerville. The law is pretty generally your dog must be leashed everywhere in the area except very specific areas like dog parks where youre allowed to unleash them.People generally know theyre supposed to leash their dogs but they probably assume its so that unruly dogs dont misbehave.

7748256,0,t3_4l2txu,Most of what Ive learned has been through experience which I cannot share for very good reasons.You will find the real leeches at city hall skimming off the taxpayers millions.There were comments on blogs about Spring Hill residents described as though you were all some self anointed hamlet of Somerville Ave Royalty. Most of us locals never even heard of Spring Hill until the story broke about your clique of fire station haters trying to prevent the new station to be built on Somerville Ave citing your fear of lowered property values.The only sections of properties mostly sought after are located in West Somerville. Anything beyond Davis was always considered a slum hence the expression slummerville penned by Howie Carr who wrote about WHG.What you critically uninformed newbies dont understand is our town is comprised of generations of life saving fire fighters EMTs war heroes and police officers. Many of our men built this city drove produce to kitchen tables worked in hot factories and risked their lives to make a pittance so their families could stay alive. They survived the Great Depression and we are their legacy.The next time you see those blinking lights you should wonder if those guys will make it home to their families. If all youve got to complain about is blinking lights you need help.I hope you never need a rescue team to save your life.Thanks to Aaron Swartz I am able to get the word out without being harassed by the syndicated operation you call home.Enjoy the ride!
