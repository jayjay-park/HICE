7109624,0,t3_4cxznj,Totally not Muyuu here.I gotta say EAs draft in game  took us a bit by surprise. We expected the poke comp but did not expect the Karma top and we didnt respect their disengage enough. Rammus was a bad pick too vs Morg. Instead of Rammus we should either have picked an instant hardengage toplaner like Malphite or flexed the Graves pick to go toplane and pick a hard engage jungler like Sejuani.Game  our sololanes got crushed in the early game and then when we were finally making a comeback we lost a Nash smitefight. I actually liked our teamcomp better in that game but we were too far behind  inhibs down and no Nexus towers at that point. Then they could just split us up with  strong splitpushers and with the superminion waves distract us and backdoor the nexus.GG to EA. I wrote this because maybe someone is interested in a bit of analysis from the players themselves. If you guys liked it I can do the same for our next games.,Vespyr,d1m98ws,5,t5_3baux
