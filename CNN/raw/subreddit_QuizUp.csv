111292,0,t1_cemsjr4,I have  In Orbit and  UN Assembly and Ive only played from my hometown. Im pretty sure both categories are based on specific countries for each category. Just dont know which countries apply to each category.Ive played over  games so Ive obviously had more diverse opponents. And whenever I played someone from an unusual location Ive checked for progress in each category. Sometimes In Orbit progressed sometimes UN Assembly progressed. In Orbit has taken longer even though its only  countries vs . Cant guess which is my last In Orbit country. ,QuizUp,cer3qd8,2,t5_2z4ld

My guess is its his kid using an ipod touch while watching spongebob.I have an adult life and cant commit that kind of time.  Maybe once my kid is old enough Ill have him grind some topics out for me.,QuizUp,cqz4sno,3,t5_2z4ld

10560046,0,t1_dd4zlgi,What about a third Play against bot option? Id prefer an upfront option that tells me Im playing against bots to the tryingtobesubtleandlooklikerealpeoplebutstillobviouslyfake bots you play against when you pick an option that tells you youre supposed to play against a real opponent.
