4139532,0,t3_38463i,Your orientation label is really personal so what works for you might not be best for everybody else. Further the word queer has been used as a pejorative for a long time so lots of people arent comfortable using it to describe themselves or lgbt people as a group.,queer,crs4htm,6,t5_2qtur

6599467,0,t3_462ggx,I found the gender options super limiting. As far as I can tell theres no place on a profile that makes you pick one of eight sexuality options. Not to mention you could be trans ftmmtf a crossdresser intersex a manwoman and genderqueer all at the same time. Im going to delete my profile now.,queer,d01xswu,2,t5_2qtur

11402762,0,t3_5xeyon,Growing up I was proud of considering myself weird in general before I had any sexuality. As I grew older and decided I liked people in those romantic and biological ways I found that my taste in individuals was neither category A or B. Im not straight I am not strictly gay even bisexual doesnt really cover it. Im attracted to trans people too. Basically to me if youre a fun human to look at and be with then I am probably attracted to you. Dont much mind what kind of parts you have as long as youre good and kind and know how to have fun. I guess you could also call me pansexual but that word feels too heavy to me. ,queer,dfohltl,1,t5_2qtur
