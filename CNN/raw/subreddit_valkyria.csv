3301458,0,t1_cp4iija,No problem! Its an easy thing to forget since its never actually mentioned in the game.,valkyria,cp4lch5,2,t5_2s7la
4199903,0,t3_38t7h5,Eh. The Steam Summer Sale starts soon and VC will almost certainly be on sale at some point during it. Wait. ,valkyria,cryze9g,2,t5_2s7la
4202027,0,t1_cryc6dg,Thanks for the reply anyway! Couldnt tell from Uplays website whether it is still operating as a separate client or just a games sale website but I guess it is the former. Ill wait for the sale,valkyria,crz8192,1,t5_2s7la
4434988,0,t1_csplslq,I personally dont think they were building it up at all I think they were establishing Isaras ambitions in order to make her death more tragic.,valkyria,csppt9l,7,t5_2s7la
4563698,0,t1_ct5jdpi,Hell no without that fast forward button this entire game would take me about a year to finish.Especially grinding all those skirmishes over and over just the get all the ace drops would be a nightmare without it!,valkyria,ct5vb47,1,t5_2s7la
5252248,0,t3_3mqxtu,Im pretty sure these swimsuit figures of Selvaria and the other Squad  females are pertaining to the anime only. In the anime only a certain portion of squad members are in the rest being assorted to Squad  and the likes. Lynn was only featured very briefly in the anime credits and they dont even show her face. I may be wrong but it is very unlikely that there is a Lynn swimsuit pic. ,valkyria,cvj31x2,2,t5_2s7la
5254102,0,t1_cvj8c0u,Ive never messed with blender but this might work perfectly. Im sure theres certain artistic liberties taken but I can hash this out with a few official arts. So will this work with steam or do I need to get them off the ps disc?,valkyria,cvjb2x1,1,t5_2s7la
5727485,0,t3_3tky7m,Huh looks like its going to be a very different game from the original series. Which is pretty cool looks interesting. I liked the musicit probably wouldnt have been particularly fitting for the original but I think given what weve seen it works here pretty well. From what weve seen Ive started thinking of this more like a spinoff series rather than a continuation of the original series which I think is pretty cool,valkyria,cx71tu9,3,t5_2s7la
