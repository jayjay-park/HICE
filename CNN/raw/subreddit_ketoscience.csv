1206950,0,t1_ci58n71,Wow regarding my questiongt Of key importance is the ability of fructose to bypass the main regulatory step of glycolysis the conversion of glucosephosphate to fructose bisphosphate controlled by phosphofructokinase. Thus while glucose metabolism is negatively regulated by phosphofructokinase fructose can continuously enter the glycolytic pathway. Therefore fructose can uncontrollably produce glucose glycogen lactate and pyruvate providing both the glycerol and acyl portions of acylglycerol molecules. These particular substrates and the resultant excess energy flux due to unregulated fructose metabolism will promote the overproduction of TG triglyceridesThanks for the link!,ketoscience,ci5ef5j,1,t5_2v172

3037306,0,t3_2uy76q,The first study he cites was over a course of two days. What the researchers do is feed one group fats and the other group carbs. The researches then administered a blood sugar test which showed the fat group getting a blood sugar of near . The study can be seen hereSo the study then was all about influencing the dextrose tolerance test. The dextrose tolerance test is about giving the subjects dextrose and then seeing how their blood glucose reacts. Consider this then for two days the high fat group had been having almost no blood sugar spikes. It didnt need to secrete much insulin. All of a sudden they dumped a huge amount of sugar in the blood. You can obviously see what happens. I think this is dishonest to apply to the ketogenic diet. Someone on keto will never dump sugar into their blood like that. It just doesnt make any sense. Meanwhile the sugar group has had a steady stream of carbs and higher insulin production for two days. Theyre already going to have lots of insulin ready to go for the dextrose test. I dont even see how this test is applicable for the mans argument. He then goes on to talk about athletes carb loading so that they can increase their glycogen stores. He says insulin is the key to let sugar in. Thats true. Insulin is the key to building fat deposits as well and storing fat. Hes so far into the glycosis model he doesnt even consider how the body works differently in ketosis. One is obviously only producing a small fraction of the glucose that he is in glycosis. Moving on he then blames intramyocellular lipids on insulin resistance which is as far as I can tell correct. So what should we be wondering now? What causes intramyocellular lipid build up? He blames it completely on free fatty acids citing a  hour study where they took healthy individuals and observed if glycogen production was hampered by free fatty acids. It seems rather courageous to me to try and infer that FFA in the blood permanently impair insulin resistance from one  hour test and to top that off its only from FFA due to dietary intake of fat.Twice now he seems impressed by the fact that things happen quickly in the short term rather than bothering to present us with a longterm study. Again hes completely disregarded the fact that someone on the ketogenic diet does not need insulin in the same way someone on a regular diet does or in the same amounts. He also is agnostic to body fat lipogenesis from carbs and the fact that carbs contribute to fatty acids in the blood. If you eat too many carbs you will cause this insulin resistance phenomena he is talking about. The difference is your blood glucose will also be raised as well meaning you need even more insulin. He then says you can do the opposite clear the fat out of the blood and you clear the sugar because you MUST have sugar in your blood! Ketones obviously dont exist. The real hilarious part is the final partgton a ketogenic diet insulin doesnt work very wellBecause it doesnt need to. Stop giving dextrose tests to people in ketosis. That isnt a marker of anything. He then draws the conclusion that if we have less fat INTAKE then insulin resistance decreases ignoring lipogenesis completely. Ignoring the VLDLP that is spawned from lipogenesis which is the plaque that sticks to your arteries and kills you. Ignoring his results are from giving sugar to someone whose body isnt in a state to metabolize sugar. Ignoring that all of his results are mypotic in their length compared to a diet over the course of a life time.Just one single long term dietary study please. ,ketoscience,coctdvn,15,t5_2v172
3083252,0,t1_cohigov,gt If it were possible thru a pill or diet no more T diateses and a slew of other conditions and we can all go back to eating pasta and pizzaI realize this is very hypothetical but even so its not actually true. Insulin resistant cells in your muscle are in an oxygen deprived glucose dependent state so in order to survive they burn glucose anaerobically and translocate some GLUT to absorb more glucose. The cell regulates the amount of GLUT translocation so that incoming glucose matches the energy needs of the cell. If hypothetically you could take a pill that would restore insulin sensitivity in these cells this would result in too many GLUT translocations resulting in glucose toxicity and cell death. Why? Because the cell cannot burn glucose and synthesize glycogen at the same time as this constitutes a futile cycle. Yes more. Pathologically insulin resistant cells utilize more glucose not less.,ketoscience,cohksz8,1,t5_2v172

3671707,0,t3_32ew4h,Link worked for me. Abstract Alzheimers disease is a devastating disease whose recent increase in incidence rates has broad implicationsfor rising health care costs. Huge amounts of research money are currently being invested in seeking theunderlying cause with corresponding progress in understanding the disease progression. In this paper wehighlight how an excess of dietary carbohydrates particularly fructose alongside a relative deficiency indietary fats and cholesterol may lead to the development of Alzheimers disease. A first step in thepathophysiology of the disease is represented by advanced glycation endproducts in crucial plasma proteinsconcerned with fat cholesterol and oxygen transport. This leads to cholesterol deficiency in neurons whichsignificantly impairs their ability to function. Over time a cascade response leads to impaired glutamatesignaling increased oxidative damage mitochondrial and lysosomal dysfunction increased risk to microbialinfection and ultimately apoptosis. Other neurodegenerative diseases share many properties withAlzheimers disease and may also be due in large part to this same underlying cause....Over time neurons become severely damaged due to chronic exposure to glucose and oxidizing agents and are programmed for apoptosis due to highly impaired function. Once sufficiently many neurons are destroyed cognitive decline is manifested. Simple dietary modification towards fewer highlyprocessed carbohydrates and relatively more fats and cholesterol is likely a protective measure against Alzheimers disease.This is a HUGE deal.

3975523,0,t1_cr7qigs,gt Ascorbic acid in most animals is apparently created during carbohydrate metabolism. I wouldnt say so. Ascorbic acid is packed together with glucose naturally its not created thats an evolutionary artefact and characteristic of endemic foods in hot climates. Human metabolism revolves around that artefact. Ascorbic acid is an antioxidant that lowers cytosolic pH and thus reduces the proton leak respectively ROS created by NADPH in mitochondria as result of glucose oxidation. This explains why some antioxidants appear harmful or with no effect in lipid oxidation as fatty acid oxidation already marks a reduction in the potential because of the ROS output that accompany the process. What matters in the case is what is the epigenetic determinant and the physiological factors that regulate the switch between glucose and lipid  oxidation but thats a different story.So you are right about that nutritional ketosis does not require antioxidants as there are already evolutionaryevolved mitochondrial defenses in action. The take home conclusion is that ROS created in the process of the two main metabolic paths glucose and fatty acid of oxidation utilize differential mitochondrial protective mechanisms and are also created in different stages of the ETC i.e. to correct Gary Taubes and set the record straight therere good and bad ROS though they are not immanently so and what matters is the dynamics in metabolism.

Fat can trigger fat storage via ASP in response to chylomicrons released in the liver but it is stronger in the presence of insulin and we have yet to see a population that can get fat on a low carb or keto lifestyle.

They did do a mouse study but Im not sure injecting modified cancer cells into mice is a valid approach. Either the mice all had a non ketogenic diet so the modified cancer cells get sugar and ketones as fuel none had a ketogenic diet and the mice with normal cancer cells did better or they used different diets and no longer have a controlled variable. This study basically reads like they genetically engineered cancer cells to be more responsive to ketones and found out they were more responsive to ketones. ,ketoscience,cvnq7v1,5,t5_2v172

6613906,0,t1_d031xue,gt Your TDEE vs. your caloric intake is what determines loss of bodymassTrue but not with the causal link you are implying. Heres a primer gt This conviction that positive caloric balance causes weight gain is founded on the belief that this proposition is an incontrovertible implication of the first law of thermodynamics. The fact remains that no matter what people eat it is calories that ultimately count as Jane Brody explained in the New York Times. Eat more calories than your body uses and you will gain weight. Eat fewer calories and you will lose weight. The body which is after all nothing more than a biochemical machine knows no other arithmetic. For fifty years clinicians nutritionists researchers and public health officials have used this logic as the starting point for virtually every discussion of obesity. Anyone who challenges this view is seen as willfully disregarding a scientific truth. Let me state said the Columbia University physiologist John Taggart in his introduction to an obesity symposium in the early s that we have implicit faith in the validity of the first law of thermodynamics. A calorie is a calorie and Calories in equals calories out and thats that. But it isnt. This faith in the laws of thermodynamics is founded on two misinterpretations of thermodynamic law and not in the law itself. When these misconceptions are corrected they alter our perceptions of weight regulation and the forces at work. The first misconception is the assumption that an association implies cause and effect. Here the context is the first law of thermodynamics the law of energy conservation. This law says that energy is neither created nor destroyed and so the calories we consume will be either stored expended or excreted. This in turnimplies that any change in body weight must equal the difference between the calories we consume and the calories we expend and thus the positive or negative energy balance. Known as the energybalance equation it looks like this Change in energy stores  Energy intakeEnergy expenditure The first law of thermodynamics dictates that weight gain the increase in energy stored as fat and leantissue mass will be accompanied by or associated with positive energy balance but it does not say that it is caused by a positive energy balance by a plethora of calories as Russell Cecil and Robert Loebs  Textbook of Medicine put it. There is no arrow of causality in the equation. It is equally possible without violating this fundamental truth for a change in energy stores the left side of the above equation to be the driving force in cause and effect some regulatory phenomenon could drive us to gain weight which would in turn cause a positive energy balance and thus overeating and or sedentary behavior. Either way the calories in will equal the calories out as they must but what is cause in one case is effect in the other.Taubes Gary . Good Calories Bad Calories Kindle Locations .

7496681,0,t1_d2ubmvn,No problem!Heres some icing on the cake for you specifically since I know you love this stuff gt  Increased fruit and vegetable consumption is associated with a decreased incidence of cardiovascular diseases cancer and other chronic diseases. The beneficial health effects of fruits and vegetables have been attributed in part to antioxidant flavonoids present in these foods. Large transient increases in the total antioxidant capacity of plasma have often been observed after the consumption of flavonoidrich foods by humans. These observations led to the hypothesis that dietary flavonoids play a significant role as antioxidants in vivo thereby reducing chronic disease risk. This notion however has been challenged recently by studies on the bioavailability of flavonoids which indicate that they reach only very low concentrations in human plasma after the consumption of flavonoidrich foods. In addition most flavonoids are extensively metabolized in vivo which can affect their antioxidant capacity. Furthermore fruits and vegetables contain many macro and micronutrients in addition to flavonoids that may directly or through their metabolism affect the total antioxidant capacity of plasma. In this article we critically review the published research in this field with the goal to assess the contribution of dietary flavonoids to the total antioxidant capacity of plasma in humans. We conclude that the large increase in plasma total antioxidant capacity observed after the consumption of flavonoidrich foods is not caused by the flavonoids themselves but is likely the consequence of increased uric acid levels.,ketoscience,d2uc0oq,3,t5_2v172

10378911,0,t3_5nwsis, is more true than .  Eating fat ensures you consume enough calories thus stopping your thyroid and metabolism tanking causing cortisol to trigger dragging up the blood sugar forcing fat gain.Eating fat make someone fat?  Many successful ketoers would disagree with that one lol,ketoscience,dckihz1,1,t5_2v172
10386081,0,t1_dcl91nv,Congratulations on the  ish days. Ive been in and out of ketosis many times in my  years in the lifestyle so I dont see it as a big deal. However if you have a personality that tends towards extremes I wouldnt want you spiraling out of control over an oral surgery. My concerns with patients and ketosis were in relation to severe pressure ulcers. Also if you have diabetes or prediabetes be aware that high blood sugar levels are very detrimental to healing. ,ketoscience,dclbrxv,3,t5_2v172

10585110,0,t3_5rggys,Ive seen enough of the Vegans trying to debunk the keto diet garbage on youtube already.  Ill base my points on what others have said in retaliation to the videoKidney stones are formed when there is a lack of K in the diet and K comes from fatty foods.  Vegans will try to argue that plants which contain K can be converted in the liver to K but there is no proof of this.  All studies done on this conversion were done on animals and animals have very different gut flora and enzymes most notably they actually have the enzyme to break down celluose.  In my experience many vegans inevitably experience either CVD or end up at a high risk for it.GI disturbances are almost strictly Stress Cortisol related.  Looking at the below comment of chinese ketogenic milk whatever that is and cookies.  There we go cookies sugar inflammation stress.Dehydration... i have never heard of someone being Dehydrated on the KD diet.  Funny thing along with hunger signals we also have thirst signals which are even stronger.  Who has ever actively avoided liquid when they were in dire thirst?.. NEXT!Higher cortisol on Keto perhaps but that is limited to the people who follow intermittent fasting when they shouldnt be and following a calorie restrictive diet ignoring hunger when they shouldnt be.  This isnt a keto problem this is a human problem into thinking calories matter over actual hunger not cravings but actual hunger.  With vegans though cortisol problems amplify due to the excess consumption of food humans simply dont have the enzymes to break down.  Internal inflammation causes stress.The main focal point in my experience with vegans downtalking any diets that involve meat are to do with what ultimately ends up with severe caloric restriction there I said it again.  People often for whatever reason when they switch to say a paleoprimalketo diet still insist on both trying to calorie restrict and eat too much protein with not enough fat leading to more caloric deprivationBut to completely switch gears here bad sleep can completely screw up everything.  A perfect diet wont outperform bad sleep.  Chronically sleep bad youre at risk for practically everything bad out there.,ketoscience,dd7rtsi,3,t5_2v172
10593419,0,t1_dd8hi6p,You might want to come up with some research that definitively shows that since Anthony Colpo will quote  isocaloric ward studies that show fat loss is the same whether the reduction is from carbs or fat when calories and protein are kept constant. ,ketoscience,dd8mny7,1,t5_2v172

10703424,0,t1_ddjy9aa,You are correct. Ketones are metabolized in the TCA cycle in mitrocondria Check out this figureI think the earlier comment was trying to say that you could modify the TCA cycle to prefer ketones over glucose for example.

10753111,0,t1_ddorc24,Yes protein has a very high insulin response especially protein powders.
