Bad team and out of his main position is not a good recipe for success especially for a young player.  How well he will adjust is a big unknown. Some very good players have struggled transitioning to MLS. However Im a bit optimistic that having Plata and Yura to help lead him on the attacking end of the ball and Beckerman behind him to help coach his positioning in the middle third will help him to grow throughout this coming season. ,ReAlSaltLake,dc2arm9,4,t5_2segw
