8114391,0,t3_4qd1nn,Some day soon I plan on making a video for this but will try to verbalize. The grip Picture the kubb as turned to look like a diamond.  I put the pad of my thumb on the top point along the edge of the kubb and my middle finger pad on the bottom point along the edge of the kubb.  For a right hander the point that  is to the right rests on the inside knuckle of where my pointer finger meets my hand.  If you can rotate comfortably at the wrist without feeling any strain anywhere else in your arm then you should have the right grip.  The other fingers just are used to help support the kubb.  The kubb should land with the front point at about  degrees on impact.  If it lands too flat it skips if it lands with too much angle it will tumble.  At first just try to throw it  meters away until you can control that throw.  As you get more comfortable with the throw work your way back to the m toss. Comfortable balanced stance.  I put my right front forward and left foot back with my feet shoulder length apart.  Several stances work but you should feel balanced.  Start with the arm and kubb pointing about  degrees in front of your body the arm swing should be an easy controlled motion with the release of the kubb just short of where your arm started.  I saw someone experimenting with putting their left arm out and using that as a guide for where to release they would adjust the arm until they determined the right release point.  Made sense to me. For a right hander I dont start to rotate the kubb counter clockwise until the kubb is on the forward swing near my hip.  Then I use the middle finger on the bottom to generate the spin should be a tight spiral.  My thumb on release is pointing straight to the ground.  Picture the spot where you want it to land and focus on that the whole way through the release. The typical arch on my throw doesnt go above shoulder height and is about chest high.  There is some advanced throws I make where I use more arc or throw very low but that is not my typical throws. Once you master being able to stop the kubb without much of a cut then for a cut that goes left to right just cock your wrist slightly to the left and do the exact same throw.  It doesnt take a severe cocking of the wrist to generate a cut.  For a right to left it is the exact same throw but you just cock the wrist slightly to the right.  ,kubb,d4s4q8a,4,t5_2tyxs
