It confused the ever loving shit out of me. I knew she was the strongest but she went way past fucking everything we had seen and it was fucking crazy. Also she was flying. The shit was that?,Freezing,cjoug1j,1,t5_2uupx

5224169,0,t3_3mk3hw,Season  It was the summer before senior year in highschool and I just quit my shit ass stupid fuck job so I had tons of free time and money. I was into anime for a while and saw most of what people were raving about so then I just started clicking random animes on animerebirth or something like that. This was the first show that actually caught my attention.Everything was right in my life. I was at peace with everything and then in the midst of my anime search I found something that didnt suck hardcore dick. This anime isnt something Id recommend to my friends but it will always have a place in my heart and remind of senior year summer.Season I ran into some really bad medical problems and was left on my bed unless I had to begrudgingly get up to go to the bathroom. So much was wrong in this stage in my life. But! With the free time I had I started studying Japanese which got me into MANY other languages gate way language for sure! which was very fun and I finally moved my pc into my room but before that. . . I torrented a shit ton. . . I mean. An. Ungodly. amount of movies and seasons of stuff because I was going to be stuck on my bed for a long time. When I searched Freezing to dl it the S came up and I was like !.!.So S reminds me of happiness in a really really dumb part of my life.TLDRThis show has been there in the worst of times for me and the best of times. Though I think it is really good I wouldnt recommend it to my friends or read the manga. HeheBoth seasons bring back a feeling of enjoyment enriched calmness to me. I can still remember vividly watching some of the series and the joy it brought me.,Freezing,cvfpcfs,5,t5_2uupx
