1738020,0,t1_cjy53vy,Such a stupid and ignorant response. Another regime apologist u guys seem to plop up like trolls everywhere. Im not even gonna acknowledge the bullshit part. And also I dont know about childhood obesity in Iran and how widespread it is but if you tell me that children of poor families in the south of Tehran or in poor districts of other cities and parts of of the country are overwhelmingly obese youre just trolling. However I can agree that many children in middleclass families and above might have that problem due to unhealthy food which is becoming a bigger and bigger problem in Iran with all the fast food places becoming more commonplace. ,iranpolitics,cjy8pai,1,t5_33239

2735317,0,t3_2rd3x3,As is to be expected the focus has been almost entirely on the financial costs of supporting Irans allies in the region.What is less discussed however is any potential net financial gains.I am aware that Oman is the primary conduit for off market Iranian oil trade. As part of the JPOA Oman was granted additional rights by the US to help trade Iranian oil.But much less is spoken about Iraq. Bear in mind that beyond the Iraqi state Irans strongest Iraqi allies are nestled in the south where the majority of Iraqs oil reserves lie. The potential for Iran to benefit from this is therefore huge.The only mention of Iranian profiteering in Iraq I have seen is by the New Yorker profile on Qassem Suleimani from last year. It statesgtAccording to the former senior intelligence officer Malikis government is presiding over a number of schemes amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars a year to help the Iranian regime outwit Western economic sanctions. A prominent Iraqi businessman told me that Iranianbacked agents regularly use the Iraqi banking system to undertake fraudulent transactions that allow them to sell Iraqi currency at a huge profit. If the banks refuse they are shut down by the government he said.gtThe other main source of revenue for the Iranians is oil officials say Malikis government sets aside the equivalent of two hundred thousand barrels of oil a dayabout twenty million dollars worth at current pricesand sends the money to Suleimani.This is something I would like to know more about.,iranpolitics,cnezrw0,1,t5_33239
