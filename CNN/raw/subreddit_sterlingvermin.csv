8552053,0,t1_d6adfiw,Yeah it doesnt fix all of the weird hiccups created by the Gritty Realism variant but its not really intended to either. Sort of designed to create a middle ground. I think with the spellcaster recovery resting trait you can kind of fudge it since it will allow additional opportunities to cast those spells meant to last until your next long rest. Alternatively an Idle Talent that extends the duration of mage armor to  days might work.,sterlingvermin,d6akvsb,2,t5_3byy2
