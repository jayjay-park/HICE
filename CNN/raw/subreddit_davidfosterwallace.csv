21253,0,t3_1ubi3a,Nobody here really wanted to talk about DFWs instrumentalizing and occasionally violent treatment of women in his private life but I think its worth talking about and Im interested in the way the women in his real life were reflected in the female characters in Infinite Jest.,davidfosterwallace,cegupl2,4,t5_2s6a8

2443449,0,t3_2nfi0g,Dave Eggers hasnt been mentioned maybe because he is too obvious a comparison. A Heartbreaking Work...is the most DFW of his books but he writes incredibly well across a wide range of styles. I loved The Circle  it was like a classic Crichtonstyle airport thriller.Id also throw Jonathan Lethems Fortress of Solitude Jeffrey Eugenides Middlesex and Paul Austers The New York Trilogy at anyone who enjoys Wallaces work.,davidfosterwallace,cmdpqyl,2,t5_2s6a8

8310021,0,t3_4tajto,The book Elegant Complexity by Greg Carlisle goes into this a bit.  Its about the themes and related stories of Infinite Jest so youll probably find some useful information there.  ,davidfosterwallace,d5gb5dc,1,t5_2s6a8
