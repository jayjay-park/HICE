867037,0,t3_240ib4,Ill post another oneSo Im younger in this one Im gonna say ish and Im in my old bedroom again though this time later in the evening rather than at night.  We were waiting for my aunt and uncles visit and I was cleaning my room up they were going to sleep in my room. I remember getting hot so I took my shirt off and sat down next to my bed and then it gets weird at least for me. I then wake up in my sisters room under blankets like I had just fallen asleep in my room and they carried me in there. However I have these weird memories in the back of my mind like screamingkicking at people and just being psychotic at anyone who tried to get me out the room. It still freaks me out to this day as Id never experienced anything like that before or anything like that since and no one ever said anything about it to me so maybe it is just a false memory. But there is always this niggling feeling in the back of my head that it actually happened.,SyndicationStation,ch2u54u,1,t5_30w38
1051053,0,t3_260bwk,One thing thats been nagging me lately that really stood out in this episode is that Mike wants to stop saying you guys because its condescending. But you know what? Its way more condescending to assume that people younger than him dont know about the Simpsons the USSR or where fossil fuels come from. By the way Mike coal and oil come from dead plant life and algae not dinosaurs. ,SyndicationStation,chnrclc,3,t5_30w38

1690434,0,t1_cjs0g8y,Static shock is a fucking great DC show as well it was created by Dwayne McDuffie who wrote a bunch of great JL and JLU episodes . Along the same vain as static was Bruce Timms batman beyond a lot of people had their criticisms for it but I liked the tone that came when a new person took up the mantle of batman .,SyndicationStation,cjs8ri9,2,t5_30w38
