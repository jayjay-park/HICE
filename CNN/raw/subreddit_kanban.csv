7106388,0,t3_4cr7jg,HelloI have no experience with machinery nor with LeanKit but Id like to help with your Kanban board. Im using Kanban in a software company. A good starting point is to team up with a few guys who know how your manufacturing pipeline or parts of it look like. Even if you know the whole process yourself multiple people give you multiple views on the process. We sat down for a few hours and created a draft Kanban system on a white board. After the meeting I implemented the kanban system in our tool.The first thing we did was to draw a stakeholder diagram and defined on what we want to visualize. In our case it was simply the developer teams and the creation of software. We could have included sales and their interaction with customers or we could have included our operations team who finally deliver software to the customer.Once we knew what we want to visualize we searched for the entry and exit criteria. How and when does an item enter the board? How and when does an item exit the board?This created the simplest form of a board todo doing doneThe next step was to agree on the detail.  Which steps do you want to measure and analyze?Can you clearly define entry and exit criteria for each column? Write down a definition of done?And also Who will move items from column to column? Can it be automated?Be happy with what you get. We have monthly Kanban system retrospective meetings where we present measurements and talk about changes to the process andor changes to the Kanban board.A Kanban system is by definition not set in stone. You may change read improve it any time Our board has basically the following columns todo a list of open work items created by stakeholders selected a short list of work items filled by our stakeholders and ordered by priority develop items being worked on. we always take the top item from selected quality assurance review and testing of finished work items done item is ready for deliveryHope this helps. If you need more concrete answers Id need concrete information about your manufacturing pipeline and processes.Kind regards.,kanban,d1lvtfe,2,t5_2rsbg
