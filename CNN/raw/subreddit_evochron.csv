6532653,0,t1_czv0shn,I was having trouble locating hightech goods too until I hit one of the more populated multiplayer servers. I prefer DarkStar at present but I havent really run into a bad server yet peoplewise.Anyway I was able to find quite a bit of the stuff I was lacking  specialty mining beams Mantis drives build and deploy constructors and all kinds of the more powerful base weapons. I havent found a Walker yet but that may be a blueprint thing. Information on the Walker is scarce.But if youre having trouble finding hightech stuff Id definitely suggest hitting up one of the public servers and taking a peek at a highrated tech system there. If you go DarkStar you may have better luck as Alliance than Fed  lots of ALC guys on that server. You can switch faction affiliation before entering multiplayer by selecting Alliance or Federation in the multiplayer connect box on the games opening screen.EDIT Punctuation,evochron,czv115j,2,t5_2tf1t
