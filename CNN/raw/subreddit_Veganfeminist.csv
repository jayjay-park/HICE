6870183,0,t3_49ulji,I read an article recently unfortunately i couldnt find it to source that was talking about the vegan activist community and its approach to activism particularly DxE style. It went on to say how the approach of being aggressive and yelling shouting and using megaphones in public can cause a lot of stress on those with PTSD anxiety disorders and a few other mental health issues. I think its important to remember this when one is choosing to engage in activism. ,Veganfeminist,d0v1oo4,7,t5_3cv39

7233670,0,t3_4ei83j,It really sucks for the good people who worked on this campaign to share branding with the same organization that will inevitably pull many more racist sexist and offensive stunts in the name of animal liberation. Until PETA actually changes campaigns like this earn no respect from me. Like you cant just slap a couple feminist slogans on some stickers as long as your organization continues to promote the exact opposite. Like its literally appropriating feminism.,Veganfeminist,d20eywh,9,t5_3cv39
