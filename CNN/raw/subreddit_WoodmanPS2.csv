193155,0,t1_cf06hhn,Yeah if every fight I ever got into was nothing but MAXes vs. MAXes I could sympathise with you. But theyre not. The only times I see MAX crashes are when its absolutely necessary to take the base otherwise its maybe one in every  people. Theyre not all anybody uses and there are so many infantry counters to them its silly.gt This doesnt mean anything and could be apply to absolutely everything in the game depending on your point of viewBollocks. It doesnt apply to anything in the game. I can play any aspect I want at any time. This doesnt mean anything is just a copout excuse. It doesnt matter what your point of view is if I want an aircraft I grab one. If I want a tank I grab one.Everyones obsessed over this asinine idea of making things valuable. As if making it even harder to pull armour aircraft or resourcecost infantry gear will improve the game when thats what you need to win right now. In a teambased game where you need every class and combined arms to win there shouldnt be a million barriers to pulling something people should just pull whats needed right now.And I hate the idea of having to grind up multiple characters just to try the various aspects of the game or just to get what we need right now. If Id be logging off and back on just to switch from MAX to tank theres no improvement over the current situation youre just making it more of a pain in the arse for me.,WoodmanPS2,cf0fvjp,1,t5_2wjus
200497,0,t1_cf15jvm,How is charge related to this? We are talking about the effective range of max weapons here. Sure its good for running away but using it to close in on an enemy only works when there is onea couple of them. Any more and it gets you killed. Listen Im sorry you got the short end of the stick in regards to your max unit with the exception of pounders and previously fractures. This does not change the fact that NC should get a medium range weapon other than slugs and for that the other factions should get something equally effective in extreme cqc.,WoodmanPS2,cf1a1pg,1,t5_2wjus

323447,0,t3_1xsk11,Yes dont use burst weapons! With one slight exception the SABR all burst and semiauto weapons are significantly worse than their full auto counterparts. Currently there is no good reason to take this kind of weapons other than masochism. But if youre a Auraxium junkie use a xx scope no NV as it has sway forgrip and stay away from the frontlines. Make sure you always have a meatshield in front. Avoid CQB battles like the plague.Try to pick your targets preferably injured ones and aim for the upper torso so that the nd or rd shot lands on the head.Dont spam the trigger and try to wait for the recoil to compensate itself. Never tap more than  times as it will greatly affect your accuracy.High velocity is not recommended as it increases your recoil while decreasing your accuracy overall.Have patience and try to choose your engagements !

419819,0,t1_cfo6kp3,I have other factions I took a long break from TR woodman play to play on waterson NC before and after the last balance build and as such I disagree.the NC weapon where goodish in the past but if you werent ADS with most you where dead after the balance update you could hip fire nc weapons with relaitive effiecincy.The PU updates also help out NC players very well as they could aim better. TR weapons on the other hand got nerfed in hip fire and then when you aimed down sights you got to watch the glory of stupidly high COF. A classic weapon to see how bad the TR have it is the T AMC it seam like a great ADS weapon to the TR untill you use the AX and then your realise what a heap of shit your holding AMC has to deal with large COF and random recoil direction angles with our standard  bullets where as the AX has small COF and no random recoil angles hits like a truck and can be hip fired with ease you dont even need the forward grip or compesser because its a simple pull down on mouse to compensate. Just to make matter worse when you compare the TAMC to the NSC you see that TR have worse aim slower movment slow reload RNG recoil only advanatage is  bullets and slightly faster vel which makes little to no difference. And there are other NS minus theme throught out the tr weapons system. Vulcan G crap battlisk Striker crap Annihilator Maruder crap fury.The harraser All of TR ES weapons where close range where the damage increases take into account. As weapons such as the enforcerPPA where ranged and as such where bearly effected by the nerf. The problem most people have is when they jump faction and say them weapons are so powerful is they play those weapons for kills. they dont try to take bases or defend with the full wait of the enemy empire come to bear they just get kills of some clueless enemys,WoodmanPS2,cfoa31z,3,t5_2wjus

1520216,0,t1_cj6tn98,Well not everybody posts but many share the scepticism regarding this issue. As far as I can see this mergersmash already poisons the community beginning with drama on Miller etc. I like that there is something at stake i dislike that there is so much at stake. As one of the outfitleaders of an outfit with  dedicated players I just see much negative input regarding this issue. We will fight we will give you a nice promotion because in the end we like the game but we dont feel our concerns are really discussed. If you are concerned that you havent seen  opinions of the population regarding this issue we could also get rid of things like server representatives because following your logic which can be valid from another point of view they are not representing the server. Regarding the possible negative impacts On one site we could hurt the epeenvalue of some guys on the other hampering the integration of a whole server. We will see how that will work out. ,WoodmanPS2,cj6u44y,1,t5_2wjus

1531585,0,t1_cj7uyjn,I was also hoping for a mirrored match dont really understand why the faction choice had to be decided by a coin toss this time. Im guessing Miller won the toss and chose NC?

1553236,0,t1_cjaxtrb,Sry I lost it. What are now real fights? Are we talking about fights for the safety of your life? If no I direct you to my previous comment Nothing is important or everything can be important. Since you live in Germany i believe   of your choices or fights in life consist of vanity and not the proper necessity to actually hold your organism at life. Yes even your fight for a job to bring more luxury goods home are all expression of that one thing Vanity. It is just a question how much importance you give to every thing as I said previously. If you talk to an oldschool hippy from  who remained true he would laugh at things we consider important. As I said we wont come together in this matter because our aesthetic preferences are different. ,WoodmanPS2,cjayziu,1,t5_2wjus
