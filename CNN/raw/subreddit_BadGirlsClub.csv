7246402,0,t1_d21tzfn, right. I liked Olivia and Diamond the most but they turned out to be just as fake as the rest. Jaymee and Jasmyn  brought some hype and even though they stand up.for themselves theyre not as crazy as I would like. Hopefully it gets better.. ,BadGirlsClub,d21v4j3,3,t5_2tdyx

11466539,0,t1_dfvosjx,More or less lol That shit is sooo dumb. She got mad that Bri was crying about missing her friends back home and key didnt feel like Bri had a right to be sad. Apparently if you want to be upset or sad key must sign some papers giving you approval n shit unless you wanna get choked lmao. I hope Bri beats the crap out of her I am so tired of this little girl I swear. Im pissed too cuz in their second fight it from the previews it looked like Key might get the best of Bri  I dont like Bri too much but bri gt key. ,BadGirlsClub,dfvq4rr,1,t5_2tdyx
