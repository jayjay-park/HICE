1262749,0,t3_26y4xk,Dunno if this thread is still hot but I have to share this story.I work at a brewery that also does craft cocktails. I can cop to my ignorance and say that because Ive never worked at a Bud and shots place I dont know a lot of modern shots and cocktails like Greyhounds Black Russians Chocolate Martinis etc. However I can do about  cocktails without ever touching a soda gun. So what Im trying to say is at the bar I work at I cant make a rum and coke but I can do a lot.Its late on a Tuesday and this woman walks in with her friend both of whom have just gotten off of work. As Im walking over one woman notices that I have Creme de Violette behind the bar a cheap one but I use it mostly for color and for flavor I have a better one in my well. Woman I see you have Creme de Violette! Can you make me a WaterLily?Me Im sorry Im not familiar with that drink but if you know how to make it I can try to whip it up for you.Woman Oh its okay we just made it up tonight! Proudly giggles Its equal parts gin dry vermouth grand marnier st germaine creme de violette and something else sweet and dumb to mix with all the other conflicting flavors already in the drink shaken over ice.So mix her this horrible concoction of teethrotting sweetness because they seem to be fellow bartenders and Im bored. The shit of it all is why the fuck they walk into a bar asking for a cocktail that they made up hours before but act like its something that should be common knowledge? Just to show off? Fuck off.Anyway I brought her the drink its sweet as a sugardipped Gobstopper floral in four different ways and has this pinkorange haziness to it. She takes one sip and is visually taken aback by its sweetness and calls me over a minute later saying I did it all wrong and this isnt even the right color its supposed to be bright purple.Well dumbass if youre trying to show off your cocktail skills dont walk in here like you have a muddler up your ass and ask for a cocktail that is fucking awful and didnt fucking exist two hours ago then complain because I used a higher quality violet liqueur in hopes of saving your bullshit drink from the brink of putting someone in a sugar comaI explained the reason behind the color but they still rejected the drink asked for the lightest sweetest beer we carried and left .,bartenderstories,cibob7o,7,t5_2ybpv
