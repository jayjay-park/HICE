9351700,0,t1_d9153ri,They have said disparaging things about the modding community and about modders in general. They have also just generally toned down the number of options and strategic choices in the game. I think a great example is the inability to construct roads in Rome II. Rome the faction should have had a great advantage because of the good and fair cost roads you could build would let you travel much faster. It may seem like one small oversight but when you have dozens of them hindering you at once the games take on a different feel. Plus theres the transition to paid DLC and incomplete and poorly supported games. ,CrackWatch,d91e8zf,1,t5_3gnpj

9454102,0,t1_d9ecdx8,Of course most costumers dont care about it or are not well informed about it. But the ones that are aware act as advocates for CDPR and generate a lot of interest in their products. That leads to a lot of awesome PR for free.Would you have cared about the Witcher  if people didnt praise it? Because although we can only conjecture I believe you wouldnt care most wouldnt for sure. And would you like it if it were to be released with Denuvo and get the same crashes as Lords of the Fallen did when it was released? Of course you wouldnt. CDPR is only the company it is today because of their aproach to the market. You can speculate all you want but good games suffered from DRM and other games sold like cookies with or without DRM. GTA V is on Steams best sellers for over a year and half despite it being cracked. The DRM didnt secure the sales the game did.

9821989,0,t1_danln69,The last point I agree on. COD  Ass Creed and some other big shot AAA games are a prime example of that. Me personally I dont even bother pirating those games let alone buy them. But I do buy games that I personally feel are worth the money and I can get enjoyment out of those games. A games worth varies from person to person. Theres no universal This game is worth it and that game is not kind of deal. Some people will buy games like Ride To Hell Retribution and tell everyone that game is worth the money. Others will say Witcher  is worth the money. Can we say the former person is wrong and the latter is right? Not really. It all comes down to their personal taste their financial situation and other variables.Gaming industry has taken a dive for the worst with all these preorder bonuses day one DLCs nickel and dime microtransactions optimization issues ridiculous season pass prices and more. Theres no point being loyal to any companies cause at the end of they day theyre running a business as youve said. There are fanboys wholl defend these kinds of shady business practices to no end and at the end of the day it hurts the gaming industry and more importantly the customers  gamers the most.But there are some games that stands out and gives player a gaming experience worth having. Games like Deus Ex MD  Dishonored  etc. Sure they have some optimization issues but the games themselves are awsm. And the devs have been supporting the game with post release patches that are ironing out these issues Even though i wouldve liked for them to do that BEFORE the games release but yea...Of course you might think differently but thats okay. We all have our own opinions and preferences. But to me I really enjoyed playing games like Deus Ex MD  Dishonored   Titanfall   Doom  Titalfall  and Doom are very well optimized mind you and to me i think theyre worth the money.,CrackWatch,dantp6i,1,t5_3gnpj

Theres no solid proof that DRM works to its goal efficiently to make a difference and there is no solid proof against DRMs effectiveness so according to the burden of proof concept in logic DRM shouldnt even exist... yet it does thanks to your mentality and the publishers mentality as well.

10577310,0,t3_5rg5nh,I was sure he will delete it here is what he wrote uopas     gt Denuvo works by placing hidden traps inside the game itself. The traps could be placed on a tree model a specific loading screen protocol a character model a piece of graphic texture the trigger of a dialogue fast travel trigger etc. etc.gt gt Basically the bigger a game is in terms of overall dimension not just file size the harder it is to crack.gt gt RE is very special. Pretty much EVERYTHING in this game happen in a SINGLE SMALL HOUSE with very FEW characters. No fast travel lack of loading screens lack of characters BASICALLY THIS GAME IS VERY SMALL in terms of dimension.gt gt Open world games are much harder to crack because there are so many possibilities. Thats why open world games takes months and some like Just Cause  still not cracked.gt gt Rise of Tomb Raider was first cracked because it is not a truly open world game still more of an adventure game that is quite linear. So while it is a big game it takes less effort than true open world games. Doom was not open world at all and got cracked.gt gt Far cry primal brought a lot of elements including the whole map from Far cry  so while its open world it still got cracked but it took CPY a lot longer.gt gt Basically Resident Evil  being a HIGH PROFILE game is VERY SMALL in dimension this is why it got cracked so fast. It caught CPY attention coz its AAA game CPY wants the fame and its an easy prey.gt gt But guess what this wont happen again. Denuvo team has learned from this and future protection will be much stronger. First of all the team will cooperate more closely with game developers in order to plant more hidden traps. Second of all word is CAPCOM is furious and future games will be further fortified with another hidden layer of protection and some even with always online protection.gt gt So get ready the upcoming games will still have the usual version so they will be cracked in a couple months unless they are also smalldimension game like RE but the NEW GAMES IN DEVELOPMENT STAGE will be FULLY FORTIFIED and they gonna take YEARS to crack if not more basically no longer worth the effort.gt gt As I always says in the game of encryption vs decryption the former always wins at the end.

11306754,0,t1_dfdd1wk,the fact is this game can be had dirt cheap and still looks and plays well. the remaster is just some textures upgraded and it being ported to UE.  i would gladly pay   bucks for this but no more.  plus its a kick in the face for the people that already own it and want to upgrade. metro  and last light did the the upgrade for their remux copies. they had a  deal for people that already owned it and it was well worth the buy why i bought it  This is just a plain cash grab for console plebs that want to play it on ps or xbox one being that it was only on last gen as for pc people. were not stupid. you can pull that shit and expect us to pay  bucks on something most people already own. ,CrackWatch,dfdlqk4,4,t5_3gnpj

The English voice acting is fine as well. At least by Mass Effect standards. The franchise has never had good voice acting. Same with the dialogue. Its on par with the original ME trilogy. That being said it does get better after the first half hour on the Nexus where the hate circlejerk gets all of their scenes. The UI isnt terrible by any standard outside of the preteen pcmr circlejerk. Could it be better? Absolutely. I agree with the point on AI. The  meter umbilical cord they have attached to Ryder gets old. But this is another Mass Effect thing. The trilogy squad members did the same thing. I believe his last point is referring to how the trilogy let players pause time and tell a squad member to use a specific power.,CrackWatch,dfs3pb6,-2,t5_3gnpj

Before the menu there was just triggers which were quite easy for him. If you know anything about reversing VMs are very hard to bypass and there are very few methods to use to bypass them.
