221204,0,t1_cf3m5jk,As the volume of daily Bitcoin transactions was overtaken WesternUnion and is approaching that  of PayPal PayPal is understandably feeling threatened by Bitcoin so they banned  Bitcoin  trading through PayPal.  Their attitude toward altcoins is not clear at first some Quark sellers reported that their eBay listings were being deleted and then eBay parent company of PayPal came out with the statement that at least in the eBay UK they will be allowing cryptocurrency sales. So you can purchase QRK on eBay via PayPal but that would be way over the market value because the sellers have to account for their own risk factor.Im in the UK. The way that I have been purchasing my QRK is the following go to www.localbitcoins.com and buy some BTC from someone Its trustworthy. Its based on rating system like eBay. I had more than  transactions and never been scammed.  Then move your BTC from localbitcoins wallet into Cryptsy.comand buy QRK there and then move it to your computers wallet.,QuarkCoin,cf3n2me,0,t5_2y6dy

Most of those silly shibes dont even understand what  inflation means.Im not sure if Doge brings good exposure to cryptos.  To others it just confirms that all cryptos are funnymoney that should not be taken seriously.  In other words yes  they bring exposure and short laughs but do they bring converts and do they instil trust in this new kind of monetary system?   What I know for sure Dogecoin brings is a lot of illwishing arrogant trolls.  Anyway itll all be over soon for the shibes  their numbers dont tally.

384684,0,t1_cfkmcl9,Cheers mate!  I used Billyticious the other day to buy QRK  just as a test and it was an amazingly fast and smooth transaction.  The whole process took less than  minutes and most of that time was me logging into my online banking and authorising the transaction.Quark need more sellers in the UK.  It turns out that UK is the rd country in the world by QRK popularity!  Whenever people ask me where to buy QRK I now direct them to www.Bittylicious.com    Who knows maybe in time QRK could become an everyday currency for Brits.  Good thing is that unlike Russia or other countries Britain doesnt ban complementary currencies  people can use whatever they want as a medium of exchange as long as they pay their taxes.  Like for instance Bristol has the Bristol Pound etc,QuarkCoin,cfkmz03,1,t5_2y6dy
416992,0,t1_cfndd1a,HiThe answer is yesbut it is not set in stone and highly debatable on a theoretical level.The problem is best visualised by this graph   and coupled with the fact that Quark block reward has halved for the last time and is now QRK per block  yes wehave finally entered the socalled inflationary period.  I have had numerous long discussions about this with another user called Kooooj you can google and read  its several long debates who according to his calculations predicted that Quark Networks hash rate would suddenly collapse when the block reward would become  QRK. Not surprisinglyhe too had an agenda he was advocating that everyone should sell their Quarks causing a price collapse and stop mining it and switch to Primecoin instead.  The doomsday that he so eagerly anticipated never came even with block reward at  QRK  Quark network hashrate is still  times higher than it was in November or anytime before that.My main counterargument to Koooj was that the original assumption in Satoshi Nakamotos original White Paper is based on a very oversimplified rational theory model that presupposes that mining and attacking can be motivated only by monetary profit.  I argued that attacks could be motivated by other reasons e.g. political or ideological and similarly the miners could still be motivated to mine for other reasons e.g. political ideological wanting to protect their investment or simply by the willingness to contribute some of their CPU power to a good cause just like many people myself included had once contributed a fraction of their CPU power to NASA for the SETI program.  Whats more is that I challenged the ethics of the model of distribution through mining  Satoshi Nakamoto did not foresee GPU mining ASIC mining or industrial mining. Mining I argued should not be seen as a getrichquick scheme which it has become for those people stuffing their garages with GPU rigs and mining every shitcoin that comes out every day before moving to the next coin.  Such centralisation perverts the original intent of mining which was about protecting the network and a fair and moreorless equal initial distribution of coins.  And I think Nakamoto would fully agree with me.  So I proposed that mining should be seen not as a forprofit activity but as a voluntary act of giving something back to Quark or any other coin for the privilege of being able to send money from anywhere anytime from any device to anywhere on the planet in just  seconds. Wauw! Its a small price to pay if you ask me and its not mandatory.    What is the risk of low hashrate?  Someone could buy or rent a LOT of servers and do a bruteforce  attack on Quark Network thus creating an opportunity to doublespend for  seconds. That being said Quark is a CPU coin! It is ASIC resistant so it does not need to waste electricity like Bitcoin and protect that network with Petahashes of mining power although if Quark had hundreads of millions of users around the globe Quark Network would indeed be in petahashes.  Alsobecause of this brute force attack cannot be carried out by ASICs  one would need to rent thousands of very powerful serves.Is the low hashrate a concern? Yes it is  it should always be a concern for any coin. Even Bitcoin Network that is more powerful than  most powerful supercomputers in the world combined is still concerned about quantum computing just as its innercircle experts are concerned over the security of SHA.  So how can the hashrate be increased?  I as well as many others have proposed a Wallet. which will have a mining tab and will let anyone contribute  or more of their CPU power to mining Quark by default people can disable mining if they wish.  The Wallet miner will be connected by default to the official QF Pool.  Such approach is in accordance with the alternative ethical stance that I described above.  And the userinterface is proposed to be so simple  that even my grandmas  year old sister would be able to mine.  The other proposal which I do not support is to introduce transaction fees and thus to give professional miners more profit incentive to mine Quark.  I personally believe that Quark transactions should remain . unlike Bitcoins .Another issue that trolls are pushing is that the new system of checkpoints inside Quark is insufficient measure of security. Again this is not a truth that is set in stone and is very much debatable as even Bitcoin uses it for its security.  I hope I explained the issues in a nutshell. ,QuarkCoin,cfnzjpp,2,t5_2y6dy

1585331,0,t1_cjezftg, years ago in Moscow there was qiute a massive demonstrations. They was triggered by a very questionable elections when proputin political party United Russia experience nearlydefeat. There were strong rumors that it was actually defeated but saved by fraud and manipulations. Obvious prowestern forces rided this wave and all this crap ended by clashes and arrests.Later it was revealed that all of these was financed by foreign NGOs and coplicated schemes with use of digital payment processors like misterious massive donations to political parties millions transactions on the same sum. So the next year a whole row of new antiterrorist laws was introduced. A severe restriction of ngos activity a total taboo on anonimous digital transactions through conventional digital money.So an oppressive ban on cryptocurrencies is a lpgical next step. The kremlin fears that new Ukrainestyle uprising will be anonimously financed with them. Losing an emerging and not so much by quantaties market is far less evil than risk of losing power and integrity.Also we have a tax raise soon.,QuarkCoin,cjf04i5,1,t5_2y6dy
