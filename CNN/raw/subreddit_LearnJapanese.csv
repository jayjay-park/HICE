52540,0,t1_ceke9j4,Technically speaking there is quite a while where you could suddenly reveal that you are talking about the actions of someone else. This goes against the language use norms but is in itself not grammatically incorrect. The point is the information is being provided by cultural and social structures not the language itself. So its perfectly fair to say the language is not information dense it really isnt since language is not the only method of communication.I agree that its over reaching to conclude that they talk faster because of this but the basic idea that the Japanese language is not information dense looks sound. If you combine this with the observation that other low density languages tend to be spoken faster as well it makes for an interesting hypothesis.,LearnJapanese,cekeu6k,2,t5_2qyls

I think this works for a few reasons... It gives us relevant and thus memorable material to work with.  We have our own internal dialogue for how we express what has happened to us and actively trying to link this to Japanese expression helps point out areas where we need the most help. Most of us with a little bit of knowledge understand basic syntax and theres a serious effort and perspective switch to get over the sophomore slump in language learning. To the man with a hammer every problem looks like a nail which in the case means that weve learned how to link subject objects verbs etc which is limiting as we try to fit everything to an X  Y  paradigm which is how were taught to break down the information. We tend to reduce to this because its all we know but if were trying to learn new methods of expression we have to go beyond this. Youll notice yourself finding new information or thoughts guide your research if instead of trying to do Japanese while youre thinking about the sentence to first articulate what you want to say with as much liberal english as you can and then trying to fit it to that... if this makes sense. ,LearnJapanese,ceugvao,2,t5_2qyls

Mainly I can much more easily remember Kanji from the keyword than I was ever able to with Wanikani.Some times I remember the Kanji because the keyword reminds me of the stroke order and constituent parts radicals so drawing the Kanji is basically immediate. With the Wanikani method you only learn the constituent parts though you dont have to which means you cant easily put them together. Also you never practice KeywordgtKanji which becomes helpful when you want to memorize vocabulary with keywords. Ive been having a consistent  error rate with Anki and this method and I am rarely able to complete all reviews every day so many Kanji are only reviewed later than they should. With Wanikani and reviewing every day I had a gt error rate.But yeah thats me.

Tae Kims guide doesnt use a lot of vocabulary and includes a vocab list at the start of every section. You could probably go through the basic amp essential grammar sections in less than two weeks.Biggest advantage While learning vocab you can now follow and learn from the example sentences. Heres the simplest example I could find fg fg fg  He put the notebook in his bag. You notice that  indicates an indirect object like a target and  a direct object like something being used. So even if youve never seen  and  before you can deduce from the translation or just the corek image that  is being put somewhere and is therefore the notebook and  must be the satchelbriefcase he shoved it into. Youll also notice the verb form being used and what kind of verb it is.Personally this makes Anki a lot more fun for me now than it used to be when I couldnt follow anything.Of course youll still learn vocabulary whether you know the grammar or not.

I do like it and the article brings up a lot of points that I agree with. As an aid for learning though as opposed to a tool for learning I would rather suggest drama shows instead of entertainment shows. Dramas often have clear speech and normal speech patterns whereas entertainment shows can have very fast speech dialects and slang together with injokes and hard to understand puns. Entertainment shows are still good for listening practice of course and part of why I like them is I dont need to understand everything to enjoy it.If you like Japanese TV or if you just want to check it out you are very welcome to join us in rJTV!,LearnJapanese,cjud59w,2,t5_2qyls

You can get that anywhere. If I was in Japan I certainly wouldnt be taking a class unless I thought it was going to help me progress in leaps and bounds. By all means study Genki  whatever in your spare time or go to classes if these things are useful  but dont let your studies end there.

Of course grammar and vocabulary are sort of independent but theres no point in learning complex words for highbrow topics before youre able to use basic tenses and so on. At the same time it helps to have at least a small working vocabulary while youre learning grammar theres equally no point in learning complex abstract structures when you dont have the words to put in them and it helps you practise the structures if you can talk about a nontrivial number of things. Honestly I think textbooks strike a nice balance for most people.

It is sold as immersion but this is only true in as far as they have saved themselves time and money by not providing translations between multiple languages having everything in the course in the target language.

Primitives are the small recurring pieces in each kanji e.g.  is made of a  primitive and a  primitive or something. And neither of these has anything to do with kanji meanings by the way. Most kanji dont have meanings.

Of course I still type using kanji on my phone or computer. Now that Ive built up a halfdecent vocabulary Ive found myself suffering from the lack of writing ability a bit more. I cant confidently write even some very common and fairly simple kanji Fairly often when drilling vocabulary I will have to look at similar looking kanji sidebyside in order to find some way to tell them apart.  So I have begun learning to write individual kanji starting with the kanji taught in grade  in Japan.

You do need to have some foundation in the language before you start getting vocab this way though as otherwise you will need to add every single word and you will have a hard time understanding the example sentences you dig up.For reviewing and I do mean reviewing not learning anki is pretty great.

3906865,0,t1_cqxx9bb,So in English we may say I went to the park then I went to the beach then I went to eat then I went home and it sounds pretty natural in a casual conversationy sort of way. Unfortunately in Japanese if you constantly say And so on you sound very weird and unnatural. This is due to how  functions as a topic marker. Lets take my example I gave above and translate it navely then do a couple of better ones.Nave translationThis is a direct translation of the English example I gave above. Just reading it out loud it should sound a little strange even ignoring the overuse of . Why do you need to say  in all these sentences? The answer is you dont because it is clearly obvious that youre still talking about yourself. So heres a better translationThis sentence sounds closer to being natural sounding but we can still do better with cutting down the word bloat. We can get rid of every  with the use of formAnd this is the most basic albeit robotic translation of the example sentence. Now with all the bloat gone you can add a bunch of descriptive language where  was if you want to sound fluent or if youre just literally listing things you did today or yesterday or whatever then this is still fine.So now that we know how to cut down and condense our information pinpointing and removing redundant usage of the subject bloat when DO we use ?We use  when the main topic of what youre talking about changes. Heres an example of a changing topic of discussionAB.Aand so onNotice in the third line of the conversation As reply to Bs question he says  and then in the next sentence when hes done talking about the  he switches the topic back to him with . If we want to get really nitpicky the context of the conversation was STILL enough to omit the  here but it is still a more acceptable usage.Perhaps the best way of understanding this concept of omitting subjects is best experienced through well experience. It comes really naturally in a why would I even have to mention Im still talking about me? Its obvious! sort of way.Hopefully this helped clear up a tiny bit of your confusion about the subject. Im not a teacher so I dont know how easy to understand or not my explanations are but I hope this is useful to you.,LearnJapanese,cr1m85f,3,t5_2qyls

A voiced sound is effectively the same base sound as an unvoiced one  your lips mouth and tongue make the same shapes with the only difference being that you vibrate your vocal chords when making it. Only consonants can have voiced and unvoiced versions as vowel sounds are always voiced.Rendaku in Japanese is the process by which unvoiced consonants can become voiced consonants when they are in the noninitial position in a compound word. Therefore  will be  when it is at the beginning of a word and then sometimes  when it is not.This phenomenon is common in Japanese here are a couple more examples sometimes     letter    To address your question specifically Rendaku unfortunately doesnt always happen theres no hard grammatical rule that defines it. There are factors which can block it but not guaranteed factors which mandate it. That rendaku happens at all is a phenomenon of natural language. If for example you imagine that  was orignally pronounced  and you try saying the word aloud over and over again it starts feeling easier to let the sounds blur into one another and become  and its through this kind of tendency in human speech to adapt over time to whatever is easiest and most pleasing to say that the changes associated with rendaku occur.Due to this rendaku is more prevalent in words which are commonly spoken and less so in words which are rarer or those which were only more recently incorporated into the language.You can read a wikipedia article which might provide more insight on rendaku wikipedia,LearnJapanese,cr8puvp,2,t5_2qyls

In theory you could just use Tae Kims guide but its very terse to to the point where would need to be exceedingly well organized and very careful about making your own practice exercises and ideally having someone else check them for you for this to actually work.The Dictionary of Japanese Grammar series is intended as a reference and not as a textbook. It is very good for explaining the subtleties of things like the different conditional forms but you will have to actually study the basic grammar first.Substituting different words in sentences isnt a bad idea but because of how Japanese grammar works theres a limit to how much mileage you can get out of just sticking different nouns in since nothing else will change.

4482759,0,t3_3chhn1,Like others have said its fairly arbitrary. For normal words its easy enough to simply go by individual vocabulary which is memorizable with time and effort. Although in almost every nonpropernoun context it will take one of the standard kunyomi or onyomi forms except in the few unique cases where the reading has nothing to do with the kanji themselves. Proper names however are a whole different beast. But lets think about English names for a second  those can be pretty damn arbitrary as well. For instance how do you pronounce Worcestershire? Certainly not warchestershire like any sane person would expect no its warstersure. This is but a tame example of such naming weirdness. Japanese is especially weird because unlike most other languages that use Chinese ideographs they can have many different readings and the readings themselves can actually impact the meaning and usage of a character though to be fair the vast majority of these little oddities in nanori can be traced back to historical and regional differences. While historically the Japanese government have had considerably deep rules as to what and how kanji can be used in names you can really easily just throw kanji together to create any name youd like and in fact they dont even really have to follow any reading conventions whatsoever. This is why you will almost always see the reading of a name given in contexts where the name is not exceedingly common.Also goon and kanon very much refers explicitly to Wu and Han Chinese readings and they dont really apply to Japanese except in very ancient historical contexts.For what its worth my dictionary lists the following nanori readings for  . And this just includes the ones that appear frequently enough for them to be documented as valid readings of that character. The majority of these readings can be attributed to the history of naming conventions throughout the various eras of Japanese history  there was never really any countrywide rules for naming conventions prior to national unification so pretty much anyone could just adopt names including both kanji and readings for those kanji at will and those that caught on became the de facto nanori readings for those given characters. Its basically an issue of just flat out memorizing the readings for common names but generally you will learn the appropriate reading for a persons name relatively early as its almost always given in hiragana when appropriate.,LearnJapanese,csvputq,3,t5_2qyls

You probably dont even really need to know any grammar yet.gt if I try to learn both Kanji and new vocab itll get too difficultLearning kanji at the same time as learning vocab is actually probably a good way of doing it. It may stick in your mind better if you learn the kanji holistically as part of the vocab from the start rather than conceptualizing the kanji as this whole other thing that you need to learn. Heres what I meanLearning a new vocabulary word in English consists of learning the spelling the pronunciation the meaning the part of speech and the usage. Right? Gotta learn each of those when you learn a new word. Well a new vocab word in Japanese has all those same things. Just plus one extra thing which is the kanji.Seeing it this way its just as though each new vocab word is maybe  harder to learn holistically than a single new vocab word would be in English or some other language.

5321741,0,t1_cvrpwlq,As an example of what udehTiger said here are some Japanese words written in katakana and hiraganagt Written  katakanagt Pronounced cho ko ree togt Meaning ChocolateYou can see the similarity to the English pronunciation by clicking on the link and clicking the speaker icon. Katakana most of the time is used just to spell words from other languages with the sounds permitted by the Japanese language. As dehTiger said though it can have other purposes.On the contrary heres a word written in hiraganagt Written  hiraganagt Pronounced hisshigt Meaning DesparateYou can see that it doesnt sound like its English meaning at all and thats because its not derived from English but from what you can think of as a third alphabet kanji. In other words the word is native to Japanese.What the third alphabet kanji does is replace hiragana with pictoral representations of ideas. It would be a lot like replacing Greek and Latin roots in English with pictoral representations of the ideas they convey. For instancegt Word semicirclegt Ideas semi meaning half circle.gt Pictoral representations in Japanese semi   circle  .gt Replacement Though it would still be pronounced semicircle its just written differently. This can help in certain situations when words are pronounced the same way but have different meanings though most of the time the meanings of words are determined contextually anyway. For instance in English you have to determine the meanings of words contextually.gt I stated the state of the state.gt Buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo buffalo buffalo Buffalo buffalo yes this is valid sentence.Anywho I hope this helped.

5408006,0,t3_3p3yl3,Ill start off with one more example.  Theres this word fg  that comes from plain phonetic component of each kanji and has no connection with their meanings whatsoever. This phenomenon of using kanji for their phonetic component with little to no regard for heir meaning is called ateji. This is precisely what happens in your  example as well.My examle is of course the very archaic way to write  but it has one practical application nowadays that the second character fg  rice is actually often used to mean America confusingly the country of rice fg  even though it has nothing to do with rice. That can be used for pure stylistic considerations or to save space say in the newspapers fg  is a pretty good example of it this whole thing standing for Japan  US relationships.While most instances of ateji used for loanwords have been replaced with katakana some usages persist especially for the loanwords that were introduced into Japanese a bit earlier  say in th centuries from Dutch or Portuguese. Tempura initially a Portuguese word can nowadays be written as  and  for instance. As coffee is also a loanword from these times you can assume it might also have this ateji associated with it and while  is probably the more common way to spell it  is still used quite often  say in restaurant menus.,LearnJapanese,cw2xluk,23,t5_2qyls

There I get another reading for it and have a card with kunyomi and onyomi. I use kanjidamage for kanji lookup because it has useful tags like if kanji shows only in compound words and doesnt need kunyomi or if its only on its own and doesnt need onyomi.

Though I think most people interested in Japanese are aware of this point.gtYou Need To Learn Japanese ContractionsThis part... well I disagree with your argument. Not that the contractions are necessary but you make them sound like a bigger deal than they are. I think most textbooks mention that  is often shortened to  and such. Shortening  to just  isnt really exotic or otherworldly. Making it like like people wont be able to communicate with shopkeepers before mastering  and  seems like an irresponsible exaggeration.Also Kaiteiku is not to buy and go. This is go and write. Buy and go would be katteiku. So kaiteku is also wrong.gtYou Need To Do Verb DrillsYes.

Unfortunately for the learners the words you listed dorodoro sukkiri etc often dont have kanji and yet are vital parts of conversation.

As for how it breaks up characters he doesnt always stick to the etymologically correct mnemonic by design. I quoted his approach in my post gtDifferent strategies are appropriate to different kanji. Some are easy to remember as pictograms. Others are best approached by linking together the meanings of their component graphemes. Still others are best learned by considering their etymology or by focusing attention on one of their distinctive features or by applying some ad hoc method.The goal is to build strongly visual or emotional mnemonics since those are types of memories were most strongly wired to build.,LearnJapanese,d2c5gkh,1,t5_2qyls

JASenseiFor me this App has been THE best help in learning Japanese. its starts off at a very basic level and goes up to what I can tell a secondary level of education. There are multiple menu options and plenty of content to let you learn.  Lessons   as of this moment each one covers a different topic and some grammar. It starts off with a coversation giving examples of how things are used then it will allow you to hear it spoken Read it in Full Kanji Kana only Romaji and English. After this it highlights key phrases used and what they mean goes over some Grammar points and then goes on to explain other things. All of this is done over  lessons in the app.  Kana and Kanji  This app lets you read both Hiragana Katakana and Kanji you can view stroke orders Readings and Pronunciations and Example words they may appear in. Once you get comfortable you can do the Quiz option which allows you to test Writing or Recognition. What you get right it will slowly phase out and what you get wrong it will make appear more often.   it starts out phasing for  days and goes up to  month where it will come back in so you can refresh yourself . For the Kanji part is it split up into different sections from Elementary all the way up to Secondary education levels.  the addition here is a Kanji extractor so you can COPYPASTE anything you dont know and it will find and explain it for you.  I didnt count but there is  Kanji available Vocabulary studying  This app has a huge list of words ranging from Colours Time Animals Food and more. Again it comes with a quiz which makes remembering much easier. I havent counted but in total its close to  words.It includes Help on Verbs teaching all the different forms Adjectives Numbers Counters Grammar rules and the different particles.It doesnt do it in the specific order you requested but. The drawing feature is in this app and is great at tracking your finger.  it sometimes  slightly incorrect drawings  as finger writing is not always neat but as long as you did the correct stroke order and somewhat the correct shape it will mark it as correct. This app has a companion app called JAaudiobookComing in at . however features Writing on screen accompanied by the Audio Furigana and a quiz again to show you understood it from there there are options you can choose to make the reading easier or difficult. It highlights all Kanji Marking them from JLPT  so you can bring them up in the other app and study them.The stories range from Kids books to Adult diary entries so there should be something for everyone. I dont have any affiliation with this APP but While on the Subject I thought it would be good to share what I use because it helps tremendously. I will be happy to explain anything more if you need any clarifications. ,LearnJapanese,d2wrzf1,1,t5_2qyls

Hello is a greeting and to understand that its a greeting you need to know the Hello sound.But heres the difference Spoken word is different from written word. You dont need to know how to spell Hello if all youre doing is saying and hearing it. Thats how illiterate people live their lives. However with Japanese its extremely hard to know the initial correct pronunciation without first reading it in the basic kana. Or else you need a native speaker fully willing to pace you through each sound or  years of listening practice like a child to absorb it all. You certainly do not need to know kanji if you dont plan on reading or writing it. The kana are fine and theres flashcard decks out there only in kana for vocab.

You could just as easily render those Japanese sentences with intransitive verbs as. The book is visible by implication to me. English is unclearincomprehensible to me and . Someone came into the room.The slipping point is that correspondence youre thinking of is one of contextual usage rather than the semantic and grammatical behavior of the words chosen.

7995735,0,t1_d4e2y9n,Thanks for the reply. Hopefully Im able to address your concerns.When I first began these Memrise courses I was going to require users input text as answers for Vocabulary and arrange the words for Grammar. However I stopped this for a couple of reasons. First it made the course harder and take longer no matter the student. Second the arranging turned out to only do individual characters and there was no way to allow it with words or group of words.What I decided was that people can on their own can make the course more difficult. In your case download that Greasemonkey script that stops the Memrise timer. Then figure a way to block the multiple choice answers hand or paper or maybe a hotkeyd window or just dont look then answer it without looking. If you get it wrong purposely select a wrong answer on the multiple choice even if you see what the correct answer should be.This is similar to my recommendation that users write out each kanji or kana words in the RTKanji and RTKana courses. The course wont force them but depending on the students needs and desires they can test as they see fit.Yes most of the active recall for people doing this course normally is going to suck and suck real bad. However without any evidence I think that theyll get through the courses faster and be literate is the sense they can consume native Japanese material which is ultimately the goal. What Id rather not happen is those guys and gals give up because a course that has  entries  words  sentences requires up to a minute of their time testing each entry. Thats just going to lead to burn out.Anyway I still recommend you use the course I posted. Just make it more demanding for yourself in requiring input. You can write it out by hand say the word out loud type it on screen whatever. If you got it wrong that way just mark it wrong. Thats what I used to do with the old iKnow online program. Hell technically its what Ive always done with Anki since thats an honor system did you get it wrong? from the getgo. All this said I did activate the audio testing on the Core kk deck. A few of the questions then will play audio or have audio only answer selections and you need to know what the answer without the help of kanji. For people versed in RTK this could be good since Kanji sort of give the answer.Hopefully youre able to try out the courses again and tell me what you think.,LearnJapanese,d4esoqg,2,t5_2qyls

8094931,0,t3_4q2rqi,Not sure how good your kana is but I think you should prioritize katakana and hiragana above all else until you know them pretty well. Katakana will let you read all the English words that are used in the Japanese language and a lot of store signs and products will be katakanaized English words. Hiragana will let you at least look up unfamiliar native words and kanji with furigana.Other than that Id say learning specific phrases questions and answers for getting around is more important than abstract grammar and vocab. You can pick up the fundamentals as you go but if you get lost in the train station with no way to get help from anyone or if you starve to death because you cant get directions to the grocery store...Im exaggerating of course but I really think a cheap tourist phrasebook will help you get by until you start to get a better grasp of the language.,LearnJapanese,d4pxyqt,0,t5_2qyls

They know how to use the language correctly and arguing over pedantic definitions is why learners fail to sound natural.Incorrect misinformed misleading or otherwise bad content will and should be downvoted so when people come here they can get good reliable information.PS Also yeah  doesnt function like other normal na adjectives because you can say shit like NOUN.,LearnJapanese,d5kbrcn,11,t5_2qyls

Ended up with Japanese for silly reasons.  Initial reasons faded and it turned into a sinking ship fallacy situation.

It is not  accurate translation but I think it is better than thinking it means I. Example some one asks you where are you from then  is just fine. You have been talking about your friend to someone for a bit but now are switching to saying you are from France you would want to use  or the person you are talking to may think your friend is French in stead of German or whatever.  ,LearnJapanese,d5pi2k9,5,t5_2qyls

8394003,0,t3_4ukv0s,Thats a common question here. Personally I like the idea behind Remembering the Kanji RTK and completed it back in  taking about  study hours. However it has flaws as a book that a number of online resources have helped fix. For example the book teaches all  of the jouyou kanji. This is even though  kanji comprise  frequency  kanji make up  frequency and  kanji make up  frequency. If youre a beginner itd be better to learn the  or  kanji then get on to learning actual Japanese using those kanji.Another flaw of the book fixed by online sites are the stories. If you dont know what Heisig is talking about there are sites dedicated to the book like Kanji.Koohii.com which provide alternate stories by users and a useful discussion forum.If you like the idea of learning an abbreviated set of Kanji first try RTK kKO pt  course I posted on Memrise. It covers the  kanji from the .Kanji.Odyssey book which as said makes up  of kanji frequency use in Japanese text and presents them in RTK order.Dont worry about not learning Japanese while learning Kanji. The idea is you use this ability to recall and recognize Kanji to aid in learning Japanese words that use that Kanji. From vocabulary words youll intuitively pick up pronunciation.,LearnJapanese,d5qspw6,3,t5_2qyls

The way I see it if youre copying native speakers youre less likely to be saying it the wrong way than just going off text. Yes I know that Text to Speech in the grammar courses are not ideal but it better than nothing at all.However yes I think a tutor is worth it if you can swing it. What I recommend is have them listen to you review your self study material for  hour and viciously correct any pronunciation errors you commit. It might be good to record those sessions to make notes about it later that way you dont waste too much time during the tutoring session.  ,LearnJapanese,d6cq6fq,1,t5_2qyls

What do you think?What Im looking for doesnt exactly have to mean transcription nor does it have to be completely formal if thats of any help. As long as it gets the same idea across while still sounding natural it should be fine.Also would it make sense to append a word for original behind  to mean original transcriber? Aside from using original I could also put some word or phrase meaning modified in parentheses after the term if that would be better.As for cover Ive decided to use  X as many others have pointed out. This might be treading on the actual definition of cover a bit but  X would mainly refer to the one playing the music just like it does in English right?,LearnJapanese,d6hu240,1,t5_2qyls

8773944,0,t3_508990,Im working through it now after getting bored by the monotony of Intermediate approach to Intermediate Japanese and its definitely going by a lot slower than Genki.  The material is so much heavier so its kinda overwhelming. I like to write down almost everything so I tend to take my time. First I listen to all the readings and dialogs and see what I can pick up without any prior knowledge. Then I copy down all the vocab and spend a day or two memorizing those. Id like to say I make anki cards for them but thats just not my style. I find that I learn the word a lot faster when I read it in context. But maybe I suggest making flash cards cause theyll be quickly forgotten in the future. Then I spend another day or two on grammar making my own practice sentences with each point. Then I finally go back to the readings and make sure I understand them completely when reading. After that I listen to them without the text but my listening skills are really bad so this takes me a lot of time. After that I finish up the chapter and repeat. Ive finished about two chapters so Im not very far but Id say its taken me at least three weeks to do all this. Granted I havent been the most diligent studied lately so Im not sure.

9105098,0,t3_54vuw3,I started learning Japanese on September  last year which was about  months before I turned . Most of my time after work was dedicated to my Japanese studies in  so I managed to finish Genki  in about  months and RTK by New Year. In January I accomplished  goals  studying all words in Core k  reading all grammar points in Dictionary of Basic Japanese Grammar and reviewing the main examples in Anki.After that I started working on N vocabulary and Tobira just the reading listening and grammar points... no exercises. Ive done most chapters in Tobira but never really finished the book because I was kinda bored. But in the meantime I also read a handful of NHK easy news articles. At one point I also started adding lots of words that I found in the wild. At one point in the second semester of this year I finished studying most N grammar points too. A couple of months ago I was able to read a handful of regular NHK news articles which was pretty cool. I also read a few articles on nippon.com lifehacker and random stuff about anime visual novels and stuff that I like. A while ago I had issues with deck corruption so I stopped doing Core k when I reached  words but Im still able to review online. So far Ive studied about  words or so and  kanji. Unfortunately I cant identify all of these words upon hearing them so N listening is still tricky... but thatll come with time and practice so thats alright. Ive started working on N grammar recently so Ive been studying  grammar points a day. Aside from that I also made a deck to learn how to read the name of the ish most important cities and states in Japan because I hate reading the news and have to look up the name of every single city.As for the fun stuff Im half way through vol  of Shingeki no Kyojin and somewhere between page  of Utsuro no Hako to Zero no Maria cant quite recall where I stopped a couple of weeks ago.Its been rough to make this much progress in a year but it would have been even harder not to do so. Im very impatient when it comes to learning Japanese because I want to know it right now not later. So I put in a massive amount of time to get the basics out of the way as soon as possible.

So more like renembering the sentence. Because if I would see that kanji on NHK Easy news or something I probably would need to look at the furigana to know what its saying.So what I tried doing was put it in a spreadsheet along with other kanji. After some I would fill in meaning in hiragana next to it. And I would create rows of around  vocab words. If I filled them in correctly I would shuffle them and the next day I would do this again.

Are you going to use a certain course or something like that?Im a total beginner too but heres what Ive currently stuck with as a person who right now is learning  by myself at homeYou need to learn hiragana there are great apps with memory hints for this  Android  iOS Similar apps are available for the katakana  iOS  Android . Your goal is to be able to draw the kana without having to look it up. Remember that words of foreign origin are written in katakana but your priority at the beginning should be nailing hiragana. Generally dont touch kanji yet unless youre really curious.Ive generally had the problem of what do I do now? at this point but it seems that when it comes to interactive coursebooks that dont cost a fortune or subscription I kinda hate subscriptions Human Japanese is a good bet. Its available on almost all platforms Windows Mac iOS Android and starts with the assumption that you know nothing about the language. Whats important here is. It has animations which show the stroke order for the kana which is quite important. It has included pronounciation for all of the phrases and words. Its written in an easytounderstand and often humorous style. It cycles back and forth between grammar and vocabulary. It includes quizzes and reviews for improving your memory of the things you learnSo far Im pretty happy with the program Im really not sure what Id do without it how do I start?.And... just remember to have fun with the language.

10631631,0,t3_5s52i8,You say you read visual novels and use Anki. Cant you go through the visual novels and take the unknown words and make them into an Anki deck? Thats what I have been doing since I started reading VNs and using Anki in November last year. Before that I would just write words and their definitions in a notebook and review when I felt like it. Only started using Anki because I have the habit of misplacing those notebooks and Anki is a better way to keep things organized and to search through.Having to stop reading and look words up is incredibly time consuming and annoying when youre trying to enjoy a story but I think its best this way because you have context and connection to what youre reading. Also VNs in the same genre or made by the same company tend to share a lot of the same vocabulary like recently I played two VNs that were post war apocalyptic type era and involved the mafiayakuza and they used a lot of the same words so this would help with the repetition part needed to really memorize a word. In the beginning I learned most of my words from songs since theyre short and fun to listen to on my phone so easily accessible it was easy. I read some wikipedia articles usually only a paragraph or two. I did do the k core vocav bur I used the app iknow to learn those words not Anki. Just listing some alternative methods to just using Anki and VNs for learning. pThe majority of my vocab and grammar has come from games and songs and I was able to pass the N this December with iirc ?

11271130,0,t1_df7t9gp,I feel like somewhere down the line people began misrepresenting WK as more than a tool to efficiently learn kanji. The vocab isnt even general us though many are its just vocab cherry picked to reinforce the various possible readings and meanings of the kanji that have been learned. IIRC the point of the whole start WK ASAP thing wasnt to trivialize kanji in other learning materials again a byproduct but to get a jump start on learning a subject that normally takes years of effort and heavily integrates into the rest of the language. Anyone who actually finishes WK before starting other resources is misunderstanding things. The WK guide for new users even goes as far as to say level  is a great time to start grammar and levels  are a good time to tackle the easier readings. By level  WK covers an estimated  of JLPT N kanji. There is no reason to go more than half the course without tackling grammar at all. This also means new learner can dramatically shorten the awkward period of the chickenegg issue to just a few months.Honestly for tackling the kanji dilemma WK is pretty solid as long as you plan appropriately. Whether its by coincidence or design you get a lot of useful kanji by half a year and a solid ability to break down and quickly learn new kanji on your own. It also pairs really well with resources like Human Japanese that dont use kanji initially.With regards to the middle way I dont think brute forcing the common radicals is a bad thing. It really helps with kanji lookups for when textbooks or readers fail to cover something or you forget what chapter that was in...Its not perfect but I think the actual solution to the problem will be when people start making better integrated resources. For instance Satori Reader has passages with audio from native speakers that can display kanji or kana based on various settings and even has WK integration. Thats pretty awesome for learners who are still balancing out grammar vocab kanji and listening. Right now we mostly have a mishmash of resources that either specialize in a single topic or dumps people into everything at once which overburdens new learners. It isnt reasonable to tackle the issue of optimizing the way of learning kanji further without optimizing the entire process of learning Japanese. ,LearnJapanese,df9ke0x,1,t5_2qyls

11442729,0,t3_63a4nl,I attended lexis Kobe for about  months was planning on staying longer but plans changed and I decided to move. The teachers and staff are amazing its a really fun atmosphere with a lot of activities to do after school. New students usually come on Mondays so your bound to make some new friends. They have two options full or part time. I was full time but didnt find the afternoon sessions all that helpful. The hour after lunch is review what you learn in the morning but the last hour is japanese culture which is nice but I think the time could be better spent studying or practicing kanjis. This is my opinion but others I talked to shared the same opinion. Its what you make it and it moves fast so if your not motivated to study after school you will fall behind. There is a speech every Friday you have to memorize and a kanji test everyday at the lower levels. When you move higher you get a test on grammar on Friday and only one kanji test a week but it is more complicated. A large majority of the students are from Taiwan or Switzerland but students come from all over. You get a placement test when you get there and from that they decide what level you are at. The only problem with this is they will put you in a class that might already be half way through the book which is daunting but if you need to move down a level it is no problem. If you have any more questions feel free to pm me but I hope this is helpful. ,LearnJapanese,dft0u0e,2,t5_2qyls

We have little lift the flap hiragana books that he liked. I will look at our books this afternoon and type out our favourites. There is a mouse series about  mice that he loves. I do know that we have several Nontan books that Ive read to him for awhile and he was happy to find them in a bookstore on our last trip to Japan even though he didnt buy any. The first few books we got were an   book some Nontan books a  board book the hiragana flap books  first words in Japanese and a book about a squirrel gathering acorns cant remember title. I went to Kinokuniya for those except one was from a friend of a clients. Ive also gotten books when friends went to Japan. Im not sure if you know Japanese childrens games but peekaboo in Japanese is   !When she gets older you can play shiritori with her. Also on my last trip to Japan I bought a karuta set theres a Totoro set! And Doraemon! And cats! And my son did not want any of those.... They do play this in school though so you will find this when you hit preschool age.When a child doesnt want to do what theyre told they say !I dont have any books with this but the teacher read one to the class in my sons music class and the dad next to me commented on his son saying it a lot. If I were doing it over I would buy that book. It had a picture of a child on the cover and was called . Although considering that just this morning I got told yada when it was time for him to brush his teeth maybe not?if she goes to yochien you might want to consider teaching English reading and letting her school teach hiragana. My sons Saturday school has been very thorough in teaching hiragana and katakana. I  supplement at home because the rest of the week he is in public school in English. Although I guess Id supplement at home regardless because I do practice reading in English with him as well Im not sure but it seems like it would be hard to keep up English while living in Japan.Oh! One thing I wish Id bought when he was younger are the Uncle Goose hiragana blocks. Theyre good quality blocks and um have hiragana on them. We have a set now borrowed and my son uses them to make words but it would have been nice to have when he was in the buildandknockdown stage just for exposure. ,LearnJapanese,dfx8x0e,3,t5_2qyls

While you learned the words necessary to ride the train in Japan I learned the word Sleep Powder attack Magic Points and Awakened Evil.. Particularly in a game like pokemon with the majority of gameplay being a battle screen the conversational materials will be rarely repeated so youre not gonna learn it as easily.  Frequency is key to learning.  In your native language how realisticappropriate are the conversations you see in video games?  For me a native English speaker not very.   Imagine a Japanese person learning English from GTA.  Get the F out of my way you smelly Nword!  Granted if you live in Alabama or Texas maybe you would say something like that often.. Theres no structure or coherent flow of information that helps with the learning process.   In Japanese  they dont start you with passive voice THEN teach you present simple.
