4289631,0,t1_cs943s0,If according to From Bloodborne and DS have a one year overlap in development and that BB started development right after AotA then there could not be any connection to Sotfs story content or to any of the  DLCs for that matter since the furthest BB could still be in development is January  two months away from release and two months ahead of the Alpha test.So the best case scenario for DS to be considered a direct sequel to DS or at least take its material into consideration is for the game to have started development around JanFeb  thus approximately  year of overlap. This would mean that at least Vanilla DS material was available to work with at the start of development.Still I personally believe this game will draw heavy connections to DaS mostly thus making it a spiritual successor rather than a direct sequel.,darksouls3,cs95vn1,-1,t5_2w3z3

4384452,0,t3_3b73ok,I dont know what the perfect solution is but I like the way Bloodborne handles it the most. Parries are limited even if reaching that limit takes a bit of time. People dont fish for back stabs.Parries are annoying in both DS and DS but I rarely fought anyone who did them anyway. But I straight dont like the way DS handles back stabs. Seeing players attempt that grab when Im nowhere near them is so irritating. Not to mention one time in the arena I fought a super laggy individual and he beat me. So when I got him again I was like okay and didnt leave the starting cell. I had my back in the corner and unsurprisingly he walked straight up to me did the grab and turned my character around  degrees. Stuff like that never happened to me in the first game. People still fish anyway no matter what weapon Im using. And to test this I would put on jesters robe and even after failing to back stab because its not fucking possible people would STILL try to circle around and do it. Im kind of ranting here but seriously theyd fish for that back stab to the point where it would get them killed. gtgt,darksouls3,csjv45e,0,t5_2w3z3

4406224,0,t3_3bfynx,Seriously though Jack nailed it.The fear and the stress you felt the deeper into a difficult place you travelled hoping beyond all hope that around the next corner will be a bonfire so you can purely just sit there and rest a little while and gather your wits before either turning back to tackle what you just did or push on all with soulshumanity still at risk was seriously exhilarating.Knowing that the option if you really want it is there to just warp back to the hub and spend those precious souls and then warp back and keep going seriously undermines the sense of relief and peace you got from a bonfire. Bonfires in DS were amazing tranquil tiny areas of safety where you could almost imagine bad stuff just hovering beyond the shadows wanting to get you. Made you actually want to spend time sitting there for a while as though your character healed and you can go and grab a cuppa and heal yourself. Bonfires in DS were just handy. Oh cool there is a bonfire! Cant lose my souls now! Sweet! Yep warping is handy convenient and makes it easier but that is totally against the grain of what Souls games were about. Souls is not handy or convenient or easy and shouldnt be.There was so much secret stuff and awesome shortcuts and areas to find in DS that I only found by actually spending time running through these areas over and over again on my travels to new areas and if I could just warp there from the beginning then all this awesomeness would not have been experienced or found. Some of you will say you dont have to warp if you dont want to and that is true but remember those little things they had in DS to remind you of others going through the same hardships as you like when you heard the bell ring that was someone else playing who had just rang it! Made me go thats awesome! Someone made it! But with knowing there is a good chance someone just warped there and that the game is overall easier because of it it takes away from the achievement of it and I dont care that someone else made it. Finishing a souls game becomes no big deal with warping and it just cheapens the whole series and what it was known for.,darksouls3,csmbdnv,6,t5_2w3z3

I can parry more reliably in Bb than I can in DS.Miyazaki already said that Soul Memory wont be implemented in DS.While the covenants in Bb didnt really have an impact I did think that the way to enter them has been improved greatly. Instead of just walking up to someone and he asks you to join his gang you actually have a quest line and at the end an invitation. Eileen and the Hunters of Hunters was done very well.

They had Momentum and when they hit the ground you saw the dust shit kicked up by the impact. They didnt feel heavy but they felt powerful.In Dark Souls . Forgive me BKGS is my favorite weapons they feel heavy yet how it interacts with things dont have the strength behind it and in some cases doesnt feel like Im hitting what Im hitting Good example is Great Machete on a Titanite Demon sounds like Im using a Mace. Not even like Oh I crushed it No like actually smacking it with a blunt object.. Or when it just smacks against the ground it. It sounds way lighter then the animation itself is letting off Infact I think its the same sound for when you accidentally hit and bounce off a wall. I immediately went for the Zwei when I restarted the game after DS and noticed That felt weak after swinging it.Dont get me wrong The Great Axe and Greathammer in  are amazing i Swung Grant around for a good while.

4552194,0,t1_ct4eq2n,Well you have to consider the fact that From like to muddy the waters for us and that a good many things get lost in translation. And since the translators themselves dont know whats what and whos who many words that are ambiguous in Japanese are translated to what seems right. I dont know Japanese so I cant say with certainty but there might be some ambiguity between royalty and lordship that may have played a role in describing OIK as a lord. One example is that there is no gender in the japanese language and the German translation for Demon of Song is Song Demoness. If it werent for DoS being a minor character this might have had some heavy effects on how we perceived things regarding the lore.Regarding your point that there is nothing that implies it I have to agree. Its just what seems to make the most sense and thats what I feel that all this theorizing is all about trying to make sense of the scraps From have given us.,darksouls3,ct4fd89,1,t5_2w3z3

Where as in Dark souls  if you attack in one direction and try to attack in the exact opposite direction think  degree angle your character only turns slightly and attacks think  degree angle.

If you encountered a fight like that with fresh eyes TODAY as a souls veteran I think theres a good chance that you would find it a lot less interesting and more gimmicky. I dont view technical boss fights as erring on the side of anything theyre going to be entertaining and force you to master a mechanic and dont rely on you being awed by something cool or artistic.

For example lets take the Witcher series because I feel it to be one of latest Action RPGs that done sequels absolutely right. All three Witcher games have same core mechanics with some exceptions like the horseback riding. But because of longer development cycle of  years between games every one of core mechanics are differently done and you literally have to learn each game anew. Combat tricks from the first game wont work in the nd or rd. Returning to Souls series I can safely say that I beat every each one of the Soulsborne bosses by applying skill of rolldodging and hitting during enemies cooldown time that I got playing Demons Souls  years ago.,darksouls3,ctq8i7x,0,t5_2w3z3

4763726,0,t3_3g4eac,I think its not the communities problem. Dark Souls II clearly showed that the developers thought there was a problem. The game is practically built to discourage invasions by both Invading covenants. Blood Brothers are restricted by CREO very hard to farm. Arbiters are restricted not only by BREO but Tokens for their own covenant making it even worse for them. Not as hard to farm but a pain to find hosts. Even their own counterinvasion mechanic was hamstrung by the Way of Blue even existing. Bellkeepers and Rat Lords are completely optional areas. Dragons are well... dragons aint nothing changed about them.Dark Souls II went out of its way to prevent invasions and actively make them harder to have occur. I severely hope that we have more consistent invasions and hell even if Arbiters keep their counterinvasion mechanic Id welcome it. I just want to see more active PVP outside of a single convenient area and a specialtyarena designed to keep big bad invaders out of each others worlds. Hell even PvEs on Dark Souls II Reddit are asking where are the invaders I play for PVE and I stay for PVP and NG,darksouls3,ctv0g1n,1,t5_2w3z3

Powerstancing was nice but not amazing so I dont really care much about it either way but to neuter dualwielding after it was nearly perfect in DkS seems like a huge step back for absolutely no goddamn reason.,darksouls3,ctvkmnj,1,t5_2w3z3

4917156,0,t1_cuea82x,gtNothing connects the Bastille to the Iron King.The Ruin sentinels are armor imbued with souls. The description mentions some jailer but there are only  beings who had this ability Vendrick and the Old Iron King. We also know how much he took interest in hunting the undead.gtThere were multiple Undead Asylums for a startThe intro cutscene points out clearly that all undead were drive to the North. The Big Pilgrims Key descriptionBig key belonging to a chosenUndead pilgrim.But this chosen Undead knows not whatthis pilgrimage has in store.There can be multiple of them but all existed to the North. Itd make sense of Straids dialogue if it was any of them. gtTheres so much more in favour of Drangleic being built on at least SOME of the same land. Also if the Old Chaos is Lost Izalith which it clearly is why is the rest of Lordran not on top of it any more? Did it just vanish? No it shifted because it was supported by Archtrees and a land supported by a bunch of pillars aint gonna last too long. That alone shows that the land has changed and it really doesnt matter anymore what land is built over what. The point is kingdoms rise kingdoms fall rinse repeat. The NPCs all allude to them rising and falling on the same land but realistically Drangleic covers a lot more space than Lordran did. So it almost certainly covers part of Lordran somewhere.You can make assumptions about a lot of things. Straids lore is basically thrown out of the window unless hes been speaking of Northern Undead Asylum. So far everybody had a meaningful lore but Straid gets no attention because his lore changes everything.gtthe Bastille was likely built by Alken due to the presence of the Belfry Luna and we know they came before the Iron King so that pretty much disproves that.The Lost Sinner is speculated to be the princess of Alken affected by the Chaos bug during the intro. The Old Iron King also is a Great soul like Lost Sinner. What makes you think that Alken is older than Iron kingdom?gtMy GOD youre ignorant.

4972176,0,t3_3izxxj,Have you read this topic on Fextralife? Its basically a fan translation of some item descriptions and dialogues in DkS. There are plenty of interesting things to read but What I want to bring from there is the translation of the Ancient Dragon SoulgtThe soul of the great ancient dragon towering high in the depth of the ritual spot. This being once possessed gigantic power but now merely continues existing in this place. The special soul of this dragon created by his pursuit of the abyss of souls will either award you with a vastness of souls upon use or enable you to give birth to great power.There are a few things not mentioned in the official translation being the most interesting one the Abyss of Souls whatever that is. It could be a mistranslation from either sides but I personally like to think the official one is wrong because the Dragon Scale item description in Dark Souls  states Touching an ancient dragon scale gives one a glimpse into the abyss. and as far as I know the Abyss created by Manus has nothing to do with dragons.Im not sure what to make of it. If the fan translation is correct we could assume the Dragon earned his soul just like Seath did and possibly Sinh and the Abyss of Souls could be the First Flame. But then again what connection the dragons would have with it? Or assuming the official translation is correct then what does the Abyss has to do with dragons?,darksouls3,cula2vf,2,t5_2w3z3

5027805,0,t3_3jt07y,There are rumors of a blue nonfunctional bar in one of the closed demos it was stated that it was a placeholder for something From is working on and would be changed.As for my personal opinion I think itd be nice to have a manabased system instead of this current Vancian magic system. It would allow mages to go a bit more allout if the situation demands but also preserve their power for stronger opponents.Itd also be very nice if instead of having to buy stronger spell there were an upgrade system where you could just unlock a greater maximum mana output for a spell and in some points it changed to look increasingly more powerful a soul arrow would become a heavy soul arrow then a great heavy soul arrow and then a soul spear and so on.The spells would obviously need to be balanced to provide diminishing returns else mages would simply charge every cast to a guaranteed kill disregarding the greater mana consumption because the HP per mana rate would be the same. Thus there would be a need for a slightly exponential multiplier applied to the mana and cast time for every tier of power something like the bonus for the second tier is only x the bonus of the first one.,darksouls3,cus1ihh,1,t5_2w3z3

The houses in this village are burned out but the fires have been extinguished for years and the houses have been reclaimed by lush vines and ivies.  You wait for monsters to show up.  They dont.  You go deeper into the village and slowly let your guard down.  You find a bonfire in a castle.  You have no reason to warp back to the hub not like you got many souls from killing nothing so you dont notice the warp function is disabled.  Further into the castle you pull a lever opening up a courtyard.  It is filled with bones and black mist which spills out of the door.  In the middle of the room is a rusted and blackened sword.  As you leave the castle you are beset by ghosts which can only be killed effectively with the sword you found Or a transient curse item which was handed out fairly often in the castle.

I just think Dark Souls is at its best when epic badass moments happen during gameplay. Contrast seeing Anor Londo for the first time with seeing Drangleic Castle for the first time. With Anor Londo you have a kinda promising start with the batwing demons but then you get this massively cheesy cutscene of Anor Londo with generic orchestral music and it just doesnt seen Dark Souls. With Drangleic Castle you have the moon reflecting on the black stone the rain splashing off the steps and your armour and this huge tower looming over you.

New statues were created in his image and worshipped anew.  The items from the previous games pointed at Soltaire more than the sun itself.  Perhaps texts written by Soltaire were discovered and brought to light by a deceiver that copied Soltaires image to raise a cult of followers.

Another possibility is that it works somewhat similar to the  pics I posted where it changed from day to night ...

6153843,0,t1_cyoc9x2,Bonfireslantern locations must really be one of the hardest decisions in the design of these games because they could be shifted so easily and alter runs quite significantly. Also I wouldnt say DS amp BB had bonfireslanterns right next to every boss. I can think of plenty of bosses with pretty decent runs in both games. DS amp DeS were definitely more spread out though. The amount of times I had to run across that bridge to the Tower Knight in Demons Souls was insane and also probably what made me fall in love with the series. Took me about  runs to get past the dragon and through the fog wall pooped myself when I saw the Tower Knight stood there in shock and got  hit. Good times. ,darksouls3,cyp4m4i,1,t5_2w3z3

6181061,0,t1_cys7oh2,Everything has a risk even blocking. Taking a hit on the shield can take away just as much stamina as rolling does sometimes waaay more its unpredictable in that way as opposed to just rolling which is always the same. Blocking hits with a shield pushes you back and thus out of range of your opponentunless your shield makes attacks bounce off but when using rolls you can roll yourself into an advantageous position whilst simultaneously avoiding an incoming attack you also gain access to fast rolling attacks. Its all about setting yourself up to get the next hit. And as if all of that wasnt enough you also get to twohand your weapon for extra damage. The advantages of relying mostly on rolling are numerous.Using a mixture of both rolls and blocks is probably the best thing you can do for sure there are definitely situations where blocking is the safest option but I just think that dodging is too much fun ,darksouls3,cys80g0,2,t5_2w3z3

Simple things that anyone in the world can do. I am not a fan of some random hollow being able to manipulate souls an make himself stronger. Thats why I like going back to some mysterious person. like I said before I like having to wonder whether I should warp back or risk losing my souls. Bonfires take that away and just makes it easy to not lose souls since at every stop you just level up.

6282252,0,t1_cz3oyyu,removing soul memory still doesnt fix the issues with DS multiplayer either. Blues got screwed massively in that game and dragonbrosgravelords didnt fare much better.Reds had the most universally useful reward and the least restrictions so they were the best by definition.Similarly in DS even without SM limit buying cracked orbs for reds would still be worse compared to blues because you dont actually get rewards from red orb PvP  the red talismans or we had literally no use whatsoever and wins didnt help progress their covenant at all. Comparatively blues had no incentive to touch their arena ever especially since it cost them items to use but HAD to win invasions or summons which very few people used to rank up.Yea PvP is mainly done for fun but you shouldnt directly penalize a part of a covenant without giving equal rewards for it like with invading as a red in DS. You got nothing but some souls and  sin per win. Therefore there was no real motivation to use CREOs over Red Sign Soapstone ever at all.,darksouls3,cz3pzfy,1,t5_2w3z3

Maybe a traditional one like in most RPGs or maybe a progression based one like in Bloodborne. Most of the early demos showed a sort of early evening aesthetic with a bright yellow sky. The network test had a lighter more washedout effect almost like mid afternoon. Then there are screenshots of the High Wall at night which were leaked very early on. Hell you can see the same area in two different screenshots one in the day and one at night.

6381412,0,t3_432tw4,I feel a large part of this is actually load times. I have Dark Souls  on PC and have a friend who owned it on PS. I watched him try to invade in the bellkeeper covenant so many times to sit in a load screen for ages to then be disconnected because the host had already died. As for Bloodborne that uses networking more similar to Dark Souls  for only Miyazaki and god knows what reason. The networking for Souls  is vastly better than Souls  and Bloodborne. I know for a fact that Miyazaki likes the Souls  formula so chances are he wont be taking too many of the good parts of Souls . However from what I saw in the network test conducted last year Souls  actually seemed to have pretty reliable and fast multiplayer. The network test was also of course PS exclusive.Realistically theres no way of knowing but generally due to better load times  its a fact that networking would be somewhat better on PC even if only by a small margin. And if you have a PC that can handle it my opinion is why the heck would you get it for a console? Unless you have a lot of friends who play on console too of courseUltimately the answer is there is no answer but I wouldnt get my hopes up for it being as consistent as Souls  for any platform.,darksouls3,czezxxv,6,t5_2w3z3

Many of the secrets of the games are pertinent to there lore or world such as accessing the darkmoon covenant or fighting the moon presence. These are awesome secrets. They relate to the worlds the games exist in. Youre defining the word accessible like a buzzword in a game article Im defining accessible to mean that within the game itself a player can experience content without having to go to reach extreme goals. Beating Bloodborne is not an extreme goal. Beating it without dying is. There is a big difference here and locking content behind the latter is not cool.

6479712,0,t3_44caiv,Theres definitely some artistic differences between  and  like what exactly light and dark means. At the end of ds you get to choose to prolong the world in a selfless way by sacrificing yourself to keep the fire going in which a stable society led by strong gods and submissive and unimportant humans could live. In ds light seems very similar to that idea of communism you mention the light seems representative of being content and self sacrifice. The dark ending of ds seems much more capitalistic in this line of thinking with the majority of the dark soul being conglomerated within you and maybe a few other elites. The age of Dark in ds seems to be just about survival of the fittest and what the cost of having power and individuality would mean which in this case it would mean killing undead over and over again and being one of few humans that retains their conciousness and individuality while taking advantage over the ceaseless hordes of hollows.Meanwhile in ds The age of dark is much more like just a human kingdom and isnt exactly oppressive or that much different from what Gwyns kingdom was. That aside the giants do seem very much an embodiment of fear of each humans desire to retain their individuality at any cost and to strike out at eachother in order to maintain it even if it would only be temporary. But all this talk of inspirations and themes metaphors and allusions to communismcapitalism may be a little far fetched and I personally draw one conclusion about the theme of the souls series. The price of power is to take it from others. And in each game you seem to be able to stand with that idea and be okay with stepping on others to remain powerful and keep your individuality or to simply give up your power and individuality so that the weak can keep theirs for a time. This is less the case in ds but you still have the choice at the end of walking into the throne and being selfless or walking away and allowing survival of the fittest.,darksouls3,czpjsxr,2,t5_2w3z3

6509327,0,t1_czrvcvm,gt what if its structured exactly like DeS? it certainly wasnt a boring timeconsuming hassle there.Which was because a quite a number of factors unique to Demons Souls. No other Souls game From has made has Item Burden for instance which incentivised returning from a level right after the boss was beaten to drop off all of your stuff and unwind afterwards. The structure of levels and needing to beat an Archdemon to get further into the Boletarian palace level mandated two additional warps to the Nexus to get through the game. World Tendency even added additional warps. This all ended up with spending a significant portion of the game in the Nexus where all your little bookkeeping tasks live.And if all of these mechanics arent in a more Demons Soulsy Dark Souls  then I can easily say for certain that it will be a hassle to level up because those mechanics were there to meter the time a player was playing and create natural logical breaks to level up.,darksouls3,czsm4fl,1,t5_2w3z3

Embers give you the additional strength you need to even be on par with the undead thats how trash you are as an unkindled. So you seek power you rise up and go after lords of cinder just because theyre powerful and youre not. The shards of manus wanted to be whole again to be powerful again. They allied themselves with powerful kings to feel more whole. Ash seeketh embers you seek power to fill the void that is your meaningless existence. If youre unfit to be even cinder youll hunt down lords of cinder and bring about an age of true darkness.Or maybe the embers get you stoned who knows at this point.,darksouls3,czspua2,7,t5_2w3z3

6520845,0,t3_44wwib,This may sound weird but I actually glad Dark Souls  is the last of Dark Souls franchise. The reason is the sequel games is limited by its own old themes game mechanics plot structures characters and lores. This also promote recycling and rehashing the old materials in the new game  which make the new games lacks originality.Fans also are more critical of the new sequel and prone to compare the pro and cons between the new and old game more strictly and harshly.Just look at the Dark Souls  look like Bloodborne complain or Dark Souls  is too fast complain. This complains comes because fans have an expectation on how Dark Souls game should look and should play based on the older series. This would not happen if Dark Souls  is a new IP instead of the third installation of Dark Souls series.Its better for From to conclude Dark Souls franchise if they want to remain relevant in gaming industry.Cant wait for From to come out with new IP. Will it be Scifi Souls? Ninja Souls? Samurai Souls? Steampunk Souls? Cyberpunk Souls? Modern Souls? Post apocalypse Souls? Space Souls? Stone Age Souls? Survival Souls? Zombie Souls? Gundam Souls?All good From did prove they can make cosmic horror Souls and it was well received. Very well received actually Bloodborne did get PS exclusive award after all.gtWhat other games can fill the void?Monster Hunter and Dragon Dogma. They cant fully fill the Dark Souls void but since they share many core gameplay elements weapon have weight poise recovery animation timing so I wont feel too bad after Dark Souls end. And its not like Soullike game wouldnt be produced after Dark Souls  so overall I am not worry that much.,darksouls3,cztt1pr,3,t5_2w3z3

6541723,0,t1_czvy62s,Artificially gimping the characters by reducing your health is a bad decision. Always throwing v fights on invasions is also a bad decision.In dark souls things dont always go your way. It wouldnt be fun if things always went your way. Why would it be fun it things never had the chance to go your way either? This is what happens with health reduction and strictly v mechanics.First and foremost invasions are not static. They progress with game progression you have early mid and late game invasions which work very differently because your character increases in power as he levels.Early game you have the danger of twinks  low leveled characters with high powered gear that invade low leveled players. This can be solved in various ways that do not affect the higher tier invasions.Mid game you have some general imbalance. Some players performed their build poorly and will be no challenge others will provide a fair fight. This is natural theres no reason to fix it.Late game is where people cap and invade usually other high level players. You see everything here which is exactly what makes it fun.But what about the newbs? Some players simply dont like invasions. Dark Souls  had a great answer for this with horrible implementation but the concept was leagues ahead of bloodborne. It allowed for people to protect themselves from PvP invaders without gimping the entire invasion system across the board. Ultimately it allowed for a fun invasion experience for both new guys and veterans who like a challenge. The answer was the blue covenants.Now the implementation was not great but the concept of having specific covenant early on to protect low level players actually allows protection of players who wish to be protected while not affecting those who dont. Problem is the covenant was dependent on another covenant and its members. If Dark souls  tackles this problem and introduces a covenant that gives significant boosts with naturally some drawbacks to the ones being invaded you have the entire issue solved without actually shoehorning v invasions for everyone or artificially gimping HP based on percentage which is really not good design at all.,darksouls3,czvytrb,7,t5_2w3z3

6624561,0,t1_cyb5zs5,Cheaters on PC are many many times worse than PS. Hackers are infinitely worse on PC. Ive played DSSotfs since PS to PC to PS. By far PC has the worst players of them all. I have a  PCProbably  now though as nearly a year passed since and Im really considering picking it up for the PS because of the hackers. No hackers wont be making an appearance on the PS. The reason is pretty much that itll take way too much time and effort to get a hack workingwhich is VERY unlikely and Sony can simply just wipe out their hack away from existence shortly after hence wasting the hackers timeno ddos attacks against Sony is not considered a hack. PC is very different though its much harder to get rid of hacksand so easy for them to create them for it hence hackers reign supreme there.So its really between graphics and FPS at this point if were talking about hackers aside. The FPS I will miss for sure but the graphics I can say without a doubt that you probably wont be able to tell much of a difference. Sotfs on PC and PS looks damn near the same. Since the Souls games were never graphics based games I will never see this as a problem for any consoles or PC what so ever.So it really boils down to would you rather have hackers or fps. I choose the fps as fps I can get use to hackers I will always find annoying. Sure you can back up your save files but unless you are backing it up every few hours or so you can possibly lose up to a day worth of gameplay which is A LOT in Souls games.,darksouls3,d04jbux,2,t5_2w3z3

Finding a fashionable medium shield and not being able to parry I already stated why I love parrying with med shields exclusively a million times with it due to it being hardcoded is gonna piss me off if it turn out like that...

6635456,0,t1_d05jwdv,Yeah as I said his connection to distorted time is kinda odd.But heres the thing if hes alive by the end of the game he probably isnt in our world anymore. As Miyazaki said he returns to his own world and we summon him as a phantom rater than encounter him in person. So whatever his relationship to our world is he didnt link the Fire in our world but in his own.We should also bear in mind that the outcome in which Solaire survives until the end of the game is achieved by levelling up a covenant and killing a bug and without prior knowledge of Solaires questline players would be unlikely to do this. The outcome where Solaire dies in Lost Izalith is much better written and more emotional than the one where he survives and as such is most likely the canon outcome. So Solaire probably died in Lost Izalith and could never link the Fire.,darksouls3,d05nvrf,1,t5_2w3z3

I dont remember exactly but Ill try my best to describe the other stuff.Bow of Pharis?the explanation was different from DS Pharis is treated as a hero. The weapon art is probably way shots..?Sunlight Charm?It is like Monastery Charm and its design is same as Sunlight Shield.Feather Knight Halberd? I couldnt really look at it from a distance but its probably the one that the fat guy had in Network Test.Saw Cleaver It is said to be used in Undead town. I couldnt really spot exactly how it looks like but it was clearly different from its of BloodBorne.Wood Shield aka Maneater Mildreds shield. Surprisingly the arts is shield bash.Spider Shield Who expects it to be backed from DS. The arts is parrying.Darkdrift As it is already reported it used to belong to Yuria.DragonSlayers Crescent Axe It is treated as Creightons weapon. Lothian must be so sad.Royal Kite Shield Its clearly Guardian Shield but they didnt mention the explanation of it. So its probably a specification in only that event.Talisman it mentioned the Way of White but it seems that the Allfather Lloyd is degraded.Halberd It can be purchased in the shrine. The art is charge same as spears.ClaymoreThe art is ready stance same as the straight swordOn top of that one boots explanation shows Imitate the knight who follows the only goddess blah blah blah.

I would even go as far to say that Dark Souls  is easy much easier than Dark Souls le originale because they made it more accessible. I like souls games because the combat is tight and feels awesome and Bloodborne is in my opinion the single greatest thing to come out of the video gaming industry in at least  years. It is so good and it will always have a spot in my heart for being my favorite game of all time hands down. Its so good. The only reason I can imagine someone not liking a souls game is if they give up before they get around the difficulty curve which is stupid because youre cheating yourself out of a really awesome experience.

6940010,0,t3_4aq1y9,with all do respect to your personal opinion here is what I believe first thing I am surprised that after all you wrote you overlooked a crucial clue that is given us by the intro in DSThe Dark Soul IS A LORD SOUL just like the other three and it has been found by human IN THE FLAME! hollows did not had them in the beginning so i wouldnt devide them as Lordsfurtive pigmy the are all lords! There is no such thing as immortality for other races exept for Nito and his servants neither there are Gods! as you said Gwyn decieved the children of the Dark soul and chose to control them why? I will explain what I believe later. The dark from which THEY came is different from the Dark Soul and the Dark sign the player is asked multiple times in the game if we seek the TRUE DARK not the dark in general. The Fire had  Souls which obviously means it was devided within it self each Soul had its own purpose and was brought by Fire for a reason. Gwin does not have the most magnificent and powerfull Soul as you describe it The Dark Soul is the most magnificent one because it is SPECIAL as Kaathe said Unique Soul. Now in the beginning Fire was born as one but had many properties all of them had fallen into categoriesLord Souls I will try to make my vision as clear as possible.  st Lord Soul Undead Soul taken by Nito and his servants with the purpose of death and everything that comes with it.This Soul cannot die as long as there other three since there is life and death that has been brought by Fire nd Lord Soul Soul of Fire taken by Witches with the goal to give its wielded the strength and knowledge of Fire in war against DragonsThis Soul will die once the Fire itself will go out and it will go out and the Fire knows that! it is the order of things. rd Lord Souls Soul of Light taken by great Gwyn with the goal to lead other two souls and light the way to victory by its brightness This Souls will also die when the Fire is no more And the most important one The Dark Soul the one Soul that will inherit the new world after the Fire will go out the Dark Soul the only one with the strength to flourish in the age of darkness Gwyn and other two lords conquered the world and forgotten about the forth but the fire was growing weaker and so was Gwyn and his offspring and Witches and their offspring Notice Nito wasnt concerned about anything he could not vanish since the Dark Soul was getting stronger Gwyn did not accepted his fate and resisted in his blindness and feeling of superiority in front of humans he commits the First Sin he links the Firehe links Lord Souls between themselves as one which was not the way the Fire intended it to be with horrible results for humanity now humans as long as they serve their Gods and continue the path of a herecy against order of nature will share the same fate as ALL OTHER LORD SOULS that means they depend on FIRE to exist as a race and they share the same fate as Nito which is being UNDEAD and carry their sign!!! In the end it is your choice either to commit the same Sin as Gwyn or to toss aside the Fire before everyone dies and so humanity can be free of this CURSE well we already know what the official decision was! Also the purging stone cannot undo the Dark sign cause the curse will be cast on another humanon another Dark Souls it will not cure it! just seems pointless as gaming design and if you think about it neither in term of lore that doesnt make any sense.

Even with DSFix I couldnt get it to reliably stay above .  so far seems to be a tad faster than  and with fps should hopefully feel good to play especially with directional rolling instead of .

6944402,0,t1_d13gdkb,By theory is that Hollow is the natural state of Humans and Gods but the Curse is still technically a Curse.  I mean what is a Curse?  Its just something that happens which negatively affects someone.  That describes the Undead Curse pretty well.  What the Curse does is it leeches off ones Soul and Humanity until one is left as a Hollow the natural state.  So being Hollow is ones natural state but being Cursed is not as it is possible to go Hollow through means other than the Curse.,darksouls3,d13h7v6,2,t5_2w3z3

Like White guy Black guy Asian guy some weird thing and etc. Bloodborne had the same presets as Dark Souls  just without descriptions. So my guess is that they put homeland in this time to mean something like DKS as a throwback which is nice. But Im not saying youre wrong.

I was going to be going through hoops to grab the JPN version myself because of those issues but was given another option instead. I dont get to control how Fromsoft and Bamco conduct their business and I dont have any insight as to why theyve made these decisions.If Im an asshole for being a gigantic fan of the series and happening upon an incredibly fortunate and lucky scenario then so be it. I feel like most other people would do the same given the opportunity. I was offered a code and accepted it thats it. I just hope people dont think any of this is out of malice.I wont speak for anyone else I can only speak for myself so when you group our entire team together as some sort of hivemind I feel thats a bit disingenuous. I dont view this situation as an us vs them sort of thing with other broadcasters which seems to be what youre implying. If thats not the case then please correct me.Anyways I didnt intend to poke the hornets nest with this post I just wanted to offer a more clear perspective on what the situation regarding streamers is.

Its going to take even longer in actual game especially after initial hype wave.Im absolutely fine with invading with  weapons. I like this change. But im really against restricting all invasions to ganks yet again when Bloodborne already showed how horrible this system is and how fast it will kill all activity. All pvp will be focused around duels and this is horrifying in a game with such a unique pvp system. I hate pvp hotspots i love creative and themed invasions and im sure that im not alone in this.

The short sentences were meant to avoid a giant wall of text not to put people down  I just want reasonable discussion on the matter.I dont think it is by any means true that the greatest possible success comes from a simultaneous release and I dont think we have any reason to suppose that is true.  Do you know what reports the shareholders were expecting?  I dont.  If you dont either then we have absolutely no possible way to assume that a simultaneous release is positioning the game for more success.  I dont want the shareholders to remove those responsible.  As far as I see it that would just be consumers digging their own grave.  All of a sudden the financial disadvantages of slightly inconveniencing consumers becomes so great that companies would be forced to make otherwise awful decisions just in order to appease them and this would just be awful for the game industry.Yes the advanced copies thing is indeed an issue and deserves its own discussion but not here just for the sake of keeping the topic specific.

7015627,0,t3_4bompm,I work in a bureaucratic company. It is a very common thing to find reality not catching up to plans or schedules and for every one actual work there will be about  initiatives raised to address the problemsinefficiency encountered during the work. Some may work a tiny percentage may potentially make things worse in the long run but everyone in the company has to conform once the new guidelines have been announced. Some will not follow due to habits. Some never will glance and toss because there are more important stuff to attend to. Some thought that these new guidelines are bullshit and will raise a new initiative to address this guideline all in the name of improving quality of work but is in fact simply a way to make KPI this year look not too bad.And this is just one tiny cycle of internal issues a company faces daily Im talking about. Ill imagine that Bamco will be more a lot lenient than this but from watching Double Fines Production production cycle have some factors called artistic sense and writing inspiration etc which further delays release and thus cause another more grounded factor called money so on and so on and everything about making games is always about money. Because people who make games work far more and earn far less in the current system so say screw it with that shapeless thing you call morality or more definitive people will call a soul and lets do everything we can to earn those money so we can eat another day. Btw Im pretty someone at Bamco or Sony or Microsoft or whatever is fired because they made a mistake. You people shouldnt be complaining since retribution has arrived already or maybe you should so more people can get fired and be saved from this hell whereas those who didnt will take the scraps from the fired and eat another day. Happy days happy days.Also did I mention communication between companies are a pain in the ass? A onesided tender is already painful sometimes but when a rd or th or th company is involved things get so so messy and prolonged. Like god theres confidentiality issues which prevents you from directly contacting person in charge in any way other than email there are copyright contracts and terms and conditions that legal departments just love to shoot at each other because a lawsuit will absolutely bankrupt the companies. But of course none can compare to the dreadful scheduling issues where one side somehow produces a timetable and shoots to the other to see if they squeeze in which will take a full week to pick review and approve but when you get back to them theyll tell you that the time has changed and now youll have to push it to some other dates which obviously isnt acceptable so you argue and argue and argue and waste time and...Then you jump.

7017218,0,t1_d1bky4q,Sure. Ads need to be disclosed as being ads to an audience. It can be a dinky disclaimer that can ambiguously concede that its an ad but it still needs to be stated. The FTC sets the standards for what needs to be disclosed to an audience and it can be pretty hard to figure out what does and doesnt count as a disclosure. For example Machinima got a slap on the wrist recently for paying influencers on YouTube to make content that portrayed a given subject in a positive light. Heres the linkStreamers are not very different from influencers in that they establish and commodify their personality or a persona to an audience that they hope to expand who in turn are viewing them on a platform that tries to normalize monetary subscriptions and donations. Beyond subscriptions and donations particularly popular streamers endorse products in the explicit exchange of money services or goods for said endorsement. In a way streamers monetize the relationship and trust that they establish with a base audience which in turn increases their exposure to a broader audience. The issue that arises when a publisher treats a streamer as a sentient ad beyond the obvious South Park implications is that the nature of the relationship becomes illdefined  where unlike an explicit endorsement the exchange of goods and services like early access to a highly anticipated game create a mutually beneficial dynamic between the streamer and publisher sans a clearly defined line of support. Streamers directly profit from having this sort of access. This in itself does not point to disingenuous expressions of a game being good or bad but it can certainly influence a bias. The reason why this is different from review sites is because among other factors reviewers have institutional backing from their employer in the form of a salary maybe if youre lucky an established reputation and perceived integrity to commit to objective criticism. Equating streamers who have a clear monetary incentive to not burden themselves with an objective perspective and who in fact gain a reputation for not being objective but personable should not and do not have the same weight in their opinions because of the previously stated biases.  As DS was listed as  in terms of simultaneous viewers according to Twitch theres a clear incentive to be put in the spotlight for both the publishers and the streamers. Where theres money to be made on a hype train I am wary.Anyway Im just waiting for the day when something like that happens. I think early access and the elevation of a gaming personality who stands to gain monetarily from early access is ripe for conscious or other biases that taint an established relationship with exploitation. But whatever.,darksouls3,d1br067,1,t5_2w3z3

It really has nothing to do with being entitled or avoiding spoilers I actually planned a vacation for this time period to keep me distracted. Half of the excitement of a game is exploration. Avoiding spoilers doesnt really help in making the world feel undiscovered because you know everything has already been discovered anyway it kills motivation to try and discover new things because now you have to try and separate what is new and what is not.

If the NPC wearing the armor is attacking you and you also attack to counter and you connect first thenexpected result with no poise NPC staggers his attack is cancelledexpected result with poise NPC can land the hit despite yours and you lose HP.

I think that does just as good a job portraying the barbaric style especially replacing the normal moveset rather than adding to it when youre in rage mode you can only use the rage mode moves while also addressing your issue with wasted potential.The more I see of this game the more I love it.,darksouls3,d1dbfst,1,t5_2w3z3

Trying a Sorcery build and the magic all just feels so weak.Just learned about Scholar of the First Sin last night and was pretty unhappy about how that ended up working out. From what I heard about it though with the enemy placement changes or rather just upping the number of enemies in each area like x just sounds like a lot of what I found problematic with the game from the start just got compounded even more anyways.,darksouls3,d1finlh,1,t5_2w3z3

Of course there are exceptions and it can be done but financially for a company like this it is virtually impossible to do a move like that mainly because this one game is going to make up the vast majority of their revenue for this quarter or year for that matter. EA is different because the company is large enough that it can be digested and booked with other releases and revenues from other games.Delays are far easier in contrast and usually more financially reasonable.EDIT for clarity You breach a distribution agreement then many stores wont be able to stock the game early. Customers will divert their money towards downloading the game instead hurting revenue at these physical copy distributors. They dont like this hence the distribution agreements. EASony can eat the costs of reworking these agreements because their revenue is diverse and significantly larger.,darksouls3,d1kla0h,0,t5_2w3z3

7097617,0,t3_4crr7n,gtNonAmericanslmaoAnyways the builds are the same as previous souls games. Its a PvE game where nearly everything is viable so just play whats comfortable. My first playthroughs have always consisted of StrFth  Pyromancy and this time was no different. Because Pyromancy requires stat investment this time around I wasnt able to acquire the truly useful stuff until later in the game. There is one pyromancy in particular that I imagine will see wide spread use due to its low requirements low FP consumption and great damage. It just seems like its objectively above a few other attacks across the board.So if youve got some similar interests just go into it knowing full well that youll have to put some points early on into FthInt if you want the flashy stuff as soon as possible. Its not as easy to rock this type of build as in the previous two titles but its still viable nonetheless.As for more specific buildsmeta type shit I assume youll actually have to wait for the community at large to decide on that.  ,darksouls3,d1kvvu0,2,t5_2w3z3

7099869,0,t1_d1kvq0n,gt On the topic of which I dont know if Im a weirdo or something but spoilers dont bother me that much. Id prefer not to have things spoiled obviously and I am excited that for the first time ever I get to go into a Souls game mostly blind but for me the experience of playing the game itself is such a different thing from merely hearing about it that I honestly havent ever really suffered for being spoiled. Some exceptions to this are extremely story heavy games like the Witcher  for example. If someone had spoiled the major plot points for me Id have been pissed.I actually had a considerable amount of Game of Thrones and Witcher  spoiled for me and I still loved both media.  When I get spoiled I just take it as an opportunity to look for the little details and things that the characters and nonspoiled audience would miss but I with my omniscient spoiler powers do not miss.,darksouls3,d1l53q9,3,t5_2w3z3

That just seems so completely divorced from reality as to be insane. For example I wasnt a huge fan of DaS so Im not going to have as fond memories of the weapons since they dont feel as good to use  theyre trapped in a mechanically worse game and were my companion through poorlydesigned levels. The DeS DaS and BB weapons are more beloved to me because theyre more fun to use since the combat in their games is better and when you use them youre playing some of the greatest games ever made.

7176698,0,t3_4drec1,Seeing as how the discussion has turned to Vitality and how it might work I thought Id provide some numbers.Equip load is  units at  VIT with every level of VIT granting  additional unit up to I think  VIT. Cutting that down to the  breakpoint we get a base  units with . added for every VIT level.On average Light Sets weigh  units Medium Sets weigh  units and Heavy Sets weigh  units. Weapons vary much more within each type but know that the lightest weigh around  unit and the heaviest weigh .To demonstrate how this might effect builds say I start as a Warrior. I would have  starting equip load with  levels in VIT. If I wanted to use Havels Set which weighs a whopping . units and I wanted keep my current weapon and shield which weigh . units in total and I want to keep under  equip load I would need if Im doing my math right  levels in VIT a total value of  VIT. EDIT Now lets say I want to use the Lothric Knight Greatshield  units. Now we are at  levels in VIT a total of  VIT. And if I want to grab a Claymore  units?  levels in VIT a total of  VIT.So draw your own conclusions but to me it seems that this change is offset by the sheer investment needed to equip heavy gear.,darksouls3,d1txb5x,23,t5_2w3z3

On the other you have the people who think the reason the game is any good in the first place is because only the people who are actually willing to put the time and energy into gitting gud are experiencing what the games have to offer and the more exclusive it is the better,darksouls3,d1u1rbv,0,t5_2w3z3

7192512,0,t3_4dsyct,IMO theres no reason for any game to have an easy mode. the game i always come back to is counter strike because the skill curve is so steep and someone is always better than me every win feels earned. Its similar in souls. I rage out i quit sometimes and sometimes I absolutely hate it. But beating that boss I have trouble with killing that enemy i hadnt figured out is really a segue into the rest of life. People always say you can do whatever you put your mind into and its very cliche but DS CS and any game that doesnt hold your hand is very similar. It takes presence of mind and willpower to get through like everything else in life. I do like games that are easy in that sometimes I like to be told an interactive story but they dont have the same feel when youve beaten them as a souls game or a win in a competitive PvP game. Similar to exercise especially weightlifting for me its that feeling of doing better than you could before that really boosts your confidence and helps you in other facets of life that you wouldnt necessarily expect.,darksouls3,d1vq8xg,1,t5_2w3z3

Overall the starting class doesnt matter unless youre minmaxing for a specific PvP SL and its not that important there either.,darksouls3,d1wa661,2,t5_2w3z3

7198118,0,t1_d1wd1tw,Do you really think so? Is the effect greater in practice than what youve shown in the video?Because it seems to me like theres at most a couple of frames of difference between capped and base speed and thats negligible for PvP. It wont make a noticeable increase in DPS it wont make an otherwise easy to dodge spell too fast to react to so its basically useless  I just see no benefit to it. Those couple of frames could let you cast the spell in some situations when you wouldnt be able to otherwise but I think that those very few cases will be outweighed by the benefits of another ring.Obviously Im talking from secondhand information here so I defer to your firsthand experience  but I suspect I wont be running the ring on my pure sorcerer based on the video.,darksouls3,d1wd8rz,2,t5_2w3z3

7201381,0,t3_4e3knx,DS is slower paced and more tactical. Stamina is consumed in larger chunks and refills slower meanwhile defensive actions dodgingblocking consumed more stamina as well.DS borrows a lot from Bloodborne which is much more faster paced. Stamina management is easier and refills faster. This makes combat much more fluid and responsive while also reducing downtime due to stamina starvation.Animations on the other hand are mostly the same.

7204589,0,t1_d1w84gk,I finished the game I am not going to spoil anything but do not expect anything from the story.My biggest problem with the game was the mechanically flawed roll. Heavy and medium roll are absolutely useless and fast roll is meh due to bad hitboxes.I have notice the game for a pve only experience is very bad balanced. Heavy armor is far better than anything and some weapons can stun lock any enemy over and over if you learn to perfect time attacks. For example the moment I found a good pole arm I simply double handed that shit and stun locked the world.Another thing really bugged me was the bosses attack patterns.I dont know if you noticed but most bosses have preset attack combos so once they start the first animation they will continue until the entire combo ends. This means that you can either fight them normally like you would a souls boss or simply stay at medium distance waiting them to start the animation stay back for a few seconds poke them and repeat.The only reason i died in boss fights after I realized that was because I tried the challenges to have the legendary weapons.Overall one of the worst souls like out there.Which is a pity because the mechanics of the combat were in theory really cool just bad implemented. Also literally no enemy variety ,darksouls3,d1x3rec,1,t5_2w3z3

7228770,0,t1_d1zulyc,yeah its pretty lame but has its use. Its very strong early game and stays strong if you upgrade them so its not like its a waste but it kind of removes your incentive to level up STR and DEX for anything other than the minimum requirements. Thats not totally a bad thing Im sure Sorcerors will be able to make good use of them so they can focus on INT and ATT. But for a qualitySTRDEX build? eventually youre going to want to pick up something with scaling.

7238483,0,t3_4ej2ej,WHITE SCREEN SOLVEDAt least for me hope this helps! This problem was widespread for the Kepler  series of Nvidia.Specs i QM .GHz Nvidia GeForce GTX M Gb RAM Windows  SCP driver for PS ControllerWhat I did First and foremost check if your driver is up to date Mine wasnt at first. I used Geforce experience to update the driver Open up Nvidia Control Panel go to D settings gt Manage D settings gt Program Settings gt Select Darksoulsiii.exe you might need to add it gt Select Graphics Processor as Integrated Graphics only temporary gt Apply Open up steam and go offline only temporary you might as well check the game cache right now Right click on game gt Properties gt Local files gt Verify game cache I did it but it is optional. Now as good measure open up your task manager before starting the game because you might need to check your RAM. Press CtrlAltDel gt Start task manager gt Performance Keep that open while Dark Souls runs because you might get a spike in RAM that leads to a crash and then you can monitor how much RAM the game uses in the spike. So you might need to close a few programs. Run Dark Souls  you will get the white screen but it should go black after about  seconds and after about  more the Bandai Namco logo will show. Before playing the game go to settings and set your resolution to p or even p Antialiasing should be off and put lighting to low. I also set the graphics to medium because you will get framerate issues especially in the tutorial after that its fine. Close the game Go to Nvidia Control Panel select the High performance Nvidia processor Go online on steam Play the gameI really really hope this helps! I tried various fixes since the release at am GMT and I spend many many hours getting here. I dont know if all my steps are completely necessary but these are the ones I performed and worked for me.

You will learn how to read enemies and attack their weaknesses. You will learn how to grind and upgrade your character until they can take out weak enemies with one swipe.

7244984,0,t1_d21otdy,Yeah fair point. I suppose it depends on how you interpret the lore of the game.For instance I think almost every character in Dark Souls is just a reincarnation of themselves time after time game after game. I suppose Andre could literally be the same Andre but I thought it was more likely that it is actually a new Andre who ended up with the same name because its his purpose time after time to stay his steadfast blacksmith self.Whereas people like Patches change slightly with each reincarnation and transform into Pate who is still an asshole at heart but slightly less so than kickingyouintoahole patches. I just think that the knight who has your estus this time around is Oscar again because Oscars forever destiny is to be a tragic case of a knight who gets unlucky in his quest before it ever really starts but in doing so provides you the true chosen with the gift of life estus in his death.,darksouls3,d21pb0d,5,t5_2w3z3

Also youll get backup from the covenant blues quite often. I had a couple gankers there but I also was rolling with two other invaders so they quickly turned into giant brawls which some of the most fun Ive had invading so far.You could probably still get some action in the swamp where there are covenant blues as well and lots of cover to fight them guerrilla style.,darksouls3,d21smar,2,t5_2w3z3

Even the starting gear for the different classes can be found throughout the world.  So whenever you find yourself asking can class x do... the answer is automatically yes.The sidestep youre talking about is a weapon skill.

Besides dude theyre not that hard. You seem to have decided that what you are doing which isnt working should work and that therefore the game is unfair. Thats not an attitude that takes you very far in any Dark Souls game. When what youre doing doesnt work change what youre doing andor git gud.

Soul Arrow will do much greater damage compared to the dart yet wont do a great amount compared to someone with a higher INT investment.I would say Soul arrow should do  damage compared to your  damage dart. For further comparison Heavy Soul arrow would do around . More or less depending on an enemies magic resistance.Cast time is another factor. Farron Dart casts much faster then Soul Arrow while Soul arrow casts much faster then Heavy Soul Arrow.,darksouls3,d22qyl5,1,t5_2w3z3

7254922,0,t1_d22tqm4,imbuing it adds different scaling or damage for instance putting fire on a weapon reduced the scaling it gains with strdex but adds flat fire damage in ds this was worse for late game as your stats will ultimately add more damage. adding a sharm gem imbue increases dex scaling  but decreases str scaling. this is independent from adding titanite to your weapon it still can get to a  when sharp is on the weapon. also note you can take the fire imbue off a weapon with a different imbue so if fire looks nice now but you want sharp scaling later on with higher dex you can remove it and add a different imbue. ,darksouls3,d22tzr3,2,t5_2w3z3

7263528,0,t1_d23ql3n,Starting as either the Knight class or Deprived will net you the best longterm results but that depends entirely on your learning style... Knight starts with the absolute most forgiving set of gear and stats you can begin the game with and lets you get through a healthy chunk of the game without needing to swap your gear. Deprived on the other hand is godawful stats and gearwise. You dont even get a parry option for dealing with Iudex. The reason I say this class is one of the best to start with however is because it forces you to learn to dodge. The plank shield is worse for blocking than many of the weapons in the game and it doesnt even have the decency to be able to parry. The only way to progress to the point where you get better weapons and armor is to figure out the games evasion system early and abuse the hell out of openings.The biggest advantage to starting as deprived however is that you can immediately get into Fashion Souls without suffering a dropoff in performance. Thats pure endgame right there my friend.,darksouls3,d23t8hn,3,t5_2w3z3

The reason people keep cosplaying Guts isnt just cause hes cool. Its also easy to emotionally connect to him and his troubles due to the brilliant writing. In short its not just murder porn. I was very discouraged from trying the series out due to how people usually sell it so I figured I should add some words I would have liked to see myself  If jumping into a long manga feels daunting I recommend taking a look at the  episode long anime.

I had the most recent Geforce drivers installed on release day and I was getting diabolically bad performance and the bonfire crash bug at the High Wall of Lothric bonfire every time completely reproducible.After reading a comment about people with XX series cards rolling back drivers I rolled mine back to . which are from April last year. Performance for me was around  better and Ive had no crash issues with bonfires at all.To get legacy drivers from Nvidia go to their site to the dropdown Drivers menu. There is an option called Beta amp Legacy. Im running Windows  but I started getting a lot of problems with games crashing in general since I upgraded from . which was very stable. Version . is the earliest driver they had available for series cards and .bit so I went with that. I also made sure that Windows update wouldnt try to install any drivers itself.So far Ive had a total of  random crashes  hours played time after doing this and some occasional severe performance problems in a couple of areas with lots of candles probably related to their deferred lighting.,darksouls3,d249jle,3,t5_2w3z3

Your example and conclusion are a non sequitur. I might as well complain magic doesnt oneshot the clams in Crystal Caves enemies specifically resistant to the damage Im using therefore magic is unusable and PvP is broken. That conclusion does not follow.Then youre lashing out like a little kid.If youre going to complain about PvP make your example about PvP.

Heh.If you did always keep your weight load  under . And if you want better armor make sure to augment your vitality.I went with a medium armor set black knight  silver knight armor with a one handed sword and shield.I put about  vigor for the hp then just enough in dex for my dex requirements and pump everything else into str end and vitality.Anything with magic and you would need to ask other people for help the only magic I ever used was weapon buff spells.Hope I helped in some way.

7280529,0,t1_d25qibs,The first number is the base damage of the weapon. The second number is the bonus damage gained from the weapons scaling with your stats. Different weapons scale differently with different stats but they all have a scaling indicator ranging from E the lowest through D C B A and S the highest. its possible that a weapon doesnt scale with any stats and it will just be blank rather than having a letterSo a weapon with an S scaling in strength means it is best utilised if you have a high strength. A weapon with a C in strength and a C in dexterity benefits equally from both.A weapons base damage and its stat scaling can be upgraded by a blacksmith. A sword with  base and a D in strength could end up with  base an a B in strength when fully upgraded for example.,darksouls3,d25qxai,2,t5_2w3z3

7285441,0,t1_d25qhdr,Well I guess some points are more controversial than others but I think that perhaps I wasnt very clear with these down here  You could play the game invasion free in the second game by burning an effigy as well. Thing is it gave you the oportunity of doing pvp while hollow not embered if you wanted whats not the case here. So you got more options there.  I am impressed that you liked this system. Sadly most probably dont like the idea of getting stunlocked to hell by  guys spamming R. I certainly dont. I cant see most people invading after a couple of days getting owned again and again without being able to fight back.  No you cannot black separation crystal out when you are the host. The problem here is when you are the host not the invader. Only thing the host can do is either kill himself or unplug the modem risking a softban.  Dueling with soapstones still allow estus chugging problem persists unless you count in the good will of people for not healing at all.  might be a matter of taste I supose but still it feels we get too much of too few stamina in a game thats faster thats not very good.  framerate isnt an issue in the ps? Its a nightmare in the Xbox one and PC. I was playing dark souls  literally  minutes before logging in the third game at the release time it felt like I was playing a stop motion movie.  I dont think sword arts are that great. Sharing the bar with mana also make me feels weird about using it.  Yes I dont like shields either never liked them and probably never will. I am feeling forced to use them now. Thing is its VERY unlikely you will get to kick any player that often  kicks in a row will only happen if his block button is broken and he cant lower his shield hehe.   Kicks arent a very reliable way to break guard because you neverk now the enemy stamina. The window to do a riposte is also pretty small and when you count the lag it makes it even harder to use as you never know when you will actually break him. Guard breaks in the second game were slower but when you landed them you knew you would be able to do a riposte.,darksouls3,d26b0s6,1,t5_2w3z3

7292355,0,t3_4f9va2,Ok so firstly Pyromancy and Fire infusions scale with both Faith and Intelligence equally.  So having  intfaith for pyro is the same as having  intelligence for sorcery raw weapons remove ALL scaling and increase the weapons base damage.  This is one way to go.In theory Dex is a good melee stat for a pryo ad Dex supposedly increases casting speed but in reality pick a weapon you like and put something into the primary scaling stat.OR find a weapon you like and infuse with fire it will reduce physical scaling and add intelligence and faith scaling like Pyromancy.Im not too far in and I am not sure what to do for my primary weapon the Katana is a little slow for my taste and I am really liking the longsword having good speed and versatile moveset considering throwing fire onto a longsword and not worrying too much about Dex If anyone has a truly inspired weapon choice let me know,darksouls3,d273bcp,1,t5_2w3z3

Maintaining the correct distance and getting a sense of your opponent for example.This movie also looks interesting. Those  bits of advice at the end are definitely relatable. You must feel what your opponent is doing and respond before he can threaten you you must feel the right moments to attack and you have to clear your mind.,darksouls3,d275lne,8,t5_2w3z3

7293140,0,t1_d275o1s,Thank you for writing an actual reply. The amount of git gud is appalling honestly and an incredibly vile stance for a community to have regardless of the type of game.Could you tell me what you even mean by changing tactics? Unless Im mistaken at least in the early stages of the game most encounters revolve around avoidingblocking attacks and countering when they are in lagtime. Blocking appears significantly less useful when fighting big enemies so that leaves dodging. I can dodge stuff decently but this becomes nearly impossible if an add comes around and if youre dodging everything you will generally be low on stamina when theyre in recoil.Dying is fine hell even being forced to reclear trash isnt the worst thing in the world but dying due to physics is just awful.One more note about the git gud nonsense Im not a fucking moron I know how to play video games.

7295989,0,t3_4f8xkh,The Astora Greatsword is fantastic in PvP owing entirely to its moveset. It also gets great scaling when either Refined or infused with something magic Chaos or Lightning ideally. Its base damage is low but its moveset and scaling make up for it.Its weapon art is the spear Charge which is pretty useful.Poise does work but it only comes into play when youre midattack. It doesnt do anything when youre standing still. Its most noticeable when you do switch from a light fast weapon to a slow heavy weapon and see what happens when you get hit midswing. Poise increases the nonstagger frames hyperarmor you get while attacking. For lighter weapons it takes a ton of poise to see a difference but it does affect heavier weapons.And are we sure the Greatsword is going to get nerfed?

So if someone bows at you only bow back if you plan to not use estus. I could be wrong about this but Im pretty sure these are the general rules. Oh and just because youre not bowing back doesnt mean you should attack them when theyre bowing.

The other thing to realize is a LOT of players are new to the souls series with this game. And when i say a lot i mean its almost split in half right now  veterans  new people.

7304253,0,t3_4ffaex,Id say that many play it this way and it has happened to me as well. I dont like the rushing much but I do like coop play the derping playing together.. I like to coop first to check an area out and sometimes its just tempting to just summon people and see where it goes. I check out the area afterwards because I hate to miss stuff and often I regret being dragged through a boss because I usually dont feel like I can beat an area or even boss alone. Which is bullshit if I play like intended its possible. The impatience. To be honest I even bought the game directly when it was out to be able to coop as much as possible. Dark Souls  and I have  hours on the game  playthroughs often left me very desperate during the first playthrough when I failed on bosses and no one was there to summon for help. I bought the game rather late and had a bad connection often. In the end I somehow managed but I never enjoyed playing a boss battle for  times in my own game and alone. Funny enough usually when I have beaten a boss I do coop a lot. Got really good at the Ornstein and Smough boss battle and enjoyed it. I had a character only for this.Dont know. Its great to conquer and area  thats how it feels. But sometimes I wanna get over with some places I really hate.,darksouls3,d28g0cf,2,t5_2w3z3

7305609,0,t1_d28ldqx,I couldnt disagree with you more. A solid  of the weapons are trash tier in pvp. Spell casting is essentially worthless. Armor is almost purely cosmetic which makes vitality worthless.  is way too high of a SL meta and each build is basically just an endurancevigor capped quality build or if you feel like gimping yourself for some reason you can waste points in int or faith. Right now there is basically zero reason to touch half of the stats in the game unless youre gimping yourself for the sake of diversity. Part of this is the fault of the community  is way too high of a SL when so many stat options are currently worthless. These have always felt like pve games with the pvp system thrown on for flavor not competitive pvp games and DS seems to take that to a new level. ,darksouls3,d28ljyn,1,t5_2w3z3

7306799,0,t3_4fh3dm,I gank spank like no bodys business in this game but I have in most souls games bar  I didnt really like it and likely have a very ridiculous win rate. I hated DSs pvp at first... and tbh even though now Ive adapted to it and am getting the crazy win streaks that I got in the others its probably still my least favourite pvp. I think its mostly because of how... plain it feels? It lacks the excitement unfairness and complexity of DSs pvp lacks the freshness style and surprising depth of the weapons in Bloodbornes pvp and I dont get quite the same kick out of it even as I did in Demons  The weapons are honestly a let down too. I just pick whatever has a  good weapon art attack that I can implement into my moveset to make it a bit more complex than just R... And fucking recovery frames. There aint enough of em. xxsniperxx with his katana is just fucking sprinting around the entire map for  minutes hoping to wear you down with his fucking katana running attack while you scratch your head and wonder how he finds it fucking fun to do so.

7308143,0,t3_4fhp7z,Its a bit complicated but the bottom line is that you have to be above a certain AR via leveling and upgrades before duel wielding begins to shine. Thus insofar as I understand it the only advantage to using your twosword attack early game is stagger.The complicated reason is as followsEvery enemy has a DEF stat. This gets subtracted from your AR when you do a single hit of damage. So the amount of damage that you actually do to the enemy is about AR  DEF. When you do your twosword attack this ultimately counts as two hits but the AR for each hit is lower than it is for a onesword attack. Say its  of your AR or .AR. However since its still two hits the enemys DEF is subtracted off twice. So the amount of damage you do  is .AR  .AR  DEF  .AR  DEF. Without going through the algebra then it turns out that this only become greater than or equal to AR  DEF onesword attack damage when your AR is greater than or equal to DEF.,darksouls3,d28vwq7,3,t5_2w3z3

In DS the Katana was fast if you used the RBs as it should be since Katanas are DESIGNED for speed. But not in  for some reason. Besides my gripe isnt with the katanas slowness. Its the fact that people can swing a massive chunk of rock on a stick about as though it has the weight of a thread of string.  I will say things are better with my current build Painting Curved Sword but even so thats because it has RIDICULOUS stun abilities which I myself admit is complete BS.

7319389,0,t3_4fmtun,Parrying is just hard to time and not all attacksenemies can be parried. PvP also fucks it up at times due to latencySouls trademark shoddy netcode. Otherwise shields are mainly an emergency measure for blocking attacks that youre not good at dodging but theyre not as reliable in DaS as in previous games because most of the stronger enemies and other players will guard break you with ease.For dodging its best to do it just before you get hit rather than when you see the attack winding up. A lot of attacks track during the windup so theyll just turn around and hit you anyway. The dodge briefly makes you invincible so once youre good at it the optimal way to play is just to dodge through attacks.Giving Estus Shards to Andre gets you more flasks burning Undead Bone Shards at the Firelink bonfire makes your flasks heal more per use.,darksouls3,d2a5xbj,1,t5_2w3z3

Chatting with some other people on steam forums some guy said that a friend of his managed to solve the problem by using WTFast. I tested and it worked but just for some hours. On the other day no matter what server of WTFast i connect in i was still banned.Here is the screenshot of the pvp area right after i installed WTFast.Ill edit this comment if i find out more information about it. I tested the family share for a new account but you cannot transfer the saved game file anymore the game wont load the file. At least it didnt work for me. If you gonna use family share you will need to start a new game.edit Btw I never used cheat engine in this game or any other game. The only thing i did that was considered to be rule breaking is making backup of my saves back in dark souls  and i still have those files but i have being doing this for k hours and never got softbanned the same can be said for hundreds of other people that i know. You would only be softbanned in ds if you use cheat engine or mods.

7325158,0,t1_d2at6zl,well its not really abusing a mechanic.  the environment is there as a sort of usable buffer for invaders.   Say for instance youve got  other phantoms with you if I invaded Im already on the back foot with half of my estus available and a  on  setup.  My only recourse is to thin you three out so trying to bait you and your helpers into traps and enemies is how Im going to do it.Full reliance on teh environment though does get boring and personally I view it as kind of a cowards way of handling it.   If the host isnt taking the bait then I need to either force the hand by outright attacking to put some blood in the water or BC out.Again thats how I handle those types of things when Im invading others will disagree as is their right to do so.   Just from the standpoint of a vet from demons to BB as an invader my goal is the death of you and your friends if I cant make that happen and I only have one string to my bow then I have no business invading you.,darksouls3,d2atjgw,2,t5_2w3z3

All of this only to realize that magic is slow I cant juke with  of the spells and I do less damage than everybody I have ever foughts hit combo.inb Just freeaim you scrub So what youre telling me is that a schlongsword has  degree tracking comes out faster than any spell in the game including the basic Combustion and can do more damage with a  hit combo than most of the spells? This is not balanced. Spells need tracking.

7328280,0,t3_4fo0nt,So a lot of that sounds like its the lag. I have the same issue where its like my hits dont connect but theres do or it looks like I blatantly missed but its an attack so know thats an issue. You can try turning off cross region play to help that. First off find a weapon you like. If you have a weapon you wreck shop with in pve I feel like its likely youll wreck shop with it in pvp. As far as tactics everyone has their own play style so you need to find one that works for you. What I do personally is play very much in peoples faces. Ill get right on top of them with my shield up and most times they go crazy rolling around not sure what to do. By the time I start attacking and they try to block their stamina is so low that Ill break their block and get some good hits in. Then Ill change up my attack patterns a bit and start just hitting once and dodging away whether it be an actual hit to them or their shield. Then Ill switch back to the other tactic here and there. Really for me its just about being unpredictable and changing it up. Ive been in some pretty epic  or  minute battles where were going back and forth a lot and its a really good fight. One thing I learned too is if theyre not attacking you a lot theyre probably nervous and afraid of getting hit. Capitalize on that and just be as aggressive as you can because theyll usually slip up. Also youre gonna die a lot. I win maybe  of my matches and I feel like thats a pretty good percentage. Im new to pvp in these games but its really addicting. Its stalled my overall game progress for sure. ,darksouls3,d2b6bz1,1,t5_2w3z3

7328863,0,t1_d2b7zhn,I am of the opinion that it still IS an epic fight but maybe Im just one of those people that think bugs just make the game more EXTREME.The first half is like a gimmick fight. And because of how its supposed to be beaten you dont really want to spend the whole fight locked onto the boss. You kinda have to be running around and constantly having to refocus on where the boss is. And then the second half feels like the Gywn fight on crack and its great. Quick hits like a truck and is hard to predict. Its definitely an embersink boss. It gave me more challenge than the strew of endgame bosses the game throws at you all of which only took me a couple tries while playing smartslow. It feels like the real final boss of the game to me and was very epic and well executed. Not saying the actual final boss wasnt either of those things just that this guy gave me more of a challenge. ,darksouls3,d2b8py3,1,t5_2w3z3

The catch is you cant see these unless you are embered. You become embered whenever you defeat a boss or when you use one of the ember items. You can also purchase a white sign soapstone from the handmaiden at firelink shrine. This lets you lay down your own summon sign in other peoples games so they can summon you. If you beat a boss with them you also become embered as well as getting an ember item. The game is hard but youre not in it alone. ,darksouls3,d2cas7z,1,t5_2w3z3

He even recognized the  kings who ruled New Londo a seperate kingdomcity as wise kings and thus gave them a piece of his lord soul so they could show power cementing their legitimacy to the people. Then theres Lost Izalith which was its own citystate kingdom that was mostly destroyed so we could only visit the heart of the city and some outlying ruins etc.. but its still a kingdom nonetheless. Overall i would say theres thisGwyns Kingdom  Anor Londo  Undead Burg where his servants lived  Sens Fortress gate to entering anor londo  OolacileDarkroot amp the Dukes Archives  Crystal Caves where the nobility lived such as Princess dusk Duke Seath etc..  Undead Parish Church where Gwyns Servants from the Burg worshipped him and his family although could have something to do with Velka... and lastly Firelink Shrine Where the first flame isWitch of Izaliths kingdom  Lost Izalith  Demon Ruins  parts of Blighttown Kings Kingdom  New Londo  Parts of the Valley of the DrakesNitos realm  Catacombs  Tomb of the Giants.,darksouls3,d2ccb1y,1,t5_2w3z3

7339769,0,t1_d2ch3zn,Well I do like to figure that out I just think what I find are optimal strats is not fun gameplay. Im at a part where I have to fight one guy with a with a hand saw i wait for him to lunge roll swing roll away etc. repeat. I can kill him without getting touched.And then I come upon an area where theyre launching spears down on you. They kill  enemies immediately. I then have to run forward aggro the  enemies there and wait for the  spears to take them out. Then I run forward and aggro the hammer guy and wait for them to take HIM out....Just stuff like that isnt fun to me I guess. Waiting rolling... baiting. I would rather play an RPG where upgrade my stats made me feel stronger as a character and this game is more about memorization and execution than progression. Not having played against an enemy before is a huge disadvantage and usually after going for a little ways you feel like restarting at the last checkpoint because its not optimal to keep going forward.

7341295,0,t1_d2cfjxy,This is by far the best and quickest farming location Ive discovered. In NG with the shield of want symbol of avarice and silver serpent ring  they drop k souls per winged knight. If you have the shortcut unlocked from the grand archives bonfire a single run takes about  to  minutes. They also drop large titanite shards frequently and often chunks. Slabs are very rare but I have seen one drop from them too. I got about  levels worth  in about  minutes. edit the extra  souls from shield of want only works when its equipped and used.,darksouls3,d2cnllk,3,t5_2w3z3
7341321,0,t1_d2cjsui,There are pyromancies that do dark damage such as black fire orb amp black flame. There are also dark miracles amp dark sorceries that scale off both int amp faith like pyro if you use the right talisman or catalyst. None of the dark sorceries require more than  int and none of the dark miracles require more than  faith. Right around where the scaling peters out. The highest int amp faith requirement for pyromancies are both .

7342769,0,t1_d2ct52z,Its just a fast weapon with decent damage and dex scaling and its buffable  infusable.Its easy to get an Estoc to  have  dex a bit of str  int faith and pump the rest into defensive statsendurance and do very well in every aspect of the game and its brainless to achieve. Theres not much unique about the build.Also poise is pretty much useless in DS. In old DS games if you had high poise you would never get stunned by attacks. In Darksouls  poise only clicks in when youre attacking. So if you have super high poise and swing your super slow UGS you can get it off even if you get hit.Problem is its useless to waste the slotsweightstats to get super high poise because the moment you get hit when youre NOT attacking you still get stunlocked even by dinky little weapons like Estocs.So since theres no battle between building high poiseusing a weapon strong enough to break poise people just use dinky fast weapons with strong scalingenchantments to spam fast attacks and stunlock people.Theres a slew of decent weapons that fit this category Estoc is just one of them and its super easy to get too. I think once the PvP scene dies down a bit and its mostly really good players well see Estoc lose popular because its easy to parry. Many larger weapons have attacks that cant be parried so using those attacks with good timing is actually the best strategy if your opponent is a good player.,darksouls3,d2ctmee,2,t5_2w3z3

7349541,0,t1_d2djeb6,I definitely agree that its deliberately intended for players to bridge the gaps between the scattered puzzle pieces that make up the series lore.One of the biggest problems I had with Dark Souls II was that the gaps between the pieces were far too large to the point that several major bosses and plot points were basically left unexplained. The game relied on the player to come up with significant chunks of the lore on their own where as the other games had nearly all the answers in the game and trusted the players to make the connections. To me this difference severely hampered my enjoyment of the game especially coming off of a game that handled it so magnificently.I understand that timebudget constraints due to the rewrite hampered the developers ability to replicate the style and feel properly but I also think that Miyazaki has a natural knack for lore crafting that is very difficult to imitate even with plenty of time to work. Its just a talent and talent is hard to copy.Shifting gears a bit Im curious why you think Lothian could be the Old Dragonslayer. To my knowledge nothing connects the two in any way.

7354800,0,t3_4g36f7,The Glaive Black Knight Glaive Red Hilted Halberd and Gundyrs Halberd are the best halberd weapons in the game. The glaive is obtained froms Greirat after sending him out to loot after killing the CurseRotted Greatwood. The BKG and Gundyrs Halberd are found ins The Untended Graves  accessed after killing Oceiros by attacking the illusory wall behind the chest  in Champion Gundyrs boss arena. After killing him you can transpose his soul for Gundyrs Halberd. Depending on your stats the different halberds will give you better damage. The BKG and the Glaive will give the highest damage if youre a  quality build and put a Refined gem on the Glaive Id suggest the Glaive because the BKGs power attack is a bit hit and miss. The Red Hilted Halberd is going to have slightly less damage but has a different moveset that you might find more appealing the R is a spearlike thrust. Gundyrs Halberd is going to be best for a Strengthheavy build but is also the heaviest. It has a unique weapon art that makes it incredibly good for invasionbased PvP where you need to be able to punish people for drinking estusrunning away but if youre just PvEing I would stay away from it as the GlaiveBKG have much better weapon arts for PvE.,darksouls3,d2e6v5e,1,t5_2w3z3

7360304,0,t1_d2eqb4u,Its quite clear the developers dont want to remove the invading. They have NPC invaders for crying out loud. Its more like they have made the game more accessible by giving the invaded a couple of perks. Doesnt matter. They all die in the end. It just seems like you dont enjoyarent that good at PvP and therefore feel that the mechanic is flawed while it clearly isnt. Like you said the invaded has a lot of perks. Should be an easy win no?I guess we just have to agree to disagree. Just remember that your opinion isnt fact and acting as though it is and that the developers feel the same way you do comes of as boorish. Ive yet to get a single good reason to remove invasions other than it bothers you to get killed which shouldnt hinder you to like a series that once named a game Prepare to die edition.Forced PvP is part of the experience and the Soulsborne series would be weaker without it. ,darksouls3,d2ete3e,1,t5_2w3z3

7363685,0,t1_d2f6k7m,So the issues with Soul Memory gtIts not an issue at high level in the ultimate bracket of m souls but at low level gameplay  A bad player dying constantly and losing all his bloodstains will be slowly matched against better and optimized players which didnt lose any souls and only used them to level up. Making the experience of a player already struggling even worse. Bow  crossbow builds are doomed at creation since buying arrows and bolts will increase your soul memory again while you dont use them to level up. Before the agape ring it actually prevented low level playthrough pvp cooperation. And if you dont like to fight against level  players well tough luck you constantly have to create a new character. And even the agape ring forced you to use a ring slot. It made cooperation harder since if you did cooperation in a same zone for a long time your Soul Memory would slowly get higher and higher and ultimately you wouldnt be able to summon or be summoned.My issues with Soul Memory is that it punishes every little fault forever it punishes fun and force optimisation. Its annoying as heck to feel that a character can be deleted as soon as you lose m souls.The Agape ring made some things better but still that wasnt the best solution. You couldnt buy consumables anymore ammunitions anything. You were forced to stay with what you had.,darksouls3,d2f78aa,16,t5_2w3z3

7366551,1,t1_d2fi7up,Toggleescaping is probably intended to some extent. It was popular in Demons Souls and they kept it for Dark Souls and then never patched it.Dead angling isnt that important. You can be good without it. Its just another option against turtles and most turtles arent that hard to kill anyway. In addition you cant even do it with many weapons.Anyway if these things drastically improve the depth and balance of the game why does it matter where they come from? Theyre there now. Theyll never be removed at this point. ,darksouls3,d2fiy2t,-1,t5_2w3z3

The primordial man.So the same thing the abyss is made from is also the same thing humans are made from  The Dark Soul.  While there are beings referred to as Lords of Cinder in this game we dont see any actual Lords  IE The race of Gwyn and his kind which were born from the Fire Soul.I believe DS takes place after the Lord of Dark ending in DS.  Like way after it.  Rejecting the fire in DS leads to an Age of Dark where the world is rebuilt by humans without the influence of gods.

7376243,0,t1_d2gc29c,Well in regards to that consider this The very first merchant in the game The hag in firelink shrine sells the same Catalyst and spells the Sorcerer starts with.  The Knight starts with  INT.  So if you just put one point into INT your Knight can cast spells.  There are no Class specific weapons in the game.  Nothing that says Knight only  Pyromancer only etc.   All that matters is stats.   Infact by raising a Knights INT to   levels very easy early on a Knight becomes able to cast a host of useful utility spells including Magic Shield Magic Weapon Spook No footstep sounds  no fall damage if not fatal Cast Light Hidden Weapon Hidden Body Chameleon White Branch effectFinally.  The Silver Eagle Kite Shield is a  physical block shield that requires  STR to wield but is available pretty early in the game after the second bonfire of High Wall of Lothric.  While the Sorceror does start with rather low strength  as soon as you add  levels of STR that Sorcerer has a shield just as good as the Knights starting shield.  Personally I think going from Knight gt MageKnight would be worlds easier than going from SquishyMage gt SquishyMage with a Shield early on.  But thats another option open to you. As an aside Dont think of it as being Forced to play a knight instead of the class I wanted.  Think of it as learning the techniques of a Sword and Board Knight so that you can use those skills once your mage finds a shield.,darksouls3,d2gmllb,2,t5_2w3z3

For the most part Souls youtubers both lore youtubers and PvP youtubers correction especially PvP youtubers are mostly positive about Dark Souls . And when it comes to Redgrave he wasnt being negative at Dark Souls  he went on record in a Bloodborne stream I was watching of him praising Dark Souls s mechanics saying that they are better than Dark Souls  which I agree with even though I generally like both games equally and when he was discussing his opinions about how Dark Souls  handled the lore of Dark Souls  he was displaying his disappointment about how it seems to be noncanonical at this point. He loves Dark Souls  so lets be clear on that. I wish hed hear the facts concerning the converging of the nations but meh hell hear it eventually.EDITWhat the hell is wrong with people and downvoting? Am I really getting all of this hate for merely defending Redfrave? Neither I nor Redgrave were criticizing Dark Souls .

I was really having fun with coop.Other random weirdness I saw today  One guy managed to summon  gold phantoms for the twin princes somehow.  Literally  people dogpiling the boss.  It was hilarious.  One player summoned me in to duo the NK fight and I noticed something was off right away because her character had no animation.  Just scooted across the ground without moving her legsarms at all.  We entered the boss fight and the NK did the same thing.  The boss never attacked.  It just scooted around the arena without any sort of animation and would not attack.  Took a while since we couldnt hit the wyverns ? head but we eventually whittled it down by smacking it in the feet.   I figured it would glitch out at the midpoint but nope!  The nd half of the fight was the same.  The NK sansanimation just scooted around the arena until we killed him.  Saw the postfight animation so I know he actually died.

7384097,0,t3_4ges98,Yeah Id say hosts and invaders can both be douchey. Gank squads were very common in DS and they seem to be in full swing again. Id prefer to fight an invader v but a lot of them run and hide in a group of enemies. And the seed from the giant tree only drops after you get invaded and its not in most peoples hot key bar. I always trade my first one to the crow anyway and only occasionally think to grab another. Could be fun though...But at the end of the day most people will do anything to win.

The Deep Soul spells have slower projectile speed but it doesnt really matter in PvE when they home in and have about the same range as normal Soul Arrows.Dark Pyromancy Pyromancy scales with both int and faith might as well use both regular and dark pyromancies and they also have roughly the same damage as each other.Dark Miracles horrible extremely slow cast time extremely slow projectile speed and they require multiple casts to get the bleed off. Regular offensive miracles are shit overall but dark miracles somehow manage to be worse.However there are problems all dark spells share monsters are really aggressive and fast in this game compared to DS so any magic build will have a tough time and there are certain mobs that have extremely high dark resist.,darksouls3,d2jf5x4,2,t5_2w3z3

7407871,0,t3_4gpc24,Yes magic is not super good in PvP because its easy to dodge. Honestly though it takes no skill to cast those spells at range so they SHOULD be fairly easy to dodge. It would be cool if there were more spells that worked in the context of close range combat. That said there should also be an accompanying reduction in melee effectiveness and that just isnt there. A magic or elemental infusion will give you damage as good or better than a pure physical character so it doesnt really cost you anything to invest in sorcery beyond wearing a little less armor and not getting greatshields which are for scrubs anyway.,darksouls3,d2k8645,0,t5_2w3z3

If youre playing an int build in pvp remember that your spells ARE NOT YOUR PRIMARY DAMAGE SOURCE. The main bonus of playing a sorceror in pvp is that you have SO MANY TOOLS AT YOUR DISPOSAL not that you can deal damage from range its the mixup potential. You can catch people by suprise with just the sheer amount of moves that you have. You dont have to be one shotting people for sorcery to be good. I rock around a  winrate with my int build using mgs at level  pvp. Use hornet ring and parry people who are predictable for one shot kills with mgs.

So whereas with a Target Shield etc. you hit the button and the parry window comes several frames later the parry window for the Caestus is shorter but nearly instant. Try parrying just a bit later than you would have with a shield. ,darksouls3,d2kww4q,1,t5_2w3z3

Its possible that when we kill Gwyn or Artorias or whoever that they do in fact respawn as the player would but we dont know where that would happen since they arent checking their progress at bonfires.

It plays a lot more like Dungeons and Dragons where the actual combat mechanics are okay but the opportunity for roleplaying and living in another world is incredible.  I play Dark Souls when I want to experience incredibly immersive and deep combat but I play Skyrim when I want to talk to people explore a world that feels like people live in it and just generally roleplay.Skyrim also has the modding community which the Souls series sadly lacks.  Could you imagine the community making side areas and weapons using the framework of the Soulsborne series?  That would be incredible.

7434989,0,t1_d2navlu,This subreddit is like the dota subreddit. Ask why you think its better get downvoted. Amazing. The DS bosses are hands down better though Ive never found the bosses in dark souls game to be such a big factor to my enjoyment. Its always been about the journey to them for me. The mobs do seem better placed in DS but I dont really feel there is that much variety at all. In DS every area felt like it had a theme to it which I dont get the same feeling of here. Sure they are clearly different areas but the mobs dont change that much. They frequently use the same skillsets as other mobs even when they look different.I do love that they are going back to the interconnected paths again though I feel like the areas are just a bit small. The interconnected paths was a great opportunity to massively expand these areas further. Much like you say really. DS was definitely the easiest game in the franchise. I feel that DS is harder purely because it was sped up though and the broken weaponry.Im trying to play the game with a greataxe right now and I cant stagger enemies that I hit before they hit me. If I pulled out a katana I could absolutely walk through DS due to the fast speed. Thats no fun though. I think that really is why I like DS more. The speed mechanics of the game are just so wrong in DS and the lack of poise is brutal. I know Ill adapt and find a way to make it all work without relegating myself to the current meta of quick and stabby but it doesnt feel as fun as it did in DS. ,darksouls3,d2nb75p,1,t5_2w3z3

You have ultragreatswords that do only  damage over the Dark Sword. Its ridiculous. The Dark Sword doesnt need to be nerfed the other weapons need to be buffed. The lack of the Blue Eye Orb and dueling arenas is something I dont understand. They are forcing multiple covenants to rely on auto summoning that doesnt work.Invasions in general are gimped. You hardly get invaded when you are alone if you do then you can autosummon a blue to protect you and you can use a seed of a tree of giants to help as well.  of my invasions are  man squads.

7436368,0,t3_4h4pu5,Im surprised so many people are saying ... Id say that its easier than in DS. Most of the groups I invade into go really aggro since they have the superior numbers but that only makes it easier for me. One parry is all it takes with hornet ring to kill a phantom  and when two or more people go at once they arent expecting a parry. Groups tend to use rolling and running attacks wayyy too much so all you gotta do is identify a pattern in one of them and kill them when they do an unsafe option. The iframes you get on riposte are also really useful since less experienced players will waste their stamina trying to hit you. Its rinse and repeat after that until you get a v. The main problem I think people have against ganks is that they get punished way harder than they would against single player. All I can say is that playing carefully will definitely pay off and even against three people in a cleared out area its still possible. You just have to switch up your playstyle and try to burst a single target down. Hitting them all in one swoop will very rarely lead to a win.Anyway I cant say anything about  since I played mainly offline in that game but I think DS is much harder because your opponents have an even larger window to punish you. Aside from that its pretty much over if you get caught in either DS or DS so no real difference there.,darksouls3,d2ngtzl,1,t5_2w3z3

7467376,0,t1_d2qyde6,Lol...I had the same experience as you.  Pretty much avoided pvp until DS.  Then I found ratbro and at first I was like whatever.  Until I got to that big area in the cave.  I was running a sorcerer build and would chameleon myself to resemble whatever statues it turns you into in the area then Id sit right where people would spawn into the area.  As soon as theyd spawn Id  shot them with a crystal soul spear.  The times it would miss were hilarious.  People would just sprint away as fast as they could trying to get through the area but I had all the traps set and they couldnt get far.  After I had my fill of that strategy I started to just chameleon myself and follow them around without attacking.

7469617,0,t1_d2r5emg,gt several of the Kingdoms from the time of Dark Souls  are spoken of in the present tense in  and we encounter characters from those kingdoms meaning theyre presumably still around except Astora which has collapsed relatively recently if we go by item descriptions in contrast to  where the nations of the first game were long gone and forgotten.We also have to keep in mind that theres wibblywobbly timeywimey shenanigans going on in the Soulsverse.  Characters we interact with may actually be from the far future or the distant past.

I think it had more to do with timing and the area the soul sword covers though. It was definitely hit or miss sometimes. Ive played around with the ring not bad. Yet as you stated the rolls are already super effective without it. I was more alluding to the ring having the ability for making actually hitting someone with a spell harder than it already was. Ive used the ring on a boss or two.

However the primary campaign and DLC are phenomenal and absolutely worth looking into.Fast gameplay that rewards aggressive playstyles interesting and more cohesive lore that is more Lovecraftian in nature and its got that careful narrative that also flows from the environment as opposed to pure dialog.

Under  should be fast roll  medium roll  fatroll and over  no roll  slow speed.People dont seem to understand that to be a poise tank which never seemed to happen on ds pvp anyways at least when I was playing it in this game you would have to actually spec to be that way. Havels ring is not nearly as good as it was on ds and you dont get staminaampequip load from the same stat. Also armor gives WAY less poise.For the pve side of things who cares if someone wants to have the easiest possible experience?

The longbow and greatbow just has a long draw animation youre forced to use.Final Verdict. Great Damage. Slow Draw. Bad in Fight Club Usable for ganking and invasions.If you REALLY want to use it in a fight club you could go staff left hand and bow right hand draw the bow back when they come at you cancel the shot with Y which also pulls out your staff then farron flashsword combo them this wouldnt work all the time especially after doing it once you can also mix up the drawback with the weapon art which shoots a fast hard hitting shot that pierces through shields not super viable but I did this for a while and I won a good amount of fights lol.,darksouls3,d2syuz0,2,t5_2w3z3

7485199,0,t1_d2sytv7,I think DS has a severe issue with build diversity caused by absolutely fucking awful gameplay balance and exacerbated by the whole poise does nothing nothing! thing.  Its also made worse by the fact that for some insanely stupid reason they dumped the absolutely fantastic dual wielding system DS had  and I dont mean powerstancing that sort of returns with paired weapons since powerstancing required similar or identical weapons anyway I mean actual dual wielding.  Slap a broadsword in your left hand in DS and its a broadsword L is a light attack L is a strong attack you can execute running and rolling attacks with it etc.  Put that same broadsword in your left hand in DS and its a really shitty shield.  I loved dual wielding once I got my bearings straight and this comes from a diehard turtle behind the shield guy from DS.  It made things riskier because you didnt have that shield to protect you if you screwed up and most weapons also couldnt parry in the offhand rapiers scimitars and parrying tools mostly.  In exchange you could have a weapon available to counteract some of the weaknesses of your primary weapon.  Youd often see spears combined with straight swords or axes for example  you use the spear to poke them when theyre far away and the sword or axe is there for dealing with them if they get too close and also useful for punishing rolls since DS doesnt have fucking autoaim lockon mechanics like DS does.  I liked combining my halberd with a scimitar in the offhand.  You cant do that in DS everything in the left hand is a fuckin shield whether you like it or not its a gigantic step backwards for absolutely zero reason.Faith is also basically worthless at any level of play.  Heals and buffs dont scale with FTH at all so theres zero reason to ever invest more than the minimum and why invest in heals when you can just sip?  Nukes dont do crap for damage until  and even once there theyre still extremely expensive and easy to avoid.Sorcery is a nogo until at least the SL  PvP meta and even then its still rather weak... youd probably need to be closer to SL  to make a pure mage build really work and even then youd still be reliant on chugging ashtus constantly.Pyromancy is doable at lower levels because of its more balanced scaling and generally manaefficient spells but its all incredibly easy to avoid because of how cheap and overpowered rolling is and how slow the fireballs are and theres no real reason to justify spending points in FTH and INT to boost the fire weapon buff when its already decent enough a little stronger than resins flat  with the base  requirements.,darksouls3,d2t0y5x,1,t5_2w3z3

7485609,0,t1_d2sroz0,you conveniently ignore the fact that heavy weapons in DaS didnt have hyperarmour except iirc abyss sword on the special Rs?. if you have both poise and hyperarmour it means heavy weapons become easymode as they cant be staggered by small ones since poise protects them in every active frame that isnt covered by hyperarmour essentially allowing them to trade by spamming R with no thought or reason as timing and spacing suddenly become irrelevant vs anything but other heavy weapons. not to mention that they have high enough of an AR that hornetstabs are near oneshots so of course theyd dominate the meta. youd just be trading one extreme for another. yay?im of the opinion that poise needs to do something tangible relevant and important and that it shouldnt be easily stackable so that vitgouging with heavy armour is a viable playstyle i just dont think that DaSstyle poise is the solution and would just introduce more problems than it solves although itd be perfectly fine for PvE but thats a wholly different beast...,darksouls3,d2t2ms5,0,t5_2w3z3

Ive overcome so many in these games that it is always the same thing...learn the moveset stay alive long enough and chip away until dead.

I held my position at the choke point instead and killed those two new phantoms there as well  the host then summoned more...  and so it went for a long time with the host summoning phantoms and me killing them at the same spot over and over again.eventually i saw my chance when i got some estus back from killing phantoms and the host was too slow in running back to the bonfire.  i followed him and slaughtered him while he panically tried to summon more help it was my most satisfying kill in DS yet.the whole thing took about  minutes.

Thrusting weapons in particular should not be able to follow me as I roll past and behind the player midattack. Id like some poise or at least a repurposing of the Wolf Ring. Watchdogs have it bad enough but making their Rank  reward completely useless with the game is just putting salt in the wound. Reduction in FP cost for Miracles and Sorceries. An arena for blues wherein they could earn PoCKs would be great.

7493500,0,t1_d2t0hno,That is correct. There are invisible trigger zones just after boss fog gates that activate the bosss AI and the boss HP bar to appear on screen. When your character enters those spaces the fight is triggered and everything proceeds as you would expect.If you ever used the Doms mule savefile in DkS or if youre familiar with it due to its property of allowing you to teleport to any bonfire from the beginning of the game you could enter boss rooms from a bonfire that you would normally encounter only after beating said boss. The boss would be completely idle like in OPs video however walking too close to the fog door and entering the trigger zone would cause the battle to initiate. Stuff like this is kinda cool allows you to take a good look at the model of the boss something you dont get to do usually due to them trying to brutally murder you. Lot of small detail goes into boss models. ,darksouls3,d2tyygt,2,t5_2w3z3

Its hard but its fair.No notification of an invasion just wouldnt be fair in a perfect world it might work but lets be honest and say that most invaders are either desperate or dicks and would take the fairnessskill out of the equation.  People already get upset that invaders run off into mobs or hosts run back to bonfires to preserve their souls or summon for help.  No notifications for invasions would make this  worse every spot with a tough enemy would see an invader run up and backstab you and every person would summon a pack to walk with them.

They drop subtle hints that it may not be the real ornstein by using words like reminiscent of an old dragonslaying knight. Its likely that he is another illusion or something created in the likeness of Ornstein. The fact that he is corrupted by the abyss makes me think its a fake someone made to guard the cathedral of blue in the likeness of Ornstein who once defended the Cathedral in Anor Londo. The Leo Ring we find in DS and Ornsteins Weapon and Armour all say he left to find the first born.

7500425,0,t3_4i39yp,Favorite Elana The Squalid Queen from DSIIThis is the perfect spellcasting boss. Her flame swathes are quick damaging and claim a portion of the field. Her tripleshot dark orb is extremely damaging and surprisingly quick. Her dark version of Wrath Of The Gods is a serious get off me move that also subtly gives the player time to buff or heal. Her moveset with her Wrathful Axe perfectly complements her lingering spells.And then theres the summons. As if this boss wasnt hard or wellthought out enough she covers her far range weaknesses with summoned support. The Scimitar Skeletons are quick surprisingly damaging and give her breathing room. The piglets are a nice little joke that in repeated attempts give welcome respite.But then theres Velstadt. Talk about redemption. What was a boss with cool lore and design but sadly simple fight becomes your bane. Any weaknesses Elana had are now completely covered. She provides the damaging long range spells Velstadt took forever to cast and he provides the support she needs to cast them along with trucking power on every slam. The arena is even graciously spacious giving you time to separate and be strategic.All in all Elana and Velsdadt are the perfect duo and Elana herself is still a great boss on her own.PS her music rocks ,darksouls3,d2urcuc,1,t5_2w3z3

Also some stupidly powerful combo attacks.  Ive been running a Great Axe offhand with the Greatsword and its ridiculous how good a combo that is despite how silly it appears.  Im not that good at PvP and I win  of my fights easily.  It does suck that your off hand weapons dont have a light attack true but you can still do some rad shit.  L on the off hand Great Axe hyper armours through your opponents attack stunning them and hitting them for really high damage and then they get clobbered with the greatsword R swing.  Maybe two swings if youre lucky although be real fucking careful with that.  Its happened maybe twice ever but people have backstabbed me when Ive gotten greedy with the second swing.   damage combo on the two swing.

That being said it felt wrong to not include you in the discussion. I started a thread with a link to translation requests I had with the hopes of getting some good discussion going. If you would like to contribute please join us. Or if you would like to help me personally but anonymously please feel free to PM me and we can work on something offlineoff Reddit. I learned a lot from your previous translations and would like to incorporate your work even if anonymously in the lore analysis I am working on though only if you are comfortable with doing so. Regardless I wish you the best.Here is the threadAnd here is the pastebin of my requestsquestions if you would like to collaborate anonymously or personally,darksouls3,d2x26ho,1,t5_2w3z3

7523111,0,t3_4idycq,For most of your play through I recommend using the longsword made raw and buffed with either resins or Spells Carthus flame arc and magic weapon are great with upgraded catalysts. You can use several weapons right off the bat but many more become available once you unlock the stat boosting rings. Ideally once you get the faith ring use the Astora sword and make it raw! It has the highest dps output of any weapon you can use at sl.Also ditch your armour completely and rock Flynns ring you are going to get one shot most of the time and having another  damage is much more beneficial than occasionally taking  instead of one hits.I invite you to ronebros  this is a sub that is all about souls game level one runs super helpful and relatively active community.,darksouls3,d2xc9u4,2,t5_2w3z3

7524453,0,t1_d2xfhp1,Unlike how Demons Souls Dark Souls Dark Souls  and Bloodborne base matchmaking and coop around soul level typically   levels or some minor variation thereof Dark Souls  based multiplayer around the total number of souls you have accrued. On paper it was supposed to protect players from twinkers and whatnot but what it really ended up doing was forcing you to use your souls to level up in order to keep up with invaders and whatnot in most aspects of PVP. This ended up saturating a lot of builds and gave birth to Havel Monster PVP.The problem with this system also is that it didnt take into account CHEATERS. Megamules and trainers on PC and consoles were pretty prevalent and would allow players with maxed out armor and every spell and item imaginable to enter low level players games anyway. Thats why I prefer the  system of reinforcement that Dark Souls  introduced. Plus the password system that Bloodborne started really really helped in terms of coop since soul level and infusion range play zero role when matched via password.,darksouls3,d2xhrgl,1,t5_2w3z3

But barely any other SS users. Even the reasons people give for tgese weapons being broken is just flat out bullshit sometimes. Theyre unparriable. They arent. Wtf? Lol. They can R spam.

Personally I find that outside of this issue they have been able to balance the different weapon classes in this game very well without poise and I dont miss the mechanic in PvP unpopular opinion I know.Secondly even with poise functioning like DS these would be some pretty high poise damaging weapons.

7530789,0,t3_4igvg9,Ill be posting videos one day but I did some netcode testing on my LAN using a latency simulator.Basically many of the results from my DS thread still hold true but with some changes and exceptionsHitboxes are calculated on the attackers side  if he hits you on his screen then you get hit  regardless of where you are on your screen.iFrames and blocking are calculated on the defenders side  if you roll through an attack on his screen he hit you but you take no damage.Parries are calculated on the attackers side the person making the attack.  This is why parries are so hard  you have to parry early to compensate for lag.  Partial parries are calculated on the defenders side  if you parry correctly on your screen then youll get a partial.The biggest difference is backstabs.  In this game when you attempt a backstab youll do a unique attack animation eg. claymore has a stomachheight stab.  If your opponent is out of backstab range on his screen then the animation counts as a regular attack that does regular damage.  However if the opponent is still in range on his screen he rolled past you he turned around he walked behind you etc then the backstab will occur.So DS at least removes a lot of the sucked  feet back into a backstab lagstabs from previous games.  But its all distanced based so turning around or rolling behind someone will not protect you if theyre already backstabbing you  you gotta roll away.,darksouls3,d2y7ppx,42,t5_2w3z3

7537448,0,t1_d2yyjeo,So things to consider are that there were assassins sent to kill Oceiros but never returned.  We see this description on the Dragonscale RinggtMany assassins were dispatched to his domain but none returned.I think some assassins died that much is clear from the Shadow Garb.  But a parallel to Seathe is that there are ManSerpents just beyond the exit to Oceiros boss room.  It could be possible that they didnt ALL die they all just didnt return.  But Seathe had ManSerpents in his employ it would stand to reason that his mad successor would eventually come to have similar methodologies as hackneyed as that is.  I think the Ashen Estus Ring excuse me implies that the Queen had some sort of misgivings as time went on about what was going on with the kingdom and she put much of her faith in the Unkindled.  But why?  Now in the original Dark Souls Kaathe tells us that the fire went out and Gwyn didnt like what he saw.  But the reverse has somehow happened with the QueenMaybebutnotbutmaybe Gwenyvere.  Im curious as to why.She left the Ashen Estus Ring for an Unkindled to one day use and when you come out of Oceiros boss door that ring is sitting in an open grave surrounded by ManCrows.  Which leads me to ask why wouldnt the Queen just give this ring to Ocelotte or any of her other children?  Why put her faith that any Unkindled would be The right Unkindled or perhaps thats what it is that the collective effort is enough?Either way Im skeptical about Gundyr being Ocelotte because he could very well be his own type of champion but Ocelotte being missing and these details you say are circumstantial... theyve been designed by someone and were clearly seeing things that have been put in the same area and have at least some significant association.  I cant say the gaps you fill for Gundyrs motivation are ones I entirely subscribe to but this is probably one of the narrative gaps in the game I find the most evocative.,darksouls3,d2yyyzi,3,t5_2w3z3

7543673,0,t3_4intke,Switch to the buckler if you want to learn parrying. Its especially useful when latency is an issue on the R spammers. Parrying dagger was hit or miss with me often miss. I use the caestus now which seems to be instantaneous.I did DEX my first playthrough and you will hit like a wet noodle but those are the breaks. What kind of infusion do you have? Honestly its best to just go with raw infusion early on the game and use the wasted stat points in vigor instead. Thats what a majority of twink invaders do at least. Id also switch to an Astora Straight Sword. Really powerful early on with a raw infusion and quite easy to get.If you want to parry an opponent just set them up. Put yourself in their shoes and think What would cause me to attack an opponent? The general answer is if you think youre at an advantage. In other words backtrack a little. Use an estus and then get ready to immediately parry. I almost always catch people with a parryriposte when they come into punish my estus use. Another good way as a goldwhite phantom or host is to attack a bunch of mobs. The invader will almost always try to sneak in hits during this time which makes parrying super easy since theyve lowered their guard. See this estoc user for exampleUse these tactics as an invader because  people hostphantom will almost always get too cocky and end up Ring you. So to summarize Switch your weaponinfusion Respec your stats into vigor until later on Switch to a buckler Practice parrying mind games if you really want to parry!Alternatively keep an estoc in your inventory when you are invaded by an estoc user. Most of them have no idea how to parry. Buff weapon R spam them to death switch back to your preferred weapon. I switch to an estoc when I feel an invader is using cheap tactics or using an estoc. Then again sometimes I just like the challenge of using a straight sword against them. There are many mind games you can play with a straight sword while an estoc has very few moves to play around with.,darksouls3,d2zog9n,1,t5_2w3z3

Both is even an option in PVE if a boss is unable to be bled you can go damage then but bleed otherwise. As for stats you should explore.

7545992,0,t1_d2zx02h,Thats only a troll fix until you find the people who dont care about the covenant or already maxed it out.For example as a purple I already have max rank in the Mound Makers.  But even so my character isnt faith focused and this can never use Warmth making the covenant meaningless for me in the first place.  I just like helping hosts and then determining how if when and were I will betray them based on what letter their name starts with.And just as I use the covenant for what I perceive as a proper Mad fashion others will use it entirely to puss someone off.  The majority will I believe.On a different note...  I would have loved for From to make the purple white sign just white.  Make it indistinguishable from the normal white phantoms until after theyve been summoned have it still pop like it currently does.  Then allow them to fight bosses of they wanted.This would provide consistent activity for the purples without them turning into just another duel sign.  From there they can decide on their own if they want to help the host all the way through or assassinate him and or his phantoms.It would also provide a much more solid use of the Sun Bros beyond their slick golden tan as a purple cant fake being golden.  As such the Sun Bros should be locked behind a challenge an entire quest dungeon and boss.

7547515,0,t1_d302iz6,It reminded me more of the Gaping Dragon  it was a super intimidating giant boss with a massive amount of HP that hits like a truck but is also extremely slow and extremely predictable. Both of these bosses will instill panic in new players as they are now fighting something so big that they cant even see the whole thing at once they hardly do any damage to it and it can wipe out huge chunks of their health bar in one shot. Both bosses come a few hours into the game where players have had a chance to familiarize themselves somewhat with the games mechanics but are still on edge. Both bosses also become totally trivial once you calm down for a second and pay attention.Personally I think both of these bosses are fantastic for this exact reason  the Souls games have always been about teaching lessons to the player and the Gaping Dragon and Rotted Great Greatwood are both extremely effective lessons in keeping your cool and paying attention. Sure they do not hold up well on repeat playthroughs and you can really only fall for the trick in your first Souls game it is still a great way to teach first timers about how to approach the game.,darksouls3,d3046pe,4,t5_2w3z3

A great allrounder can be infused with magic doesnt weigh a lot very low stat requirement Darksword  Like the long sword but a little better in almost every category.You can use it just dont tell anybody. Seems to have overtaken the estoc as the most hatedupon weapon in the game. Demonslayer nunchucks  Just kidding but how awesome would nunchucks be? Very awesome.If you like spears theres a couple that have magic requirements to use. The ones I can think of off the top of my head is the Yorshka spear and one I think called the ceremonial spear or something like that.Ive discovered Anris straight sword and its hard for me to go elsewhere. I have luck at  and this thing hits really hard for a small weapon.

At some point at least one of them will separate from the pack  perhaps to go and find the invader. The longer youre in the hosts world the more stressful it can be for them.None of these comments are designed to portray a git gud mentality because I dont agree with that.

7555576,0,t1_d310w70,I remember you as well!  I think this is still a pretty decent connection and I think that Londor has been influenced by Velka.  But theyre still shady to me so I think I try to discern some of the potential motivations and potential contradictions in their methods and ideologies as well.  I think its good of you to have written this up precisely because it gets us all thinking and talking about the part of the game I love too.  Which is piecing it all together lol.  Yeah to your point I think she has because the citizenry has clearly looked to her.  But even the game makes it somewhat explicit that occasionally these stories are interpreted in ways that reflect what the person is most apt to want or what they most likely believe in as a matter of faith.  These are miracles after all.  Lets take Atonement for instancegtThis is the only tale known by exiles who believe it carries words of forgiveness. Cursed journeys too must come to an end.If I gave the impression I didnt think they were connected thats not necessarily my meaning.  I actually think they are but I think that Londors ethics and Velkas status as a deity are aligning in a sort of moment of convenience.  The fact that going to Velka can potentially foil the plot of the Sable Church I think is important which makes me feel that Londor worships Velka but Velka isnt necessarily wholly supportive.  I get the sense its a sort of client based relationship at least thats my interpretation.But I think thats very fitting thats precisely how Gwyn began the linking of the fire in the first place.  He created a belief system based on maintaining fire and being afraid of Dark.  And he used similar moments of deceit.  You could say that turn about is fair play.  Im still waiting for the DLCs to arrive because I think the current textgame we have is still a bit... muddy to me.  But I dont dispute this relationship youre making I think its a good observation.

Anything with the perseverance or stomp WA would pretty much be dominating the meta save the super skilled people like that one japanese free aim pyro.I want them to bring back power stancing. If not power stancing at least make dual wielding same types of weapons result in a unique L attack.

7560437,0,t3_4iuaw9,gtso what do you guyz thinkI wouldve loved the Washing Pole to have a different weapon art... mostly so it can have a sheath on the back and not clip through the floor on the ground because hold requires a sheath at the waist.To take this further though... I think all weapon arts shouldve been a kind of stance so you can have multiple abilities tied to different commands like light attack heavy or roll. Different weapon types can trend towards certain moves but individual weapons would vary. The options being.......L Go into your stance modifying your R R and Roll commands into....Roll stomp for STR focused weapons dash for DEX focused weaponsR or R any two of guard break parry shield piercerside attack backstep attack War Cry Perseverance Spin Shoulder Tackle an extra heavy attack that differs from your regular R so you have more move variety and so on....With the twin weapons Id have dual wielding just change your regular RR attacks into using both left and right hand weapons in consecutive attacks. So the standard straight sword knight starts off can have a stance where its r is a parry and r is a guard break while a lothric straight sword has a more agile thrusting oriented r evasive thrust.The relatively short and stocky black blade can have a quick draw r parry and r guard break with stomp to close in the distance while the long and thin Washing Pole goes into a stance taking advantage of its reach with an r spin and r backstep slash familiar for those who play Monster HunterA brutal weapon like the Fume UGS can have R warcry R charge. And so on.,darksouls3,d31l2vt,2,t5_2w3z3

But IIRC you still cant get staggered under Perseverance even when youre naked right? If thats the case theres three possibilities Perseverance doesnt use the poise on your armor at all. Perseverance gives so much poise that the armor doesnt matter. Perseverance gives a low enough amount of poise that armor DOES matter but the buff is too short for us to see it except in extraordinary situations we havent run into yet.I dont think this has been tested yet...

Likewise though I dont think they got to work as closely to the developers as Future Press has the privilege. Epic Name Bro helped write great guides for dark souls and bloodborne but he also got to work with the developers themselves. That makes a huge difference in the quality of the guides especially since Epic name Bro pushed for even more information to get put into the guides he helped write adding like  more pages more than originally intended. ,darksouls3,d32dgxc,1,t5_2w3z3

7572739,0,t3_4j1wvn,The total lack of any actual system for spellcasting other than the awful lockon feature which is clearly only meant for melee. Short of freeaiming which is woefully insufficient and about as manageable as juggling with handcuffs on lockon is the only way to aim spells but it has a shorter range than most spells and is prone to unlocking itself for no reason midcast which causes the spell to flop into the floor. Spells needed an aiming system like bows have or something similar. Even just a crosshair that pops up during the spellcasting animation so that you have a moment to aim but still have to be quick about it because the spell will resolve in the end. This would also lend some measure of compensation to the particularly slow spells.Its actually a little absurd that were five games in and the magic system still feels like the beta version of an experimental mod grafted onto a game that isnt meant to have it. Its the worst magic system Ive seen in any game. The mechanics are so unwieldy and irritating that I never enjoy playing a magicfocused character.On top of all that Ive always just been disappointed with the games spells.  of offensive magic consists of just shooting one projectile straight forward. Its so boring and plain and Ive never felt like less of a mage than I do in Dark Souls. Going through pretty much the entire game just shooting variations of Soul Arrow is tedious as hell.There are so few spells too. When I do try to play a magicfocused character I end up using two or three spells. Sometimes I might equip both Soul Arrow and Great Heavy Soul Arrow but that barely counts as two different spells. My latest attempt at playing a mage I went through  of the game just casting GHSA and Magic Weapon. The only other spell that I wanted you dont actually get until literally the last fucking area in the game.There are times when magic is plenty strong and some boss fights are completely trivialized by it  I burst out laughing when I took Aldrich on with my pyromancer and killed him in twenty seconds without getting hit because he dies to like six Chaos Bed Vestiges. But I always feel like Im playing something that the game doesnt intend because the mechanics dont facilitate it at all. Its like you werent meant to use offensive magic just buffs.,darksouls3,d32zeyd,3,t5_2w3z3

Granted there are probably ways to improve it because theres always ways to improve it but not without a lot of effort.Well I probably am talking on assumptions and beliefs but I am under the impression that the way DkS works with the blue summons is that first of all the Invader needs to spawn in your world. Only then the game will actually begin searching for a Bluebrosis in their own specific queue. The Red vs Blue is responsive but only after the Red is in  I guess that this solution I have in mind might be a pain in the arse for FROM to introduce but itd be nice if whenever someone RedEyes there is a small delay of time that sends a ping to the Bluebro queue letting both spawn in a synchronized manner in the hosts world.IIm not too sure if Im being clear enough?,darksouls3,d331mv6,1,t5_2w3z3

7586395,0,t3_4j5xjy,This is coming from someone who often gets killed by invaders so take it with my huge grain of saltiness...   Isnt that part of the danger of invading is that you are fairly likely to face multiple opponents? If you dont want to take the chance when you see multiple summons or dont want to fight gankers just BC out and invade someone else.  And I dont really understand the point of making the fight more fair for the invader...Invaders are entering a players world to do nothing but impede their process in an already difficult world   Why should you get a buff that would defeat the purpose of having summons and covenants that exist solely to help the person being invaded?    There is already so much working against a host that buffing the invaders for the sake of fairness doesnt really make sense.  But I also think that multiple reds invading shouldnt take friendly fire. That was a strange design choice by FromSoft and I think that should be disabled.      edit I actually like the idea but maybe only in NG and beyond. Having to watch out for the dangers of your phantoms if you pop a seed of giants would add a really cool strategy element to the game that is completely lacking in the lets all attack at the same time and smoosh this  person into the ground  plan of attack that seems to be the regular course of action.

This is also a tradition for me since I also made elderly characters for Demons Souls and Dark Souls.My choice of armor was to have something that enchanced my alreadybulky physique but wasnt too heavy since my vitality was left at cleric starting level thus the heavy chest but light everythingelse. I liked the mummified look of being covered in rags and it suited my name too.Also I love that being hollowed in DS just adds an effect over the top of your designed character so Im still recognisable and I dont feel like making a perfect character was a waste.P.S.

7591737,0,t3_4j9ozo,Theres never enough room if you PvP.Assuming infinite resources or farming youll want Estus for healing. Ashen too for FP recovery if youre a caster. Undead Hunter Charms for keeping your opponent from doing the same. Can effectively silence casters if they just used a bunch of spells as they wont be able to recover any FP. Weapon arts might have bonus damage and special effects removed too if you know your opponent is using an uninfusable weapon or shield in their offhand or back otherwise theyll probably recover through a Simple infusion and use it with  FP left. Duel Charms to remove dangerous or excessive buffs before they rek you. Throwing knives to deal surprise cheap shots or safely kill an opponent on their last legs. Kukri is slower and cant cancel into another throw but it deals more damage and helps build up bleed. Poison is worthless. Lightning urns to deal more damage with manual throws. Good for assisting in team fights without getting hit yourself. Green Blossoms for faster stamina recovery. This is actually really important as whoever recovers stamina faster can be more aggressive and maintain control of the fight. Budding variety is better but rare to the point that it just exists to give hackers an advantage theyll likely never be banned for. Pine resins for extra damage. Pale in particular will do a lot of damage against anyone wearing a Dusk Crown but those people arent really that hard to beat anyways because lol magic. Carthus Rouge is very powerful when applied to weapons that already cause bleed. Pine bundles for quickly getting damage in when you opponent is pressuring you too much to get a regular pine resin off or to safely add extra damage when going for a riposte after a parry. Dung Pies to punish turtles and Iron Fleshes. Blooming purple moss clumps to cure toxin if you accidentally poison yourself or get shat on.Adjust to preference. If you cant hit with Dung Pies or Urns having an extra type of Pine Bundle can be useful to exploit an opponents armor set. If youre in a tournament the Undead Hunter Charm is probably useless. Green Blossoms only do good if you ever run out of stamina when fighting if you normally can throw out an extra attack or two at all times without issue then its not worth bringing. Red and blue moss can help relieve pressure from specific status builds and regular purple can help if your opponent happens to be nuts and actually good enough to proc poison when it stands a chance of killing you. And extra head stones allow you to more quickly communicate ideas to other players not using mic.For the pause menu toolbelt Homeward Bone or Coiled Sword Fragment. Cheap get out of jail free cards plus they save you a lot of time getting around the world. Always keep on the first slot for rapid access. Replace with a Black Crystal when doing PvP to get out of gank squads or hacker worlds. Redwhite soapstone or Red Eye Orb for finding multiplayer. Rusted coins for farming or just getting loot when you know youre going to kill a tough enemy anyways. Theyre only  souls a pop and the extra drops often pay for themselves so dont be afraid to use the copper coins liberally. Prism stones for checking falls or leading a host back to a fog gate you want them to check out after you kill the boss. Head stone for communication with other players. Youve already got a Call Over gesture to get another players attention or greet someone so something like Im Sorry or Help Me might communicate exactly what you need to save your life.For equipment its all about carry weight. Torches weigh too much to be worth carrying at all times.  A  physical block shield a simpledinfused caestus for parrying and weapon art regeneration and an offhand weapon that you can hit with are good for your offhand slots if you want an arsenal build.  Right hand is entirely dependent on your playstyle but choose complements  if you use a Fume Ultra Greatsword have an Estoc or spear on another slot so you can deal with enemy weapons that counter your weapon of choice.  Having two instead of three weapons on each hand means you can more quickly swap between then but if you want to fill all the slots having a ranged weapon handy is really useful for plicking away at mobs and opponents that are too far away to hit with a stick.  A catalyst or pyromancy flame on your offhand can also be useful even if youre not really a caster a little support magic can be useful.,darksouls3,d355583,2,t5_2w3z3

It has inherent OP tier builds you can make because of the RPG side. Thats not the nature of a competetive game at all competetive games strive for balance. Thats hardly a thing in DS. Yes they will roll out some patches for nerfsbuffs...but it will never be balanced like it should be to be a real competetive game. I can only hope From one day makes a DS like game and throws out all the RPG elements to completely focus on competetive combat. I would be all over that.

Poise affects the details of that in a subtle fashion but you will usually have a workable roll to protect yourself with. DkS started new characters with a nearly broken roll that you could only do three times before running out of stamina.

7615530,0,t1_d37tvgs,If your so good you can win without them then dont waste time applying them.  buff is not long enough for people to run up to you and hit you unless they were basically in melee range to begin with. And a duel charm takes a while to throw go through the air and land which by this time if all you did was  buff you could easily avoid. Builds have counters a mage build is easily countered by that magic negating AoE spell a buff build is countered by duel charms a bow build is countered by a shield. Something to remind you. Dont force people to wait for you simple as that. Just as you think its rude to counter you build with a simple time I think its rude to force me to wait half a minute for you to be ready. Alsogtsimilar to yourself just try and run to stop a swordspear buff and not realise it has an attack with it.Swordspear buffing is fine if its mid duel because as you said its an attack as well. But if your opponent has the decency to wait out your buffs and then you start swordspear buff which you know full well is a long ranged attack then you must be the edgiest dueler ever to need every single advantage you can get from the start. ,darksouls3,d37ugue,2,t5_2w3z3

Sure NPCs have some speculation or hints about what would happen if it does and have tried to let it happen but nobody really knows for sure.  And the Untended Graves could be that glimpse.  Same with the Firekeepers dialogue at the end. From might not even know.  I think that adds more motivation as the player to pick what they would like to happen.  Link the flame again.  It wont last long but the world as we know it will pitter on for some time.  Or risk it all for something different.  You dont know if you did the right thing and you have to live with that.

Also as a side note daggers and other weapons with quickstep absolutely destroy greatshields. I think making shield piercing skills stronger would also help. As it is right now shield piercing skills are near worthless.Ive been using the thrall axe with a black knight shield to use the weapon art and I destroy greatshields users. Its light enough to let me have another weapon in my nd slot too.,darksouls3,d38gsna,1,t5_2w3z3

7622133,0,t1_d37sc26,The way I rationalize Boletaria is that the place being affected is a whole continent and the  places we visit form some type of a joint kingdom. I remember the Twinfangs had their own lead Tower of Latria was ruled by a queen Shrine of Storm is at seaside one edge of the country and has the Storm King is he a demon though? I dont remember if the flying mantarays were ever described as demons but Storm King was either a demon or corrupted by a demon soul. To top that all off the cut sixth archstone was called Northern Limit which to me makes sense if the kingdom indeed is a joint kingdom or a whole continent. Boletaria was probably the supreme ruler of that continent.Its obvious DeS doesnt have as deep of a lore as the other games because it was heavily altered at some point in development and never was meant to have a sequel or expansion but I still think the point about story progression holds.Your point about the Old Dragonslayer shows just what I mean with my dislike of some of the lore. Its hardly based on anything definitive information and has been formed into a piece of potential lore but its just your head canon. Solaire being Gwyns firstborn was also head canon for many but now it seems pretty evident that it wasnt the case. Like I have nothing against you coming to your own conclusions since thats pretty much how I came to my Boletaria conclusion but its also one aspect I dislike about some of their most recent games lore pieces. It requires too much rationalization or speculation at times.I have heard a few different lore pieces about Heide and OD Heide having relations to Iron Keep and OD Ornstein reborn dark rationalization was that Ornstein felt betrayed by gods and compassion towards humans which is why he uses dark to defend the humans against any potential gods or minions of theirs.I think thats like an alright try at explaining OD but its still pretty stupid and involves the whole reborn BS.,darksouls3,d38lhc4,1,t5_2w3z3

No one I talked to understood that they were supposed to stand on the opposite side of where the red rings were and whenever I tried to get a fight there Id always see a red ring disappear and then reappear where I was standing no matter how much Id try to switch places.DS still makes you jump through dumb hoops to access arenas and lacks basic features like being able to match with someone in particular for a duel in the arena or choose special rulesets for variety but it was so much better than the DSs awful implementation.

Your ring layout. If you wanna be an invader you need Obscuring Ring. Estus Ring isnt very useful. Also you may want to investigate Prisoners chain to basically give you free levels. Other then that it makes a good starter build. it isnt optimized but that doesnt really matter.

You can try right clicking the save file going to properties and then clicking previous versions. This will only be available though if by some miracle your laptop is set to automatically backup files.You could ask for further help with data recovery in general in rdatarecovery or even try rpcmasterrace or rtechsupportAs far as Im aware though theres no way to return that file unless you get lucky with recovery software. ,darksouls3,d3b3hbu,1,t5_2w3z3

7648052,0,t3_4k1rb1,You make a really good point about it possibly being a location based in meditation.That hadnt quite occurred to me which Im a bit ashamed of given that my own pet theory is that the players trip through Oolacile in Artorias of the Abyss is something of a quasireal dream world based on the characters own memories which is why Oolacile looks like Darkroot. There was a post on the DS boards a long time ago pointing out a lot of Alice in Wonderland correlations in Artorias of the Abyss which is what inspired that line of thought.ampnbspI think its also probably worth noting that once you kill the Ancient Wyvern and get transported to the Dragonkin Mausoleum were summoned there in the same way the Drakeblood Knights the Ricard Streakers and the Havel Knights are. Were basically invited in because we passed part one of a test. That in itself doesnt really mean its a meditation but it does reinforce the theory that its a series of trials on the Path of the Dragon.I think that makes most sense as a meditation trial because any group that runs trials by combat where you actively have to kill all the testers man serpents and others would not last past the first successful challenger and we can see from all the petrified Dragonkin in the Mausoleum that there have been... several.,darksouls3,d3bji99,19,t5_2w3z3

I got quite a bit of souls from this path while farming the Black Knight armor obviously wearing the Symbol of Avarice gives more souls and higher drop rate on the armor and the reasonably close bonfire makes resetting them easy.,darksouls3,d3di5h1,1,t5_2w3z3

I get miracles are had to land with such long casts etc. bit to say that they are all dodgable..... well everything is this game is dodgable. The whole idea is to catch people on no staminaafter a roll etc. Try like squash that fool with a great hammer and time it so that WOG lands right after he gets up and rollscause we all know hes going to be spamming that roll button Im not saying miracles are definitely viable but I think too many people are quick to say its not viable before putting in sufficient effort trying to make it work. Youve got to get creative parry bait the roll etc. Maybe try using even less cast speed to throw off their roll timing? I dont know I havent actually tried any miracles yetjust made a new character last night with the intention of doing so but I hate hearing that things are completely  unviable.

If gwynevere left and built heide ornsteins presence for being at heide was to protect gwynevere just like he was ordered to do in anor londo.An illusion of Ornstein was guarding the illusion of Gwynevere.  There is no suggestion that the real Ornstein had anything to do with Gwynevere.gtAlso Im positive ornstein heard about faraam. Yeah he probably founded the Lion Knights to honour Faraam.gtOrnstein could have left with gwynevere and flann since it states that gwynevere left with the other gods this fits in with the theory that the ornstein we fight in anor londo was an illusion.Im pretty sure there were more Gods than the ones we see in DkS.  What suggests that Ornstein was amongst the Gods who left with Gwynevere?gtIf heide was founded by the firstborn and ornstein was there like you suggest the ornstein would have died in heide and not in archdragon peak as we know ornstein died when he finally met with the firstborn.Ornstein went in search of the Firstborn spent centuries searching eventually found the Firstborns kingdom but it had already collapsed and the Firstborn had left.  He remained in Heide then left and found the Firstborn in Archdragon Peak.gtSo your theory doesnt hold up well compared to mine.Regardless of how good or bad my theory is your theory doesnt hold up even remotely.  Heide was almost certainly founded by the Gods sure but not by Flann.

Monster Hunter U and Generations as I hear it has gone a long way to fix the tedium of early game fetch quests at least compared to U.My recommendation... I guess you could see if the Wii U version is on sale anywhere. If you can get past the tedium of a slow beginning it opens up and becomes a lot of fun.Otherwise Id say you should stick to the DS.

Leonhard may have remorse for his previous actions and serves as a Finger as penance. I also find it interesting that you chase him down to Gwyneveres chamber. If he is related to Gertrude and in turn Gwynevere Anor Londo seems as appropriate a place as ever for the showdown.    Other potential connections may lie in the Crescent Moon Swords imbuement with the power of the moon seemingly the same strength as the Moonlight Greatsword. Along with his armor set stating his royalty is the reason he is skilled in both sorcery and swordsmanship one can extrapolate that Leonhard harnessed his techniques from Oceiros who to add more strings to this corkboard would be his grandfather. Oceiros is consumed by paledrake related causes and his soul can be transposed to the Moonlight Greatsword bish bash bosh!    Counters to this theory could include the fact that he always refers to Rosaria as his goddess though Id say hes either still playing the part through or has gone mad and forgotten. Another might be his crescentmoon shaped weapon would be tied to Gwyndolin. To that Id say the Darkmoon does not seem to have any relation to the Moon whereas plain old Moon related things are associated with the paledrake Seath and almostpaledrake Oceiros.,darksouls3,d3fqes8,3,t5_2w3z3

7689088,0,t3_4kn75b,As long as you dont use the dried finger you have a cooldown for being invaded in Anor Londo as well. I believe solo its  AF invasions and then you have a thirty minute window. With phantoms its  AF   RedPurple for every phantom. It shouldnt be that bad have everyone go down the ladder in their own game without embering so that you cant be invaded then pop on the way of blue covenant. Have only the host use an ember and then summon down the ladder already at the lizards. You should be able to kill them before invaders even get down the ladders.An alternative idea is to summon your friends using the red sign soapstone which will take up invasion slots and wont boost your chance to be invaded. Use a seed of the giant tree from the tree at firelink shrine so that they can attack enemies. This will also allow them to keep their  HP bonus from being embered. If you really dont want to be invaded you can summon them as a red using the soapstone without ever embering so that you cant be invaded.P.S Killing Aldritch will also prevent you from being invaded in that area at all which means you can use red signs with dried finger to summon two phantoms then use a seed so that they can help.,darksouls3,d3g77zz,2,t5_2w3z3

I think the range was  tiers in each direction.anyway the more whiteblack you got the world actually changed.  new routes would open up or in the case of black enemies would get harder and there would be more of them.it wasnt all that reliable and could get wonky so i assumed that is why they dropped the mechanic.here is a nice writeup explaining it in detail.,darksouls3,d3i4jo0,1,t5_2w3z3

7712263,0,t1_d3ijykj,Possible but I think unlikely. The Dark Set states that the Darkwraiths were of a small country that fell to the dark long ago. While people can clearly coexist in a hollowed state the particular darkness of New Londo its own branch of the Abyss seems to make human life quite impossible in the normal sense see Oolacile. So it is probably similar but not the same.Also it could still very well reside within the old boundries of Lordran.

And yes I get what you mean but you dont get what I posted Im saying the spells are highly telegraphed and do not hit proportionally theyre not meant to be used as a main damage source the pvp is designed to be played in melee.

Who knows how much time has passed between UG and Normal Firelink but shes still there.I do agree that the note is addressed in a way that suggests the grandmother is still alive but I just feel like the shrine maiden is too old you know? I know everyone or mostly everyone is undead and so life expectancy is probably impossible to predict but since shes there and an old woman at that point shes been around for a long time.And to be fair the Fire Keeper addresses the Fire Keepers Soul in the present tense calling ither sister when you give it to her.

Check out rFashionSouls for inspiration.With weapons the most important factor is its moveset followed by damage.

The Blue was just there because he signed up to help people kill invaders not necessarily gank them.

Basically youd keep a pillar between yourself and her and only attack when its absolutely safe only like three of her attacks leave her open long enough for a single hit from a straight sword the big spin attack during her nd phase the leap and spin and a long chain of attacks that start with a low sweep with the dark sword and end with her slamming both blades into the ground. Her attacks can hit you through it especially the double poke and if you positioned poorly she could spin around the pillar. For the st phase she attacks slow enough that you shouldnt need the cheese. I killed her relatively early at Farron Keep bonfire  estus ashen and raw astora sword doing about  per HRS.

7772259,0,t3_4lqfsd,I agree with you. Im pretty sure some other people have reached that conclusion too.We know that the bonfires are connected through space and time. So your NPC that heard the bells does not really contradict anything. Like you he was awakened at his firelink shrine and teleported to that timelines Lothric where he can find the Lords of Cinder. We can even deduce that Firelink Shrine and Lothric are not connected because after killing the  lords of Cinder and the Sun goes Hollow the sky of Firelink does not change in the slightest unlike all other locations with the exception of Irithyl where the moon reigns. Two big question marks are. Why are the Untended Graves so drastically different from the rest of Lothric?. Why would the Firelink Shrine send Unkindled to the past when it does not look like the Shrines timeline is in dire need of a kindling? During our stay in Lothric we see that the world is ending fast. We understand why we need to reach a conclusion quickly. But the Shrine seems frozen in time.,darksouls3,d3pn616,3,t5_2w3z3
7772406,0,t3_4lqqdp,Some places to tweak parrying on Nerf Hornet Ring.  It was nerfed in DS for the same reason.  This will probably happen. Increase recovery frames on parrying.  This will hopefully happen.  Shields of all varieties are probably okay but weapons need far more recovery frames to compensate for the fact that you have a second weapon.  Cestus in particular should probably be the weakest parrying weapon because of its extremely low weight. Increase damage taken from a partial parry or remove partial parries entirely.  Unlikely to happen. Add an FP cost to parrying identical to the cost for performing a shield bash.  Also unlikely to happen. Increase the stamina cost for parrying.  It might happen.Not all of these would need to happen but theyre possible knobs to adjust to bring parrying into line.  I would start by severely nerfing Hornet Ring Id nerf it from  to ... thats still going to be upwards of  damage on an average riposte quite significant and substantially increasing the recovery frames on Cestus probably  or  more frames and seeing where that leaves us.I also think that Blessed and Simple infusions should not provide their passive HPFP regen unless theyre actually in your hand.  I would also reduce the penalties to shield resistancesstability and weapon base AR for those infusions as compensation however.  Right now they gut resistancesstability and base AR by such a fucking ridiculous amount that you pretty much have no choice but to relegate them to cape duty.,darksouls3,d3pnrqs,0,t5_2w3z3

I say this as someone who never heals I actually prefer nohealing duels myself. But noheals should be an active choice made by each duelist not the result of massive community pressure and the strange mentality of honor.Theres nothing inherently dickish about healing other than that people dont like it. But saying its somehow morally wrong to heal because of that is a dangerous line of thinking  what if the community decides it doesnt like criticals or leo counters because they are too strong? What if the community decides the carthus sword as a random example is too powerful and thus unfair? Suddenly anyone who wants to use either of those things is shunned berated insulted. Thankfully there are a lot of smart people in the community who know where to draw the line when it comes to things that are too powerful but Ive seen a good number of the stupid ones over the years brandishing their honorsticks to go beat on someone for a perceived lack of honor based on an opponents weapon choice or certain tactics.Anyway Ive probably written more than your response warranted but I like talking about stuff hope you dont mind. ,darksouls3,d3r2suw,2,t5_2w3z3

Black Hand set kinda fits too the hat is very Gascoigne. Thief set isnt too bad either. Other bits might be mirrah gloveslegs assassin set northern gloves fallen knight set minus the helmet pale shade set bits of the prayer set cleric gloves court sorcerer chest jailer legs leonhards set drang gloveslegs.Weapon wise is harder since theres obviously no transforming weapons and the movesets are entirely different. Something with quickstep would be good for simulating the speed of BBs combat but none of the weapons that have it really fit the BB weapons. Bloodlust kinda works as a makeshift rakuyo what with its weapon skill being bloodthemed. Off the top of my head the bonewheel sheild can be used as the logarius wheel claws can be beat claws corvian scythe for burial blade pretty much any axe for the hunter axe drang hammer with gold pine resin for tonitrus. Fire surge is a good replacement for the flamesprayer crystal hail is similar to a call beyond.

Played a bit did a speed run to get the  astora sword before vordt and got invaded once by a invisible player. Didn.t pick any items up just battled and killed him. Then i decided to transfer my save to another account. After  days of not login in to my main account i decided to go to it today and what do you know? penalized once again. I bet it was triggered by the hacker.

7800655,0,t3_4m5fdc,For some reason I really love Greatswords. Damage may seem lacking compared to Straight Swords but they are not weak and hyperarmor in h mode is veryvery nice.My absolute fav is Hollowslayer GS. I love its sleek and fluid h moveset and it also consumes less stamina per swing superstrong R poke boostable by Leo Ring stance WA is pretty basic but still useful. Bonus damage to many enemies in PvE also.Second favorite is Twin Princes GS aka Homosword. Kinda PITA to get and split damage makes is less powerful than Hollowslayer but that gimmick stance WA is so much fun. Just equip Simpleinfused weapon offhand an enjoy shooting lasers with LR and clearing big crowds of enemies with LR.And rd best in my opinion is Black Knight Sword. Its probably the hardest hitting GS on a quaility build Rs are pretty standand R are not so good with exception of h rolling R which is awesome. And the best thing is Preservance  one of the best WA for PvP that makes this weapon simply impossible to beat in trade.,darksouls3,d3surrd,9,t5_2w3z3

Why do NPCs always say the exact same dialogue?

7808025,0,t1_d3tf8ta,Well thats subjective I suppose. While Resins require no investment beyond souls spell buffs are ALMOST always more powerful. Testing on a weapon with  AR buffing with a lightning resin gives  AR while buffing with  FTH Crystal Chime gives  AR. The difference is pretty substantial so long as your catalyst is upgraded. For melee characters only though that dont use other buffsspells resins are definitely a better option because it frees up quite a few points for use elsewhere. ,darksouls3,d3too47,1,t5_2w3z3

7816690,0,t3_4mblx3,Remember how Tanimura saw the whole Hornet Ring thing as being terrible so he removed it in DS but then added a mechanic that basically gave the same effect to everyone just for being in NG primarily to ensure that riposting in PvE on NG was still viable with the huge healthboost that enemies got only to realize that this new effect was just as damaging since it applied in PvP and then made it so it didnt apply in PvP any more?Good times.Once that whole riposteboost shit was gone pretty much the only way to oneshot riposte people was to get a lucky crit with the Engraved Gauntlets on the main attack of the riposte with a good weapon which was pretty rare or to just be fighting some glass cannon basic bitch. Even the most dickrippingly powerful weapons couldnt oneshot someone with a chunky PvP healthpool after the effect was removed and it was great. Before then one of the most popular tactics was to bananaspin or otherwise parry an attack switch to a shadow dagger CDGS or any other heavyish weapon and instawin. Once that shit was gone PvP became way more varied and interesting since not as many people felt forced into using unparryable weapontypes just to not get oneshot. Whilst ripostes were still threatening and could finish off anyone who was already wounded they werent instakills any more.Then Miyazaki just adds the ring back this time creating much the same problem that prepatch DS had. Fucking LULIts actually hilarious when you consider how many rings either have pretty niche or outright terrible effects in general or have specifically reduced effectiveness in PvP that is harsh to the point where their existence can be entirely discounted and then you have the Hornet Ring and  available slots to jjjam it in. Yeah its really a tough choice I can either have reduced weapon durability damage slightly cheaper weapon arts  incoming damage reduction HP regen  more health or  more crit damage. HMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM... Decisions decisions. This shit worse than ROBFlynnLeoClutch.Yes it can be countered. Being able to selectively charge attacks certainly helps this time around. But theres a reason that this whole thing was removed before PvP became notably better afterwards and apparently that removal is something that Miyazaki either disagrees with or just didnt perceive as being as beneficial as it actually was.Then again this is the same game where Miyazaki decreed that all armour is created equal which allowed us to focus on fashion yet punished us heavily for not having something in every slot. So who knows what actually goes through that mind of his.Parrying is fine. Just fuck the Hornet Ring.,darksouls3,d3unsfb,6,t5_2w3z3

7818877,0,t3_4mc2ko,Ive seen this thrown a lot no enemies with red eyes take extra damage and shit and also many enemies linked with the abyss lack red eyes but to me it seems like something else.It is corruption by the abyss but not in the sense of oh the abyss does this to everybody but particularly the Pus of Man which has very obscure origins.The Abyss Watchers have been Abyss hunting for VERY LONG and they do a pretty thorough job. They know how the recognize signs of corruption theyd know red eyes is a starting sign and wipe themselves out.And the reason I think that Red Eyes specifically means the Pus of Man is Gundyr.Look at him as Champion.Now look at him as IudexHe has red eyes back then. Why? Because the seed of the pus of man is already within him hes simply not taken yet as are the enemies we face with red eyes or the watchers themselves they are not FROM the abyss nor completely taken by it so were damaging their normal selvesI think the Pus of Man devours the victim from inside entirely so its merely a husk much like Aldrich controls Gwyndolins body.I mean look at the regular enemys faceTo me it feels like that thing isnt hollow that shit is utterly dead inside. As Gundyr probably was when we face him in the beggining of the game.,darksouls3,d3uwniv,13,t5_2w3z3

If he dropped two at the start of the summon his summoner would ALWAYS get something just for summoning him. Then when he eventually wins the summoner would get another third and while he would get another one since he dropped two he would still have one less than he started with.

7827344,0,t3_4mh3jy,Im running a heavy drang hammer build right now and its actually pretty effective. I use both the carthus milk and blood rings to boost rolling and use that as my only defensive option and it hasnt been bad at all in pve or pvp. Youre able to fit in a  hit combo with the weapon art and still roll away and thats with only  stamina. Besides that the important stats are  STR  DEXupped to  by milk ring and  VIT. The biggest flaws are probably its slight squishiness due to the blood ringi think and its lack of hyper armor. Attacks have to be spaced and times well to succeed in pvp for sure but for much of pve you can spin to win with the weapon arts and roll to safety after. So far Ive solod pontiff Aldrich and dancer with them and the great dodging was the mvp along with the effective weapon arts that was still usable after  dodges and left enough stamina to dodge away. As for pvp I have an even win rate and Im not that good so Im satisfied with this build. If anyone can provide insight to improvements Im all ears! Thanks. ,darksouls3,d3vuyyr,1,t5_2w3z3

Its all extremely fascinating and disturbing the baby crying made me have Bloodborne flashbacks but I still think we deserve more information revolving around Oceiros Ocelotte the QueenGwynevere and everything else going on here.

7841575,0,t3_4mq979,I agree that the game likely underwent major changes after the cinematic was made and most of your points make sense.That said several of them seem like reaching to me. I dont see any particular indication that the ruins we see are Anor LondoDukes ArchivesLothric Castle.The Abyss Watchers look like they are waking up the Cemetery of Ash and I see no reason why they would be buried at Farron Keep. Time has passed between their awakening and the Ashen One putting them down.The architecture surrounding the Firekeeper looks very much like Firelink Shrine to me even if it doesnt perfectly match the area ingame.,darksouls3,d3xgm7e,12,t5_2w3z3
7842175,0,t1_d3xbqcq,Here is what I personally think happened Oceiros is insane consumed by rage and sorrow. Ocelotte was his final chance to succeed in his lifelong goal and Oceiros did something to fuck it up. Either killed Ocelotte by mistake or consumed Ocelottes essence taking on the form of a child of dragons why the fuck else would he look like he does? The infantile cries you hear are literally what Oceiros hears all the time his madness is seeping into you as you fight him. In a moment of clarity Oceiros realizes that Ocelotte has left him Therefore he angrily calls out his sons name. If Im not mistaken the cries also stop at this point but there is no scream as if a baby has been killed so I dont buy into the Ocelotte is still around ideaIf we are sharing conjecture my guess is that Oceiros jumped the gun on linking the flame. He believed that Ocelotte was the perfect being to link the flame and sustain it forever. Lesser beings had linked the flame and live so Ocelotte as the perfect vessel should be able to link the flame and thrive afterwords.He takes baby Ocelotte to the Kiln to link the flame and in a twisted turn of fate is cursed and bound to Ocelotte in a similar fashion to his twin sons. EDIT As the two are now one Oceiros personality and mind take precedent in the new being and only the cries of Ocelotte as he is consumed by flame remain aside from his physical form explaining the cries during the boss fight. His new form has the attributes of a Child of Dragons and the insanity of one who linked the flame only he is neither of these things just a father consumed by rage and grief.This very act could be the reason why Lothric and Lorian avoid linking the flame. It already took their younger brother and drove their father to madness. The world will not be saved by their actions if they were to link it its death would only be prolonged. They share a great compassion with eachother and it is not a stretch to assume that they could share that compassion with their world and all those in it. They may have seen their decision as a coup de gras.Again this is all conjecture and Im not going to act like I have the item descriptions and total lore knowledge to back it up but it does seem to fit. As long as there is a good reason why Ocelotte and Oceiros linking the flame should backfire. The only reasoning I have for that is that the flame is not meant to be everlasting like the dragons. It sprang into life consumed the world and now it is time for it to die.,darksouls3,d3xj1m2,3,t5_2w3z3

I dont use it anymore because in PvE the Dragonslayers Greataxe is just as slow with a bunch more damage and I dont use it in PvP because its weapon art is albeit cool not as useful as the spearcharge of the Astora Greatsword. That being said it is a very very good weapon. The free buff is nice the moveset is pretty good and I think my favorite thing about it for PvP is how easy it is to mix up the timings between the Rs and Charged attacks because they initially look the same and if charged a little bit I think the R can burn then go out as well.

7867267,0,t3_4n26wr,I love this theory and would like to add to it. My speculation so far has been that the Deep is essentially a rising tide like an ocean thats going to wipe out everything no matter what. Theres always been a thread of ironic meaninglessness to the games an existential feeling that were never really accomplishing anything and to me the Deep is the ultimate manifestation of that. Here in the final game where were going to continue the cycle again or break it again or break it in a new way the truth is that none of it matters and that the Deep is coming and everything will be washed away. Sort of a metaphor for climate change.With that in mind let us turn to Ash Lake and the Arch Trees. Its called Ash Lake but its more like Ash swamp by the time we find it in DS. It feels like a shadow of something that used to be incredible and aweinspiring. Since DS came out Ive held to the theory that the Arch Trees are gateways to different parts of this world. Areas in Drangleic are supposed to be thousands of miles away from each other but we get to them by running through corridors. Most of these corridors appear to go through trees. If they are Arch Trees then thats how were able to cross huge distances in no time. Ash Lake was also where the Dragons lived and when Gwyn fought them they ruined up quite a bit of the place and presumably destroyed many of the Arch Trees and left it in the sad state we find it in. In DS its reasonable to assume that the Smouldering Lake is an even more ruined version of Ash Lake. The trees are completely dead burned to a crisp and useless. Ash Lake which was once essentially the Firelink Shrine of the entire planet a physical place but also another layered dimension where space is compressed into a hub is all but gone.Perhaps the Deep is Ash Lake the DeepWood is the beginnings of new Arch Trees reclaiming the world that destroyed them. The planet itself has had enough of the cycle of ages. ,darksouls3,d40cqn8,41,t5_2w3z3

7868066,0,t1_d40fato,Yes some users do sit back and wait for me to approach them instead. They werent included in the video since I wanted to keep it relatively short just one duel like this would have been a third of the video and wouldnt be all that fun to watch. Youll see some of this in the uncut session if you decide to watch that when its uploaded.Enemies are impatient and the weapon art is longer than almost any other attack in the game. The arena is also not that large. Eventually youre going to back into a wall and have to time the roll properly on the weapon art at some point.  At the end of the day you can run away from any weapon though not just a whip. It just means the duel will never end till someone gets bored and bites the bullet.I dont use Ashen unless the enemy does first including buffing then using Ashen to use the weapon art. It would also be pretty fair to use seven Ashen in one duel in my opinion at least considering a red phantom could very well duel like that legitimately. Ive honestly never come close to using this much though if a duel went that long Id probably just suicide and move on. Once I run out of FP I use the simple Caestus to continue using the weapon art after the patch hits to kill this tactic Ill probably need to start using Ashen in duels if I want to continue using the whip considering its almost broken straight sword levels of awful without the WA.,darksouls3,d40fz7m,2,t5_2w3z3

From shouldnt get a free pass just because thats how they are. I could see that argument being made for Demons Souls and the first Dark Souls as From was arguably somewhat inexperienced with making and distributing patches with detailed notes. But IIRC Dark Souls s patch notes while not detailing the minutiae of every single change that was made still had a lot more detail in its patch notes than Dark Souls  does.

Its just cheaper to use a macro on PC you dont need to buy a special controller to set up the macro.If youre not already doing it you should do it.  Figure out what weapon you have does the most damage on a riposte put all your junk weapons in storage and practice quickly equipping it a little bit.  Then try it on a generic enemy.

Only the Storm King is much more cinematic and difficult with the flying stingray type things just raining shit on you the whole time. Wolnirs gimmick was cool too I thought. I mean if Yhorm didnt have a gimmick it would just be a typical slash the ankles dodge the slow attacks type of fight which is arguably worse if you consider the might of a boss like Yhorm.,darksouls3,d47bgny,1,t5_2w3z3

Invaders come twofold The honorable duelist wholl seek you out make themselves noticed do a gesture and wont heal during the fight. Do the same and youll have a fun encounter. The other version often in those aforementioned areas will try to ambush you will heal during fights and bait you into NPCs.  To get an early sortof advantage thatll save you time later equip the Blue Sentinels Covenant item as early as possible. The rewards are notoriously tough to farm and youll get better results if your level is low the item summons you to worlds where the host got already invaded.There are also purple summons in this game that can fight PvE unlike red phantoms.

7949781,0,t1_d49kq9z,DS is the most  specific knowledge based of the souls games. It doesnt rely on mastery of the established mechanics as much as figuring out what to do in each situation. Although there are technically clues to things like the red drake and mimic players will generally only discover how to solve the problem after a death.  Compare that to DS where the only time I remember dying to something that strictly had to do with prior knowledge and not basic mechanics was jumping to get the fire keepers set the second time I magically managed to get it my first playthrough and died because the jump is really wonky. I prefer DS and actually value unfair situations because they make each moment of the game memorable and pose a threat to the player even after they are technically skilled. I beat about half of the DS bosses without dying but the only DS bosses I did in one go were sif pinwheel and nito. But the fanbase really prides the souls game on being tough but fair so I believe Im in the minority with that opinion. And also using this style of design can lead to Bed of Chaos and ceaseless discharge which are so knowledge reliant that they dont even use  of the core mechanics. ,darksouls3,d49mpom,6,t5_2w3z3

Thats why you see their phantoms around the world thats why you randomly get invaded thats why even when offline you get NPC invasions for people that dont have internet. It might not be a game built around duelling but its a series definetly focused around trolling each other and ganking and gank spanking and false messages and just overall MMOish gameplay.

7985553,0,t1_d4dj61t,Hmmm looks like Microsoft changed it with windows .Only way I can see to do it on windows  is to make symlink into a folder thats aready being synced.  Itll require an elevated cmd prompt.type cmd.exe in the search box and when that pops up right click it and choose run as administrator.In the cmd prompt go to your documents folder or some other folder thats already being synced to onedrive. In my case it was CUsersJosephOneDriveDocuments but yours will be different.  So in the cmd prompt you would type something like this    cd cUsersJosephOneDriveDocumentsThen you need to figure out the folders that your saves are saved in.  Lets assume that its something like cProgram FilesSteamSaves.  To make the symlink youd go to the cmd prompt and type the command in this format    mklink D ltnew folder symlink you want to makegt ltpath to save filesgtso in my case I did this    mklink D cUsersJosephOneDriveDocumentsSaves  cProgram FilesSteamSavesif all goes well you should now have a symlink that looks like a folder called cUsersOneDriveDocumentsSaves.  It should contain everything in the cProgram FilesSteamSaves folder and will be automatically backed up to onedrive.It was much easier to do in windows ..... dunno why microsoft changed it.,darksouls3,d4dnh7p,1,t5_2w3z3

7991404,0,t3_4ook1c,If you want a good scaling faith weapon you could get to  Strength and  Dexterity and infuse Lothric Knight Sword with Lightning. It gets an S scaling in Faith and has a decent amount of Lightning damage at  somewhere around . Also has a great moveset to boot being the neo Balder Swag Sword.For the actual casting purposes the regular Talisman is a great choice Can be bought at the Shrine Handmaiden and the Herald class starts with it. Has  Spell Buff at  Faith and at  and with the weapon art being Unfaltering Prayer grants few seconds of Hyper Armor for a cast makes it very viable in both PvE and PvP. Its probably the best casting tool for Faith users as Saints Talisman has a high spell buff at  but its Unfaltering Prayer is awful and the Sunlight Talisman has a really good Unfaltering Prayer but the spell buff is only like . The regular Talisman is the perfect balance between power and versatility.For spells Sunlight Spear is an obvious choice as it has great damage up close It does over  damage on the Lothric Knights directly outside Lothric and Lorian. Lightning Stake is really good for baiting people into attacking and it also has an decent AoE so it works wonders with Unfaltering Prayer. Dorhys Gnawing has really good bleed buildup and can make enemies that are weak to bleed fucking jokes The  Sulyvahns Beasts near the Aldrich Faithful covenant especially. Lightning Storm is okay at baiting people in and it has a huge AoE so if anyone charges in they will be caught by it.Thats really all I have for a Faith build. Get Strength and Dexterity up to  respectively get Astora Straight Sword and infuse it with Raw get Faith up to  ASAP get a Lothric Knight Sword and infuse it with Lightning level Attunement up to something like  Vigor and Endurance up to around  or whatever and wear anything you find fashionable.EDIT Oh shit I forgot about the rings and such. Of course use Mornes Ring and Ring of the Suns Firstborn as they both increase the damage of miracles Mornes by  Suns Firstborn by  Sage Ring is also a good choice as it will increase the speed you cast the spells saving those precious amounts of time. Darkmoon Ring is a decent choice as it gives you  extra attunement slots allowing you to equip more spells but its a reward for Blade of the Darkmoons and you may be an unlucky player in the sense that it just doesnt work for you. So if you cant get Darkmoon Ring try and get the Deep Ring as that also gives you extra attunement slots and its not locked behind a covenant. But it does give only  slot though instead of the  that the Darkmoon Ring gives.,darksouls3,d4eb5x1,5,t5_2w3z3

And Id also like them to use that white city we saw in the leaked pictures.       yeah I feel the same. I see guns working the same way as bloodborne as parry and interrupt tools. Think the themes of the game should be about perversion of the natural order like bloodborne where an advanced civilisation was trying to prevent the entropic heat death of the universe but accidentally ended creating being that harboured life and energy effectively turning them into gods and lords half great biological creatures half technological marvels like Akira.       Ive done lots of play throughs already half way through an SL run. I had an idea of doing a protect the princess run where I would be non hostile and summon phantoms to protect me then dried finger  WoB then no matter what just keep moving forward so it would be up to my summons to defend me against mobs... ,darksouls3,d4gl2ld,1,t5_2w3z3

8034870,0,t1_d4ijdyh,Well generally the only viable way to deal with gank squads is by being able to output high amounts of burst damage in a short time window so that you can eliminate the hostphantom before they can react if youre too slow with it youre just gonna get interrupted and they will heal it up. Thats why there is such little diversity in the gank spank builds  AR Hornet Ring riposte Darkmoon Sellswords bleed builds because there are only so many options in this game that have this high burst damage potential.Unless of course you have inhuman timing and patience to just slowly but steadily chip away at the hosts and phantoms HP while avoiding being committed enough to get yourself killed and finish them off when theyre out of estus  then you can use anything but theres also a higher chance of host summoning an endless stream of phantoms if you dont deal with him quickly.,darksouls3,d4j711x,1,t5_2w3z3

8035514,0,t3_4p8ijh,I would say that my classification of worst will be dependant on how much of an nuisance they were. Although the jailers were fairly annoying I didnt think much of them. Giving it some patience and baiting them one at a time was no problem for me might depend on the build though as pretty much everything does in this games!I would say the Basilisks. Getting ganked by these miscreants has caused me some pain. Especially when you get stuck somehow and a bunch of them just sprays their love steam all over you. Not to mention their whole existence and looks are a living meme. And after that I would say dogs and rats. SL or SL these motherfluffers are so annoying. Sometimes showing up from nowhere especially dogs and interupts your fight with another mob. I mean come one have you never been on a sliver of HP after a mob encounter taken a swing on that last friggin dog you ignored and he actually gets you?

8084441,0,t3_4pui9e,I always thought of it as everyone including gods eventually went hollow but going hollow and losing ones humanity is a process not an instant event. gt Below is what i understand from the games. Some fact some my own speculation.If we look at what we learn in DS when the first flame started to fade is when the curse of hollowing showed. Hollowing is a person slowly coming to the brink of losing ones humanity and completely becoming a hollow being. That meaning as in a person who has lost his humanity is is essentially a walking husk of his former self. Someone who can not die and can not think like a human being. They have lost their will to live.But as we also know beings whether god or not do not just lose humanity once the curse starts. Its a progress that takes a while to make you into the beef jerky you are but if a being has a purpose to live for gt Thou who art Undead art chosen Escorting lady into catacombs simply waiting at firelink and waiting for the inevitable.Whatever the purpose may be that is what keeps you from going completely hollow and losing your humanity. Your will to live is what keeps you from turning.Take the player chosen undead for example in DS. Sitting in a cell waiting to turn basically when a knight frees you and gives you this purpose to move forward. Now when we look at Gwyn at the end of DS we see that when he gave himself to the flame to fuel it not actually knowing what would happen to himself that the flame not only took his soulbodymind to fuel the flame but as we know the flame also needs humanity to sustain itself as seen when we kindle a bonfire. Humanity is what lets the flame burn for a little longer. That is what it took from Gwyn when he gave himself to the flame. His Humanity.Which is why when we face him he is this skinny jumpy shadow of his former self. He doesnt know what he is doing because its not him anymore. Just a hollow god.Now for his son we can conclude there is a purpose for him to still be around seeing as he clearly has his mind still with his fighting skills and the ability to ride his dragon companion. So really he doesnt need to be a god if he really isnt in DS to keep his sanity. ,darksouls3,d4ork2w,1,t5_2w3z3

If I go through the trouble of putting points into faith and attunement then Im going to make sure I make the most of it whether you like it or not. Some people choose to sacrifice stats to use buffs others choose to do it for debuffs others decide to use items instead while others yet use heals these are all perfectly valid fighting styles that are incorporated into the game. How is your whining about people who use their builds to heal any legit when we have people who use the sun princess ring or enchanted caestus ? What next are you going to start bitching about the people who use buffing spells instead of resin ? Just because mister cannot do the same ? And sure you are more than free to be a salty kid and use your estus to heal after all your bitching about how the game works because I say so but then again nothing stops the other party from using theirs either so you are not going to achieve anything other than embarrassing yourself.

If you waste that second chance by getting hit by a hilariously easy to dodge throwing knife then thats your fault. But for duelling charms used while the opponent is buffing is just pure cancer more cancer than any overrated weapons like the dark sword which isnt even that good. You cant cancel the buff while the guy is throwing shit at you. And if youre using a weapon buff it means your weapons will now only do like half the damage.

Still. Always.Pay attention to damage splitting weapons. When damage gets split like a PhysMagic or PhysLightning thats a pair of defenses that both sets of damage have to go through.If you can stack more damage out of a purely physical build you only have the physical defense of the target to get through rather than the physical and magic or lightning or whatever.,darksouls3,d4vexfz,1,t5_2w3z3

8153763,0,t1_d4wraft,gt Estoc turtle is without a doubt the best build in the game. It can swing after a block before the opponent can even start their next swing. However this is half due to Greatshields being extremely strong. A plain Estoc user can be beaten with a bunch of different tools. The nerf involved its recovery time after swinging which is irrelevant because only the first swing matters.So what youre getting at is something must be done about Greatshields to fix this issue but what do you suggest be changed? Also why do you think it is that the issue only seems to be with Havels Greatshield as I personally dont hear anyone complaining about any other shieldGreatshield in this instance?gt watDark Hand apparently got a silly buff so now punching SL players with it will deal upwards of  damage per hit.

8174556,0,t1_d4yv0t4,I dont mind the long post. I quite enjoy rambling discussions about lore. As for the profaned flame I think of it as an ancient force related to the old chaos and thus the chaos flame. Fire in this universe is more or less a metaphor for life and the essence of existence. It could make sense then that old flames contain knowledge and power. We know that the beings whobrcieved shards of the Lord Soul became immensely powerful. We also know that the chaos flame was so powerful thst it created demons and consumed one of the Lords herself. And finally we know that the Profaned flame granted some sort of ancient knowledge and great ambition to Sulyvhan. If the Profaned Flame is in fact related to the old chaos it makes sense that the flame contains ancient knowledge. Sulyvhan is a sorcerer and sorcerers seek knowledge. The old chaos fought against the ice magic in Eleum Loyce so it could contain a memory of sorts. I agree with you that perhaps Sulyvhan experimented with frost magic on his weapona and found it to be too dangerous. It is a type of magic that drains the very life from a victim similar to other things such as dark magic and the life hunt abilities of the crossbreeds such as Priscilla.  Even though the Pontiff is power hungry he is not stupid  so he could recognize the danger. Overall I think there is a lot to frost magic and the frostbite mechanic that is missing.  Perhaps it is also a victim of an incomplete development.  It would be great to see t expanded upon. Also Sulyvhan is perhaps the most interesting character in any souls game so far. He is central to the plot yet most people only remember him as that ass hole with the two swords.  He is an enigma. He used to be a sorcerer then he discovered some ancient and forbidden knowledge and used it to create an entire kingdom. What is his relation to Yhorm? What does he seek to gain by using Aldritch? What are the outrider knights and those black rings exactly?  What are those gigantic beasts in Irithyll? How is he related to the moon and moon sorcery? There are so many open questions that we need to find out.,darksouls3,d4zdax8,2,t5_2w3z3

However this has happened so much in this debate already that its become problematic. In that Dark Souls  fans just didnt bother to argue with people who hated it anymore because these haters were often so loud in their dislike that a lot of Dark Souls  fans felt they were a niche which has even given new players in this subreddit the idea that Dark Souls  was bad game and generally disliked which plain isnt the case by sheer numbers. Its no coincidence that Dark Souls  gets more vocal appreciation now that Dark Souls  is turning out to have some issues it emboldens them after years of hearing Miyazaki does it better which is giving one man way to much credit to make or break a game either way you argue it but thats another story.

8242049,0,t1_d57sqef,I do think the DLCs will be about what happened to Manus and his children.DS had the biggest baddie Manus. He was defeated and split into multiple weaker parts.DS was essentially about the weaker parts the children of dark. It also showed that not all of them are inherently evil Alsanna. I wouldnt mind seeing Alsanna again the DLC or even a mention. She seems to be a tragic figure. Waiting on her throne alone to the end of the world. And this is why I think DS DLCs will be about Manus and the dark. The Brides from DS were defeated and split again into multiple weaker parts. These weaker parts became the dark possessed creatures. Your theory about Eleonora fits into that mold. Regardless Im stealing it for head canon. ,darksouls3,d57t8bu,43,t5_2w3z3

8263814,0,t3_4sn14t,Having just beat the game I agree it does feel more linear than Dark Souls  but worlds better than Dark Souls . You still have a few branching paths here and there that eventually lead up to boss fights in dead ends Some optional branches as well!. On the other hand I do feel like I travel far more and the areas are far more complexlooping in on themselves than anything in Dark Souls . Lothric Castle is a great example of this. Almost everything you can see including the rooftops you will be running around on. Its amazing how fully fleshed that castle is and how many short cuts and other paths let you get from point to point easier as you progress through it. Theres even that loop from near the start to near the finish to cap it all off. In Dark Souls  you had Anor Londo which was far shallower by comparison. I loved the atmosphere dont get me wrong but there is far less to explore and there is a very strict gridlike feel to it. Dark Souls  also had a very shallow castle feeling in which most doors didnt do anything.I guess what Im trying to say is it might feel linear but thats because the hallways are that much longer? I think theres a similar amount of branching and generally more depth and complexity per area which is expected of a sequel x amount of years later.,darksouls3,d5aj8ui,43,t5_2w3z3

Hes the type of guy that would reverse roll x per fight just because it looks cool while it doesnt offer any real advantage.The thing is hes not advertising his gameplay as such. Hes talking like he would be in Scotts position good at the game effective knowledgeable. But he isnt. Hes saying that all of his ineffective flashy moves are actually well thought out and therefore have to work on good players too. But they dont. His combos rely on his opponents inability to press their roll button and while Scott is doing that as well to some extend because the game kinda forces you to with so low recovery times he at least knows how to keep his own ass safe enough to avoid incoming hits or trades.Everyone who has some knowledge about the game can see that. Its just the case that barely anyone of the big community knows their stuff decently well and because of that they believe people like PTS who advertise their bad sloppy but coollooking gameplay as good. The fact that no one of his subs knows anything about the game is the only reason that people even talk about this topic that much.

8295694,0,t1_d5ehp60,The corruption could be explained if say some of the abyss the split from manus corrupted the chaos flame after DS. Which would cause it to corrupt people like the abyss corrupts artorias and char them as the chaos flame charred the silver knights. Another note is that after being caught in the kindling of the first flame by gwyn the black knights went mindless and roamed the lands. So say the Abyss corrupted TOC was below eleum lloyce and the king and men went below to battle the chaos doesnt this imply SOMETHING was down there prior at least? and were charred black by the chaos fire and lost their minds to the abyss within the flame. Theyd become an artoriasbk hybrid corruption. If the abyss was not in the flame its possible prolonged exposure to the concentrated flame also corrupted their mindsmore like black knights after the linking of the flame albiet slower,darksouls3,d5eiqpv,6,t5_2w3z3

Thinking theres no way in hell Ill be able to beat that. Getting up and doing it again. And again. Other gamers call you a masochist. How is that supposed to be fun? You keep dying. But you are starting to do better. You are starting to be able to predict the bosss moves. You are starting to get good at this fight. You execute dozens of perfect dodges land dozens of perfectly optimized hits as the boss screeches and careens around the room. Its like a dance and its satisfying even when you lose. And then you kill it. And it feels like you won the goddamn Super Bowl. You are jumping and shouting.Meanwhile your friends playing other games are busy feeling vaguely satisfied as they press X to not die and victories are handed to them. They will never have an experience even close to the one you just had.Thats how invasions are in Dark Souls . But everyone is complaining its too hard its too unfair From needs to make it easier to invade they need to make it so they cant summon if Im invading or use a Seed or Hidden Body and Estus is too fast its not fair to me its pointless if you cant win at least  of the time even damnnohtml says its bad and hes really good at dueling its not fair.

Honestly it would make more sense for you to just use estus shard in inventory and it magically upgrades your estus flask. The only reason why they did it this way  prompts to go through just to upgrade it once at a specific NPC is because it feels slightly more impactful since it assumes most people rush back to upgrade their flasks soon after finding a shard. This way it feels like big progression like finding a heart container in zelda.But unlike the heart container in zelda it doesnt upgrade immediately. It doesnt refill immediately.

8309876,0,t1_d5g3xxe,     Well Hollows of Londor can and often do disguise themselves see the Untrue Dark Ring and like I said it just a theory and an imperfect one at that.  But Sirris is part of the Sunless Knights and serves the Nameless Moon setting her apart from Anor Londo and so Londor seems like the next logical possibility.       Another point is that Sirris refers to Gwyndolin as the Nameless Moon however Yorshka clearly remembers Gwyndolin and even refers to him as the Dark Sun which MAY further emphasize that Anor Londo is not the Sunless Realm.  Whoever the Sunless Knights are they are clearly not the Darkmoon and they have forgotten Gwyndolins name but is it possible that they forgot it intentionally?  The Nameless Moon can be seen as a parallel to the Nameless King the other nameless deity of the series who was stripped of said name for his foolishness and IF the Sunless Knights were from Londor they would have pretty good reason to hate the deity who fought the most against Kaathe and his Age of Man in the first game.  Again this is not hard proof that Londor IS the Sunless Realm however I would say that it contradicts the idea of it being Anor Londo.,darksouls3,d5gahs8,0,t5_2w3z3

Free aiming requires you to predict exactly when and where your opponent is going to roll. And if you roll in reaction to where the projectile is going and not on reaction to the actual cast itself your enemy cannot really hit you. gtand the talisman weapon art is insanely good.Too bad there arent any actually useful spells to use that weapon art with. gtJust because its hard to hit someone with a spell does not mean its useless it means you have to get better with that spell or weapon.No it doesnt. If you are using an ultragreat weapon to the point where if your opponent is using a fast weapon and knows what he should do you are fucked no matter how hard you try and how good you are. gtPyro and free aiming casters in general have a very high skill ceiling and have the potential to put good players in their place.I would argue otherwise. Skill ceiling in souls games is generally pretty low. Pyro and casters do not have that much potential simply because you can exaust their FP and their ashen estus with enough patience.

It was hard for me to go back to the ps hardware but loved the games.For me Bloodborne was an aesthetic masterpiece with amazing PVE and meh PVP. Well I didnt know the PVP was meh til playing souls. In DS after i got thru the mandatory mauledbytwinkers outside the undeadburg cathedral thing I started to get it. It was a bit slower and more methodical tactical even. Soooo many build possibilites. OMG... gotta build them all lol. Then  came out and its literally all I have been playing.Note that shields add such an interesting depth to the gameplay coming from BB but be cautious thats a twoedged crutch. Besides bosses swatting it aside and staggering you good PVPers will shield break you quick and find yourself reposted often.

Its NOT SUPPOSED TO MAKE SENSE.To answer your original question which I just now realized was your question  we dont really know EXACTLY but the game leads us to believe hes in the past. Our interactions with Gundyr are an example of a closed loop. In order to become Iudex he has to be defeated as Champion. This HAS to happen  and it turns out were fates weapon in that regard. We defeat Champion later in the game thus allowing us to beat Iudex at the beginning. I believe personally that the Untended Graves are a localized bubble of time existing simultaneously alongside the Cemetery of Ash in the same space. Time is convoluted in Dark Souls  and as the converging transitory lands of the Lords show  so is space itself.Time could also be wholly nonlinear in Dark Souls so who the fuck knows tho. ,darksouls3,d5l4yah,1,t5_2w3z3

And need it badly enough that they are willing to sacrifice a ring slot to get it? The first thing that comes to my mind is a Darksword R spammer. I dont know if nerfing the main way to punish R spam is a good idea. Im a pretty big fan of the rest of the list especially increasing recovery time on parry windows. Parrying should be high riskhigh reward and spamming parry should be a bit easier to punish. Although Im ambivalent about the OU weapon art thing. It seems like its pretty easy to read and dodge and doesnt need a nerf IMO.Id also like to see the HR speed of the Carthus CS reduced a bit.

This enabled you to get to areas you shouldnt be able to get to yet by crossing bottomless pits between sections of an area such as the large gap between Sulyvahns cathedral and the area after him without entering the boss room. So if you were able to get to Anor Londos bonfire using this bug you could backtrack and unlock the elevator shortcut that goes back into Sulyvahns boss room from Aldrichs Deacons outside while still leaving Sulyvahn alive. Afterwards you could go through Irithyll like normal and get to Sulyvahns boss fog but since you unlocked that elevator earlier you could have Sulyvahn follow you up the elevator and out of the boss room via the exit above as it is never fogged off unless youre invaded.Then you could take him wherever you want like the dueling area after Sulyvahn himself.,darksouls3,d5po2rw,3,t5_2w3z3

And just a mere few months after its own release all those years ago it dropped to k players per day.Putting aside all that you actually didnt refute my point at all.

This is his side to argue in favor of ornstein not being an illusion and the ornstein in dark souls   and  are all different ornsteins because time is convoluted. I told him this isnt the case you could make an argument for ornstein from dark souls  being convoluted by time because everything from dark souls  thats in dark souls  seems to be completely forgotten and what is remembered is pretty vague. But the ornstein in  and  are definitely the same as the events of dark souls  are much more remembered in dark souls  which leads me to believe it isnt a separate time line from dark souls  meaning ornstein was an illusion.

All split damage weapons need to be good is rebalancing and tweaking to their damage figures.

The only problem with it is that its one handed rs are among the most punishable attacks in the game. The recovery time for it is just too slow to dodge most things and the second rs hyperarmor is too slow to activate before getting hit. a parrying tool or left handed rapier may fix this but if it doesnt its one handed use may be limited to rolling attacks.,darksouls3,d6b647q,2,t5_2w3z3

There are less gank squads since there is a steady supply of Aldbros often resulting in great battle royales with sometimes reds of purbros added to the mix for maximum mayhem. Also I really feel that having profiles which are solid both in STRDEX and magic  miracles is a great way to add inpredictability even though there is probably a bit too much Chaos Bed Vestiges spamming.As for higherlevel PVP dying in months time I honestly dont care I will have moved on to other games lots of exciting stuff incoming on PS and I still havent played the latest Uncharted. ,darksouls3,d6d4x8h,1,t5_2w3z3

The highest number of estus flasks an invader can bring with them is  and that is if they have played all the way through to the Consumed Kings Garden or the Grand Archives.A host will have  flasks after they have completed the tutorial level  by the time they get to Vordt and  by the time they get to the very early stages of Undead Settlement.  Thus there is at most a  flask difference even at very early stages of the game even if the invader has played through most of the game and is highly optimized for very low level invasions.Undead bone shards do provide a pretty significant boost to an optimized invader though.,darksouls3,d6ency2,1,t5_2w3z3

DkS has DeS weapons DkS had DkS weapons and DeS weapons DkS has weapons from all of its predecessors.

The guy is not facing you when you back stab him. You can sometimes do this against large enemies in PVE like the three winged knights.

8672420,0,t1_d6pmrub,IMO Dark Souls  is the best because the world feels so real. You start off in the city and explore fantasy locations surrounding it rather than moving from one are to the next in the other games. The areas are in certain places for a reason and the surroundings always make sense in a way. You go underground and theres lava for example instead of going up into the sky with its own magical ground ocean of lava and castle. All the hidden tidbits of the location and the lore behind it all was amazing. Every location had a story of why it was there. There was so much more interesting stuff to. I felt like the others didnt really do much with world lore and went more with history and events after the first. ,darksouls3,d6po9qf,8,t5_2w3z3

As the Goddess of Sin it is Velkas job to define sin and mete out the punishment though she offers absolution by means of her Pardoners. Items and miracles associated with Velka include Velkas Rapier Velkas Talisman the Black Set Karmic Justice Vow of Silence Book of the Guilty the Judgment Set and the Clutch Rings.gtUnusually the Velkas Talisman is made from a tuft of her hair. The Ring of Sacrifice is also created from a rite dedicated to Velka.gtThe crow is also a symbol of Velka and many can be seen in the Painted World where several items and spells related to her can be found. This suggests that Velka has a strong connection to the occult. This is corroborated by Velkas Rapier also being imbued with Occult power.gtCut content reveals that there was a covenant devoted to Velka which was tasked with hunting down Blades of the Darkmoon. Because of this it is implied that Velka and Gwyndolin were enemies.Because of the description and function of Velkas Talisman as well as the nature of Karmic Justices magic adjust it can be inferred that Velka favored intelligence over faith.,darksouls3,d6vvdxk,1,t5_2w3z3

8753354,0,t3_4zwr73,Actually you are right. It wasnt Gwyn it was Gwyndolin and Frampt.From the very beginning the gods whose power had come from the first flame and its light feared the darkness. The feared men because they were bearer of the dark soul. Will you entrust your future to the ones you fear the most? When the darkness started to crawl upon the lands of gods they understood that the age of fire was ending.They tried everything they could they created a new flame in Izalith fought it with their bravest knights in Oolacile blocked it under a frickinlake at New Londo but nothing worked.In the end the most powerful of all them Gwyn resorted to selfsacrifice. But what happened actually? The fire was not restored to its full power it was just nourished with Gwyns soulpower.After his sacrifice just like in Game of Thrones the throne passed to the oldest male son the Nameless King was in exile so the new king wasnt the king of sunlight anymore it was the king of moonlight Gwyndolin.He understood that the fire age was ending again he knew that the sacrifice of his father was useless but what could he do? He did not hate his father he respected him he feared him but always stayed by his side even if he was despised by Gwyn himself because he was so different from his beloved firstborn who had betrayed him. If Gwyndolin sacrificed himself who would reign over Anor Londo the land of gods? He was so attached to the mission his father lef him he even created the illusion of a warming sun the illusion of Gwyneviere. He decided to sacrifice humans to exploit them to gain more and more power. he is the Dark Sun because he embraced the nature of men in order to achieve his objective. In my opinion he links the mankind to the flame with the curse .I dont know if he was willing to sacrifice his knights Ornstein and Smough but he certainly did not cherished the other lords his sisters rapist a bunch of demons a group of kings possessed by darkness and the shadowy deathskeleton he hated them they survived on the sacrifice of his father but all they could to was to be doomed by darkness or go mad. And so the curse began with the objective to collect the greatest possible power to kindle the flame again. Gwyndolin observed on the side in hiding.In the end we dont know why Frampt and Kaathe sided on opposite sides we dont know who their master was we know nothing about them. My hypothesis is that the side doesnt matter to them. If you follow Frampt you slaughter all the most powerful beings you kill the gods themselves It doesnt matter if you sacrifice youself in the end who will benefit from your sacrifice? You are just making it easier for the next chosen one to bring the age of dark. On the other hand if you refuse to link you become the most powerful being and peacefully wait either for the flame to die or for the next champion to come and slaughter you because they will keep coming until the flame dies and the curse with it.To sum it up Gwyn went all Stark and sacrificed himself with honor Gwyndolin was as sneaky as fuck.,darksouls3,d6ztrn7,2,t5_2w3z3
8754087,0,t1_d6zbv9s,I honestly felt having big plump censored titties really demeaned the work which was otherwise great and interesting.The undead are meant to be unpleasant husks and theyve never been sexualised as far as I recall.They never spawn topless anyway but she should have been a deflated disgusting zombie like the undead always are. No dumb censorship.When the character no doubt gets Kindled later seeing her fill out into a human form would be beautiful and the contrast helps readers understand why the struggle to retain humanity is important to an Undead.You could even censor the titties in human form but not husk form if you want to metapush the contrast between being a human or little more than a beast but no censorship is ever really necessary as long as things are handled maturely.This just felt like  of the panels unnecessarily drew attention to the fact this corpse has big sexy anime titties with clever censoring.,darksouls3,d6zx2oj,1,t5_2w3z3

8778380,0,t3_50az52,Ive said this before mostly being an asshat. This is a solid theory mind you but Ive always thought the best possibility for Yorshka  Priscillas parentage lie in Seaths story. Yorshka also isnt very knowledgeable apparently. People can fly shes trapped when she can just walk off a few ledges. I wonder if shes crippled or just that weak or dumb. Gyndolin could have just claimed she was his sister which if hes lying would make good sense.If he isnt however... that opens up a spectrum of Zeus dont do that. that I shudder to think about how twisted this tree goes.My current running theory is that Yorshka is being lied to about being Gwyndolins sister because Gwyndolin as much as I like that trappy bastard is an ass.The nameless king idea being her father could be an interesting twist on this theory as it would actually give some credence to my other theory replacing Tarkus the unlikely Priscilla suitor with a character much more likely to be in his place. That said. LOTS of speculation there with very little evidence Im actually aware of.Take DaS      into account however and you get some hilariously wild possibilities with stuff that strait up isnt confirmed particularly in the nd game.Manscorpion Tark has some very interesting lines like.My master was a powerfully lonely creature...The past is a distant fog I only remember... my name was Tark...Which after I posted a hilarious joke theory on how Tarkus died from a crushed pelvis after doing questionable things to Priscilla the only boss in the game that doesnt immediately attack you i had a hysterical laugh. though after Yorshka being locked in a tower the Pontiff rocking a greatsword an UGS and magic Gwyndolin being eaten by Aldrich AND Pontiff also being one of the bigger difficulty spikes in the game. I dont see a tarkus summon anywhere while Knightslayer Tsorig has his shield and armor but not weapon? Also I apologize  for this post being a mess.

It looks to me like there isnt even consensus in the article. I dont see how that actually fits into any of the definitions even the shitty first one that I dont think should be therre.Dude I just have to ask though why? Why are you insisting on using this fucking horrible definition? We already have so many phrases that fit and at the same time leave artificial free to describe things that are truly artificial. Im sure youd agree that real life feats that require precision and focus over long periods of time are usually described as difficult without people feeling the need to throw artificial in front of them. Why do it here? It really seems like you want to make the phrase less useful and powerful while at the same time creating confusion. What could possibly be your motive for doing that?And by the way Ive been playing games for a while. I know about the term artificial difficulty and I agree its been in use a long time. However back at the beginning of th gen I almost never heard it. People called things cheap. You know when artificial took off? Probably the last  years. Right when Souls got popular and everyone suddenly became a game design expert with  skills. I still hear this term thrown around disproportionately by the Souls crowd.  That doesnt mean its considered acceptable by most people though. Im pretty into platformer speedrunning and I pretty much never hear that phrase unless its from somebody new. And precision platformers on average require a lot more perfect play for much longer periods than Souls games. Its just that players of those kinds of games recognize this as requiring actual skill and are more reluctant to brush off challenges as being unfair in order to protect their egos,darksouls3,d76y6mn,3,t5_2w3z3

8853294,0,t3_51hon1,Just to repeat what I said when it was brought up beforePeople keep saying this but I personally cant see it and there isnt really any evidence for it. That the Nameless King is stated to have tamed the Stormdrake and led a lifetime of countless battles alongside it carries implications that dont really mesh with the theory.Is it possible? Sure but many things are possible given how little concrete information were provided. That said the mechanic parallel doesnt really hold up much. All or at the very least most Dragonslayers utilized lightning since lightning was the primary weakness of Dragons for Ornstein especially its only natural as he was both the head of the Dragonslayers and the Nameless Kings apprentice at some point. The King of the Storm itself never utilizes lightning instead it breathes fire as is proper for a Dragon and utilizes the power of Storm Wind which has been a power associated with Dragons since the first Dark Souls. All other attacks are by the Nameless King himself riding atop the Stormdrake after he absorbs its soul he continues to use lightning but also gains the power of Storm.,darksouls3,d7c1guu,12,t5_2w3z3

8854960,0,t1_d7c6fpd,Yes Kaathe wants the world to fall into darkness but thats not a bad thing. Feeding the Flame unnaturally prolonging the Age of Fire thats whats causing all the problems.See in the DS intro we see hollows emerge and find souls in the Flame three light and one dark. Having souls gives them consciousness makes them more than mindless zombies. Thats why Gwyn is hollow at the end hes given most of his soul away and used what was left to fuel the First Flame for a while. But the Flame is not the only thing that needs to be fuelled. Youll recall we find most bonfires unlit which indicates that they fade over time just like the First Flame and kindling them to make the flames burn higher and hotter consumes humanity i.e. bits of the dark soul. Being short on humanity causes hollowing. See where this is going? The longer the Age of Fire is artificially prolonged and the fires fed the less humanity there is to go around and the worse the undead curse gets.As for Kaathe he wants to fix this but he doesnt have the means to do so openly. So he has his Darkwraiths gather as much humanity as they can by any means necessary and turn it over to him. Desperate times desperate measures. Its no coincidence that he makes his home in the Abyss the darkest place there is as far away from the insatiable Flame as its possible to get. By hoarding humanity there hes trying to both snuff out the fire by depriving it of fuel and also save humans by preventing them from burning the very thing that sustains them. Hes trying to save the world of humans by destroying the world of the gods the gods are trying to do the opposite. Its eitheror the two cannot exist side by side. In order for one world to live the other must die.Except of course fire fades darkness does not. If the gods have their way the fuel will eventually be exhausted the fire will fade their world will end anyway and then there will be nothing left. If Kaathe wins at least there will be a world left. So yes the dark ending of DS is the good one.,darksouls3,d7c8olu,75,t5_2w3z3

8860074,0,t1_d7corbi,To be honest its the same with Katanas. Lorain can wind up swing and hit you well before youre able to get off an uchi R attack after his last swing its incredibly frustrating.Personally I think its that the bosses are badly implemented using a Bloodborneesque design that meshes badly with the way your character handles especially when using great or ultra weapons.... Lorian is actually the best example of this that I can think of  this boss has always been a DPS race for me will I run out of estus from traded hits before the boss dies? rather than an exercise in skill. His moveset is so varied that it defies learning and he very rarely gives you any time to breathe. So why not mash R?C.Gundyr is a counterexample. Not too many moves occasionally gives you a bit of space and you can parry him as an alt exercise in skill amp patience. I cant see myself learning Lorian in the same way I learned C.Gundyr  the fights just too fucking messy.,darksouls3,d7cutf6,2,t5_2w3z3

8865093,0,t1_d7dezz9,I have to respectfully disagree with the DS and DS feel in my opinion DS was all about exploration where they added so many new lands to the point that youre expecting something new after defeating a boss. Whole different types of environments just waiting to be explored. Its something that DS did very well with but with DS since it was so much bigger the feeling was that much more exciting.DS I think is less on that and more on so the feeling of hopelessness. Youre created from the failures of past lives molded together as the last hope and throughout the journey you see the failures of others before finally reaching the end which in itself is also a failure depending each ending. Its that monotonous cycle finally cracking that makes the game so unique in terms of its feeling. Its not about the feeling of purpose that you get in DS the feeling of wonder and lust for knowledge of DS its the feeling that your decisions that for the longest had very little effect to the cycle finally come crashing down and theres nothing that one can do to change it.,darksouls3,d7dgk2x,52,t5_2w3z3

8874101,0,t3_51srh3,To determine if a weapon is good follow these steps. Equip said weapon. Swing said weapon a couple of times and use its ability. See if you like the weapon. If you do its a good weapon.For PvE and casual PvP against invaders just about any weapon is viable. Weaker classes like Fist weapons and Scythes arent quite as good but can totally be used with some practice. The Knights starting sword is also really good so you can stick with it if you like.Shards become stupidly common down the line so dont worry about that. Eventually you can buy them for less than  souls so feel free to upgrade whatever you enjoy. You can also buy most of the other upgrade materials later in the game as well so feel free to upgrade the special items.Titanite scales are used to upgrade boss weapons you make through transposition. Talk to Ludleth and give him the Transposing Kiln you got from the CurseRotted Greatwood.The Irithyll Straight Sword uses Twinklng Titanite to upgrade. Its rarer but you dont need as much to fully upgrade it. The Straight Sword is a fine weapon but frost damage isnt particularly strong so you may find it lacking in the late game compared to other straight swords. But like I said you can eventually buy upgrade materials so feel free to upgrade and use it if you like it.,darksouls3,d7ejiln,6,t5_2w3z3

8877299,0,t1_d7ew5jz,I also have to agree as it does dilutes the depth of the game.The concept of SharpRefinedHeavy gems probably stems all the way back from Demons Souls which has the worst weapon variety. All CrushingSharp weapons basically had an S scaling with either Dexterity or Strength and Quality had CC scaling.Most of the weapons in their classes also basically shared the same moveset too.Dark Souls  improved on variety by getting rid of that system giving us plenty of more options to choose from for characters alongside introducing the favored Infusion system as well.Dark Souls  expanded on it and it gave way more depth into weapons including alternative movesets interesting scaling and a much better infusion system especially with auxiliary and elemental types of infusions. The game really did set a number of standards that Dark Souls  shouldve followed and not just for infusions either.If the weapons in the game at least tried to follow up with some of DSs examples with weapons it could easily be said that the base game could probably have been on par with DS in terms of weapon variety and depth otherwise we wouldnt have to sit and wait for both of the DLCs to come and judge it eventually.,darksouls3,d7excre,2,t5_2w3z3

8886227,0,t3_51ydae,From my understanding of the lore of the games no but it definitely wont be going on much longer.The world always cycles between two ages The Age of Gods and the Age of Dark. An alternative term for the latter is the Age of Man. Eventually some Chosen Undead ie your characters in DaS will either link the flame and continue the Age of Gods or let it burn out to a mere cinder turning it to the Age of Man until the Fire burns again.The timeline of these cycles is deliberately hidden and I believe its supposed to represent eons of time in between the changing of the two ages and in an almost monkeysandtypewriters scenario the exact same events will occur a god named Gwyn will fight the dragons with his Sunlight warriors a witch named Izalith will try to create a new Flame with devastating consequences etc. Dark Souls  is near the eventual end of this cycle spanning over several Ages which potentially spans millions of years. Its worth noting that the Flame seems sentient and has worldaltering capabilities likely greater than the gods themselves it literally makes the lands converge together and revives those who previously linked the Flame into Unkindled Ash for the chance for someone to link it again. Its also the likely but unintentional reason of the undead Hollowing those chosen to link the Flame are given the Darksign which revives the undead upon their death. But as the undead revive continuously the very act of revival strips them slowly of what humanity they have left eventually leaving them Hollowed and insane.Then the Flame chooses someone new. This doesnt happen to the Unkindled Ash because they already have a portion of the Flame within them having previously linked it.Its also worth noting that comparing the linking a character does in DaS and the linking in DaS is a good indicator of just how fucked the Flame is getting when you link it in DaS its a large almost explosive burst of fire. Meanwhile linking the Flame in DaS is more like tending to a dying campfire. So yes Dark Souls  is not the end of the Flame but it certainly is close. The only thing I could see changing things is the Usurpation of Fire ending which will begin rather than an Age of Man or Gods an Age of Hollows instead. Rather than the Flame controlling the Hollowed the Hollowed control the Flame. Perhaps such a new change could revitalize the entire cycle but as we see in any NG of that route the cycle still continues.Do note that a lot of this is speculative and based on my understanding using VaatiVidyas lore videos.,darksouls3,d7fzz1e,9,t5_2w3z3

8895938,0,t1_d7h4yfm,So for bleed weapons at any SL I would recommend using the Carthus Shotel. It has low stat needs and is really good at procing bleed and is powerful and fast. The reason it is powerful at low SL is because it has a C in dex which allows you to do decent damage while still procing bleed.The Carthus Curved sword also requires low stats and is mostly the superior weapon to all bleed weapons except for low level damage compared to the Shotel or the combo potential that the Twinblades have. The reason Id recommend it at higher SL than low SL is because it becomes a godtier weapon when you use refined gem and level up your Dex and Strength stats That means you basically give up  free levels in Luck for that big damage boost. It does everything the Shotel does but is weaker at low SL.Now for the Warden Twinblades. They are my favourite weapons. They are weak but also powerful for procing bleed. It also has one of the best combos for getting a bleed proc LRLR although the weapon does require patience to use and isnt as spammable as the Carthus weapons. If you use the L attack the R attack right after is almost always instant which is really powerful to learn how to use properly. Overall what Im trying to say is try out all bleed weapons and see which one you like. You can also use two at a time by putting them in both hands and if you want to two hand the left hand weapon then just hold Triangle on PS or Y on Xbox. Also to note if you put any of these weapons in your left hand then your L will become a parry. Really useful for fighting spammers.Also always use Carthus Rogue. Never forget it since it adds around  extra points of bleed so basically  hits would usually proc bleed on the Twinblades if the person you fight isnt resistant to bleed.,darksouls3,d7h5xon,1,t5_2w3z3

8927613,0,t1_d7kxyt9,Theres not much to go on about to guess how old Irithyll is but this piece of Anris dialogue might help to shed some light on the subjectgt We reached the Cathedral of the Deep but Aldrichs coffin was empty. The maneater must have left for his true home. The little doll in the empty coffin told me. Aldrich is said to hail from Irithyll in the Boreal Valley an ancient fabled city...To hail ones home or origins in a place.The use of ancient fabled city makes it sound like its quite old probably founded in between the first and second linkings of the flame. Its possible Sulyvahn we dont know if hes Undead is as old as that but we have to take into account that his rise into power was a long affair and not something that happened in a short amount of time there would have had to be enough time for him to train a sorcerer find the Profaned Flame rise through the ranks of the clerics etc.. Besides Aldrich started to consume Gwyndolin after awakening as a Lord of Cinder since hes only done with his bottom half by the time we interrupt him which means that Aldrich probably was the last person to link the fire before us. Also adding the founding of Irithyll to Sulyvahns list of accomplishments would probably show up in an item description or something. ,darksouls3,d7kyudz,4,t5_2w3z3

Similar to your situation one of my friends linked the fire by accident after defeating Gwyn because he thought it was just another bonfire to rest at. Imagine going through such a harrowing journey only to accidentally light yourself aflame and die at the very end. Itd be like if Frodo tripped and fell into Mount Doom at the last moment.Hell a lot of Chosen Undead and Ashen Ones probably dont have the slightest clue about whats happening. They cant exactly read item descriptions after all. With that in mind it can be a lot of fun to roleplay as a moron that only succeeds because youre involuntarily immortal. You dont really question what youre doing or why youre doing it. You just hit things until theyre dead.Doesnt matter if it takes hours days or weeks even  if you keeping walking through that fogdoor youll win eventually. Its horrifying from the perspective of a boss actually. Imagine if every day a lone venomous spider would wander into your room and mindlessly crawl towards you. All it takes is one good stomp to kill it but it gets slighter better at avoiding you every time it enters. On a long enough timeline that spiders victory is inevitable  even if it means trying until you die of unrelated natural causes. ,darksouls3,d7osiar,90,t5_2w3z3

A covenant that tries to reduce ganking is a cool idea but the actual reduction of ganking wont result. You wont see less ganks and sometimes the Bloodshades themselves will pull them. Its inevitable. Its how the game works its inherent to PVP. The cool thing about the Bloodshades is the idea not actual tangible results.

Its just a way to become Hollow.The original beings before the Age of Fire were Hollows as you can see in the intro cutscene when they all make their way to the First Flame. They only became the humans and gods with the souls they found in the Flame. Hollowings more of a reversion to that prior state presumably due to a loss of the soul that made you human or one of the gods.In short the gods can go Hollow just the same as humans can they simply dont do it via the Curse.

Elana and Four Kings for example are pretty easy on NG regardless of SL but nightmarish on NG since you wont have the DPS needed to keep the fight solo i.e. K syndrome. Compare with bosses like Fume Knight and Ornstein and Smough which are more consistently difficult capped at an effective difficulty ceiling.A lot of bosses are arguably more difficult on New Game as youre likely less prepared but overall its easy mode.Edit I removed the NG references.

Lower vit to minimum put those points into vigor again. With a light weapon like longswordestoc you dont need high vig to wear good protecting armor like heralds set.If you switch to a lognsword then you wont even need to go beyond  str dex. Hence why longsword is one of the best weapons for pyro. Estoc Astora GS and Gargoyle Spear are also very solid.Id switch Black Orb to Fire Surge or Black Flame. Or if you put more points into att and are a freeaim god get a great chaos fire orb.Those changes will make your build stronger in PvP but if youre having fun with what you have then no stress EDIT Great Swamp Ring goddammit! You gotta have that instead of the deep ring. Put some points into att  is the best. Even at the cost of going above  SL meta you could even go  and still get paired with  players.

9075269,0,t1_d82mblc,gt Dks dual wield akimbo weapons like gottards sellswords the macs and axes have more attacks and depth to their move sets that power stancing in .No they dont.  Power Stance in DS actually works the same way as Paired Weapons in DS.  For Paired Weapons when onehanding your RR attacks use only the right handed weapon once you switch to dual wielding you get LL which are the attacks that use both weapons the RRs remain completely unchanged.  This is exactly like PowerStance.  Except in DS the lefthanded weapon was an actual weapon I could equip and use independently even when not PowerStanced.There are two new attack that Paired Weapons have The RollingRunning Ls.  Thats It.  Thats the only improvement over PowerStance and its debatable whether or not its an actual improvement since in the process weve completely lost the ability to use a any attack that only involves the left handed weapon since we can never equip it independently.  For most weapons this might not be a big deal but for some like the Farron Greatsword it actually makes their moveset terrible because the entire use of a Dagger OffHand with an Ultra would be to take advantage of its faster speed.  The Farron is Unique but it would be better in every single way if it were made in DSs System where I could use the dagger as its own unique weapon with a full moveset.However youre also ignoring that Dual Wielding in DS was more than just PowerStance it was the ability to have access to almost the entire moveset of the weapon in your offhand the only attacks you lacked were backstabsripostes.  I have an entire character devoted to being Fume Knight in DS and taking advantage of the fact that putting the Fume UltraGreatsword in my left hand doesnt actually remove any of its normal attacks.  It was also being able to quickly switch between just having an offhand weapon and powerstance quickly to radically improve your moveset.  Dual Wielding a Curved Sword and a Straight Sword in DS wasnt just power stance it was attacking twice with your right hand then once with your left hand then powerstancing to do that awesome spin heavy attack then going back to normal to do a heavy attack with your left hand which was actually useful because it could combo.Dual Wielding in DS had VASTLY more depth than any of the Paired Weapons or Weapon Combinations of DS.Also in DS I can equip an Ultra in my Left hand and the character doesnt hold it like a straight sword like an idiot.,darksouls3,d82p7sg,23,t5_2w3z3

9084510,0,t3_54owei,Im one of those who believe that Ornstein actually left his armor in dragon peak on his way to become a dragon. we dont loot his armor set from a corpse. so he did it like the lothric knights which for me are the dragon creatures who sit around everywhere in Archdragen Keep and also left there armors.  There are some who dont think that the Dragonslayer Armor in DS is actually the one from Ornstein. But the item description says it is associated with Dragonslayer Ornstein. The term associateddoes not necessarily mean that it isnt actually his. So I think it is.  Dont get me wrong. I love the idea of Ornstein beeing the stormdrake of the nameless king.  I thought so too. But after a lil bit of research there are two item descriptions which dont fit in this theory for me.  The  Lightning Storm Miracles says  Once a slayer of dragons the former king and wargod tamed a Stormdrake on which he led a lifetime of battle. This miracle is likely a tale of their bond.  And the Dragonslayer armor says  Ornstein left the land in search of the nameless king. For me he searched him to reunite.       Which means for me if you dont go mad on everything else and forget about everything else after completing the path of the dragon to its fullest and actually become a real dragon Gwyns firstborn should not have had to tame his Stormdrake if it is Ornstein who was actually searching for him to reunite.   ,darksouls3,d83t6dx,1,t5_2w3z3

9111068,0,t3_54y235,Honestly I think the boss design there is some of the best in DS. None of the enemies are hard and the boss itself isnt really hard itself but it gives a very good feeling of defeating an endless horde of unkillable enemies. None of the Deacons are challenging themselves but together they can pelt you with spells and inexorably drag closer to you. The idea of needing to kill the one with the aura is cool because often that one is near the center of the mob and you have to wade through bodies swinging madly to get to the one with the aura before it moves on to another Deacon. Once the Archdeacon spawns in the fat priests near him start healing him and casting Force to knock you back. Again it doesnt really deal damage but it makes dealing consistent damage much harder. And of course the mass curse spell just looks fantastic and it really makes you feel like you need to get in there and start swinging once you see the curse slowly building up. Overall I think its a great fight. Easily the best version of the lots of weak enemies together boss battle that From has ever done. To be honest I doubt that From will stop making these fights and I think the Deacons will be really hard to top. Its not a hard fight by any means but damn if I dont come out of it feeling like a badass every time I kill them.,darksouls3,d87045h,1,t5_2w3z3

Since Gwyn and Lloyd are both Welsh names I was trying to find some sort of corollary in Welsh mythology which is kind of a complicated set of stories. But heres a couple cool items.So one of the main heroes in Welsh mythology is wait for it Gwyn ap Nudd. Interestingly Gwyn is a great warrior who leads the Wild Hunt in which he rides around with a pack of hounds to HARVEST HUMAN SOULS. lolwut. So thats kinda interesting. I couldnt find anything about sunlight or fire in relation to this Gwyn but you cant have everything I guess.Gwyn ap Nudd is the son wait for it again of Nudd who is also sometimes called... Llud. Now this is a different word than the one Lloyd is derived from but in terms of game designers coming up with names it could be an inspiration its not that much of a jump.

9134523,0,t1_d89uh8g,gt Youre comparing Soul Spear to Rs.So is everyone else though!gt . . . where soul spear takes  years to cast.About three seconds without max investment in casting speed roughly . with max investment which is usually what a Sorcerer would go for. gt Plus most weapons stunlock for at least two hits. Soul spear does not.Thats fine were only counting perhit damage. Its not like you cant dodge a CCS swing either. And yes melee weapons because of the stunlock mechanic will do more than a Soul Spear at this output. The logic behind this though is that you trade the capability for a hit combo for nearunlimited range in your attack certainly more than even the longest of melee spears obviously. Now whether that logic is sound with the way Sorceries track enemies in this game is sound is up for debate its not sound . gt It takes more stat investment. . .No it doesnt. If Im SL and youre SL we both have the same amount of stats invested in our build for the most part since you can optimize your build by choosing a class with an investment in the stats you want from the start but its likely that well both be doing this so its irrelevant. Thats just simple math. Gear and effort on the other hand yes I do agree that it can take more of these to be on par with melee quality builds in PvP cmon lets be real for a minute. Sorcerers can go up against things like bulky UGS or even typical Straight Swords like the Dark Sword and be on even footing. The real issue is the meta weapons that dominate PvP right now.gt You can argue that sorcery is viable till youre blue in the face. . .I never was in the first place especially since viable means absolutely fucking nothing since this community has been using it to death. My argument has always been about how the mentality that you must invest  INT and wear every sorcery item to deal reasonable damage is just flawed and I stick by that argument through and through. My argument is not taking into account whether you can hit an opponent with a spell or not as thats all a culmination of skill anyways and only considers the damage output of a single cast.,darksouls3,d89v7za,1,t5_2w3z3

Does not work on unbuffable weapons naturally. Ring of Fast Hands. A ring that lowers weapons strength requirements by  but decreases their scaling. Rusted Butchers Ring. A ring that lowers weapons dexterity requirements by  but decreases their scaling. Rusted Squires Ring. A ring that makes dark magicpyromanciesmiracles gain power the lower your health is. Martyrs Ring. A ring that boosts heavy weapon damage the lower your equip load is but applies a larger boost the heavier your weapon is. Berserkers Ring. Dark Wood Grain Ring. A ring that halves incoming damage but also halves your own damage and prevents you from healing while equipped. Cannot be unequipped while in combat or being actively chased. Ring of Devout Faith. A ring that briefly turns you invisible s and grants narrowly timed iframes when using a backstep. Ring of Silent Retreat. A ring that makes weapons do more durability damage minimal effect on smaller sleeker faster weapons maximum effect on heavy weapons doing considerable damage to enemy armor and being able to break it if they take enough hits.

Vendrick and Aldia sought a cure for hollowing I dont see how literally embracing hollowing and becoming Lord of hollows anywhere close to a solution.

Because I tested every single talismans hyperarmor by holding L on healing miracles and letting my friend wail on me. Sunlight has more Saints has less and everything else has the same. Canvas has higher base Spellbuff but worse scaling than even the regular Talisman and does not have more hyper armor. The Canvas Talisman is for builds with low faith who want to cast some miracles same as Ds. Also if youre saying Canvas has only  less SB thats a shit load less damage. Ill have to test it again to get the numbers on that but I distinctly remember the damage difference between my Saints Talisman and my regular Talisman being almost  points even though the spellbuff difference was about  because Spellbuff is a multiplier.,darksouls3,d8chsbj,1,t5_2w3z3

9189148,0,t3_566vwr,gt  I expect to die if I invade so I almost never do anymore.Then what was the point of having the mechanic in the game if it discourages people from ever using it? Constructive criticism of an arguably unbalanced PvP mechanic is fine and shouldnt be called misinformed. You are right that people should expect to be ganked and Im pretty sure the community has gotten the memo by now. I dont see anyone complaining about gankers on the sub anymore but plenty of people sharing stories about dismantling poor ganks ever since the Bloodshades were established so if youre advocating for people to stop complaining about it youre a bit late.,darksouls3,d8gsilw,2,t5_2w3z3

9198211,0,t3_56adbi,To add to what uHeyImNiko said it truly is the furthest possible thing from being balanced. If you dont need to give up any stats to make your build viable then suddenly only the best weapons become worth using because they benefit the most from your stats. For instance despite the fact that I have  Attunement I have not attuned a single damaging ranged spell because unless I want to constantly ring swap theyre not going to put out even respectable damage compared to melee and even then a buffed hollow melee weapon will still do more damage so that rules out magic for your fight club.Then as far as weapon choices go you have to choose one of the OP weapons. Anris Straight Sword and the Estoc are both good contenders doing very high damage with incredibly low stamina costs but if you want the highest damage per second the Carthus Curved Sword and the Sellsword Twinblades  Warden Twinblades for targets that can be bled have no match.Fights at that high of level are inevitably spammy and uninspired and thats not because the players at that level are all bad its because thats honestly the best way to win when your stats are that over the top.The best way to encourage creativity in PvP is not to raise the levels so that you dont have to give up anything its to lower the levels so you HAVE to give up something for whatever build you want.,darksouls3,d8hxvky,2,t5_2w3z3

Youll just be spamming attack without bothering to play defensively because you know youll kill it before it kills you. Take Witcher  for example. Has a very similar combat style but because it is easieralbeit not by much if youre playing death march NG with scaling on I find myself sometimes ignoring any damage I take just so I can play greedily and just take out the enemy. ,darksouls3,d8laxhq,1,t5_2w3z3

It is simply the best console for MP experience. Yes you get better performance but paying for the infrastructure of moderators and a secure program are specifically worth it to guys like us.Its not just me ive seen huge live streamers switch over for the same reason because  of your time is wasted on cheaters.

With swords you can hunt them down easily and maybe even get some roll catches even if you miss your first two Rs.The problem with normal swords is they have tons of utility As they should but also have stupid amounts of damage They should not. Swords should do a maximum of  AR IMO. Of course this opens a whole can of worms where now swords with  AR are almost like daggers but I have not thought of it to the point I lose sleep over it I know FROM is not gonna patch anything major any time soon so I just got used to it. ,darksouls3,d8rqkcd,2,t5_2w3z3

9276204,0,t1_d8r4se6,Thats exactly why I say the spoilers dont matter though. People come back not because of insanity but because whether they want to admit it or not its been reconciled within their head that the spoilers havent significantly impacted anything.Id even go so far as to say the spoilerphobes are a vocal minority in this case. I bet most people go through the game without paying attention to the story and just read about the lore later. Most of the spoilers in the videos are things like areas or bosses and even then a small clip in a video cant accurately replicate playing the game. My main point is just that the overall experience is way more than just what could be considered a spoiler and people focusing on that do themselves and the game a disservice although this applies to all mediums. They focus too much on one aspect. They dont see the forest for the trees.If you cant tell I really hate spoilerphobes.

They will become aggressive pretty fast and will make mistakes.But even with all these options its still insane combo and very hard to fight against.,darksouls3,d8sxtqc,1,t5_2w3z3

9330302,0,t1_d8ymq66,I respect that youre revealed yourself here and youre communicating with us. But I also wanna be clear about something even if your actions dont harm other players in the long run youre still causing grief to players in a multiplayer game and you know that perfectly well. And no one back then could know for certain that they werent going to be softbanned since Froms asinine system caused a lot of paranoia and continues to do so. I get that youre doing it for the lulz but you cant seriously be surprised that people get angry about that.As I said I love this games multiplayer and thus I play it a lot. Cheaters no matter if they only have  in all stats while at SL  or if they send me to Firelink in dragon form have a devastating effect on that enjoyment to a point where it makes me want to stop playing the game at times. It is frustrating enough when you get constantly ganked as an invader. Thats fair game though. But when people start cheating against you on top of that its a really fucking shitty situation. I wont ever rage against you in your comment section since I know its pointless or may even be what keeps you going.

9348108,0,t1_d8zdsgs,His assesment was VERY biased. . His very first point about the noscope montages could be said about any montage. After much practice I am consistently throwing fireballs where I intend to. . He makes a skill variable argument with michael jordan. It goes like this Remove skill from the equation and GCFO is actually bad. This is also wrong you want to set two players of equal skill against each other to test it.  Like Michael jordon in high heels vs Michael Jordon in ice skates. This means that w two robots set to low skill GCFO probably would not tier very high but if you took two optimized robots it would be another story. This is bc GCFO like parry has a high learning curve but great payoff. . I could criticize stat investment on a quality build as not having enough points for good spell casting. People who are bad at casting think that they are being ripped off when they have to invest points into the intended playstyle. I can agree with the need for the rings at least. . His criticism of GCFO He strongly exaggerates how easy it is to dodge a skilled pyro. At medium range you can begin to predict its flight pattern but in close range you dont get enough time. You have to guess if the pyro is aiming at his feet or if he is aiming where you intend to dodge to and if you mess up the fight heavily shifts in the pyros favor. Also the pyro can minimize your options by putting black serpent down first then he knows where you cant go. And if you play close to the pyro like he suggests then you are at greater risk of being punished for your approach or spammed by surge. In the end he is committing the same bias mistake he did with the michael jordon example namely that as you increase the skill of the player dodging the orb you must equally increase the skill of the player throwing the orb. . He argues that GCFO does bad damage! Oh my gosh could you imagine how ridiculously OP it would be if you could have a ranged attack that is equally powerful in damage to a top tier weapon? The whole point of a ranged attack is its ability to outrange an opponent of course it shouldnt be doing as much damage as melee. . He then states that GCFO doesnt get used at range but this is a mischaracterization of a ranged attack. The point is not to hit your opponent from a mile away the point is to attack your opponent before you yourself are in range of their attack. This means if you try a roll attack with Fume I am going to roll through it and begin my fire orb from outside of Fumes range and now he has to make a critical decision where to dodge because he wont have time to interupt me. Hence he is being outranged even with the Fume. I am not trying to noscope you from the other side of the arena which I have done anyways. . I want to comment on his build he made a terrible choice with Gargoyle flame spear. It is not a bad weapon but if you are going to use GCFO as your primary method of attack you need a weapon that can punish an approach in an instant. Some people use Black flame which does enormous amounts of damage if it connects. I would say you could easily get away with Lothric Knight Straight Sword paired with a light crossbow and in my case I prefer the witchs locks which is such a light weapon choice that I can afford the fast dodge. Another reason Gargoyle spear makes no sense is it trivials Fire surge to an extent making the long reach and small hitbox redundant with the spears long reach and small hitbox. ,darksouls3,d90xurz,1,t5_2w3z3

9359531,0,t3_58q1nc,Dark Souls is a lot slower than Bloodborne I highly recommend using a shield if youre new to the Souls series. Block and watch what the enemys combos are before attacking this way you can learn their patterns. This also goes for PVP just figure out your opponents patterns and if he never does the same thing twice just take it slow and punish mistakes. I wouldnt bother with parrying in PVE since the timing is weird and different from PVP but if you really want to give it a try most humanoid enemies can be parried. In PVP the general idea is to parry right before or at the start of the attack animation it takes a while to get used to but practice is all you need. As to what you can parry you can parry most weapons except Ultra weapons and Whips. On Ultra weapons you can still parry the running R and the rolling R.,darksouls3,d92dzfm,1,t5_2w3z3

9402171,0,t1_d97q8r7,its more than just health and endurance too. its versatility. a wide array of hybrid scaling weapons become actually usable since you can invest more into strdex than base requirements. that opens up a lot if you are ok with using melee in a magic buildif you want to remain a pure caster you can start using other schools of magic. this lets you make up for weaknesses within a certain school as well as make you incredibly unpredictable since you have significantly more spells at your disposalits a lot more than just more health and stamina for magic usersgtAlso a  pyro flame carthus flame arc at minimum requirements is better than a resin right?I think its roughly on par. It still costs a lot of FP over a resin though. Flame Arc is an oddity among buffs however. The pyro flame scales less dramatically than the other catalysts and flame arc lasts longer than other buffs as well as scales worse with your spell buff compared to other buffs. in your post you specifically mentioned darkmoon blade not arc every buff that isnt flame arc doesnt become worth the fp cost and magic investment until about  points in the respective stat,darksouls3,d97sicy,1,t5_2w3z3

9430200,0,t3_59tjnz,Hey man. For starters the meta is not . Its still at  but a lot of people have gone to . My main character is currently at this level. The reason why some people have gone to that level is because it allows for builds to be  feel more complete and not have as many weak points without being level . Strength builds are fun especially for invasions but in duels its a bit harder if youre not used to it. Strength weapons have a tendency to swing slower but granted can do some crazy damage with hyper armor to allow you to keep trading or get the upper hand. In all honesty your build should be decided based on what sort of weapons you want to use. If you think youd lean more toward the great weapons greataxes greathammers ultra greatswords etc. then a strength build would be best for you. Quality builds are always a strong way to go. It allows you to use essentially whatever weapon youd like to being that youre at a high stat in both strength and dex. It wont optimize your damage on some weapons but it will give you way more options. Quality builds are fantastic for greatswords which have gotten a quicker swinging speed since the most recent patch. I would personally suggest practicing with the Claymore should you want to go this route Claymore has always been my favorite weapon for its honest moveset. Quality builds are also good for straight swords some axes some curved swords etc. if you think youd enjoy a faster paced playstyle that lets you swing in between slower weapons and just simply be quicker all around a dexterity build is the one for you. This is a perfect option if youre into katanas daggers curved swords scythes so on and so forth. Ive never been a pyromancer or sorcerer so Im not the best source of knowledge for that. Let me give you some examples of builds if any of the ones Ive said have interested you. Quality  vigor base attunement  endurance  vitality  strength  dex base int faith luck. Analysis  vigor and endurance are a good point for a  build. It keeps you close to the  that a lot of  builds have. The extra vitality will allow you to wear heftier armor for when youre using some of the bigger weapons giving you better defense and some poise too also has been put in the game since last patch. Having matching stats in strength and dex paired with a refined infusion will give you the best scaling. You wont need the last three stats unless youre looking to use them for buffs as far as this builds go. Dexterity  vigor base attunement  endurance  vitality  strength  dex base stats for rest. Analysis  vigor and endurance will give you the same amount as most people. You wont need as much vitality being that dex weapons are much lighter in weight.  strength because most dex weapons dont ask for more than that and  dex to maximize your damage with dex weapons. I use a very similar build for my Chaos blade as it has an S scaling in dex and benefits greatly from the higher dex. Same rules apply as last time for other stats. The strength build looks good. It will do everything you want it to do should you want to try it out. Sorry for the length of the response just saw your post and wanted to try to help out and explain as much as I can. If you have any questions feel free to ask Im not one to pass judgement. No question is a stupid one. My PSN is TheDoctorDoom if youre on PS and would like to test some things with me. Good luck! ,darksouls3,d9bcc6d,2,t5_2w3z3

9432695,0,t1_d9bkibp,Oh absolutely. The gaming industry churns out trash these days and the souls series stands above all of that as shining example of incredible gameplay.But as you said they all had things wrong with them but I do think its a missed opportunity when these mistakes still exist from one game to the next. At the same time every souls game had their unique strength and in some cases it just boggles my mind why those features arent present in the other games. Why does darksouls  have ng rewards and darksouls  does not? Why do we still not have good covenants after so many games? Why were weapon arts just an afterthought?,darksouls3,d9bnqns,1,t5_2w3z3

Im only ish in DS though so the people Ive seen in the arena arent quite max level. Didnt really notice a pattern. Some were pretty competent and clearly knew what they were doing some were fairly clueless. I saw a lot of variety.

No other character creator offers this much freedom. The next best I can think of is Fallout  but even then the limits of that editor become quite apparent very early on in the creation process.

This drasticaly fluctuates with the skill of the Player way more than with the character  weapon level.I played it with my SL cosplay character not perfectly minmaxed build on NG and it was okay for me. I could also have done it with lower Level or in higher NG but I guess this wouldnt have changed the expirience much because I got catched in trapps and died at SL too. And if I made it untouched and with still full estus from one BF to the next I would have done this with a lower weapon and less Level too.Id rather recommand to Play it offline at first time because you dont want to get spoilered by the Messages bloodstains amp I dont like it to have my first playthrough ruined by summons nor invaders too. so this might also be personal opinionIn General I had a blast playing through this DLC! I dont get it how so many People could have been so disappointed by it! Yes it is pretty short. I got to the main Boss in h to h by playing complelty blind. And it took me another  hours until I gave up and asked the Internet to find the cnd Boss. and after Ive seen it I slapped my head because I didnt find the path on my ownThe DLC will surprise you with some verry cool Encounters that can be rated as minibosses in my opinion. You gonna have moments where you gonna think Daaaaamnnnnn where am I and where do I have to go??? and OMG this enemy is so coool I want that weapon and his moveset OMG and later you rly find that weapon and it is as cool as the Monster was.The main Boss was a real surprise for me. Even when I saw the Trailers I didnt expect what happened there. And he is pretty hard to beat but not impossible. I like that fight verry much! Also I think there might still be a secret noone revealed until now. For the ones interested I hide it in Spoiler but I still try to Keep it as Spoiler free as possibelSpoilers There are cut sceense in the Trailer Video we never seen in the actual DLC! So maybe we have to do something different to get that cut sceene to happen? I love the idea of the game still offering some secrets to discover! Ps If anyone knows the answer to the secret Id like to know it! D,darksouls3,d9f4ruo,2,t5_2w3z3

9469161,0,t3_5agctw,Sadly there isnt much to know. All we really know is that it was a large city at some point conquered by Yhorm. He wasnt particularly popular but was incredibly powerful so when the time came to link the fire the city got rid of him in the most obvious yet polite way.For whatever reason this linking of the fire caused a flame to erupt from the sky consuming all humans in the Profaned Capital. The Jailers survived this and later joined everyones favorite Pontiff once he discovered the Profaned Flame there.While we may not know the exact reason for or mechanics of the Flame we know it was caused by the Jailers. Since the Jailers live in close proximity to Anor Londo were not destroyed by the flame as the human residents were and are all related to a certain oracle its pretty safe to say that the Jailers are the source of Dark being descendants of Alsanna. The question then becomes the source of Flame. Seeing as the Profaned Coal also handles Chaos infusions we can surmise that the Profaned Flame is also derived from the Chaos Flame corrupted by dark.Coincidentally ages ago Alsanna too was a child of Dark tending to a frozen land that housed the Chaos Flame guarded by freakishly gaunt knights. Why the descendants of Alsanna profaned the flame they were concealing likely for generations is still a mystery. The only motive given is that the Jailers are all quite sadistic but that cant have been the only reason. Its also a mystery as to why Yhorms ascent to Cinder was necessary for the process.EDIT Sources  Eleanora  Handmaids Dagger  Profaned Flame,darksouls3,d9ga2ys,1,t5_2w3z3
9469231,0,t1_d9g6mon,Thats actually one point Id argue in favor of it. People use the blood ring all the time and that only gives you extra Iframes on your already absurdly good roll. Given the added benefit of Vitality as of . it might work in your favor. Especially when you consider that Vitality adds extra flat defense which is better than absorbtion it adds extra vigour which helps mitigate your damage AND youll be able to wear stronger armour all of which can mitigate the extra damage while netting you  free levels not counting Vigour because it cancels itself out basically while allowing you add more poise. ,darksouls3,d9gae4r,1,t5_2w3z3

9494232,0,t3_5au1jq,I played DS as my first game.I like it more than DS but...I own DS as a digital download on a friends PS. However I own my own PS now and uhh. So. I dont borrow my friends PS anymore. Which means I dont have access to DS anymore despite the digital download being technically mine haha.Each game has something I like though. DS is the closest to having the best of both worlds as far as things I like in DS that arent in DS and things in DS that arent in DS.While I never played DS because my computer is shit and cant run it my interest in the series started there. Entirely because the idea of a Poise Stat Get hit without falling down? Dramatically powerful looking moves dont even flinch me? Sounds badass. and the fact that its like... the only game where you can Dual Wield Shields something Ive wanted from a game for a long time... really appealed to me.Specifically the Bonewheel shield.Which was absent from DS. However Poise while not as impressive as DS was still there and was nice.I ended up rocking Heide Knight set and going full lightning spears on everything and saying fuck it to my dreams of dual shields Im not losing my dual shield virginity on something that ISNT the bonewheel shield and throwing poise out the window.Then DS readded the Bonewheel shield... but murdered Poise entirely. It only matters when Im attacking? Fuck that thats stupid as shit. And even then only during certain parts of the animation? Fuck you. Thats not poise. Thats just super armour. Super armour during some parts of animations is used in fucking everything boring bullshit fuck you ruined the whole point of Poise as an awesome interesting stat. Fuck you.But it has the bonewheel shield and its MUCH easier to play with friends. So thats nice.It lacks the Heide Knight set though. So DS having both the best set in the series AND better poise beats DS.Unfortunately while DS has the Poise I want... and the shield I want... it lacks the antitedious features present in DS and the features DS added to further improve on DSs. Though DS also failed to bring back a lot of DSs QoL type features Such as putting the orange squares around areas with a lot of people in them.DS also lacks any armour Im interested in. Aside from Giant and Golem which are alright sets the rest are garbage. So unfortunately its unlikely Ill ever have a desire to play DS.DS is the closest to a perfect dark souls game for me. Its weak to DS in terms of some things and weak to DS in others but its a fine balance between the two as far as features. I have things I want from DS to an extent with some extra nice convenience features And the best hub town and the Emerald Herald who is best level up lady while having slightly worse systems DS improved on.Also I enjoyed extincting monsters. I made DS a VERY peaceful place by killing almost every single monster. Even the umm... very tall knight guys behind the doors in that basement. The same guys who were a boss earlier in the game. You dont get to hide from me. I purified the world and lit every torch. Let there be light and peace in the world of DS.Minus the infinitely respawning knights in that same aforementioned basement. Despite my best efforts they kind of dont die and reappear when you go back to the bonfire. Alas. Just avoid the spooky basement though and youd be safe. D,darksouls3,d9jd8b9,-1,t5_2w3z3

9507031,0,t3_5b0zuu,I agree Dark Souls  had an extremely onpoint soundtrack. Every piece on it fits the theme of whats happening in the game as it plays. Special mention has to go to the Firelink Shrine Ash Lake and final boss themes  these are three of the most perfectly moodsetting pieces Ive heard in a game. The bombastic music wasnt quite as good as it would later become but Ornstein and Smoughs theme is no slacker and very memorable. The boss themes back in DS were more focused on setting and enhancing the atmosphere for each fight than at being memorable pieces in their own right. Sometimes the two overlapped though like with Sif and Gwyn.   Dark Souls s OST has unfortunately never made any real mark on me. I like some of the songs on it well enough and it does have my single favorite theme from the DS games Sir Alonnes theme which is the perfect fit for the last stand of a noble and valiant warrior but overall it just never caught on with me. One of the best uses of music in the game is definitely entering Vendricks grave though. And the music from the DLC is easily far superior to the main games just as the gameplay is which leads me to believe the forgettable boss themes from the main game actually has the forgettable bosses themselves to blame. I imagine that when composing for a video game the direction and material for the music to be set over is very important and if thats bland and doesnt offer much direction then maybe the music will be thereafter. Pieces like the Burnt Ivory King and Sinh however are brilliant like the fights.Dark Souls  kicks up the boss themes to eleven it easily has the most powerful boss themes of the trilogy I think. Kitamura doing many of the pieces really paid off. Theyre both great songs and usually fit the mood of the fight very well such as how Yhorms theme sounds as huge and imposing as the man himself how the Twin Princes carries an air of twisted regality that segues into what almost resembles a sorrowful last hymn for the pair or how Pontiff Sulyvahns sinister twopart theme starts out eerie and lurking only to surge upwards into an explosion of chanting choirs. The soundtrack still never felt as overall onpoint as Dark Souls  to me though. The area themes like Firelink Shrine and... well yeah Firelink Shrine cant match the originals by a long way and the usage of Gwyns theme in the final battle however technically well composed merely felt hollow to me like an empty attempt at recapturing what made the original so emotional meaningful and memorable.   As for the others I havent played either but listened to both soundtracks in full. Demons Souls havent stuck in my mind aside from the haunting Astraea theme but Bloodborne stands out as easily the best OST of the series. The sound quality is by far the best as you pointed out and the compositions are probably the most impressive out of any modern game. It feels like a true successor to the games where composers for classic JRPGs were knocking it way out of the park in the s. I cant wait to play the game for myself because Im sure the music only gets even better when you go through the full experience.,darksouls3,d9ky060,7,t5_2w3z3

9541579,0,t3_5bjkil,I really like this and share your opinion of people who are rude with gestures. Thanks for taking the time to put this together and sharing it with the community. Regarding the various attack types I think some weapons naturally lend themselves to different attack types ex Gotthard has good R R L and L movescombos but some weapons have only one good attack but that one attack may be REALLY good. Case in point is the Carthus Curved Sword. You may find the lack of attacks other than R boring but the R is really the only effective attack the weapon has possibly excepting the weapon art. The katanas are similar  they have a few different decent moves standard R is OK the weapon art is pretty good but where they really shine is the running R WDR. If youre not using the WDR for over  of your attacks youre not using the weapon properly.Also you need to consider that while an opening R will combo into the next this isnt usually true of the R attacks giving us all even more of a reason to stick with the R.  TLDR Dont blame players for maximizing the effectiveness of the tools theyre given. Blame the game creators for not making the other attacks sufficiently attractive. ,darksouls3,d9p74sb,1,t5_2w3z3

9542167,0,t1_d9p5t6d,Are you referring to how the game seems to consider each of these lands feels like a separate slice of time? Theres a few big chunks suggesting that these lands arent as fragmented and separated as we initially thought.The Crystal Sages for one. Their base of operations were the Grand Archives and one came over from Lothric to aid and assist the Abyss Watchers. Thats a major correlation there.A minor tidbit is the Profaned Capital It houses one of two leading schools claiming heirship to Logan. This means it had to have coexisted at some point with another school maybe the one in Farron? In the Archives? Im actually having trouble remembering other precise references.Third one real quick is Sully himself primarily with all of his outrider knights. Its not a mere coincidence that these guys are bearing rings representing his eyes These are also scouts and infiltrators for the other kingdoms the eyes of Sulyvhan possibly providing intel and correspondence and hell maybe Sulys so magic strong that he can peer through them.Some of the stronger parts of DSs story and background are how solid all the interconnections are part of it is reflected through the world design too. From the getgo were told they all worked together in killing the dragons and shaping the world. On the flip side DS misleads this through that initial dialog Churning converging homes?

And for that matter why was Fraampt so adamant on linking the fire if he knows the true way is to end the cycle hes also Primordial he also was there with Kaathe to witness it all and yet believes opposite of Kaathe.On this end the Sable Church most definitely does NOT want Orbeck to be the Champion of Ash. Why? I mean hed probably agree with them to usurp the throne the guy was an assassin. Oh wait he was an assassin. Odd how Anri is dead the moment its clear youre not gonna be becoming the Lord of Hollows and her friendly guide is nowhere to be anymore. Perhaps Orbeck was a Londor assassin at one point but left? And even more of that matter its clear the Firekeeper can hold the power of the First Flame within her but yet everyone else needs a Dark Sigil to do it? Sounds like the Sable Church doesnt like that fact as it goes against what they say is law wherein only hollows with the Dark Sigil can do it.

9596580,0,t3_5ccq4s,I agree with all of your points. Infinite respecs would be a godsend for me. I love the game but playing through it over and over again just to try out different builds to spice things up is really a drag and in the end I think it makes me take breaks from the game more frequently because of the grinding. I understand that you can simply just make new characters with different builds and stick with them instead of using just the same one but making new dudes and getting to NG to get all the rings and having to farm for covenant restricted gear over and over again is a lot of grinding.I think its confirmed that were getting new arenas. I hope theyre all unique so youll have a reason to want to fight on each one instead of just a few favorites.Implementing a chalice dungeon system sounds like a ton of work. Even though it would be a very welcome addition I felt that not many people really appreciated chalice dungeons in Bloodborne. While I personally enjoyed exploring the dungeons and finding unique weapon variations and neat blood gems as rewards I recall the Bloodborne subreddit complaining a lot about how the chalice dungeon grew old and repetitive well at least for the more vocal players.A horde mode would be awesome. I can imagine fighting off waves of knights while pus of man enemies show up once in a while as minibosses.

Youre not winning until the enemy is dead because comebacks are so easy when people actually trade especially if you land a parry so I dont think that argument is valid.Also DamnNoHtml mentioned that it would be harder to run if rolling costs more stamina but thats only true if youre using a fast weapon because slow weapons are too easy to react to and only roll when they swing.

Once you hit B a backstep will happen almost instantly and it takes maybe  frames for your models feet to leave the ground I think this time is actually shorter but I dont have a way to confirm this myself.gt I mean thats pretty much how it is right now  try to backstep in response to an attack.I dont see how this is true at all. Ive used backsteps in response to an opponents attack before I knew they didnt have invincibility frames and would be hit purely because I was still in range of the attack. My animation had nearly ended by the time a Straight Sword swing would have hit me and if we incorporated invincibility and recovery frames into the animation this would have been the time I just started the recovery animation feet touching the ground again. The animation is much faster than youre thinking it is I believe.,darksouls3,d9xk5d3,1,t5_2w3z3

9636263,0,t3_5d0igh,Not sure if this will be helpful to you but I will try my best to answer from what I remember. Gwyn in DS and maybe Solairethe Chosen Undead. DS has no explicitly named Lords of Cinder. There could be hundreds of unnamed Lords of Cinder due to the unknown number of cycles the worlds have gone through. The Soul of Cinder is the avatar of past lords of cinder their souls all coalesced into one from the first flame.  In DS the First Flame is dying and needs to have the great lord souls that originally came from it back. The gods are all birthed from the light souls Nito Izalith and Gwyn. Gwyn tried to link the first flame kindle it by giving back his lord soul to it sacrificing himself. However it was not enough to keep it going. The chosen undead needs to kill and collect the souls of the remaining great gods of Lordron to empower his own Dark Soul to be able to successfully link the fire replacing Gwyn as the sacrifice. or not if you do the dark ending. Linking the fire aka becoming a lord of cinder kills the chosen undead DS is kinda unclear on this. If a chosen undead also called heroes or champions fails to link the fire they become chosen ash or unkindled a special kind of undead called forth by the tolling of the firelink bell as a sort of backup plan if things get really bad. DS is very vague on this and there are many theories on how an unkindled works.  DS has primal lords but they are not lords of cinder they never linked the fire. They are powerful god like beings related to the original  lord souls or reincarnations of them. Be aware that DSs story was not written by the author of DS or DS and there may be inconsistencies because of that. The Lords of Cinder in DS are the last  chosen undeads who successfully linked the fire in the previous cycles. Each one sacrificed themselves or was forced to to keep the fire going. Prince Lothric was supposed to link the fire in the current cycle but chose not to and the fire faded past the point of recovery. A backup plan was put into action and the four previous lords of cinder were summoned to firelink from their graves to give up their souls to a new chosen undead who would link the fire. However this plan failed when the lords of cinder did not want to be set on fire again and fled firelink back to their old homes.  To link the fire someone needs to have the equivalent power of the original four lord souls light life death dark. Each of the lords of cinder has fragments of these souls within them and thus the ashen one needs to gain their power. ,darksouls3,da0v9r9,3,t5_2w3z3

Its a big pet peeve of mine when people keep trying to force an inherently subjective thing into an objective mold.Sure there are elements of games same as movies that could be argued to be objective. If a game crashes all the time you could argue that its not a very competently made game.But there is no such thing as objectively enjoyable gameplay or engaging story any more than there is an objectively funny joke or an objectively moving song. So much of what makes a game good or bad is ultimately subjective.If awards were given out for any reason Id say they ought to be given for being influential but thats something that is almost impossible to tell until years after release.EDIT At least come up with a counterargument instead of downvoting and bolting like some child.,darksouls3,da3f7q1,0,t5_2w3z3

The only issue I see is that doing a life ring gt sun princess swap puts me over .  That said Im not even good enough to pull this swap off midduel.

That being said Im not just going to ignore the problems Dark Souls  has that prevents it from being Game of the Year material.Just like I wont ignore the fact that Overwatch doesnt have a story mode yet has built probably pages of exposition for its characters. . .

9696840,0,t3_5dyqnn,Yes this game is pretty terrible as far as PvP goes. I hate that invaders can use estus. I know there is the items that make it where it blocks people from using estus but Im not going to always run around with it in my lineup and have to switch between a ton of items all the time during PvE. People only look for the easy win rather than just fighting you. I was down in the area right after Pontiff where the crocodile wolf things are  and this douche just stood on the ladder for  min blocking me from going up and wouldnt come down. He finally came down and tried to fight me and I took down half his health in one shot. Then he ran away and healed like a bitch and then came back and I got him down to th health and he ran around like crazy like a bitch and then climbed up the ladder and left my world like a bitch. If youre gonna invade me then fucking fight me. Invaders only want to fight if they have  other enemies to fight me with. So they can gang up on you and run away and heal like a bitch.

Alonne is the reverse of this super easy with a good shield rather hard when only dodging due to a combination of delayed and fast attacks.. People used up their wedges before getting to Fume and didnt find the rest making it so he was constantly healed.. People fighting him in higher NGs for the first time instead of starting a new character to run through the DLC. In the upper NGs he can easily oneshot and has a bunch of health whereas the two other bosses from the DLC still leave a small bit of leniency in the upper NGs.,darksouls3,da8umct,8,t5_2w3z3

It could literally just be the sculptors depiction of it.

9772199,0,t1_dahkkvg,Ive played since Dark Souls  and parrying is a goto in my tactical repertoire. Funny story.. I had been trying to get my best friend into these games forever but he was really turned off by all the walking in the first and the halflife bar in the second. So he comes over to check out the third and in only a few hours of play time I had already gotten to the Crucifixion Woods. He was convinced and picked it up. He struggled from the get go taking several hours to beat the tutorial boss. He came back over a few days later expressing grief and frustration. I said Here watch me play  maybe youll learn a thing or two. Parrying always seems to change slightly and by now I had it figured out. I parried Gundyr and my friend looked on in amazement. He had never thought to do that. By the time he got to Pontiff he was parrying shit left and right. ,darksouls3,dahn1o4,1,t5_2w3z3

9777307,0,t1_dai85ak,gt So the Bearer of the Curse who is still Undead and still immortal btw would have to live through civilisations rising and falling over and over again. Which in a way could be worse than just dying or going Hollow.  I agree that it would be a shit life. Im not saying stepping out of the cycle is necessarily a good idea for ones sanity and happiness look how fucked up it made Aldia  gt Presumably you still need light and warmth to live a normal life.  From what weve seen of the laws of the dark souls universe I dont think amount of light impacts a humans ability to survive. Again I agree that its not exactly a normal life if youre living in a twilight world surrounding by mad hollows but its your choice whether you go down that path.  Basically to summarise my thoughts on this a bit better now that Ive organised it in my head more Aldia never really achieved what he set out to do but he gave it his best shot and once that shot was done there wasnt anything else he could try. The only ways I can see to theoretically break the cycle are to completely eliminate fire which seems impossible from the laws of the universe or to permanently maintain the fire. Permanently maintaining the fire should then surely be Aldias goal but his dialogue suggests that he hasnt committed himself to this cause beyond the scope of light beyond the reach of dark etc. etc. which sounds to me like hes fighting a losing battle and will toil in obscurity for however long his form lasts. Its a touching story and one of the best that dark souls has ever told but I dont think it can really be revisited.,darksouls3,dai9olz,1,t5_2w3z3

9809115,0,t3_5fomvx,Best Twin Princes. Fantastic design both aesthetically and mechanically. Difficult but not broken. Plus wonderful soundtrack with a lot of emotion to match their lore. It represents a unique twist on multiple boss bossfights and I adore the teleporting mechanic because it is used far more aggressively than theyve ever used it in the past but it doesnt go overboard with it. I also think its the only boss in the game that correctly forces you to hone your instincts which DS stresses a lot more than the previous Dark Souls.Second Best Abyss Watchers. Beautiful design that does a proper homage to Bloodborne without being too copypaste looking at you Friede MariaGehrman combined with a phenomenal soundtrack. And the mechanic of the boss brawl is not only an appropriately fresh concept but its also executed well. Unfortunately the boss has way way too little health and the second phase returns to a rather boring oneonone duel that wouldve been okay if the moveset wasnt the exact same thing as phase one.Honorable Mentions Champion Gundyr and Dragonslayer Armour. Probably the best designed bosses in the game. Movesets that perfectly balance difficulty with fairness and both challenging in their own way Gundyr challenges your ability to sustain against long combos but isnt ridiculous with them like Sulyvahn. Dragonslayer challenges you to be spacially aware more successfully than other bosses without being unfairly overwhelming about it. Unfortunately Gundyr has far too little health and Dragonslayers lore is poorly implemented making him feel randomly placed and unsatisfying to overcome.Worst Consumed King Oceiros. Visually uninspired looks like a malnourished Bloodborneesque dragonbeast thing way too easy tiny moveset that is trivial to master especially the boring charge in phase two and boring boring boring! He looks boring his fight is boring and his character is so poorly developed that fighting and defeating him doesnt feel like it gives any real payoff. Plus it leaves a bitter taste by being a waste for an amazing soundtrack.Second Worst Ancient Wyvern. An undeniably terrible boss that is outshined by the mobs you fight to beat it. Just a crap dragon fight. However it is slightly redeemed by actually having a pretty neat puzzle that reminded me of Demons Souls it shouldve taken more than one hit to kill it though! and by not being as disappointing as Oceiros because expectations were much higher for such a lorerelevant character.Honorable Mentions Vordt and Crystal Sage. Vordt has far too little health for such an imposing design and his moveset is painfully simple. Crystal Sage is also too easy seems like a stupid checkpoint before the Cathedral of the Deep and his design is stupid for being just Big Hat Logan as a boss.Hardest Sister Friede and Father Ariandel. Selfexplanatory really. A combination of an attrition fight a multiple boss fight and a Bloodborne fight. If Im honest the boss is okay but I think its hard for all the wrong reasons. The attrition aspect is poorly implemented with three separate health bars and adds tedious padding to the fight. The multiple boss aspect wastes the potential of Ariandel and its placement in the middle of the fight fucks up the pacing. The Bloodborne aspect is both way too copypasted and just feels wrong to fight because well its a Dark Souls game not Bloodborne. Altogether they make the fight really epic but tediously difficult and sometimes unfairly difficult because Friedes Bloodborne speed and ludicrously long combos are pretty much impossible to counter. The fight is more running than attacking and thats not a good way to make something hard.Second Worst Nameless King. Just a really really punishing boss fight. The arena adds to the difficulty and his moveset has some wonky hitboxstagger mechanics. Not a terrible offender and actually really fun and epic to fight but Ive died to him from some pretty bizarre hits.Honorable Mentions Pontiff Sulyvahn and Soul of Cinder. Sulyvahn is not only combos for days but his attacks take so few frames to complete that its sometimes somewhat unfairly impossible to dodge attacks. Doesnt have high health though and his doppelgnger in phase two makes his fight much easier. Soul of Cinder is a nightmare of combos and huge hitboxes in phase one and his phase two nearinstakill combo make him extremely difficult with two separate health bars but its mechanically sound so it just requires a lot of skill to defeat him.Easiest Yhorm. I dont really have a problem with this being easy but its actually really hard to die in this fight if you use the Stormruler. He has a cool moveset but its easy to dodge and his hitboxes are actually really solid so you basically have to roll into an attack to get hit by it. With Stormruler taking him out in about five hits its over quick and easy.Second Easiest High Lord Wolnir. Another gimmick fight. Nothing particularly challenging about fighting him although sometimes it can get really annoying where he puts his hands. Dodging isnt hard but he is pretty damn punishing if he connects especially the breath attack so a little bit harder than Yhorm.Honorable Mentions Curserotted Greatwood and Champions GravetenderGravetender Greatwolf. Greatwood does little damage and is really easy to stagger but has some difficult hitboxes and his weak points arent always easy to hit. GravetenderGreatwolf is a combination of a really weak NPC and a miniboss you already fought twice. Nothing particularly difficult about it by the point youre doing the DLC but you can get overwhelmed if youre sloppy.,darksouls3,dam6m9r,1,t5_2w3z3

And again from     An exploit from the English verb to exploit meaning using something to ones own advantage is a piece of software a chunk of data or a sequence of commands that takes advantage of a bug or vulnerability in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior to occur on computer software hardware or something electronic usually computerized.    Anything unintended by the developers IS a bug. Whatever said bug is useful or just some random pixels producing garbage is still a bug.

In the Demons Souls days sure there were some griefers with stuff like scraping spears but it didnt seem like there were a huge number of people like that and the discussions and such seemed more fair and...pleasant. But Dark Souls  I think thats the first time I saw people dismissively telling others to git gud and obnoxious stuff like that. Kind of an elitism that swept through the community and it seemed like a lot more griefers as far as PvP in duelsinvasions is concerned and the hacking...and just an ugly scene all around. Then Dark Souls  rolled out and it kinda divided people a lot of people hated and mocked DS and looked down on those who liked it. I see a downright unbearable amount of people like that on Twitch. Ugh. Not to say things have really improved for Dark Souls . But I mean I feel like there was a lot of negativity swirling around at least as far back as DS.

9866169,0,t1_dasoi5t,Kiting mobs has never worked in my experience. The AI becomes completely fixated on you and the gank just murders you while youre trying to avoid the enemies you kited. Ive been in many situations where mobs continue to chase me even after getting hit by members of the gank. You can also never hide with mobs because people who summon a lot have more Giant Seeds than lone hosts. Its a stupid system. Like I said it kills any possible creativity in invasions.If you have trouble agreeing with me about skill vs. builds in invasions Id invite you to try this out. The same logic applies to Oroboros builds.I have a bunch of normal metalvl builds that I use for everything. However when invasions really get to me I have two NASTY twink builds built to be the most efficient builds in their respective levels. Hilariously I get less hatemail for twinking. Our community is weird.Whats also worth noting is that I almost never lose even to groups of people who play well. The only people I lose to are twink ganks running the same thing! Turns out having more damage and being able to kill people faster is the most important thing for success in invasions. You can call it a crutch or cancer but the results speak volumes of the nature of this game. It proves that all you really need to win invasions is to have a more powerful build. Try it yourself and see the difference. If youre morally opposed to this try invading with a Rotten Ghru weapon. Youll see the difference. Outside of Gank city too since in Gank City you can just have other invaders carry you.You can try to get around this with whatever skill you think you can ply but brute force is multiple times more effective. And you cannot match the brute force of a gank.,darksouls3,datl1zu,2,t5_2w3z3

So after running back and forth a bit I finally run down into the arena and realise the host had been hiding crouched using hidden body. Before she could even cast on us wed killed her.

I mean that shit is hilarious. Of all the points you could make you latched onto a small vagueness in the English language and then proceed to completely undermine your point. At first your comment almost had the right holier than thou condescending assholishness to get under my skin. But as a seemingly rational albeit assholish and ironically lacking nuance  person I think you fully understand how you dismantled your own point. Im sure youll fire up the indignation flames but I mean cmon you even used the words dislike to describe not like. You had to change your phrasing to highlight what you meant.

9897146,0,t3_5h5lns,The DLC was distinctly average tbh the real test is the scaling application. The enemies were weak but hit for truckloads of damage in NG which is fine if their scaling is adjusted but in NG and beyond the scaling is a joke. Gravetender imo is too easy he guard breaks after like three hits and has no resistances at all including phys so if you equip the hornet ring and  hand a decent weapon you can kill him in  ripostes even disregarding the damage you can do normally and the wolf only has like six moves five of which weve seen before but harder. The other boss is far better but the scaling is stupid annoying. Youd better know the boss well by NG because you cant block anything due to insane chip damage. Even the filler attacks wreck your health. What most upset me was the linearity. Entering the snowfield for the first time I thought it was modular as in three areas or so like the first each telling their own story about Ariandel the Millwood Knights the Corvians...even just those two would have done which would interconnect so I was deeply disappointed when I unceremoniously reached the end after one small area I mean come on not even a cutscene? You literally made one settlement and an open expanse then called it a day? Really? Although to be fair the variety of weapons and armor were great even if I resent the fact theyre mostly more powerful than base game because I can no longer play undead match for more than an hour at a time due to it invariably being onyx blade pyros spamming the min  damage one millwood axe or dark sword r spammers follower rapier weapon art spam or washing pole phantom range abuse.

9904653,0,t3_5ha6xm,Its generally considered to be rather stripped down in terms of content. A lot of features were rolled back that had been expanded upon in DS.The story was much more refined and less bloatedderivative creatively speaking though. Something i feel DS suffered from to an extent. It also made more of an effort to create that impression of environmental connectedness and coherence that DS was well known for albeit on a more micro rather than macro level lothric castle and cathedral of the deep for example. If i had to sum up Dark Souls  i would say it was an attempt to return to basics and keep things focused. However i feel the attempt to return to its winning formula basically made it TOO formulaic. It tread upon too much familiar ground without REALLY establishing its own identity. DS was controversial yeah. But you could never call it a straightforward repeat.

If youre going up against a faster weapon take advantage of your poise. If the opponent youre fighting against is above average in skill and is clearly playing reactively then keep a small weapon in your pocket. To some people that seems to go against the spirit of UGS but really if you want to win against someone who hits you once and rolls away over and over again then you need a fast weapon. Even wielding one in the offhand is a decent idea. They have the potential to be good. It would be nice if the weapon swung faster at least on the first swing.

Going all the way down the Great Hollow and coming out of that hell to see the beauty of Ash Lake was incredible but what made it such a remarkable experience was the realization that those archtrees were holding the entire world above and that this was the graveyard of the ancient dragons. Being pretty was important sure but it was this feeling of seeing something primal and tragic that made it work. Fishing Hamlet. My favorite area in the series to be in. The decrepit yet charming village with the rain and fog and all those sounds of wood and sea and rain... It is just so pleasant so immersive. The way we enter it was mindblowing and the understanding of what happened there upon hearing that first fisherman... Damn. Such a perfect moment in gaming.If I had to pick one... Fishing Hamlet.

9979851,0,t1_db8bfoz,When the description mentions first of the Scholars the description is referring specifically to the Grand Archives in Lothric.  Aldia was situated in Drangelic which is considered a different place. Could he have moved to Lothric? Maybe. Maybe not. However nothing implies that Aldia was in these specific archives except for the Soul Geyser spell but ill get to that later.Just because Aldia is a scholar that doubts the linking of the fire this does not mean that he is the scholar in the Grand Archives that also doubts the linking of the fire. The Sable Church is entirely against the notion of linking the fire so it could easily be someone else that fits the billWe dont know how Ocelotte was really made or conceived but this point still only loosely ties these eventsSulyvahn may in fact be directly tied to Lothric and may have had influence in the Kingdom. We do know that he is a sorcerer but in the High Wall of Lothric in the circular courtyard where we see the Winged Knight walking around the statue in the middle appears to be holding a sword that is very similar looking to the Profaned Greatsword. Not only that but the statue of the person holding this sword has a bracelet on his arm just like the Pontiff when we meet him.The only thing that could tie Aldia is the Soul Geyser spell but how do we know that it just wasnt passed down like Big Hat Logans spells with Ocerios? An Outrider Knight even guards the spell. So while the spell could have in fact been originally created by Aldia it may have been found and adopted by Sulyvahn.,darksouls3,db8eiip,3,t5_2w3z3

This means that if you hit with the very edge of the scythethe actual blade you do more damage than if they were right in front of you and you were actually hitting them with the hilt. It provides a fun challenge of being able to time your attacks and being able to judge the distances. Also if you land the weapon art beck swipe and hit the sweet spot it causes the headshot stun animation allowing for more attacks. I would also recommend one of pontiffs eyes rings which either A. Give health with each consecutive hit or B. Do more damage with each consecutive hit. I recommend corvian great scythe with bloodbite ring at least until you can get Friedas scythe.  Or an elemental build in which you build your character around one type of damage lightning fire etc. This gives you a limited weapon selectionunless you infuse and a disability against certain bosses. A bow run is challenging for scrubs cough cough but it is very satisfying to do and causes you to stay stocked on arrows instead of dumping all your souls in to levels.I recommend black bow of Pharris Tldr Scythes Elemental Bow,darksouls3,dbg7b1c,2,t5_2w3z3

10060760,0,t1_dbhysuh,Yeah I made a pretty popular post about it a couple months ago. The issue is that FireDeep are simply bad on things that arent daggers used strictly for parrying most of the time. Split damage is just so meh in this game that its not worth it.The thing with the Giantdad is that its whole point was to minmax to to the max. And since Chaos let you have damage comparable to a normal build without any stat investment you could hit the soft and hard caps for health stamina and endurance. Realistically the Giantdad was actually just a joke build but it pulled off the whole minmax thing really well. That said thats not really possible in DS. Even if you left STR at  you dont need  you only need  if youre handing and the original build never onehanded hence it required  fukin strength a  Heavy Zweihander will have an AR of  which jumps up to  once you throw a resin on it. Plus this means that theres less of an issue from split damage absorption since most of your damage is still physical. So if we wanted to really minmax for potential wed start with  Vigor just as a base  Endurance With FaP  and  Endurance we have  stamina Each swing from a H Zwei takes  and rolls take  so this lets us swing three times roll and still have  stamina left for an emergency attackroll the highest stamina possible is  at  END so theres not much point in going higher since well never swing more than  times  Strength and  Dex and  FTHINT along with  Attunement. As a deprived this puts us at SL  meaning we have  points to get to SL or  to hit meta of . Like you posted with Havels and FaP  we only need  Vitality to medium roll in full Gundyrs with all our weapons. So what do we do with at minimum  stat points? Pumping them into Vigor nets us  health which isnt bad but at that point isnt a huge bonus or anything. Theres no point in putting them in Endurance Attunement Luck Faith or Int. So we could put them in Vitality and get heavier armor I guess. But that doesnt do much for us at all. Pumping those  in VIT lets us swap our chestlegs for Havels but it only nets us about  more general physical absoprption which is nice but not great or anything. So that leaves us with Dex and STR. Now we know dex is for casuls. So what if we place those  points into strength? Going from  to  gets us an AR of .  to  is a . boost to our AR. So our options are  boost to health  percentage point boost to absorption being casul or a  boost to outgoing damage. If were going for a minmax build its pretty clear the AR boost makes the most of those  points. And if were going all the way to  that leaves us another  points to play around with. The ideal stat investment here is from my quick calculations which might not be compeltely accurate  Strength and  Dexterity for a total of  AR refined. However since dex is for casuls still lets say we just did  Strength and left DEX alone. Now we have  AR on Heavy with  points to go. Now we can just put them into vigor for a little health or into VIT so we can replace a piece of armor with Havels for a tiny bit more protections. So thats where I was coming from with my original post haha. From my perspective GiantDad isnt about mimicing an old build that just so happened to work out years ago its about fighting the Meta with a build that makes the most out of nothing. And thats what my goal is.EDIT Some grammar stuff,darksouls3,dbixwcr,1,t5_2w3z3
10060905,0,t3_5jtyty,A basic StrengthFaith build would work for you I think.  Most early Miracles in the game are supportbasedhealing etc and itll be a bit before you actually get an offensivebased Miracle so for the most part youd have to rely on a weapon.Sorceries and Pyromancies have more offensive options early on though naturally low damage applies on the former due to how badly shafted magic in general is in this game but even then those two will let you work with spells primarily and weapons as a backup.

One on One fights with a low teir enemy and mob will tear you apart if you lock youself down with blocking. Unless you can one shot them after that block rolling away is better because you will get swarmed. light projectiles at medium range. At short and you can easily roll past them which more easily tansitions into attacking then if you block and at long range you can easily move out of the way. Top of the cathedril comes to mind as an area this type of blocking happens. light shields for parrying. blocking traps but most traps hit you from the side or back so running around shield up is not very effective.New players may have an easier time at first with blocking but will quickly find that not only do they need to learn to roll for nearly everything but they have to unlearn the instinct to block,darksouls3,dbvypex,1,t5_2w3z3

Despite how menacing some enemies especially bosses look sometimes the best thing to do really is to get right in their face when there is an opening. Just dont get greedy.Gundyr took me hours to beat for the first time. This game really does throw you right in. Thats the beauty of it. If you arent having fun then I wouldnt blame you for shelving it but if you keep going you will get it eventually. Gundyr tends to attack in threes. So time it right and roll away then repeat twice more then you can go in for one or two swings. Then back off a bit and repeat until hes down. You can do it! ,darksouls3,dbxcof4,13,t5_2w3z3

10201978,0,t1_dbzx2np,gt  If youre concerned about your reflexes being slow then you probably arent parrying. Which is fine because this setup doesnt use a parry tool.  I dont have much issue parrying in PVE but in PVP I find the huge variety of weapons a challenge to learn the right windows. Of course experimenting with them to try to learn mostly gets me killed.  I suppose I could spend an evening in the arena practicing nothing but parrying....gt Anyways the Black Knight Shield besides being one of the highest stability medium shields in the game trades its ability to parry for the ability to activate weapon arts with one hand. Press L then you have obnoxious amounts of poise for the next attack or two.  This is actually my shield of choice when I play with Drang hammers. Recently I have dropped it for a parrying dagger and mostly  hands the hammers for that L L R combo. I always seem to settle on close weapons... dual craftsman hammers and maces in DS and recently in DS Ive found success with the bandits knife.  I dont know if its my play style or what but I get absolutely wrecked when trying to play with anything larger than a greatsword. ,darksouls3,dc0g94h,1,t5_2w3z3

10208843,0,t3_5m5w3z,Dark Souls  is much harder for me. Its mostly owed to the increased speed and hyper aggressive enemies. Dark Souls  was perfect for me in that regard it was a very tactical affair for me and could be beaten with observation and patience.     Dark Souls  sped up a bit but also offered a lot of weapons so whenever I hit a brickwall it was fairly easy to change up gameplay adapt and keep going. Dark Souls ... nope. I cant keep up anymore. It sped up too much From my perspective without a corresponding system balancing it out. In the end my fucked up nervous system didnt allow me to react fast enough. And so I struggled a lot with Dark Souls  as a result. For reference I started with Dark Souls  and always found it relatively easy because it played to my way of gaming Observe adapt. ,darksouls3,dc189he,2,t5_2w3z3

10215443,0,t3_5m99qo,Theres a difference between subjectively enjoyable and objectively good. I love this fight. Because I love Sif I love snowy environments and I love attacks with fancy animations and effects.However  take away the atmosphere and the environment  and its relatively generic. Not bad by any means. Just nothing special and clearly had the potential to be better.I think the biggest reason this encounter gets no love is due to the nature of our expectations.Due to Froms relatively excellent execution of DLC historically anything less than excellent is immediately deemed garbage. In addition to that this DLC only had  bosses.  If its going to be the shortest DLC that they have released then expectations are ramped up even more. Oh only  bosses? Well they pretty much better be the best  boss fights ever created or people are going to bitch. In fact people would bitch even if they were. Because its only  and we have  reasonably come to expect more.That being said...If this fight was part of the core game and not the DLC I am sure it would get plenty of love.  Especially if it were an optionalsecret area with a covenant or cool item. Same exact fight put into different context and with different expectations and people would eat it up.I dont feel bad for liking this fight but I am not at all confused why it gets no love from the community.,darksouls3,dc1z85h,6,t5_2w3z3

Where strength or dexterity hit soft caps at  and begin to give diminishing returns intelligence scaling seems to ramp up past  until about  being the agreed stopping point. Also if this character is a PvP character the only reason I would personally stop at  and  you should drop the magic clutch ring. Clutch rings dont give the same bonus to PvP damage as they do in pve. The crown of dusk is very useful for a magic damage increase but remember to take it off against magic damage enemies because it severely reduced magic damage  absorption. It will be extremely difficult to limit to sl and still have the attunement and intelligence to do good damage and have more than a couple spells. ,darksouls3,dc2vj6r,1,t5_2w3z3

10235952,0,t3_5mkmlh,if you made a  weapon your current char can only invade people from  or  up to  and its level locked too so dont expect that you can invade as a level  in undead settlement. except people in new game plus but thats rare. so when you are starting with an invasion built you could make a level  built with a  weapon invasions from undead settlement up to catacombs and save your file on your destop pc named lvl built or something do this for different levels too i recommend lvl  with  insane fun in irihtyll and post pontiff a  or  built and thats enough maybe a meta built for duels. So at the end you have like  different save files each with an different built. so you can invade anywhere you want without making a new built your weapon level should be around your current level divided by  so if you are  you should go for  but not more. just think about how whould be the built of a casual player in this area his level his weapon? yeah then you need to git gud in pvp.

10247540,0,t3_5mqu63, Id recommend taking a look at the start of a playthough. Itll show you want its all about without spoiling much. In very short terms its a fantasy fighting game where you have to kill a lot of stuff. Every now and then you have to kill bigger stuff. The stuff is very hard to kill sometimes so be prepared to die. You dont need to know too much of the story to play . A couple of references might go over your head but the story is relatively selfcontained unless you want to get to the really deep stuff. Id never played a previous Souls title before  and when I got into it I just looked up a couple lore videos for things I found interesting. It has multiplayer but Coop with a friend is a little tedious. If you want to Coop its better to summon someone random since playing though with a friend means you need to play through the game twice. Invasions add an extra layer of difficulty and you also have the option to duel which is considered more competitive but isnt for everyone. I have  hours in game Take it slow. The tough enemies wont get stunlocked and flailing your sword will get you killed quickly and brutally. There isnt any rush. So many people get frustrated that the enemies dont care about their M spam. Also make sure to explore. Youll miss a lot of stuff if you never explore everything.Edit I replied before you edited so I added the extra questions.,darksouls3,dc5m60j,2,t5_2w3z3

10268590,0,t1_dc7zbkk,After the . patch you can now rely on a certain static armour poise based upon what armour you wear that stacks with the hyper armour and poise frames granted by your weapon thus allowing you to consecutively hyper armour through HR attacks from your opponent without staggering as long as you are within your active frames. Essentially for the sake of simplicity base poise now assists with hyper armour durability. However this system virtually only works when wielding heavier weapon classes as lighter weapons have zero hyper armourpoise frames. For example wearing almost full havels and optimising for a base poise above .  handing a greathammer you can comfortably infinitely hyper armour trade with any two handed R in the entire game as long as you time your attacks in active frames. Which means your opponent being less optimised with poise should stagger after the first or second blow whilst you will not allowing you to tank through their attacks. The key word here is infinitely you need less poise to tank through one attack but using this system you can face tank consecutively without needing to roll away or use a WA to reset poise as you will not stagger in response. The numerical breakdown increases depending on the attack variation as well so its easier to optimise for HR trading rather than everything else which is essentially the most used attacks in the game anyway. The only way to equip such heavy armour and main a heavy weapon without fat rolling is then to level up vitality and also use havelsRoF preferring the   variations. The poise breakpoint system is different numerically for each weapon class with great hammers being the easiest to optimise towards. Its a nifty new system giving new life to heavy builds and now making levelling vitality a viable option if this is the playstyle you want to lean towards. Edit youre probably thinking wait wouldnt my opponent deal enough poise damage to me eventually to make me stagger? Well if they are not optimised like you are they will never hit you enough times to do this and since smaller weapons deal less poise damage as well you will comfortably poise through them before any dangerous poise damage is caused to your tanksome self. ,darksouls3,dc801kq,1,t5_2w3z3

10299334,0,t1_dcb8n0n,I think upon further reflection that this is my main complaint with DS. I still dont think the early game areas are that great especially compared to early areas from the other games but it would be a lot more bearable if there were more good weapons to play it with. DS has a lot of weapons at the start but IMO most of them kind of suck. The difference between a  Raw Uchigatana and a  Raw Astora Straight Sword is insane and the Uchigatana is one of DSs better early weapons. If there were better choices early on or more to the point if the choices were better balanced early on I feel like DS would feel a lot more fun to play early on. I still dont think Id much care for the first few areas but if it was as fun to play a magepyro as in DS or as good to play an elemental build as DS I feel like DSs early game would have come together a lot more for me. And I think its a pity because I really like a lot of the later game content I just dont find it worthwhile to push through  hours of boredom to get to a few areasbosses I like especially when I could just boot up Bloodborne and play through an entire game I like. ,darksouls3,dcbhh8u,2,t5_2w3z3

Sure you could say that DS never stated that the flame rekindled itself. But the fact that it states that the choice does not matter means that whatever you do or do not do it will come back. You have to keep in mind that originally DS had only one ending. And whats stopping someone else from not kindling the fire in DS? Then it fades away. So how is it that the cycle keeps going then? And if that is not the case why doesnt BoC just sit down in front of the throne gets his or her weapons ready and wait to defend the throne forever?gt If the BoC doesnt link the fire someone else will thats the point. all humans are the bearers of the curse and they all want to find a way to release the curse ds tells you youre not special when gwyn linked the flame to humans he brought that curse upon them. aldia saysOnce the lord of light banished the dark and all that stemmed from humanity and men assumed a fleeting form when you sit down at the throne you link the fire.gt gt gt Continuing the research doesnt mean anything when their research served to produce absolutely no possible solutions to the problem during their time. They just tried random stuffs.gt In the dlc ending you do find a way to remove the curse but only for yourself. and even though they didnt find a way to remove the curse from all men their desire to release the curse without linking the flame is what Dks is all about. gt gt gt The five lords have never been a thing and thats the thing. Its new. It speaks volumes for the state of the current Flame.gt gt gt gt And who or what guides the Firekeepers? There needs to be some kind of power that enables them to bring back the previous lords. What allows them this power? I believe it to be the Flame.gt In ds the firekeepers dissapeared except the three old sisters in things betwixt and one missing fourth Milibeth saysThe old women are sisters. I am told there was a fourth.They have looked like that for as long as I have known them.Long ago Fire Keepers were commonplace.But now they are lost scattered to the winds. which could be our firekeeper in Dks but we find a firekeeper soul on the top of firelink on the bell and a room full of dead corpses with old firekeeper cloths.gt gt gt Nobody brings up the concept of amalgamation in DS? When the whole game is an amalgamation of all previous Souls games? And in any case that means its a surprise. Which worked for me. I was surprised by the final boss very much. And when I look back it makes sense.gt Honestly except a few items thrown in random places dragonriders bow with no magic damage anymore thrown in the smoulthering lake shield of want near the giant electric worm in the smouldering lake as well and some drang clothing in the cathedral and two soldiers in irtyhil theres no trace of dks events at all. nothing about the three crowns nothing about aldia and his research..gt gt gt The avatar is acting on instinct. It needs to test the one that has come to link the fire and it also needs to transfer its power to the new candidate.gt gt gt gt DSs levels were remnants of previous kingdoms? Hah. Im sorry. But no. Nope. Certainly not every area. Like what kingdom is Lost Bastille from? And the Gutter? And the Undead Crypt? What relics were there? Items with descriptions that all started or ended with this is something from old long forgotten kingdom? That had no details whatsoever?gt Lost bastile is a new place created by king vendrick to lock away those whos affected by the curse similar to irythil dungeon just with some failed experiments made by ocerios and other hollows. or its like aldias mansiongt gt gt A world full of history? What is that history may I ask?gt ....gt gt gt What was to be explored in DS mate? The things you mentioned Ive already shown how they were already done in the original. It only added the idea of cycles. It added a lot of random new stuff too. A lot of which didnt work out. Like the lore of the Giants. Or Ornstein. Or Nashandras whole story. Or the main four bosses in the first half.it added how the curse affects men it shows the individual struggle of humans with the curse lucatiel and the motivation that lead aldia to find a way to release it without linking the flame because he learnt that linking the flame in the first place is what caused the curse. ,darksouls3,dcgtmft,2,t5_2w3z3

I often use  weapons I like the most with one usually getting the upgrades first as I find the first large shardschunks.  When I finished Dark Souls  I had something obscene like  smalllarge shards and enough chunks to get  weapons high tier.Not to mention twinklingdemon titanite basically gives you another near max weapon and theres more than enough slabs to get your  maxed in one run.I suppose if you were truly terrible at dark souls  you might want to upgrade your armor but beyond that I dont see how you could run out of mats in  where armor was worthless or  where there was no armor upgrading.,darksouls3,dcke21o,2,t5_2w3z3

Every time the Fire needs to be linked a new Lord is chosen for that and if he refuses the old ones are resurrected as a backup and our character is like the second backup.     Therefore if a Lord be it Lorian or Lothric did link the fire before the game would need another new Lord to refuse the linking.

10395669,0,t3_5ovjjq,DISCLAIMER The following post is well documented and I am explaining how this is done to elucidate the readers here. I do not advocate malicious invasions using this glitch and I believe From should make this a function of the Mound Makers using the White Sign and not just a glitch.Ok when invading there is a glitch.  Wear a Covenant Mound Maker  Warrior of Sunlight Use Red Eye Orb When it says Invading another World use the Dark Sign When it says Invading another world as a Dark Spirit case Heal Aid and drink Estus If performed properly the Invasion will happen but due to Darksigning and input queing with the Spell the game will register you as a Host and instead use your Covenant thus allowing you to Invade as a Cooperative Mound Maker or as a Warrior of Sunlight.  Both will be able to enter your boss room. This means the Mound Make could even kill you in the boss room As a CoOp Phantom you could use the Black Crystal to send them away. This is a glitch that From is aware of but it is deeply ingrained in the code since it ties in with Pizza Tech and Tumblebuffing both of which are glitches as old as Demons Souls. It is not super common and most doing it seem to be benevolent having fun doing Forced Cooperation as Mound Makers and if the host dies they get a Shackle and if the Host wins they get an Ember.,darksouls3,dcmeywi,3,t5_2w3z3

Shes described explicitly as a rogue deity which pretty plainly states she didnt align with the other Gods.I do wonder what wording they used in the Japanese version but Ive always taken rogue to mean that shes a bit of a maverick not that shes their enemy.gtIt would still be the first time that I know of in DS where the game directly lied about the label of something And Scholar of the First Sin is literally the official name on the package. In every game sins are present and ALWAYS dealt with by Velka andor her follower.You inderestimate how little mankind cares about the Gods in DkS. Its not a lie humans just decided theyd define sin differently now that theyre in charge.gtHer Crow People guard the occult weapon ember in the Painted World along with a spell of hers.Shes responsible for dealing with sinners. The Painted World is used to imprison artifacts and beings that could be used against the Gods and thus would be deemed sinful. The answer is pretty plain Velka was in charge of the Painted World at the time. Her crow people if they are hers which is doubtful given that Miyazaki only ever said they were originally supposed to be her servants and then never implemented that lore into the game are guarding them to stop people stealing them.gtStatues that appear to be Velka are in the Painted World also and also show up outside the Four Kings in New Londo.For a start they might not be of her. They could well be Caitha judging by the tear marks and fact that she matches the title of mother of the Forlorn perfectly. And even if they are her well New Londo wasnt always associated with the Abyss. It was once just a place where humans lived. Velka was worshipped in Carim and we can assume New Londo had a high Carim population because theres lots of Carim items there. I doubt the Darkwraiths built those statues after the fall of New Londo.Personally I see Velka as partBatman partprison warden. She worked alongside the Darkmoons to hunt down sinners but she wasnt one of them hence rogue. But the Painted World was under her jurisdiction so its likely she was the one who threw sinful objects in there.,darksouls3,dcxx3ut,1,t5_2w3z3

10498189,0,t1_dcy1wce,Yup i guess you are right on the RPG side. We could say that RPG definition is become a personal matter. I too at first thought of a game to be RPG by simply have experience and progress and char creation. XD But then i changed my thought on the RPG. Now to me a RPG requires a lot of stuffs. Like the choices during the multiple stories building relationships with other characters deep developing of your char which dark souls has and a lot of other stuffs.I understand what you are saying about cooldown. Basically a cooldown could become easily a way to force people into using other spells just because those that he likes have huge cooldowns.

Both require patience and time to play especially if you are new but if you can find Bloodborne with its DLCs included at a discounted price since its an older game it will be more cost affective.

10511208,0,t1_dczjfs0,gtWhich the first three words tell you right off the bat that it was an Iron Shield that was melted. It formed part of the Dragonslayer Armour as in it was its matching set not that it was literally a piece of the armor that fell off. The Dragonslayer Armour is thicker than Ornsteins original set that much falling off and being melted down and being used a shield that thick with armor still that thick doesnt add up unless youre saying they also without an item description added material to the suit of armor all while absolutely no one was wearing it for a reason you havent specified just yet.Wrong it is stating that the armor was melted down to form the shield.  Same deal for the axe.  Also if it once formed part of the DSA why does it still form it based on your logic that its talking about the set?The description clearly indicates that the shield and the axe were formed from misshaping bits of the armor they melted hence why the whole set looks beat to hell and droopy.gtThose are two weapons used by two Dragonslayers.  That doesnt mean every Dragonslayer used crossbased weaponry especially since we know Ornstein faithfully served NK likely inspiring his weapon design.gtNowhere in the Japanese text which is still very different from its English text mind you does it mention Gwyn anywhere.Nowhere in any English text does it call Nameless King Gwyns first knight but there is text that says Ornstein is the Suns eldest borns first knight like in the text youre quoting.Im going to supply you with this description again so you can read itThis is the tale of the Suns firstborn his faithful first knight and the brave dragonslayer who served them both.Sun  Gwyn.They establish the Firstborn as Gwyns.Then they make a descriptive statement that the Firstborn was his faithful first knight.Then they make mention of the Dragonslayer which is Ornstein. Reread it as many times as you like until you are able to look past your own stubbornness and acknowledge that this is the interpretation that makes the most sense. gtYes this is the first time weve seen this guy. though I understand that youre interpreting it as hes a melted yet somehow thicker and bigger set for Ornstein despite Ornsteins set being in mint condition spear and all in Archdragon Peak  so we can just agree to disagree if youd like.No its not.  Considering that the armor was Ornsteins after eons of being melted and crafted with.  Golden piece name associated with Dragonslayer Ornstein from the age of gods and imbued with the strength of lightning.Oops.  Imitations of armor sets are all around Dark Souls lore including Havel as youve already established.By the way Havel has never demonstrated or has been suggested to wield lightning as if he were its master.

Why is Logan forgotten in one but a fucking rockstar in the other?Dark souls  containing no referrences to Logan doesnt somehow mean it was deliberate the item descripitions for all the crystal spells have absolutely no referrence to him and contain descriptions of what crystal magic is mechanically rather than where it came from  im willing to put that down to the B team being lazy rather than them attempting to do some deep commentary on him fading from memory.Perhaps Dark souls s lore is the culprit here because it gracefully forgets about Logan?If you want my noncritical opinion its simply because Drangelic is home to undead losing their memories while the same clearly isnt the case in Lothric.If you still want to dispute me take a look at the amount of crystal spells present in Drangleic  theres only  and lets take a look at Allone  hes a foreign swordsman that Drangleic knew very little about and was a mystery so why cant the extreme be said for Logans sorceries?The problem you claim  has with Logan is a problem that stemmed from Dark souls  casually forgetting about where the crystal magic came from.,darksouls3,dczxrj1,2,t5_2w3z3

10560486,0,t1_dd547fi,The problem isnt dying to phantoms thats an established risk of invasion and mechanic the problem is that hosts can have an infinite supply of phantoms which they can just wear down invaders with.Its a broken mechanic you can face an effectively infinite supply of enemies as an invader if the summons are capable of keeping you busy long enough for the host to keep summoning theres nothing to stop this happening. This is the main complaint I have for invasions sure joining into a v fingered world where all four are just stood by the bonfire waiting for you is frustrating but theres nothing that stops them from doing that by mechanics the problem comes when they start to pull summons out like rabbits out of a hat every time a summon falls.The game already stacks the deck against invaders when it favours worlds with multiple summoned phantoms so invaders will more frequently invade into worlds where they are facing up to v odds over v fights alongside the embered bonus the host likely has and the double estus supply the Host already has a clear and measurable advantage over Invaders being able to summon a constant stream of Phantoms completely breaks the balance of invasions.,darksouls3,dd55f8m,1,t5_2w3z3

10581680,0,t3_5rhykl,Ive done something like this with prior souls games.  I rolled a lot of characters to play as archetypes and the stats would follow that theme.Ergo a Mage wouldnt be putting any points in STRDEX outside starting stats which severely restricts their equip options similar to something like DnD. Ultimately its the equip stats that wind up impacting these sorts of games the most so I was willing to give wiggle room on some points e.g.  A cleric starting with a mace they could only H Id be willing to allot one str for the cleric to onehand the weapon.The clericmage are the most obvious types and they lend themselves well to it because they start with natural stat penalties that prevent them from equipping a wide range of gear because of Dex or Str mostly.The problem with some roles in  is that newer restrictions hamstring some wouldbe roles.  The cap on arrows carried makes it hard to make a bowonly character ranger because youll lack the arrows to clear an area and kill a boss.  Similarly the amount of FPAsh you start with is unlikely to be able to carry you far as a caster early on and the Cleric will lack combat spells for awhile.I like the idea of a interdependent party as well but the weak point is the healer.  Its hard to coordinate a party to gather up for heals and the cleric requires the party to be near to effectively heal.  Even as early as VordtDancer in the first area youll find fasterratic movement in bosses that given you little opportunity to support your group.It would work better in the actual levels but even then the nature of a lot of the miracles seems to fall along support in between fights rather than during.  This could make it a bit dull for the support character.,darksouls3,dd7f2xj,3,t5_2w3z3

10611874,0,t1_dda6urm,There is a difference between a player mechanic that rewards skill based button inputs such as Toggle Escaping. And just preventing the player from taking more than  hits at once.Toggle Escapes increased the depth of the game since it was a mechanic you had to learn therefore put a little effort into. Its not even particularly difficult once you learn the timing just press the dpad as youre taking a hit. There were tons of uses and playarounds for it if you made a mistake on the first toggle escape you could try again on the second and third and fourth hit until you got out.Sometimes you could toggle the first hit and parry your opponents second swing. The next time you get hit your opponent only swings once inorder to beat your toggle and while youre attempting to parry runs around and backstabs you.Then again your opponent goes back in and hits you and swings twice because you failed your toggle the first time. Then when you toggle the second hit your opponent runs around for a backstab but you double back and backstab him.I could go on and on and on about all the different engagements Dark Souls  allowed players to encounter just from toggle escaping alone. Dark Souls  every single combat engagement is Hit Hit backoff. Hit Hit Backoff. Or Hit Hit Get Aggressive in their face. There is no thinking involved. Its just This happened now I do this. Thats why this game is hemorrhaging players and everyone is saying the PVP is dead. Theres only so much you can get out of the barebones combat.,darksouls3,ddaj8br,1,t5_2w3z3

Use the resources cuz duels invasions and pve are three completely different games. ,darksouls3,ddfd1nm,5,t5_2w3z3

10673016,0,t1_ddgtl3c,I intentionally let the NPC survive and used a weaker weapon last time I went up against it. Fighting against him and the wolf at the same time is... well... its fun but also pretty janky. Its definitely not the cleanest multiboss setup. The biggest problem is when the wolf starts darting around like crazy theres simply no way to keep track of both it and the NPC who can decide to fire a Soul Arrow at any time. So youre basically just hoping for RNG when that happens. Since your timings need to be precise to dodge the wolfs charge you can also end up in a situation with unavoidable damage if the npc fires his spell at the wrong time. Thats not good. Otherwise it does make the fight a lot more fun to have two targets to keep track of and if the execution was cleaner it might be even higher on my list. But I think the problem is that the NPC dies too easily and then the wolf isnt that hard. They should have made it so that at the start of phase  he dashes away from youthe wolf jumps in and protects him and then he heals to full so you actually need to fight both at once to win.,darksouls3,ddgua12,2,t5_2w3z3

When you dual wield a Hollowed Twinblade you bumb up to  luck assuming youre Hollowed of course and the blades are fully upgraded. Thats very basic and by messing around with starting characters and stats you can add magic but usually you just want to hit stuff.Other meta builds include the standard Quality build plus your weapon of choice Poise monsters and bleed builds with the OK. There are also meta weapons like the Washing Pole and Carthus Curved Sword that work with the Quality build.

Theres no story to speak of too many gathering quests and is generally easier than the others in the series overall barring event hunts and certain endgame things. Runs at  fps quite playable but you can tell the difference between  and .U was the game before. No styles or arts. Probably the most polished game in the series so far with good pacing in quest progression. Runs at  fps on Nds. You may have slowdown on certain thingsfull party with an old one. Has LR HR G and GSpecial ranks. Still plenty of people playing online. More story than any of the others still not saying too much but at least its there. The thing with LR HR G and so on is essentially tiers of a sort. You start in LR low rank and both you and monsters arent too strong just getting going. Reaching HR high rank amps up the damage your own weapons and armor capabilities enemy AI and more difficult quest conditions. Reaching Grank does all that again even more noticeably. G quests are tough and you have to play well to make it through. GSpecial is the endgame stuff in U and is where you can be twothreeshot by most of the monsters and are at risk of instant death if playing a gunner.Any further questions or info wanted feel free to ask gt,darksouls3,ddprgxz,2,t5_2w3z3

I usually have no dramas buffing either but occasionally I do deal with some rushdown which is easy to counter anyway  the issue lies with people that think they are somehow entitled to buff without interruption in an arena designed to encourage aggressive play from the get go timer. Adaptability is key and reacting and predicting are tactics that assist in dealing with this sort of play I take issue with people that just get salty and profess their superiority over players that clearly beat them  if its such a scrubby tactic then it should be easy to deal with for an experienced player.

10804119,0,t1_dducfgd,Ya mean the magic gate we have to go through because of a pile of ruble on the street half the height of one of the giants? Theyve got boulder slabs as weapons if they can smash up the fort they can turn that ruble into powderized gravel. And the gate to Aldia may be magical but at the same time couldnt they just go through the wall next to the gate?And in terms of all the fighting happening there that is true but we see that their only siege weaponry is boats at sea they dont seem to have anything on land. And in all honesty at this point Im kinda wondering if Drummond meant just simply that both his father and grandfather diedfought the giants in the war I mean itd be kinda weird that we see no other evidence of the conflict with the giants across Drangleic if the war have gone on for three whole generations thatd just not be consistent story.Also a note on Yhorm and the profaned flame if it is the Giant Lord he is indeed descended from and the Profaned Capital is in fact on the land where Drangleic is located.. Well the war happened long long ago when we get there in DS so either the profaned flame already happened before we got there and we just missed the thing since its still on the On setting or afterwards after we were there but no one is there at all there is no people to subjugate they all left. Only real alternative to keep up that theory is we only see like  of Drangleic or something or that the populace were enslaved by the giants which I just doubt since they seem to be there to sack the place more than anything and Melentia says herself that everybodys run off.,darksouls3,ddudaf3,1,t5_2w3z3

I guess an epic sendoff wouldnt be right in the context of these games but in hoping we can get a definitive ending which isnt cyclical  kind of like how in Bloodborne becoming a great one allows mankind to ascend and breaks the cycle of the hunters dream. ,darksouls3,ddv3zbg,5,t5_2w3z3

10824936,0,t3_5usf3a,Thats the way its supposed to be kind of. Theyre all a little desperate these days because invaders are so starved for prey.Back in the first game one of the signs you were growing up was when you stopped playing the entire game hollow and took on the threat of invaders stopping your progression. Even just one had the potential of stopping you even if you won the invasion  just because youd have run out of estus and had to turn back for more.Now there are bonfires as far as the eye can see and invaders coming upon lone hosts is rare. The players who used to be a significant threat to progressing through the game are a joke subject to hours of ganking and disrespect beyond what they already got for being ruthless killers. So theyre a little desperate. Theyre more willing to work with their fellow reds who they know go through the same pain than in the old days where they would have fought each other before the host or else had a bloody freeforall.Theyre not salty because theyre losing. Many of the old invaders were good enough at the game that they could easily rack up wins dueling. Theyre salty because the system doesnt work anymore. They were meant to be the ultimate PvE enemy but now theyve been reduced to something the worst players in the game farm for souls.That was perhaps the thing I appreciated most about Return to Lordran that when I first made it to the Depths I got chased around by a twinkedout axe murderer and died like a scrub. One of the greatest challenges I ever faced in Souls was the first time I got to Anor Londo and was invaded by a dragonbro whod hacked his White Dragon Breath to cause curse just like Seaths. I had to fight my way through the gate back down to Sens and up to the Parish at half health.Again its not a matter of losing for the invaders. Its a matter of losing to cowards who would go hollow on their first death.,darksouls3,ddwikyo,10,t5_2w3z3

10947409,0,t3_5w9zau,I think there should have been a bit more of a clarification of some sorts. In my opinion RP accounts should be allowed to RP or act normally like every other user and post whatever they like on their RP account. They shouldnt be downvoted for not acting like the said character if they are just commenting to help others or to just socialise. There are many communities where a person with an account named after X character doesnt really act like how the character itself is portrayed.They RPers should also respect others andA Do NOT flood threads and steal spotlight from others ruining good discussions just because they want to RP. If they want to just randomly RP they should make their OWN thread.B If they are going to roleplay a character roleplay it well not horrible and cringy roleplay. I dont want to see someone roleplaying Gwyn and ask for pizza rolls. Please.C This goes hand in hand with point A but deserves its own spot because its the most important of all. When the Ringed City dlc launches do NOT flood threads where important loremeta discussion happens. Just like you want regular players to respect your RP you should also respect us and not mix us with your RP on every situation imaginable. Imagine if in real life you were to go out in the park and try to roleplay loudly something dragging others into it most people would feel uncomfortable and you know that it isnt proper manners to do so in real life so no need to do it in a forum either just because you are behind a screen.Phew what a long sentence that last one was.

10950149,0,t3_5wdbkk,gt we find a lot of armour sets belonging to the Old Knights of HeideI personally disagree that they were knights of Heide. They dont seem to fit their aesthetic and I consequently always had them pegged for invaders or scavengers in Heide and its surrounding areas. The alternative Id provide is that theyre actually knights of Venn. Brume Tower iirc had been wrested from Venn by OIK with the help of Alonne and Id always thought the Old Knights there were supposed to indicate a connection to Venn rather than Heide with OIK stringing them up ironically as mantle pieces in his own renovation of the tower. That said I do think Heide was very much caught up in the whole Alken and Venn conflict  I even wrote a post on gameFAQs years ago theorizing that Heide may indeed have been a part of Venn. But thats a different topic. At any rate I like the theory. There are certainly much less coherent ones out there.

Minus the ones that got removed from the SoC and brought back to life.And we return them to their thrones to burn once again as cinder and yet they arent taken back into SoC.gtIn his own world. AKA not the Chosen Undeads world. In the world we play through we are the second person to ever link the Fire. straight up says that the cycle of the age of fire exists and that  implies that there where numerous chosen undead. So why would SoC not use those souls as a last line of defence? Besides originally it was only the undead who could burn as cinder due to humanity and we can see in Yhorm that is no longer the case so things obviously changed down the line and what happened afer this change of ritual sacrafice would no longer become a part of the SoC. gtThe cycle literally just means people make the same mistakes over and over. Flame fades someone links it Flame fades again. Kingdom rises and falls someone builds a new one. The cycles have nothing to do with time is convoluted thats a whole other part of the lore.Yes and the chosen undeads where all a part of that cycle as well as the cycle of rebirth of the lord souls Dark souls s whole point is that we merely act as fuel for the flame so another foolish chosen undead can be lead by a toothy serpent to yet again link the flame.Dark souls  is a game where the world and its rules are changing  a new age is peaking around the corner known as the age of the deep sea and new concepts exist in the world such as angels and the deep stagnant dregs of humanity so whats to say that SoC isnt a result of this shift in the world?,darksouls3,ded7l3p,1,t5_2w3z3
10986038,0,t3_5wsxeq,Thats quite the observation about the Chime of Want having that hooded figure sitting atop it. Interesting. Im still open to the possibility that the Children of Dark somehow originated in Anor LondoLordran but if so the question is how? Did they reform right where Manus had died and then were raised in Anor LondoIrithyll until they themselves decided to head off to Drangleic to seek the kings? This could maybe explain Nashandra having a portrait there and maybe the picture of Eleum Loyce if we assume Alsanna like sent a picture of her new home back to her old home or something but then it begs the question of why a picture of the Iron Throne is there. Nadalia gave up her body and just kind of haunted Brume Tower so I feel like she wouldnt be sending postcards back home like that. I agree with you on both of your points.

Miyazaki described the gaping dragon as a being twisted by the effect of learning how to want or something like that. So basically dragons became mortal and desirous when the first flame came. The first flame gave everything will and mortality  even the dragons. So though dragons and dragonkin are the most resistant to fire fire is still in them. Only the stone dragon down in Ash Lake seems to have somehow avoided the effect of fire. Anyway I have an old theory that ties dragons to water and since I consider water and soul connected that could help explain why the serpent magic has soul damage.,darksouls3,dee65aj,1,t5_2w3z3

11061154,0,t3_5xxp6g,Controller  Start as a knight warrior or mercenary. They are the three best classes for beginners imo. Knight is probably the very best w good endurance armor and a solid shield. As for tips Expect to die. Methodically clear areas dont become frustrated and sprint through unless youre going to a boss because a youll miss lots of important items NPCs and shortcuts b Youll lose out on the overall experience and c youll die anyway when you run to a dead end because you dont know the map and the conga line of motherfuckers behind you catch up.  Level vit and end early. Unless youre playing a caster no excuse not to. Use a raw gem which are easily acquired in the early game to boost weapon damage to compensate. Once you can withstand a few blocks and have enough health not to be instakilled then focus on other stats I always neglect health and late game it means most enemies are lethal. Two hits and I drop or one supercharged attack. Remember your soft and hard caps. These are points where either you gain no benefit from leveling the stat or such a diminished benefit it isnt worth it. Keep an eye on how your numbers tick up. Most standard stats should be around  the only exceptions are intelligence and caster stuff as far as I know.  Manage that stamina learn those weapons. If you run out of stamina youll have a second delay on the next input which usually means tanking a shot if not outright dying. If youre going to use a weapon give it a few practice swings learn its moveset and learn how many times you can hit before your stamina depletes.  Mix up evading and blocking. Blocking is a good idea for some super quick or unpredictable attacks. Rolling is a good idea for obvious or easily telegraphed attacks. It takes more stamina to block than to roll so use every opportunity to roll you can. This again is stamina management be aware of how much you have and the best course of action  especially as holding your shield up slows regen rate. A little trick if youre uncertain about a boss or enemy is shield up roll shield up shield down unless it attacks. If you time the roll right this usually allows you to learn any follow ups or further dramas from the attack and can often stop you getting caught by a sweeping attack which covers more distance than youd expect.  Get a bow. If youre on safe ground draw enemies to you with arrows. Dont risk rushing into the unknown especially if theyre clustered in a group.  Nothing is free. If an item is invitingly in the open on a cliff edge chances are theres an enemy to push you off. If theres one at the end of the alley check the walls for enemies waiting to drop down. Be aware of your surroundings at all times and any possible ambush points.  Fashion is key. Armor resistances especially in  dont make enough difference to really worry about all that much. Dress badass youll play badass. After all its as much about fun as anything else.  Play blind. No guides no wiki no nothing. Much more rewarding.  Let it click. To start with youll die all over the place and feel like quitting unless you happen to be an excellent gamer  push through. Take a break if need be. Some bosses in Soulsborne have caused me to take a days rest because I was struggling and rather than get wound up and play poorly anger will just get you killed I had time out to think about what I could do. Usually this resulted in killing the boss less than an hour after starting back up and mostly within six tries. Once youre in youll see why Souls has such a mad fanbase,darksouls3,delricm,2,t5_2w3z3

11093479,0,t1_depeyfw,Rolling confers up to  Iframe coverage. Nothing can effectively punish those values.  You seem to have fallen into a pitfall yourself do remember that  while the bosses in DSII are less aggressive you tend to fight several at once mistiming an roll has harsher penalties and they have greater overall bulk. The healing items are a moot point because DSIII places bonfires right next to tough bosses whereas DSII typically puts bonfires much further away. Theres also the matter of unlimited healing being a moot point because in a lot of the tougher fights its not worth the risk when youre just gonna get OHKOHKOd anyway.Regardless im wary of any argument supporting the notion that DSIII even remotely cares about balance while stuff like Hidden Body allows you to effortlessly cheese literally every aspect of it sans the boss fights and even without it most enemies arent super aggressive and the ones that are  are either found alone in limited numbers or can be pulled independently with very little effort  if not outright avoided.I hope thats enough context for you.,darksouls3,depfp8h,10,t5_2w3z3

I disagree with the idea that Dragons didnt have Souls I believe that when the First Flame appeared and brought Souls with it Dragons gained Souls and became mortal. Their stone scales helped them retain a degree of immortality but these were easily removed so they could be killed. I believe the reason the Drakes are so weak is because they are descended from Dragons who had Souls and as such have Souls themselves making them crushingly mortal.The Everlastimg Dragon of Ash Lake is said to be a descendant of the Everlasting Dragons. This means it really shouldnt be immortal but it is. How? Because were giving it scales of immortality.

Or they started at their churning homes came to Lothric here for some reason then returned back to their churning homes.The second scenario seems a little silly to me.

11182230,0,t3_5zmzuq,Truth be told I see absolutely no singular reason for From to develop entirely new maps solely for the sake of arena matchmaking. Dark Souls has always attempted to be entirely selfcontained it certainly makes more sense for the available arenas to be optimised models of existing ingame areas instead of some random ass environment pulled from nowhere. Unless of course said new arena map came with its own lore and history and reason for existing but personally Id rather they dedicate that level of effort and creation to main game DLC content. The arena is tacked on the side purely to appeal to PvP players who want an organised method of matchmaking and these new maps do exactly that whether theyre reused assets or not. I dont know I guess I just dont really find it that big a deal I guess I mean its better than nothing in my eyes. Im not a big user of Undead Match though I prefer invasions so naturally my tastes are more inclined to favour the DLC over arena maps content wise.

11186408,0,t3_5zph5c,Ok so one of the biggest mistakes new players tend to do is not learn. Do you know what the definition of Madness is? Its repeating the same thing over and over expecting a different result.Youre reaction when you die needs to be why did I die not oh shit I died. Dodged too late? Too early? Ran out of stamina? Attacked when you shouldnt have? If you never learn you may as well start your mound in Lothric since youve already gone mad!Usually you want VIG and END not Strength. This early on staying alive with stamina and health is more important since infusions like RAW will carry you through the early game. Out of interest youre definitely wearing an armor item in each slot and are below  equip load. Make sure to have an item in each slot and keep your equip load below .As for the run back you really shouldnt be taking any damage at all. Is there any reason you want to fight stuff? You can easily just run by. Killing the Knights and Co on your way back only serves to satisfy your insatiable bloodlust. Just run past them or use the drop down in the little area next to the Crossbow dude and the sleeping solider Generic tips for Vordt hug that booty. Usually staying underneath him means a lot of his attacks wont hit and he needs to reposition. Just keep an eye on him and youll be safe. He attacks slow but decently hard.

Or reduce chaos storm to  Att slot rather than buff it?Not that those ideas are bad but to get variety we need to buff the other schools.Making lighting defence scale with faith rather than endurance would indirectly buff offensive miracles not many quality builds running around with high faith but endurance...? Slightly increasing casting time would be nice. I understand its suppose to be a trading class but a pyro can see you preparing to throw a bolt go get a coffee come back throw a vestige at you and roll away before your bolt hits. So make it possible to trade  similar to a quality build using a quick weapon they can hit and roll retaliation free.Never done a sorcery build so i shall bow to your experience on those points. i dont think Ive ever fought a sorcery past sl where their entire aim is to try one shot you with a soul spear. ,darksouls3,df1r87k,2,t5_2w3z3

But after we meet a certain person in the DLC lore hunters delved into the original Japanese and found that the original wording makes no reference to gender.

Theres also the dragon greatsword which was our equivalent of the fume sword only it had a R that shot a wave towards people.Poise was a big part of it to. If I was to fight three pigmies at once I would position my self to take a hit from one of them and get all three in one hit. In DkS  that one hit would stun me and I take all three hits back roll twice kill one at a time and heal.

11265594,0,t1_df8wbv3,gt Theres no indication Sulyvahn ever tried to build a legacy for other people besides himself which immediately makes him a douchier figure than Gwyn.I still think genocide is worse and by the looks of the Ringed City he may have significantly shorthanded the pygmies as well. The prolonging of the age of fire and hishis familys handling of the undead issue is another thing which although debatable doesnt paint him in a wonderful light. Pitiable may have been the wrong choice of word but the case I wanted to present wasnt necessarily that Sulyvahn is a more nobleethical figure than Gwyn but just that theyre comparable Gwyn is Sulyvahn . I think. Theyre ambition driven dudes who did some pretty terrible shit in an attempt to end an age and usurp power. I do think Sulyvahns actions have a lot to do with having been born in the Painted World. His home is quite literally a resting place for unwelcome forlorn beings that was created at least initially to house everything and everyone the gods deemed heretical or an affront to their power. Theres a good deal of irony in the fact that the ultimate downfall of Anor Londo and the royal family was at the hands of a guy born in their heretical stash spot imho and that makes him more identifiable at least thematically than Gwyn.,darksouls3,df8xsyf,2,t5_2w3z3

11276947,0,t3_60wuwq,All my kooky predictions  remaining lore theories Gwyndolin and Velka are synonymous  two faces of the same deity may be related to Ring of Reversal.  The First Sin wasnt Gwyn linking humanity to the First Flame it was the Witch of Izalith attempting to recreate said or the act of the Witch of Izalith giving the control of fire to man.  Velkdolyns definition of said as sin was directly related to the conflict between Gwyns knights and the Chaos Demons. The First Flame was originally started by a Dragon. Dragons are dicks. Their reasons for doing so are unclear but possibly this is how they reproduce or rear their young  Hawkwoods reference to there being only one True Dragon in each age being the precedent. The only true Ancient  Everlasting dragon weve seen is the one visible from the final overlook at Archdragon Peak all the rest have been descendents or false recreations.  The forces of soul magic miracles dark magic and pyromancy are all intrinsically related and derived from the same basic source.  The universes of Demons Souls Dark Souls and Bloodborne are all loosely connected. Possibly the Dragons are a form of Great One or the enemies in Bloodborne are less literally borne from distant galaxies but simply exist outside of the boundaries of time and space that encompass Yharnam similarly to how Drangleic and eventually Lothric became removed  distorted from other lands.  The Curse of the Undead was deliberately fabricated  created by the Way of White and was spread by its adherents. The Darksign is not a natural phenomenon but a curse deliberately manufactured and inflicted as a weapon.  And finally possibly the dumbest one but one I still like because its so ridiculous Dusk went fullon lunatic and is behind everything you see in Lothric. I mean come on. When you fight the Soul of Cinder look at the Darksign Eclipse. Its sprouted little wings off to each side that look almost identical to the Dusk Crown. Seriously.

11316815,1,t1_dfeq3dr,I like how you conveniently quote only the part that suits you best. I said in terms of GAMEPLAY and DIFFICULTY. Lady Maria is much cooler in lore but both of the bosses had similar mechanics. You want me to go further into this? The old gravetender had a unique moveset so did Lady Maria. Her cooler moves are of course superior to Old gravetenders but thats why there is a wolf with a badass charge attack and a frost breath as well as tons of aggressiveness. Lady Maria isnt a completely new asset she is the doll in a different outfit and unique animations the old gravetender also uses same model as playable character but has different armor however horrible and a unique weapon that gives him unique animations. The Wolf might be similar to Sif in appearance but its far more vicious and a lot more badass than a doggy using a giant sword to fight Honestly Sif looks stupid with that sword in its mouth its as if its playing fetch. Now on difficulty both were one shots both were easy.So there you have it thats why Lady Maria is on par with Gravetender mechanics and difficulty wise. But sure keep fanboying over the doll and like Gehrman says you can even user her if it pleases you P Ludwig and Orphan of Kos were the only bosses that were worthy enough to be matched to the likes of Friede Fume Knight Sihn Ivory King Artorias Sir Alonne Manus Kalameet. Lady Maria Lawrence and Living Failures were more like Chimera Aava Elana Old Gravetender.  ,darksouls3,dfeqqrn,2,t5_2w3z3

11328077,0,t3_61n0ne,Im pretty sure that the Deep and the Abyss are distinct. The Deep is the land below. I expect that some of areas well be exploring in the upcoming DLC are part of the Deep. Its a name for the space that separates the rest of the world from the Ringed City which is likely to be the city of the pygmies i.e. the first humans and the resting place of the Dark Soul.The Abyss is the allconsuming void. It is a formless manifestation of wantdesire. The antithesis of the First Flame it is the Disparity born from the Flames creation. In the strictest sense it is not a place or an entity. It exists it hungers and it destroys.I would assume that the Age of Deep Seas is actually different from the Age of Dark. Mostly because Aldrich already knows about the Age of Dark everyone does in that universe and there wouldnt be a reason to create a new name for the same thing. As for what the Age of the Deep Sea looks like go to the Cathedral of the Deep or Aldrichs throne room and youll have a pretty good idea.

If you want a kinda Super hero build  int and  faith will give access toForceEmit forceChameleonHidden bodyHidden weaponDecoy The spell that removes fall damage and silences footstepsAnd blessed weaponwhich is in my opinion the best weapon buff it gives a . percentage physical damage boost. Put everything else where you want it would probably fit strength well because of the fact that is has blessed weapon and that kinda sucks for dex weapons.

11339503,0,t3_61u605,The issue isnt pressing r players who know to use the two hit system to their advantage are perfectly legit especially my personal fav the rrr as are players who game an aggressive enemy knowing they wont retreat its those who dont have a clue and are frustrating especially as a phantom. As an invader its not such an issue as theyll run their stamina down or be piss easy to parry  either result means they get hit. Its still irritating because its the equivalent of CoD campers  especially as they usually use the Dark Sword or some weapon with range and roll catch potential so no matter how advanced you play theyll usually get a spam or two off. Having to kite around the large hitboxes of a swinging lunatic to get one hit in and repeat the process makes a simple duel a ten minute escapade especially as they usually heal andor run away. As a phantom its annoying as fuck. Have them die because they tried to r spam a basically infinite poise silver knight? Annoying. Have the boss kill them because they got overexcited and exhausted their stamina? Annoying. Having the host get ganked by the AI because they rushed one enemy and r spammed it without using their brain? Annoying. Always results in a dead host. ,darksouls3,dfhb9xw,3,t5_2w3z3

11343555,0,t3_61w5xc,Its more or less exactly like respecing in DS if youve played that.The reallocation page displays your class base stats with your current stats in red as reference. If you pump them back up to what they were the number turns white indicating the stat is back at what it was. You can raise and lower them as you pump up or decrease the levels and the game wont accept the changes until youve reallocated all levels so there is no risk of not redistributing all of your points before hitting ok.If youre curious about the interface you can choose to reallocate to check it out and then if you dont want to change anything you can cancel the reallocation I think if its anything like character customization you can cancel out and not spend a Pale Tongue.,darksouls3,dfhrt3t,2,t5_2w3z3

11344631,0,t1_dfhla8n,Firstly I dont know why red eye is being focused. Hes not the only one making the rules and enforcing bans. If you have a problem direct it at the mods in general instead of calling him out. Secondly I couldnt disagree more with your idea. The right to free speech should not trump the right to be respected. Just because you can talk shit doesnt mean you should. While everyone has freedom of speech they also have freedom to decide for themselves to be nice to someone. Even if you are justified to call someone an idiot you actually have the capability to simply let it go and move on and let the mods handle it. This rule is there to encourage this sort of civil mentality that tries to reduce the amount of petty fights. You say downvote and move on as if the damage is controlled that easily. What is much more likely to happen is for the attacked user to retaliate resulting in a heated shittalk that derails discussion and not contribute anything while the very act of not moderating this stuff implicitly says you can be a cunt here. The mod teams stance clearly says you cannot be a cunt here but that does not hinder anyone from discussion. All it hinders is personal attacks that have nothing to do with dark souls. And if people cant help but resort to personal attacks then they may as well be children and be moderated as such. ,darksouls3,dfhw6yo,6,t5_2w3z3

11396299,0,t1_d9aicbq,I definitely think Velka and Gwyn was a thing. If she was indeed angry at the war with the dragons it makes sense that her painting keeps a few safe as they rot.Gwyn is the patriarch of the world of light a world that since its inception has been about war fighting dragons giants eachother etc. Velka is the matriarch of the world of darkness. Instead of a horrid world of fighting it is a dark cold gentle place. The painted world is as much of a world as Gwyns it seems it is the boundaries of the Gods domain.I also think that this marriage of light and dark Gwyn and Velka and the dynamic of thier was being hinted at throughout DS with Nashandra and the other dark queens who were all fucking with their kings.The kings may be powerful and may have control of the light but the queens were always the ones with the upper hand or the last laugh.Elana is a symbol that the dark queens dont mind dragons as she sings Sinh.

11397316,0,t1_dfnuv2o,Precisely my thoughts. I come from games like destiny where ive seen everything nerfed to the ground consecutive times rip hand cannons you will be missed. I dont want this game to end up like that where only  weapons seem viable and everyone has a shotgun. Hence why I often post potential balance ideas like this where I give a set of possible changes and see what people like. It also helps to have a second viewpoint especially if that viewpoint is of a person who likes the weapon idea. As someone who typically shies away from meta gear I attempt to give new ideas that come from someone who is neither a massive supporter of the current weapon  nor a player who gets super salty. Most of my comments calling these cancer blades exist as a joke of sorts. Sometimes I feel like they are overused  a lot of the time but I also feel like if something works a player will stick with it.,darksouls3,dfnvcty,-1,t5_2w3z3

11402045,0,t3_62pvy0,Im on PC so I can only give you some tips. After every attack of his he always lays his head low damaging the head does twice as much damage than any other part. If you have a high fire resistance shield you can block a fire hit and tank it like its nothing since most of his fire moves just hit once. The first move he always does is easily avoidable try learning that one first hell walk through your way and then turn around. Try not to get stuck behind him he tends to do his tail slash a lot if you are behind him and it is really hard to telegraph. The fire breath that he seems to do directly onto the floor will travel to his right so just run straight to your right facing him whenever he does that or if it is too late shield up and you should take only one hit if you are not in the travel path of the fire. His Shin Godzilla ray is the easiest to punish with this guy run straight to him and whack him in the head a couple times he only attacks far with that and the initial fire only goes straight so you can run to him from a side and punish him a lot. As for phase  it seems he doesnt get any new moves aside from his dark explosion he just becomes a little more aggressive but still using the same moves and doing the same damage so stay calm in that. For his dark explosion just run as far as you can and it wont hit you he tends to do either his double hand slash or his moving stomping fire breathing move after that so just watch out for those. ,darksouls3,dfoeomg,2,t5_2w3z3

Theres very few.But Ludwig has this hit beginning a few seconds in through the song and its not only a catchy as fuck theme but its also memorable.Soul of Cinder is much the same if only because of the second phase having references to Gwyns theme.Most other boss themes just melt together.

Londornew londoThey made darkwraiths because they dug too deeply and discovered darkabyss stuff I believe this refers to the ruins of oolacile.  You see that the darkwraiths are nearly identical to the new enemy we fight in the new dlc.We also fight the miraclespamming cleric enemies look exactly like the pilgrims of londor. again Londor is directly above oolacile built on top of the ruins of oolacile if I am correct.Further evidenced by halflight being from oolacile us finding the bow from oolacile etc.in DS when we went to oolacile I believe it was immediately after THEY dug too deeply discovered the abyssthe deepwhatever you want to call it. which is why it looked so different.Ill have to pay more attention on my next playthrough but this is what I think happened some distant past events may be out of orderOolacilehumans  Gwynn kill the dragons gt Oolacile digs too deeply discovers manusabysswhateverDS DLC gt Gwynn sends Artorias doesnt work gt Gwynn sends everything else conquers oolacile maybe obliterates most of it gt He Sent Shira and Filianore to guide their development gt Some magic shit I dont understand happens with the shellall contact lost gt Gwynn sends his other pet humans to build new londolondor where oolacile was gt THEY dig too deep because of kaithe they make darkwraiths etc gt They all go crazyhollowdie before the events of DS main game when we fight the  kings gt DS DLC  we fight the first boss in the same place we fought the  kings...

Do you think that Gwyns daugther would be a warden to something or a princess? Yeah there are some thing about an uncle or something but... whats the point? Gwyn is the real deal the real god. The others are gods too but his blood is the royal blood.

If the existence of fire brought disparity and ended the age of the ancients shouldnt everything just go back to the way it was when the fire fades.

11421886,0,t3_630pza,The WAs definitely help with infiltrating ultra class weapons something the standard hold stance couldnt IMO. Ultras are also my worst matchup. If the Rapid Slash cant be parried I have a feeling it can though just a really tight window then thats another bonus too.The blindfold mask with the dark clutch ring for that much extra damage though thats pretty impressive especially considering dark weapons and dark sorcerymiracle users are nigh nonexistent anyways.Feels a lot like Twin Princes Greatsword except the damage is actually good for its class and the WA damage is good too feels bad my guy. It requires some finesse and you obviously cant spam arts to win. The wave is easy to react to at neutral and the Rapid Slashs hits comes out a little later than youd expect especially considering latency so if not setup properly youll probably get hit out of it. Thankfully the Rapid Slash doesnt use FP until the rd swing.

Also Midirs soul giving you Old Moonlight heavily implies that hes a paledrake or is related to a paledrakeSeath.I also mentioned that Midir mightve been an experiment perhaps to create a paledrake with scales assuming paledrakes actually are naturally scaleless.

11436854,0,t3_6388ic,Im not a good PvPer but Ive done some for farming covenant items.  I always tried to PvP mainly for the covenant items even for the notorious Darkmoon covenant token worked better in PS than PC.If you feel youre missing out on PvP give it a shot and it does grow on you.  It sucks to be invaded when you just want to go through content you can keep the Way of the Blue covenant item on and people will come to your aid eventually.  Worst case you can use one of the Seed of the Giant if you need that extra edge against invaders hiding behind mobs.  Ideally youd be fighting invaders in a place where you can safely retrieve souls.PvPing for covenant tokens is fun if you accept that you will lose a couple invasions and get outnumbered a couple times... I say place a red sign in popular duel locations and get the feel of PvP before diving into invasions or defending yourself vs invaders.  Find  weapons that youre comfortable with they dont have to be meta.Once you get comfortable with those weapons you can start looking to mix in spells or role specific weapons like equipment that have better roll catching etc.Dont take embarrassing losses or offensive taunts too personally.  Its cheesy to say but they hurt when you let those feelings hurt you.  I dont even remember most of my embarrassing PvP moments and Ive had a lot of them while farming over  PvP covenant tokens across a few characters.,darksouls3,dfscu2u,1,t5_2w3z3

Youll never feel like youre underpowered and towards the end youll be blasting through enemies.Pyromancy  The strongest of the bunch. You can get the most powerful pyromancies in the game as well as all the pyroboosting gear after only beating two bosses. Youll be melting everyone in no time. Miracles  The weakest of the bunch. Offensive miracles have seen a lot of buffs since launch and definitely arent to be trifled with but the problem with miracles is that all the good offensive miracles are locked away at late late game. A pure caster miracle build also requires a sizeable stat investment. Lightning Spear hits like a wet noodle at the lower levels and Lightning Stake isnt that impressive early on either. Great Lightning Spear isnt available until Lothric Castle and requires  Sunlight Talismans Sunlight Spear isnt available until the Soul of Cinder and Lighting Arrow isnt available until the middle of the Ringed City DLC.

11439896,0,t1_dfsn499,I dont think theres anything tangible that leads to this explantation. The only Dark supporter we talk to is the Locust Preacher and his behavior doesnt hint at him being allied with some bigger and hunted faction within the city. If that were the case still it would mean that people in favor of the Dark would be a minority in TRC and its problematic with the rest of the game. It doesnt line up with what Yulia wants of you to become the leader of Londor and its Undead legion. You cant lead a nation that mostly doesnt want the age of Dark to happen and that already has well established leaders. An open conflict within Londor is never implied and youre very much installed as a fullblown leader of some kind with a queen and everything.Another hint that TRC isnt Londor  the sand desert during the final boss of TRC and the one from the intro of the game is one and the same. In the intro we see pilgrims of Londor dying from exhaustion at this very desert during their pilgrimage towards Lothric meaning they did a significant distance before dying out where The Ringed City stood.,darksouls3,dfsp9o2,1,t5_2w3z3

I thought it was very likely that the Chasm of the Abyss ended up being connected topart of the great cave New Londo is inside of or at least is the location of the  Kings boss fight. If New Londo and Oolacile take place is the same area which is further supported by the abysss presence in both Kaaths influence in both and the areas lining up if you look at Darkroot Garden and Valley of the Drakes then Oolacile must have come first.Also I doubt that the Darkwraiths were founded along with New Londo. If they were an existing faction for hundreds of years before the flooding of New Londo then I dont see how there arent any darkwraiths outside of New Londo though they may have been killed off but then there should at least be some mention of eating humanity outside of New Londo. New Londo would also probably not have flourished into a huge city with the presence of the incredibly powerful and parasitic Darkwraiths.,darksouls3,dfuk8aq,1,t5_2w3z3

11457331,1,t3_63i7rd,tldr Soul of Cinder is insanely overrated in my books and Gael is the best fight in the trilogy.    By miles. Gael is a vastly superior boss as far as Im concerned whether thematically aesthetically or mechanically. I guess Ill rant a bit about Soul of Cinder since its been a while.       From a lore standpoint Soul of Cinder is like... its like a fanfiction final boss. Its like a nostalgia show. You get to be brought back and you get to be brought back and you get to be brought back and so on. Its a being with absolutely no character or purpose of its own. Its just one big pile of pandering to past affections and maybe that wouldnt have been so bad if it wasnt done in an extremely onthenose way which feels totally out of character for Dark Souls. Obviously this was still fine for a lot of people but it fell short of expectations for me. A fight like the Twin Princes is the sort of thing I expected from a Dark Souls final boss  an emotional thematically charged encounter with its own unique character and purpose. Gael succeeded far better at this. Hes his own character entirely and he was a million times more humble and in keeping with the Dark Souls approach to storytelling.    Aesthetically Ive always kind of hated Soul of Cinder. The way he awkwardly sidestrafes the way he suddenly snaps to attacks and delays his swings just... it just doesnt look good to me. I dont know exactly why I have this issue with literally  other bosses in the series but after so many times fighting him I still kind of hate SoCs animations. Maybe its because he resembles a player character that his attack animations also reflect that they have the same unnatural delay that you see in certain attacks the curved sword H and curved gs R come to mind. Aside from that hes literally the culmination of generic armordudes. The only other thing he does is mage form which is by far the worst of all  that ugly purple poison gas and harsh blue light completely CLASH with the ash grey reds and blacks of the rest of the arena. I can not remember ever seeing a From Soft boss which are usually so tightly designed aesthetically to create a perfect harmony with their environments or at least clash in interesting ways that highlight something cool have such downright ugly looking aesthetic elements. His arena honestly feels more gaudy than anything else and its also largely a rehash that didnt become interesting until they made a level of it.   Finally mechanically Soul of Cinder is great in some ways but in others I really hate him. He is basically Delayed Attacks The Fight. I hate how the fight in a few forms feels like its built around some attacks being so quick you have to twitch dodge and others having just enough delay to rollcatch. Im fine with rollcatchers  but when theyre interspersed so carelessly with quick twitchdodge attacks and when there are other faster attacks with basically the same telegraph they stop being interesting and start to feel cheap. His sword and curved sword forms are the major offenders here. I really hate fighting either of those two modes and based on what Ive read online pyro mode is more like fuck off and wait it out mode for many. I dont think it speaks favorably of your enemy design when that happens.    The spear mode feels awkward in a different way I feel like I often dont have enough time to counterattack because he can snap to a new attack so quickly. Now sure with a dagger or something youre probably fine but I was just fighting him with Gaels GS not a slowass weapon by any means and for example even after timing my roll to iframe through his WotG he was able to charge and cast another WotG so quickly that it hit me before my animation was over. But if I had waited he probably wouldnt have cast one so there was no correct choice other than to just wait. This sort of design just feels sloppy to me and its all over the place with SoC. An opening should be an opening unless its tied to a specific combo or mixup and you can certainly see that in the Gael fight. Gundyr is the only time theyve gotten this endless attack thing right and in that case its because the fight feels like it was built entirely around it to make it work with SoC it feels like a side effect of sloppy design.        Mage is the only one Im fine with even though its arguably too easy compared with how hard the others can be to dodge. What does feel cheap is when he brings his soulmasses over into the other forms. That simply isnt reasonable and it shouldnt be happening as far as Im concerned. Oh and Gwyn mode is pretty cool. Id say thats the best one since its like a much better version of original Gwyn. But none of it compare to Gael.   ,darksouls3,dfuoi6a,0,t5_2w3z3

Two wins were won when one phantom died at the start of Phase  while the remaining phantom was already out of Estus and had HP left from Tears preventing removal from the fight yet made it to the end of the fight. The feeling of exhilaration was palpable.I think Gael on NG is completely working as intended. Its an amazingly tense challenging fight and winning it is a great feeling.,darksouls3,dfvl55y,1,t5_2w3z3

Ive only played against the paired UGS once but I got absolutely wrecked because they had way more reach than I thought they would and the tracking is crazy but I feel like by the end of the match I was able to figure it out and it wasnt too bad dont really see why its being nerfed. The weapon that really pisses me off though is that new spear idk the name but the range is absolutely balls to the wall fucking insane Im getting hit from that shit in the next County but oh well something something dark souls.

11471108,0,t1_dfw81bz,Im a pyromancer and I fuck shit up in the spear fight in fact im usually the one with the highest damage contribution its easy to get behind a spear or distracted summon and backstabspell punish them Ive done it quite a few times myself. A backstab from a fully buffed spear is basically a one shot kill.The people who are complaining about this fight are fucking themselves over they ignore the spear and go for the assholes who get summoned in when most of the spears dont even worry about them. If they would focus their efforts on the actual boss they would probably win but they do stupid shit like blindly charge the spear while theyre summoning spears and crap and screw themselves over. I literally bought this game the day after the ringed city was released and it was the first time I had played the game in like a year because I was tired of all of the pussies using glitches in pvp yet here I am absolutely destroying most of my opponents even though im really not that great at doing pvp I dont even invade people because its a dick move. Hell I dont even know most of the good loadouts and builds because im a casual player all of my builds are unique to me. From what I have experienced first hand most of the people dying are doing stupid shit that gets them killed. You dont attack without a plan you dont ignore the spears you dont charge the spears without a plan you dont exhaust all of your stamina while attacking you dont summon a full squad to fight one damn person unless you think you can handle them getting like a  boost to defense health and damage. Its all common sense its not the games fault that theyre being stupid.,darksouls3,dfw8tav,3,t5_2w3z3

11476613,0,t3_63tnjj,A softban means you can only interact with other players who also have been softbanned or penalized as the game calls it. Since most players circumvent softbans by making an altaccount there wont be many people to interact with however. A softban is often preceeded by the invalid data warning upon login which means the server team has detected some kind of modification to the game files before you ask no one really knows what does and does not trigger a softban and even people who did tests with good methods have come to results that I can refute. If you dont remove the modification from your game ideally by deleting your save file and removing any third party tool that interacts with the game this will usually lead to a permanent softban.There also seems to be an alternative softban which I have encountered three times now where you dont get a warning instead the game goes full penalization instantly. However in my case this kind of softban was lifted after a week in the first instance and after two weeks in the second and third instance.,darksouls3,dfwvbne,3,t5_2w3z3

It in combination with a DLC item you arent meant to be able to use normally creates a trail of lightning spears which electrify the ground for a while allows it to be spammed in places it shouldnt be usable and be invisible due to that as well.If you see it again itll create a small AoE around the user and then a straight line forward that does slightly track towards you to curve but not very much.

11540806,1,t1_dg44yfw,gtYou know they buffed the entire pike class this upcoming update right?Id hardly call Increased tracking on attack animations for Pike category weapons a significant buff. Up the damage maybe then Id call it worthwhile and a good competitor to the longsword category.gt It used to be only dark sword and katana running rs.It still is people just running longswords. They are far too powerful when compared to other classes. They hit hard stunlock enemies into oblivion and generally just make the whole PVE experience trivial. They shouldnt be this powerful. From should be nerfing them not other classes of weapons. The dark sword nerf barely scratched the surface. Ive seen many user reviews for the game on various websites that agree with this as well. There were people even saying they literally saw no point in not using their starting longsword for the whole game as they couldnt find any better truly weapons. Maybe removing the stunlock and toning down the damage and buffing other unused classes would actually bring more build variety and weapon diversity.,darksouls3,dg45hm0,-2,t5_2w3z3

But I dont understand why they wouldnt you know just actually advance their game. They have  more health double the amount of Estus up to three helping phantoms Way of Blue a seed are probably at a higher SL than the invader because thats how the matchmaking works. What reason do they have to be scared of one invader? Absolutely none. And even if they die to the invader what does it matter? Hosts dont camp at the bonfire just because there is a powerful mob in the level so why do it when theres an invader around? Simply playing the game and trying to advance through the level even with an additional threat surely beats just sulking at the bonfire doesnt it? At least I dont imagine the latter to be much fun...gtInvading is supposed to be hard.And it sure as hell is in DkS  and it also will be with the new patch. Youre still more likely to run into vs vs or even vs you still have less health and less Estus nothing about invading was and is easy. Invading was and continues to be the ultimate challenge in DkS .

The exact same thing happens in DS where soul memory doesnt exist. If my friend is level  I cant join him with my level  character. This is only a problem if you insist on playing a single character.gtA completely new player who loses thousands of souls will be matched against higher level players because of his mistakes in other words in that case it is helping griefers.This is just rephrasing the same thing you said before. I already addressed this.gtThey tried to fix one problem and in doing so created a whole bunch of other arguably worse onesLike I said before soul memory is only a problem if you want to do PvP on a single character longterm. Even this can be avoided by simply making a new character. This would mean more players going through NG and thus more chances for new players to get coop. Fromsoft knew this and probably decided that the benefits outweigh the cost. I would agree.gtIts not because the shield isnt part of getting gud as rolling is. The roll is there so that you can forgo a shield so that you can forgo stats that is the point.Nobody is forcing you to put points into Adaptability.

11631350,0,t1_dgee2tg,gtIts recovery isnt nearly that bad.I heavily disagree especially when comparing to other weapon arts. I wouldnt mind if its meant to be a slower but stronger version of Gaels GS but the speedrecovery gap is way too big. gtI would guess the hp recovery bonus would be confusing with how it would interact with added buffs. I guess a line of text in the description could say what exactly triggers the hp gain damage physical damage or total ARIts actually independent from everything else and doesnt scale. According to the wiki you recover hp from light attacks and  from heavies. With the WA active the healing increases by  for both light and heavy.gtthough its WA should just cancel any weapon buffs anyway.Ah I completely forgot about that. Maybe allow it to just be infused instead? I honestly dont know because I can see why they wouldnt want to because of the healing. But yeah at the very least increase the WA duration. gtThe current system isnt made for it at all Now why would you say that? All it was was invading as a Mad Spirit as though the host summoned him through a sign. When it was around it didnt break the game or made it unplayable. I would even say this is something that DS needs. Aside from the new patches Boss Invasions was the only reason I kept playing after doing everything. The smallest fix they couldve done was to not reward invaders when the boss is killed. ,darksouls3,dgefcji,1,t5_2w3z3

Depending on stats and rings it can do between  damage and  of pvp hits allow for a nd followup or more when people are stunned and are briefly considering just letting you beat them and be done with it. It scales primarily with Str with some dex and faith for bonus not at all necessary. Its also got a good lightning bonus which makes shields a fairly poor defense and cuts down most pve enemies.

Theyre certainly usable though.gtAnd does anybody have any tips for pvp  pve regarding weapons?

Compared to other bosses the Spear has really low HP and if you play a high damage build it can be over pretty quickly. gt Why do you think the Demon Twins swap active states? Because fighting two entities that have special abilities that the player doesnt have and that can kill you in  hits without you being able to stagger them is inherently unfair.Weeell OrnsteinampSmough the Throne Watcher and Defender Ruin Sentinels the Maneaters and a few more fit that description and I didnt find them unfair at all either.

11713510,0,t1_dgnogwg,While that alone as evidence is indeed very strong I present Soothing Sunlight and Bountiful Sunlight. The big thing with calling Rosaria the daughter of Gwynevere is the fact that one of those miracles come from her. BUT the Soothing Sunlight Miracle comes from the Dancer of the Boreal Valley. Both are linked to Gwynevere through description and through the games. And the Sun Princess Ring mentions how Gwynevere became a mother and wife raising several heavenly children. Rosaria and Gertrude are not several by any means. Oh and the other gods are always present in some form why would Gwynevere be the only one to fade away? She was Gwyns first born daughter and depicted with statues and rings and miracles. I believe that based on this and the connections in The Ringed City and other things to Dark Souls  that Gwynevere when she died had her soul split seeking those who would need her light. Rosaria to care for the mangrubs and becoming the mother of rebirth Gertrude to be known as the heavenly daughter and to the dancer to stand tall and proud despite being twisted by the evil Pontiff Sulyvahn. We DO find many reincarnational themes in the series and perhaps Gwyneveres soul reincarnated into the Queen of Lothric or split into Gertrude Rosaria and the Dancer or she could very well be the Queen of Lothric even though I personally believe its a rather big stretch. Im not convinced by the item description of one item in two games frankly. Lets not forget DSWater blessed by an ancient goddess.Her name is long forgotten and the MagicAcademy of Melfia denies even her existence.In any age there are those who refuseto see reason. It is their meddling thatdistorts the truth.Im not sure what to make of that one. It tells us that Divine Blessings were indeed blessed by a Godess but the fact that its so long forgotten and an academy denies her existence makes me think its not something she blesses on the spot but rather she blesses a source were they tap the water so no matter if shes alive or dead they can still find that power however limited.Soothing Sunlight is also found by invading Licia of Lindelt a cleric with a dark past. And Bountiful Sunlight is for the Blue Sentinels located in Heides Tower of Flame were we run into Licia. Perhaps that makes Heides Tower of Flame the place were Gwynevere and Flann were married in ages past. And the last part from the DkS Blessing that not only ours but every other one meddling without seeing reason despite whoever holds the correct answer distorts the truth. Because maybe my comments make people believe that the Queen of Lothric isnt Gwynever and perhaps your comments make them believe and our disagreement makes the truth hard to see. Maybe thats just poetic and wishful thinking but nonetheless. I can totally buy into your theory if you can prove it better than with Divine Blessing from DkS and DkS. In The Ringed City it was confirmed that Dark Souls  is Canon Universe and all lore there is applicable here.,darksouls3,dgnr7rn,3,t5_2w3z3

11733639,0,t3_67frti,Shields are most useful in PvE since the enemies are less likely to punish you if your guard breaks.Rolling is still far more effective but having a shield for small trash mobs and attacks you didnt expect can be very handy. Putting your shield up is instant so you instantly put it up in a panic giving you time to roll away or protection from the combo.When I first started I used a shield for the tough bosses like Namless King and Pontiff Sully since I was awful at dodging and having a shield meant the attacks I didnt dodge didnt take out half of my life total.Theyre less useful in PvP since people will try to punish you for using a shield and people never really attack more than twice in a row. Rolling tends to be a lot more effective but against shields might be useful in a pinch if youre not confident in rolling.Just make sure not to hold your shield up too much or people will break your guard.,darksouls3,dgq1dgg,1,t5_2w3z3

You said we were talking about underrated weapons. Or are we talking about underused weapons? Let me explain again underrated means something that is UNFAIRLY considered worse than it is or useless. The Great Mace is an underrated Great Hammer because it has the highest AR of a standard Greathammer with the perseverance WA but most consider it bad. Smoughs Hammer is not underrated because there is nothing special about it aside from useless unique R attacks and health Regen. It is worse than all other Greathammers save the Wooden one and the fire ones. There is not a single reason you should be using Smoughs Hammer unless Im missing something about it. If we want to talk about underused weapons you would be correct. It is definitely underused. ,darksouls3,dgsmdw7,-1,t5_2w3z3

11808174,0,t3_68e2hj,Problem Ok so I helped Seigward with the demon and he fell asleep. Then I progressed to fight the abyss watchers I didnt know the path continued. Now I can get neither Seigward or Patches to spawn. Do i have to restart the game now?,darksouls3,dgyhx3w,3,t5_2w3z3
11808270,0,t1_dgyfoet,The strategy that worked for me was to stay near his head. His physical attacks can be dodged relatively easily and when he rears up to use his flame breath you need to turn around and run directly away rather than trying to get behind him.,darksouls3,dgyib7y,1,t5_2w3z3
11808877,0,t3_68h09o,Nameless King is my favorite DS vanilla boss very good learning curve. Also yeah playing Bloodborne first makes DS cheesecake. ,darksouls3,dgyksfd,6,t5_2w3z3
11809623,0,t1_dgyn9v1,I think thatd be a reasonable starting point.  Probably not definitive but thats my gut answer from past experience.,darksouls3,dgynu1k,1,t5_2w3z3
11810270,0,t3_68hvyn,Bloodborne. It is the magnum de opus of the Soulsborne games. The aesthetic the game has is so unique and well done not to mention how fluid and precise the combat is. While DS has a tremendous amount of weapons Bloodborne does an incredible job making every weapon in the game unique and fun to play with. While Darksouls  is an incredible game in and of itself and the DLCs improve on that quite a lot Bloodborne has what is in my opinion the greatest single piece of content Fromsoft has ever created the Old Hunters. Bloodborne does have its share of flaws like a health penalty for invaders no proper duel system and covenants not being to rewarding. But another thing it has in its favor are the Chalice dungeons a system of procedurally generated  level areas that are unique and can be shared among players. They are infinite endgame content that can be made more difficult through the use of offerings and let me tell you if you thought any boss of the Darksouls series was hard you are in for one hard beat down against a Fetid Rotted Cursed max depth Chalice Dungeon. ,darksouls3,dgyqh3v,3,t5_2w3z3
