5192927,0,t1_cvb01nt,Youre absolutely right that dramas involve the least work in addition to the translation itself by far. I was talking purely from a translator perspective. Theres obviously a lot of dialogue to translate but more importantly theres no transcript to refer to its all by ear and also lacks the audiovisual context of anime.So basically theres little to go by when something is hard to catch obviously not an issue for written materials and I think even anime often has closed captions andor a licensed reference translation to fall back on these days. Which is especially tough when the seiyuu pull out their their fanciest voice techniques to make the performance more interesting.,yuri,cvbxweh,1,t5_2qqk8

7317990,0,t1_d29zlas,Ive always been sick of romance stories that are anything but. The worst the fucking worst are those shitty romantic dramedy movies where the couple spends a literal total of mins together on screen and the other  of the movie they are separated due to distance or argument and then make up in the last  minutes with a shitty fucking montage at the end.i just wanna see gay couples in a stable flirty happy relationship. Keep the drama external. Have the couple weather storms together. Dont separate them. Dont introduce a wedge between them. Yea a lot of relationships have serious problems and stupid fights. So do a lot of depicted relationships. But yknow what? Some relationships are enduring and sweet and happy. Why not depict those too?But talking about this isnt gonna make it happen so please If anyone knows of anime that depicts a preexisting lasting yuri relationship without the death of one or both of the women and with actual mutual romantic love between the two women I will give you gold or whatever.So far literally the only anime I have found that meet this criteria are Kanamemo Bodacious Space Pirates and Psychopass These three each have two women in a romantic relationship with each other. They are listed in descending order of screen time given to their relationship. In Kanamemo you see at least one sweet moment between the couple once every other episode and with psycho pass its literally one quick scene that confirms the existence of their relationship.So yeah. The world is sparse when it comes to true lesbian relationships in anime with a happy ending.,yuri,d2a07sj,3,t5_2qqk8

7619513,0,t1_d36nuoy,I dunno back when Tan Jiu was putting out concept art and stuff for the series it was almost all of them either kissing or just being together as obviously a couple.Like in story terms its actually been moving at a decent clip its just that it gets published so slowly.  And its not like Sun Jing has gone passive now that shes confessed shes explicitly hitting on Qiu Tong now and Qiu Tong seems to be getting more comfortable with that idea pretty quickly.,yuri,d38as0g,1,t5_2qqk8

I wouldnt defend the fetishization of lesbians either but a lot of yuri is not that.gtYou cant possibly imagine what it feels like to be on the other end of the Male GazeI dont have to imagine it I know it. It still in no way makes it wrong for someone to enjoy a love story about people with a different sexuality  you can make an at least equally valid argument for it increasing peoples understanding which would be a good thing.,yuri,db5f189,5,t5_2qqk8

10974278,0,t3_5w6mzy,I actually finished it. It has absolutely no value imo. The main character likes another girl but basivcally gets it on with every other guy because the girl she likes likes a guy. I seem to remember it ending with the two girls leavimg the country together but it was a long time that I read it. I am pretty sure there was almost no yuri at all apart from the protaginists one sided love. But that thats just my memory of it. Im not going to read it again to give you a better summary ,yuri,deby12m,1,t5_2qqk8
