427184,0,t3_1yz1ya,My Ivan common top was at  so it went through about  game after a repair. It cost me  credits to repair so with  clothes thats some  gold to repair a game. My Uncommon Gold Predator took  gold to repair from  so with  uncommon weps to repair thats like  gold. Were talking about  gold max to repair everything. You earn about k gold on a win on average and  gold on a loss average. Edit The real problem with gold is the  needed to upgrade gears. It costs .k to go from  .k to go from  and .k to go from  and .k to go from . I estimate the rate at which gears to upgrade to be about  at level   at level  and  at level . Gears also risk decreasing levels when you try upgrading from  so you could be spending k to get to level  easily another k to get to level  itself. At level  any failure to upgrade to level  could blow up the gear. ,Gunz2,cfp1jxf,2,t5_2slx2

440107,0,t1_cfp9i6h,Theres a lot of people that desperately dont want advanced techniques to be developed because theyll feel pushed out of the target demographic.,Gunz2,cfqdra5,1,t5_2slx2
447506,0,t3_1z7arr,just to point out this is the entire point of classes. One playstyle that counters another which counters another. The Max excels at close combat due to flame. The entire class is meant to to get into close quarters and beat down. On the opposite side of things it has low manueverability relatively and is horribly innacurate at long range. Ivan longrange and Elena essentially hard counter it.Maybe instead of running into a flamethrower with a blade at short range you should...i dont know..play intelligently?,Gunz2,cfr5dcu,9,t5_2slx2

713614,0,t3_22c57t,Better yet. If the items look bad give some awesome stats to go along with it. Not damage but maybe critical chance or more AP. Something minor. I saw the items and was like WTF  for this? I can buy a whole game that has  hours of play time for this or cheaper!I would pay like   for those items. If they were that cheap I would totally buy  items. Old Gunz had weapons with different stats. It definitely wasnt play to win because the stats were minor but I dont see why they cant do something similar here.,Gunz2,cgle3p8,-1,t5_2slx2
713903,0,t1_cglex20,Your tactile input might not need to be as fast as gunz but it can be mostly thanks to dash cancel.Its similar to the speed difference between dstyle and kstyle in gunz. Daggers themselves were quicker in the agility and movement opportunities they granted while swords required you to be quick in order to move with any fluidity. GunZ  perfectly captured the agility and speed of GunZ  dstyle only without the need to switch weapons or mash leftclick and with much more polish in terms of characters interaction with terrain. Youre given greater freedom of movement and agility without the necessity of memorizing Painwheels BnB in three different forms in order to move two meters in a slight zigzag with a slash. The game will feel faster when you play faster. And you can play faster.,Gunz2,cglfacn,0,t5_2slx2
729680,0,t1_cgn1f3r,Ah good add I forgot about it since I whiff it too much haha!  For those who dont know the combo by Thothmes it requires you to use your launch attack on the downed opponent allowing you to fast switch to desired weapon and still leaves them on the floor very useful if you can pull it off!  ,Gunz2,cgn7vg3,2,t5_2slx2
815026,0,t3_23c9c9,I know Ill be hated for this but I feel like these are really good changes. All they need to do is setup some nice servers and they might have a chance in breathing life back into the game.,Gunz2,cgwx78b,1,t5_2slx2
1055310,0,t3_266sq5,There are no real winners. SMGMost people say that coffin is the best highest fire rate but Im more a fan of the Schmeisser Highest damage.KatanaI believe the Saber Blade is considered the best one its damage is almost the highest it has more than  armor piercing and its switch time is almost double as fast as the othersSniperEither Krasnov or Predator most people use the Predator.You can compare the stats with this program ,Gunz2,cho8rze,3,t5_2slx2

Her melee will be pretty decent once they fix up the bug as it does deal quite a good amount of damage. When you shotgun always aim for the head.,Gunz2,cix0378,0,t5_2slx2
