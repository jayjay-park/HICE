1388633,0,t3_28vtey,Hello! Im currently using my Teach Yourself Norwegian book and I came across a possible written error. Jeg vil ikke spise frokost med norsklreren min! is what the book has the sentence I will not eat breakfast with my Norwegian teacher! typed as. I use google translate while I read from the book often to ensure understanding of certain words and it keeps correcting the sentence to Jeg vil ikke spise frokost med min norske lreren!. This latter translation makes more sense to me but which is correct?,norsk,ciqci4e,1,t5_2uhx1

3929500,0,t3_35fj9m,For language learning in general not Norwegian specifically check out Gabriel Wyners Fluent Forever book. I am currently using the method he outlines for language learning for French and German with really good results. In short his method involves starting out with  of the most commonly used words in most languages  a lot of nouns like tree table chair school Etc.  and then moving to grammar and then the top  of the most common words of your target language. The author utilizes anki to learn all of this material or you can build your own flashcards. The guy has a ton of free information including the list of all of those words and an overview of his method at his website and youtube page Good luck with your studies! ,norsk,cr475wc,3,t5_2uhx1

I think any of the eastern dialects are my favorite the intonation is so much prettier and more musical. Also theyre WAY easier to understand  when I first started learning Norwegian I sometimes had trouble understanding my bergenskspeaking husband so he would just switch to a pretend Oslo dialect and suddenly I had no trouble understanding him!
