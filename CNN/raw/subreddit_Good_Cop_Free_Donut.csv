944353,0,t1_chbdbxh,gtYes people have the right to film but there really is not purpose too it.Wich is why thousands of people call for body cameras for police officers. The ability to record events especially if they are of such  intensity and legal importance for both the police and the person on the other end can be of extreme relevance for every person involved.gtpeople crowding around an already very stressful scene for any emergency personnel just ads to the danger of the situation.YesgtIn addition I feel it should not be the right of someone to film incidents of medicaltrauma calls int he sic interest of the patients privacy.I feel like everything that is happening in a public space should be accesible to the public because the public can be directly affected by it. There are more interests of importance here than just that of a patient who could also be a perpetrator or circumstances of an incident in some other way be informative for the people.gtAll so people can make make fun of cops.Something they should be able to handle otherwise they might be in the wrong profession.,Good_Cop_Free_Donut,chbmo7n,-6,t5_2rbu1

2238854,0,t1_clod1t6,Honestly Ive played out the scenario once or twice in my head and Ive decided its fairly easy to slowly slip cash into your bank account. Im a server and regularly deposit ish at the end of each month from tips alone. That means at most it would take  years. Throughout those years I could just use the money for groceries going out to eat etc. I wouldnt be able to go out and buy a car right away or put a down payment on a house.

2610498,0,t1_cmz3ydu,I dont know why you make a point of their faces being blurred out. Its for their own privacy.The police provided a photo which in turn required some backstory in order to recognize those certain officers that went above and beyond and did something nice. The kids now actually have some sort of gifts going into the holidays the police officers get recognized the community appreciates it you feel good reading about it not necessarily the actions that caused it but you know what I mean and sure the PD gets some good PR in the process. It took a shitty situation and made it better for everyone involved except for maybe the mother. I dont consider that lame by any meansIf you main objection is that the department used the photo to gain good publicity well we live in a time where every officers smallest mistake is scrutinized and judged sometimes on a national level. If were going to judge officers based on bad deeds then we sure as hell need to recognizing the officers that do good deeds,Good_Cop_Free_Donut,cmzbvgq,1,t5_2rbu1
