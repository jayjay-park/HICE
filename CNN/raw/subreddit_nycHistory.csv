8936881,0,t3_52lq1g,Part of Moses plan for the city actually affected my family. My Grandfather was born and raised on High Street in Downtown Brooklyn. The street which ran for considerable length from the Navy Yard to the promenade was decimated by his construction plan for the BQE the Manhattan Bridge and Cadman Plaza. My Grandfathers house was condemned as were  of the houses on High Street and the residents were forced to relocated. The location of my Grandfathers house would be what is today Trinity Park. Today High Street is one half of one city block connects virtually to nothing and is altogether forgotten. ,nycHistory,d7m2xdv,3,t5_2wzvr
11763048,0,t3_67j3e8,I would love to see a documentary about the Sugar Bar on the Upper Westside . My coworker goes often amp keep telling me they have an amazing open mic night. I went with my husband amp watched these people sing their hearts out. I wondered what they all did for work if they in the industry or what they did with their time. Ever since I went there a few years ago I imagine seeing the big guy with a deep voice as a toll booth operator or running a subway or the skinny little girl that belted out Etta James as a stay at home mom pushing a stroller. The band was absolutely fantastic. They played regularly with Quincy Jones. The first amp only time I went there was a kid from the Berkley School for Music there. It was his birthday amp his parents brought him down to NYC so he could come to the Sugar Bar. He had a song that he wrote. He had copies of sheet music he gave the band explained a few things amp they just started playing while he jumped on the piano while the singers in the band started singing his song. I suppose it would work for any open mic night in the city or maybe a barrestaurant Broadway casts go after theyre done with their show but the Sugar Bar was what sparked the idea for me. Edited to addThis post prompted me to look up their website to see if they were still around. Right now they are holding a contest for young dreamers to write why walking in Nick Ashfords shoes would help them achieve their dreams. The prize? A pair of Nick Ashfords shoes. ,nycHistory,dgtdcxw,1,t5_2wzvr
