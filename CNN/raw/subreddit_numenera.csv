941893,0,t1_chakngm,Heck I thought the whole game was supposed to be kitchensink crazy and to expect the unexpected and unexplained?  If you go into the game and everything has to require sound logic that sounds like a different game to me.  Wheres the risk to personal safety if every bit is spelled out?I dont think reaching for the kryptonite when someone has an extremely powerful pool stat would work either.  I think you would probably want to do is setup some random monster encounters or puzzles traps hazards etc that can show up in the session amp some of those may target the weak spots amp those are the times you want to put the GM Intrusion in full swing right when they need it most.Another thing I would look at is rebalancing the character.  If its too strong and making the game boring perhaps the character will need to be tweaked to lower the power.  I only bring it up because I recall some folks playing a Traveller game and a new character was introduced later that beat the game by sporting a powerful sniper rifle and battle dress.  It was pretty much unbeatable given the rules of the game.  They GM and the player had a talk to lower his power levels in the game and the player agreed.So I think any set of RPG rules can be broken when people start minmaxing the values.  So for the Fuses with Steel that adds  extra points to get to  Intellect or so perhaps throw it out and use the other options instead...or weaken it to  user per day instead of every round.  Or just limit how much difficulty can be brought down for any level  or above.  For instance in certain difficult or storycritical circumstances make the max decrease in steps only by  so a level  can get to  level  gets to  amp use edge points for those chances of rolling a .  But this is story driven and it depends on what youre trying to do.  It may not require a roll at all but to solve a puzzle trick trap ingame..no rolls.,numenera,chbcl6p,0,t5_2w096

1751983,0,t3_2egtah,Ask them to tell you exactly what their character says as they say it in first person. Get them into the habit of doing this. I tell them what I know might work when it doesnt really matter to the story and you want to move on. But if this is an important scene youre giving the player a huge out there. They may forget something when they tell what they know or word it in a way that leads to a misunderstanding. If its at all important they should be roleplaying what they say word for word. With a new player or a player from another game or group that didnt rolepaly its up to you to teach them how to play.If theres a social roll involved look for assets you can give them when they speak especially well.Ask for vivid descriptions of what theyre doing any time a roll is involved. Then look for assets you can give them due to the description. This works very well in combat but it also works in any situation involving a roll where how the PC proceeds may affect the outcome.With a new player Im much more concerned with this type of thing than that they understand mechanics. I can have a player at my table that doesnt know anything about the rules but roleplays her character and everyone will have a blast.

3851607,0,t1_cqv27ln,Im hesitant to share too many specifics because the campaign is just starting and I dont want any of my PCs to read what I have planned and thus ruin all my secrets. Im planning to post sessions after the fact. I wanted to share some of my thoughts with the greater community of Numenera players and GMs and get some feedback.I want to put my PCs in positions where they have to make decisions that influence what happens to Aian and all of Milave. Here are basic decisions that will have to be made at some pointWho to support. Tarvesh and his resistance. The Democratically elected council. One of the rebellious groups like the Beggar Queen. One of the five great families. Stay out of politics completelyI have come up with at least a few encounters already that pin two or more of these groups against one another and force the PCs to pick a side. Then there are lots of optional sidequest type encounters that will force PCs to decide whether or not to make enemies with a powerful group or ignore something they might find unethical. Things like Angulan Knights mistreating mutantsLattimores Undermining a great family to help a poor family  Helping a criminal organization do something good while suspecting that there might be unintended consequences. Is the enemy of my enemy is my friend?Im going for feeling similar to Dragon Age Inquisition. I want PCs to feel like their decisions influence not just the city of Aian but even the entire country of Milave. Also I want their choices to be morally ambiguous and difficult to make.  Lastly I want information to be one of the most powerful tools you can wield. ,numenera,cqvbh4c,3,t5_2w096
3958317,0,t1_cr7g5ew,I like that whole explanation and the idea that a shin could be multiple bits helps explain in theory how things less than a whole shin could be traded. The fact that money in Numenera is more of an abstract concept is cool and adds to the strangeness that the game promotes. It encourages things like bartering and helps the economy feel different than in DampD where it feels like the world is full of identical magic shops with identical  swords. However if a player just wants to buy a glow globe for  shins so they can explore a cave theres also no reason that it wouldnt go off without a hitch  of the time because the idea of shins could work in practice pretty well. The strangeness and complications of shins shouldnt come into play unless it adds to the games fun or excitement IMO. ,numenera,cr7hcy8,1,t5_2w096

5429239,0,t3_3peb0b,Also some random thoughts from my sidegt People have told me that Numenera is too fantastical lacking any firm grounding in reality. I find it a little hard to debate absolute realism in fantasy RPGs. However regarding inner realism I think that its lore is nicely crafted and allows a whole range of fantasy concepts to peacefully coexist. Im not talking about silly concepts such as Viking Ninjas in Constantinople but rather on a bigger scaleWhat I very much like about it is that for virtually every fantasy image I find on the internet rImaginaryLandscapes or rImaginaryMonsters Numenera offers a place where these could realistically lorecompatible exist without feeling silly or displaced. It plays very nicely with ones imagination especially if youre a GM.gt will stop being surprised and awed by the tree that heals people when you sing to itMaybe somewhat true its certainly not a subtle fantasy setting. However I think that has a lot to do with storytelling and the time and space a GM gives these concepts in the narrative. gt idea of giving xp for interruptions or being able to use xp as rerolls From a gameplay mechanics perspective I like it because it provides some sort of explicit contract how conflicts resolve. GMs explicitly have the freedom to trade a complication for an incentive and players are more or less free to accept these or refuse them. Of course the basic principle exists in every RPG but here its codified. gt players wont spend xp for rerolls because they know it is a very small short term benefitCould happen. Practically though at least in the groups I was in people quite liberally spent XPs for rerolls not so much for scene or permanent benefits though.gt Not telling players the difficulty of rollsInteresting never heard of that. At least we never played it like that.gt Ive heard combat can be quite dullLet me boldly claim that if you play Numenera by throwing in enemies DampDstyle youre doing it wrong. There is nothing to be gained from combat well yes Numeneras and shins which you can get in many other ways and battles should be short and purposeful. It is absolutely true that there a only very few official combat actions in the book. But that doesnt mean players can only do five things in their turn. Quite the contrary Rather imagine whatever feels right or realistic for your character at that moment and youll probably hear something like that sounds challenging difficult impossible give it a try from the GM.  ,numenera,cw5n30p,5,t5_2w096

Ive been tempted to let the Intellect stat be the same for both so I may tweak creation in general somewhat.

The adventures are all good. The simple layout is great and is something Ive implemented when constructing my own material now. If none of the adventures we mentioned above grab your attention a few tweaks could turn any number of these into good introductory adventures.Lastly I wanted to mention Robert Schwalbs Beyond All Worlds. I dont see it mentioned often. It is a very good adventure. Again Im not sure if I would introduce a group to Numenera via this adventure but every group is different. Maybe this is the adventure your group would love. It involves a trip into an extradimensional prison that served an entirely different purpose in the past. If you can create a good initial hookreason for your PCs to enter the prison its a very cool adventure. Rob knows how to write cool creepy adventures.EDIT I took a look at Beyond All Worlds in order to refresh my memory. Its definitely not an introductory adventure assuming youre starting at Tier .

The same could be said for traps combing an area for traps taking time to explore every nook and cranny will take time and effort but in the end if there are no traps you would still have spent the effort.As uOrangePhoenix has already mentioned searching for traps that are not there is a very difficult task harder than actually finding traps because they have a level to target the roll.

No XP for killing stuff. Very story driven.Generally speaking DampD is rules heavy less fluff in my experience but each group will differ and largely GM driven. Most sessions are usually a lot more combat orientated. Storyline is largely a plot to get the game going then becomes less a story and more a series of actions and events.To be completely honest if your group can play DampD they should grasp the cypher system within a session because its that simple.Converting DampD to a Numenera setting is definitely doable but could be a lot of work as youd need to scale things i.e. a tier  Numenera chatacter technically has hp whereas most DampD st level characters are gonna be under half that.,numenera,dcmkf5p,1,t5_2w096

There will always be more andtheyll have different benefits. This means that in gameplay cyphers are less like gear or treasure and morelike character abilities that the players dont choose. This leads to fun game moments where a player cansay Well Ive got an X that might help in this situation and X is always different. X might be an explosivedevice a shortrange teleporter or a force field. It might be a powerful magnet or an injection that will curedisease. It could be anything. Cyphers keep the game fresh and interesting. Over time characters can learnhow to safely carry more and more cyphers so the devices really do end up seeming more like abilities andless like gear,numenera,ddskxiv,1,t5_2w096
10884469,0,t1_de27lmb,Thats actually some of what I have in mind. On its high power level I want it to cut through weapons and armor Im thinking anything below level . This would add to the effect of the initial reveal where melee characters think I got this fool as they then watch their favored blade get effortlessly and unceremoniously chopped in half.And if heavy emphasis on IF the players ever gain access to one I ABSOLUTELY want to make its access to power very limited requiring high level powercells that are hard to make are rare to find because of how high energy they are in such a small container.I also like the idea to penalties to recovery rolls. Naturally if theyre losing limbs its an excellent opportunity for permanent injury. Something my players havent experienced yet...I was also toying around with what weapon class to treat it as. I had been considering light due to how well light it would be being composed of just a handle.,numenera,de2nlyz,1,t5_2w096
