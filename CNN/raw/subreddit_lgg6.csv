11547880,0,t3_64p2qv,I had mine for a week before I sent it back I dont know if I just got a bad one or what but the UI was slow and not intuitive along with the fact that many apps were slow for me.  I also have bigger hands which made the skinnier phone feel really small and dealt with many issues trying to use the keyboard.  Made the switch to the Pixel XL and couldnt be happier with it. ,lgg6,dg4ydtc,0,t5_31nxb

11762064,0,t3_67mn1a,Dat  yr old Gorilla glass  tech though....Jokes aside. And although I personally wouldnt buy another LG. Ill give you a heads up. Since its worked for me. Invest in Zagg screen protector. They are Legit! And come with a lifetime warranty as well. Although they have the newer tempered glass ones will still protect your screen. They can also shatter and that in itself will freak you out. I used the plasticyrubbery military grade one. It sits flush to the screen cant even tell its THERE! Your screen will remain scratch free for as long as it remains on. I had the Original Invisible shield on my HTC incredible  back in . That shit WORKS! Real well. Granted its not as big as the LG G is. It was still a well built pretty hefty phone. I had that and a  cheap ass gel case on it. I dropped it  ft....ON ITS FACE!!!! To the hard concrete below. I was prepared for the worst. Not a scratch nic dent fracture chip. NOTHING. So yeah. Its way worth it. Think the incredible was rocking GG at that time. And it definitely lived up to its name. Shit was built like a tank. Put the HD film on my S still have it still works. Got the phone when it came out in . The Zagg shield is STILL on it. My screen is FLAWLESS. Had it on my G but my toddler pulled it off... Tore it up as well. So no free replacement for me. Now I got chicken scratches all over it. But it is yrs old. And not bad overall. Plus I dont think it has Gorilla glass. We had the Tempered glass version on our G reason why i wont purchase another LG. And it works. But Since it protrudes a tiny bit since its thicker than film obviously doesnt always work well with a case. And yeah they shatter much easier than your screen will. But then again it takes the hit so your screen doesnt have too. Could always buy a skin tight clear case. That way you still see the color of the phone. But it isnt obstructing. Just my  cents. Sorry for the long comment. So if youre gonna invest in a screen protector. Dont cheap out. Most Zagg is like  tops. Depending on type. And its lifetime free replacement. If you can provide the one that came off tore turned yellow etc. If installed right. It stays on virtually forever. Yet easily removable and leaves no residue. Not sure about full on waterproof. But it can get wet to a degree. Ive personally never broke a screen. And I cant fathom how so many people shatter their iPhones and what not. ,lgg6,dgt9cm2,0,t5_31nxb

11798249,0,t1_dgxan7k,Well Samsung actually stands behind its products. LG does not. Plus if Samsung starts rebooting. Its a FIRST for that company. And will be cut in the bud and fixed immediately. Whereas LG has had that issue since the G. And since. The G is yet to be determined if it does as well. Thats the differences. Plus Samsung is HUGE! And any issues they get hits front page almost immediately. Where LG isnt and doesnt get recognized anywhere near as fast when problems arise. And not that its a surety. But for the G. It has a high chance of suffering boot loop as well. Because all the previous devices did. ,lgg6,dgxdejs,-2,t5_31nxb
