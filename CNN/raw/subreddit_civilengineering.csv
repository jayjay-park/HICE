Figure out the smallest cheapest pipe that will get you Ls with the required pressure at the mfg plant. Do the same for the paint shop.That gives you the pressure you need at the split. Figure out the smallest pipe that gives you that pressure and flow from the tower to the split.I could be wrong though. Like I said its been a minute since fluids class.

2712539,0,t3_2r4hc9,First you should not be working hours off the clock. If tasks are taking longer than budgeted that is your companys responsibility not your own personal responsibility. Definitely communicate to your PM and manager if you are concerned about budget but bill the hours you work. Working off the clock is bad practice and if lots of people are doing it likely a red flag for a toxic workplace culture.Next the knowledge experience and comfort with taking ownership of work will come. Dont rush it. Any consulting firm worth its salt will foster you as an engineer to match your responsibilities with your proficiency. They will also have a solid QAQC process which will prevent major mistakes from going out the door.

A Feildwheel is was? very useful for quickly finding the size pipe needed for gravity flow of water.  Lets say you know you need to convey  gpm of storm water you want to use concrete pipe you know the slope of the run of pipe needed to keep a minimum depth of burial.  All you do is set the dials to the set points for those variablesand voila the pipe size arrow is pointing to the pipe diameter you need roundup to the next available size if if gives you an odd size.Or if you know pipe size of an existing run of pipe you survey the slope and you know pipe material it can tell you how much flow it can carry for different pipe fullnesses. Now yes its obsolete.  There are several apps Excel templates online calculators and we all learned Mannings equation in school.

4466546,0,t3_3c996n,Civil PE here. Like umadcity I also got a Bachelors in Geotech but I got a Masters in Water Resources.  As for the highs and lows the low points are the frustration in trying to get plan sets and reports approved and dealing with reviewingpermitting agencies. The high points for me are seeing a project I designed actually constructed and working as designed.  The average day really depends on where you work. Ive worked on both the public and private sectors and they are VASTLY different.  Private consulting is fast paced and you work on the projects that your company gets with its clients. The public side is significantly slower and likely to be in lots of meetings without much design work.          The personality that I think is needed is one that loves to learn. Theres so much to learn outside of college so embrace it. It also helps to have a cando or a gogetter attitude. Also experience in Civil engineering is king. Start getting experience ASAP. even if you pick up a part time internship with a local civil engineering firm doing drafting simple engineering tasks or even surveying  any experience is extremely valuable and sets you apart from your peers when you all graduate.  Your first few years will likely consist of doing simple tasks under an experienced PE.  It could be in bridges and building like you want or it could be in something else. Youll need to do your research when looking for jobs to see what certain companies do on a daytoday basis.  Go work for those companies that already build bridges and buildings and youre more likely to jump right into design work on them right out of college versus working for structural firms that may do other things.Edit condensed and fixed,civilengineering,cstonov,3,t5_2qo8j
4467721,0,t3_3c996n,If youre looking to do buildings or bridges focus your efforts on structural engineering courses.  If your school requires a senior project of some sort youll probably be tasked with doing a preliminary design of a building or bridge.When I was in school I was told that if I wanted to be a structural engineer I would want to get a masters degree.  I didnt and it hasnt really held me back but these days Im seeing more and more job listings for structural engineers that say its preferred if not required.Out in the real world youll be doing grunt work for those first few years before being handed a project all your own.  And if youre looking to do design work youll be working in an office for most of your time.  Youll want to get your P.E. license once youre eligible or whatever the equivalent is if youre not in the US and youll eventually need to look at getting your S.E. license which is a relatively new license but is becoming more and more necessary for structural engineers.Ill also let you know that its unlikely youll be able to get a job where youll be designing both buildings and bridges even the S.E. exam is split where you have to choose to be tested on buildings or bridges.  My firm and several others that I know of have a special bridge design group and a general structures group.Anyway hope that all helps!

5516573,0,t1_cwgnefj,Wow thank you for answering so many questions!Im currently a senior at Colorado State University and I plan to graduate in Fall of  . years total. Ive always loved construction sites large buildings and manmade structures. I also love understanding how stuff works and building things. I originally decided that I wanted to get a masters degree because my adviser said it would be difficult to get a structural engineering job without it. I think I would want to get a masters degree even if it didnt help me get a job. I started looking into it and some of the classes seem interesting. After  years of undergrad I havent really taken many structural classes and thats what I really want to learn more about. On the one hand I think it would be amazing to work on large infrastructure projects such as a bridge or skyscraper on the other hand I think it would be really cool to work on smaller projects like residential homes.Another reason I want to go to graduate school is to challenge myself and boost my own confidence. In elementary school I didnt care about school at all I actually took kindergarten twice. I grew up in a broken home and Ive struggled quite a bit. I started doing better in high school but I didnt challenge myself much. In my first year of college I really struggled but I learned how to learn. I was shown that if I really tried that I could learn pretty much anything and solve most problems. I feel that graduate school might have a similar effect on me.

I spent around  hours for the latter two but Im upwards of  hours and will go on to  hours before the weekend is over for seismic granted I had a strong civil background so the general and surveying were mostly review from undergrad courses.  Also schedule your tests as far apart as you can.  you dont get a choice with the general portion but you could schedule your surveying exam to be at the very last day offered and your seismic as the very first day.  that way you can spend most of your time studying seismic and the general exam then when seismic is over switch gears for cramming for surveying.

I dont know about Canada but in the States survey crews are always happy to have more labor. If you show a real drive to learn and improve youll quickly move up relative to the field work. If you continue to work hard and put in extra hours filing the surveys learning to use drafting programs etc. you might be able to land an office job associated with the survey crew. Then youd have a stable job doing work related to engineering and might be able to attend a college then with your improved qualifications having been exposed to the work for some time.

7007283,0,t3_4bkgnz,Ive been doing transmission lines for  years.gt How did you get into tline work?I was actually interested in transportation in college.  I applied to  jobs during my last semester and IIRC  were transportation oriented and  was in power delivery.  The transportation jobs paid k lower than the job in power delivery so guess what job I took?gt Which city do you work out of?I work out of the Pacific NW.gt What location is most prominent for this profession?The major players consulting firms in transmission lines and substations are Power Engineers Black amp Veatch and Burns amp McDonnell.  Stantec HDR Kiewit Sargent amp Lundy and Beta have a presence too.  You should be able to find one of those companies in almost any major city.Black amp Veatch and Burns amp McDonnell are headquartered in Kansas City and Power Engineers is headquartered in Idaho.gt How do you see this work being different from substations?Good question.  When I started my career I split my time  between substations and tlines  I only do tlines now.  Why?  Civil engineers often serve as support staff for most substation projects and the projects can become repetitive.  Youll get very good at designing spread footings piers firewalls oil retention basins simple steel structures etc.  Utilities have standards for most structuresfoundations so unless the substation is very unique the structural analysis typically involves checking the capacity of an existing design.  Transmission line projects are typically geared toward civil engineers aside from system studies.There are two types of transmission lines overhead and underground and theyre both very different.  I dont know anyone who is an expert in both fields.  I do underground transmission lines and I highly enjoy it.  The people in my office who do overhead transmission lines enjoy their work too.  Personally I think transmission lines allow civil engineers to have more design freedom compared to substation engineers.Overhead transmission lines tend to be heavy on structural and geotech whereas underground transmission is all over the place general civil surveying geotech transportation etc.gt Where do you see the direction of this industry heading?Power delivery seems to be pretty strong and the outlook is positive.  If you decide to enter the field Id join one of the top  firms or a utility.gt I know the pay is more lucrative as a structural engineer relative to a land development engineer for example but should this be expected as a new hire?

8303596,0,t3_4t8vgw,Know a few people who have tried it with mixed results. For some its great but for others the starting again in a junior role combined with the downsides of design was too much for them. Its a big switch  as a designer the work is a lot more headsdown computer based which can be rewarding seeing your designs progress. The downsides are in general its a lot less communicative and can be a bit of a silo dowhatyouretold culture. The public speaking and building relationships side is something that wouldnt typically be found in a junior designer role. I think the key would be to look  years down the road  if you did start as a designer which route would you like to go down? There is the technical side focused on the technical aspects and less the softer side or the design management side where youll be doing a lot less technically but more peoplefocused and making projectlevel decisions. If the latter sounds more appealing to you you could try looking into design management roles now rather than start as a junior designer and progress to there.Just to finish off  its never too late to switch and probably wouldnt be too difficult to find a junior to midlevel role as youve got industry experience. I dont know about all countries but over here designer paypackage will typically be a bit less than contractor as less hours on paper so expect a bit of a pay cut. ,civilengineering,d5fi99d,3,t5_2qo8j

10045449,0,t3_5jkohd,k starting salary is a big difference.  Unless you think either youll enjoy life a lot more at the lower paying place or youll learn skills there you wont learn at the higher paying job I wouldnt try to negotiate.  Take the better job and enjoy the extra week.  Obviously if the k better job tells you they expect a minimum of  billable hours per week and the lower paying place wants  then take that into account falls under the enjoy life more clause.  Personally I wouldnt want to work for a company that puts me on salary then expects that much free overtime.  It is a sign of bad management.Also for a first job a lot of places will get offended if you try to negotiate.  I think it is a stupid attitude but it happens even if theyll negotiate with experienced engineers they think new grads should just take what they offer.  Check Glassdoor just to see.  You might be better off sending an email simply thanking them for the offer but saying you are declining because you got a better offer.  If they want to pay more theyll call you back and see if youll reconsider for more money.  If they dont then they probably arent going to remember being offended at you if you interview there down the road.Alternatively if they get offended at you negotiating they are probably going to be stingy with raises meaning youll have to leave in  years to get a decent raise anyway.  If you dont care it could be a good litmus test.  Consider this Im not sure how normal it is for students in your area to graduate with that much internship experience I had about that much when I graduated and I was swimming in job offers because it was about twice as much as most of my peers.

Check to see if theres anything in writing. Even if theres nothing it writing if you are allowed to stamp plans then there is the potential that youre on the States liability insurance which will cause a conflict of interest if you practice on your own. Secondly youll need liability insurance. Do not practice without it. Third find out if the State you live in makes you incorporate or get a business license to practice. Its a big deal in some states. Theres a reason most civil engineers do not practice on the side.

10157422,0,t3_5lffdz,There was once a town with a water problem.It stated with the environmental regulatory agency of my state issuing a notice of violation at their wastewater plant for discharging too much Chloride into their stream which had a TMDL total maximum discharge limit on various salts.  Well no conventional wastewater plant can removal salt.  That turned into an investigation of where it was coming from which turned into the regulatory agency performing an MCPE on their water treatment plant to diagnose why it wasnt treating water correctly which lead to us getting involved and going uhh...guys?  This is a conventional filtration plant.  It cant remove dissolved solids either.  The better question is where is all the salt coming from to begin with.This was a severe drought in the region.  At the rates of evaporation and consumption at the time the reservoir was going to be completely empty in less than  months.  No one had really paid any attention to the real source of the problem and were all instead trying to diagnose the symptoms.This led to a major alternate water supply project involving neighboring communities several different emergency funding agencies offering loans grants and various subsidies to complete a pipeline to a neighboring community with enough groundwater capacity to temporarily supply both towns.  We set several agency records for fasted project from application to completion that I dont think will every be touched.

10301776,0,t3_5nd7b2,Based off of my own decade of experience civil engineering has been extremely slow to adapt to new software and technologies.My first job out of college I worked for one of the largest engineering firms in the world their name rhymes with Schmacobs.  They were still using a version of AutoCAD that was from the late s I learned AutoCAD  in college.  Their primary FEA software was GT Strudl that program is so archaic and outdated that its obscene.  Hell we didnt even get Windows  and Office  companywide until well into  both of which had been superseded by that point.  And while its not techrelated I did  of the aluminum design at that job using a design manual from .  This was most definitely a company that had the money to invest in the latest and greatest software computers and codes but they chose not to.I went from that job to a much smaller familyowned company that actually invested their money and time into updating their technology and library of design codes.  They unfortunately didnt invest much in training me on how to best utilize these tools which were new to me.  I was at a loss because Id spent so many years at a job using outdated design technologies and methodologies.  I was only with the company for a short time due to a family situation but I felt like I never adequately got my head above water with the work that I did do.Maybe this isnt true across the board but from my experience it feels like civil engineers are very much stuck in their ways.  The fact that my state doesnt actually have any continuing education requirements doesnt help either.  The other part of it is that ours is very much an industry with razorthin profit margins and thus there isnt the money time or even coordination for continued training on how to properly utilize these tools.At any rate keep up with your Civil D skills dust off your resume and update your LinkedIn page.

My channel got copyright striked so I had to close it.  Sorry that some people had to ruin it for everyone.  I really enjoyed helping people by providing this great educational tool that increased peoples hireability and knowledge but people like Nadrius and  titusbrutusaurellio want to keep the knowledge for themselves.  INB  . You were monitizing those videos you pirate!  How much do you think I made ?  Ill tell you the past  months  before US taxes.  thats about  a month cant even get a McDonalds value meal once a month with that.  . Pirating is wrong and you are ripping off the people who actually made the video!  Most of the videos were by Eric Chappell  Just looking at his biography is weird hes a EIT with  year in Civil engineering...whatever he makes good videos support him anyway you can I bought the subscription once and marathoned his videos not sure how much that helps him.  I ripped off Lynda.com lynda paid his salary through the subscriptions.  I dont care if I ripped off a month subscription service.  Knowledge should be free and thats what youtube did.  . You didnt even crop out the logos in the video its not Nadriuss fault you got caught!  My channel has been open for a couple years now with those videos.  The dates were changed because my subscribersviewers reset accidentally while changing my nameaccount type whoops.  So given that I got multiple pms from those two above about how my channel was going to go down Im not that surprised.Ending thoughts   I probably wont start another channel to upload it took way too much time to set everything up well if I do I wont advertise it here because I might get harassed again.  I would post a torrent of all the files but I know I wouldnt seed it for long and I wouldnt be able to post it here since reddit in general has a weird morality about torrents.

I know there were a handful of others that were mad about my videos but I want to ask why?  I joined Lynda when youtubers were advertising it like crazy but now I dont see anyone being sponsored by them.  Its not well known its a very expensive service especially for people who do not have a job or are scraping their way through college and Im just talking about people in NA.  Thousands of viewers and commenters were from around the globe who probably dont have the access to Lynda.com or the money but I was able to provide a free service for them in hopes they educate themselves in a program that can get them a job.  Fuck.,civilengineering,dcce6nk,1,t5_2qo8j

10407373,0,t3_5p0dho,I think you can be honest about it and it will be fine. I think there is a shift away from the old school engineer  designer  drafter mentality. This is so at least in my company. The engineers are expected to draft their own work to a certain degree. So the whole mentality of someone being dedicated to one platform is obsolete. In order to make your resume shine you should also look at BIM platforms. Personally I use Revit but there are other capable platforms. Although we still use CD we are do more projects in BIM than Cad. Although we will never get away totally from CAD some of our resources are shifting towards BIM,civilengineering,dcnqryp,3,t5_2qo8j
10533768,0,t3_5qt0pq,What other people have been saying. College is about about learning but its also about growth and having fun. Joining civil related clubs is a good way to incorporate both of those things. Im not sure about in the UK but here in the US there are clubs sponsored by the ASCE American Society of Civil Engineers. So joining clubs related to your interest is a good way to meet  influential people and learn skills for the future.,civilengineering,dd24ahy,1,t5_2qo8j

10861140,0,t3_5v63h0,I work in construction and I have thought of doing the opposite. I actually work in the field building the kind of water treatment infrastructure that engineers like you design. Construction is pretty great job IMHO its very social and the culture seems much more casual than in design consultancy. You spend lots of time outside every day and you get to experience civil engineering from a very handson perspective. You get paid more as well.There is only one crucial drawback and that is the hours are just too long. Working  hours every single day and coming in on weekends once a month it feels like a struggle to have much of a life outside my job. Ive often considered switching over to design for that fact alone. Working hrs a week would feel like vacation compared to my current schedule.,civilengineering,de090ad,1,t5_2qo8j

Ive known people who have managed it but they all went to school in America or married someone here. I dont think that applying while you are outside of the country is viable.Larger international companies like CDM Veolia Black and Veatch or Siemens probably all have branches in Australia. If you can establish yourself at one of them then I imagine transitioning to one of their American offices would be relatively easy.I wish it werent this way.

I was Project Managing a highways realignment scheme and my  years experience senior engineer insisted I did all the design by hand before people forget how to do things the old ways I still have all the drawings was allowed to keep the originals after as builts were issued.

11226927,0,t3_608esb,Avoid if you can build a separate garage or an attic instead.In our last project a substation with the first floor only open column layout the water table was  feet below foundations but we still added pumping external drainage well because the water table can change  feet and maybe more.It could be possible to use bitumen cladding on outer concrete surfaces to keep it dry but I would not spend my lives savings on that as Pumping is an active system it will cost during use and it will deteriorate with time failing at some point. Constant pumping also draws clay out of the soil with settlement or sinkholes after time.  Concrete cracks from its chemical reactions shrinksexpands with normal temperature variations and it absorbs water like a sponge.  Any differences in vapor pressures or temperature causes moisture diffusion and efflorescence osteoporosis which in turn can compromise bitumen tightness.  You also have ambient moisture that will condensate on or in a colder basement wall. Especially if it cant evaporate outwards due to the bitumen. Any wood in contact with the concrete will mold often fixed by a bitumen strip. A damp funky basement might be ok for some and the osteoporosis is only visible after  years when contractor responsibility ends where Im from.,civilengineering,df4k33n,3,t5_2qo8j

11416657,0,t3_62ye80,A caveat civil engineering is a very broad field. I focus on water and wastewater treatment. Someone who designs port infrastructure might have very different experiences.gt Is this field growing enough so that theres room for someone like me?The world will always have room for good engineers. gt Are too many or too few people entering this profession?Ive seen demand for qualified water and wastewater engineers. A lot of folks in my field started their careers just after the  Clean Water Act and they are all retiring now. There are a lot of big shoes to fill.gt What developments on the horizon could affect future opportunities?Civil engineering is tied to the broader economy. When money gets tight then companies and municipalities stop building. Specific legislature like President Trumps wall can also boost or diminish project potential.gt This industry has changed dramatically in the past five years. What have you seen from inside your company? Where do you think the changes will happen in the next five years?Regulations design software and construction methods all shift slightly but I would not expect the earthshaking changes of computer science or biotech.gt How frequently do layoffs occur? How does it affect employees morale?It depends a lot on the company. Some fire their least productive  percent every year but that would be atypical. Engineering consulting companys main asset is their talent pool. Some will risk insolvency before letting anyone go. The  recession was a bad time for a lot of consultants. Even the most protective might have been forced to cut back then. gt Who are the most important people in the industry today locally and internationally?Civil engineering doesnt really have paragons like Steve Jobs or Elon Musk. Most people only ever notice when engineering projects that go wrong. Unfortunately that means that the best engineers quietly produce excellence without notice. There are still chances for recognition but it is mostly limited other engineers and clients who are smart enough to recognize a job well done.,civilengineering,dfq2elr,4,t5_2qo8j
