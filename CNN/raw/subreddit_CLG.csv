That is not what I want. What I want is to see CLG having fun as a  man team in a games.So here is what I propose. uhotshotgg or uSaycean can you have the guys stream the team playing  man games? Does not have to be ranked could be normals if queue times are an issue.The guys would not play their roles this way no strats or champ secrets would be outed. I would be interested in seeingSupport SeraphADC LinkEXXTREME SHINERGY!Double as jungle he can work on map awarenessAphro mid beast ahri incDexter topFor CLG they would get viewers... you know this is true.For fans we can see the guys play as  in a setting where we can listen to how they talk to each other.

A game is planned over all the possibilities and scenarios that can and will happen as soon as  people set foot on Summoners Rift. Maybe DL didnt need to use his ult as much or his ult didnt impact the game as much this time around but rest assured that for the comp they were running Sivir was the best pick they could have.Maybe CoL didnt have as many fight opportunities because they knew that if they engaged they would be placed in a bad position because DL could ult the team out of there and reorganize giving CLG the advantage.

Was not worth. Teams not only CLG seem to make this mistake of putting Baron on the pedestal. Just because you are ahead doesnt mean you should give the enemy a  smite steal opportunity.

Holy god the derp is strong downsyndromeokay thanks for clearing that up youre either a hotshot  year old or just unable to have a real conversation with someone with a different point of view from you. good ad hominem fallacy though.Against my better judgment Ill continue to try to explain.A teams skill level and their performance over a short period are two different things. One is the average performance over many games and the other is the average performance over a few games. This is like a batters batting average versus their performance for one or two games or a golfers handicap versus their round score. One is long term the other is short. If I am a golfer and have a very low handicap thats a good thing but I play three terrible rounds that does not mean I am now a high handicap golfer or a bad player It just means I had a few bad rounds. In fact my handicap doesnt change. Now if this behaviour continues for more than a few rounds then my handicap will likely drop and it is fair to say that my skill has declined or Im doing something wrong that makes me a worse golfer. Im saying CLGs poor performance over a short term doesnt make them a bad team just as a few bad rounds doesnt make you a bad golfer. A slump is exactly that just a slump and until it becomes the new norm it isnt necessarily an indication a team is bad. You can disagree with that but I think thats a foolish and naive point of view. Any time a team loses more than one or two games they are now a bad team. Its a very bandwagoney way of looking at things.,CLG,cjllx3i,1,t5_2v76v

This team went from first to possibly relegated in a split. Coaching is about more than knowledge it is about management. Also they seemed very underprepared for this match.

Reginald back in the day comes to mind if Link cannot fulfill this roll I think Dexter or even Aphro should.

Ive been a participant and a coach in a bunch of different situations.  Some sports and some as an IT or a instructor. Its completely different for each one. A coach has to be able to convey that knowledge well and hold their attention. If the coach isnt conveying the information correctly the players wont use it well. A player has to be able to use said information and continue to adapt it on a moments notice. The roles are completely different and a great player wont always make a good coach. Same could be said for a coach not making a great player. Theres an older saying that says those who cant  manage those who can. That rule applies to coaching.

2287432,0,t3_2lg1cj,I mean from videos I saw at the beginning of Niens time on CLG he tried his hardest to fit into the LinkAphroDoublelift trio but those three would just hang out with each other and he would always be left out of their jokes. Even during team wins Nien would always walk by himself while everyone else celebrated together. If you dont believe me look at the spring split vods. Like for fucks sake if you live with someone and your teammates with someone and you cant realize that he is becoming depressed from all the shit talk that Reddit gave him then what kind of friend are you. Like I dont think Im this amazing person but I sure as hell would have tried to offer some support to Nien if reddit people were shitting on him and he was feeling the pressure of being trying to live up to peoples expectations. But for some reason the teammates on CLG seemed surprised at him leaving which shows to me that they dont even know him as a person even from all that time he spent on the team. Why would anyone want to stay on a team like that? Of course Im sure I could be COMPLETELY wrong and maybe Kelby will write some response to this since he browses these forums often.

No unknown commodities no foreign players adjusting to a new country no role swaps no longdistance coach bringing unwanted negative attention to the team via a controversial talk show.  Just simple.  And the old guard already knows Zion and Xmithie from LCS and solo queue so theres probably a better chance of them all meshing well together than there was with Dexter and Seraph.The lack of flashy additions is fine.

There are a LOT of ADC and Mid players with multiple accounts in Challenger but fewer top laners and support players because its harder to climbcarry in those roles. So if you want to climb you play midadc and then there are fewer topsupports.Additionally like you mentioned if you want to climb as a toplaner you can play offmeta champs like Riven that dont prepare you for pro competition. ,CLG,cnkjxsx,1,t5_2v76v

3066104,0,t3_2v9t9f,Xmithie does a lot of really low key things that other junglers dont do very well at all like helping laners establish wave control and being  in the perfect place exactly when hes needed consistently.  For most teams if the top laner has the wave pushing away in a v they have to go roam around the jungle for a bit maybe try a predictable gank mid.  With CLG Xmithie shows up right on time to push the wave all the way to tower and get it pushing back in CLGs favor.  Also youll notice that CLG pretty much never has their laners get ganked successfully either because of Xmithie being there for the countergank or having helped establish great vision although CLG has great wards in general and it cant all be chalked up to Xmithie.  Dexter always tried to get the team ahead via straight up ganks alone but I think Xmithies style is harder to play against and much more cerebral which is why its working out great for CLG along with their great lanes.,CLG,cofsr5w,3,t5_2v76v

I dont know how you consider Vayne to be a bad mannered pick.  She is a tank buster.  The Jax pick was more off meta but they probably knew they had a backup game if they lost and thought they could get enough farm onto the Jax to win.  Impact played really well.

Ill admit that I thought Xmithie would be an attitude upgrade from Dexter and I was wrong about that.  I like Link and Xmithie as people by the way. I watched every game and hoped and supported them like a fan should.  But right now in the face of the fifth consecutive letdown is the time to make a big fucking deal out of this.  Link and Xmithie need replaced if at all possible.  HSGG following Incarnation is really encouraging.I just dont know who to bring in for jungle.  I liked the suggestions of bringing Dexter back.  Without Seraph and Link I think he could work with Doublelift despite any personalityattitude differences.  Also keeping Scarra and Zikz and Mattcom and keeping this positive team environment is a must.  It would probably help keep everyone off tilt.And if he cant work with Doublelift... Im not sure DL is the dealbreaker he was two seasons ago.  Hes still a great player but is it worth keeping your team from being a solid contestant for  NA?,CLG,cq1wzca,4,t5_2v76v

They literally were the best team NA until they THREW SO HARD against TSM. And then in the playoffs where their biggest fear was to be horrible and lose instantly and they did that.

Reason CT tends to win more rounds is because Ts can come from up to  in rare cases like season  directions in on a site while CTs can stand in at least  different spots.  a lot more for the Ts to clear and not much time to do it.

3811980,0,t3_33zmi9,Honestly though isnt it tougher to put up more consistent numbers when you are playing champions that dont really highlight your actual amount of skill or playstyle. For example Seraph mentioned when he joined CLG the meta wasnt in his favor and that it is much more appropriate for him now It showed in the TDK matches. Bjerg said in an interview himself that he feels Pobelter is a really solid mid laner but he can never get the v because they always put Pobelter on a champion that doesnt fit the match up. He has outplayed Bjerg in an LCS game before too. Considering environment is a big part aswell maybe Pobelter was quietly unsatisfied with his. How many Winterfox productions involving the team did he appear in? In comparison to link i think hes a upgrade. He gets along with  of CLGs current roster members On Stream. He performs better from a Ladder perspective deeper Champion pool more flexible and offers more Potential.TLDR Pobelter hasnt had the resources to shine. Maybe he was emotionally was discouraged because of his environment and it impacted his gameplay. In comparison IMO hes a better player than Link. ,CLG,cqqsolc,1,t5_2v76v

The NA csgo organizations are playing catchup to EU and if CLG goes and puts similar infrastructure and support into the csgo team as they do with the lol team they will put themselves in a position to skyrocket to the top of NA while everyone else scrambles for a year or more to catch up. On top of that it makes themselves the most desirable place to play regarding free agent talent both in NA and in EU. Another bonus might be the potential to quickly catch and maybe pass the EU scene or at least be highly competitive as well which would be huge for the org as a whole regarding visibility from the perspective of sponsors. Top teams pull more sponsorship dollars and win more prize money. Both of which are good for business. ,CLG,cqua5ng,2,t5_2v76v

CLG has become the laughing stock of the community for failing to deliver on the expectations set by the ORGANIZATION over the course of multiple seasons. People are here to find out whats going on. When they do not find any news they speculate. Because that is what you do when you are interested in something but you have no information to work with. Where is the promised transparency? Lack of transparency is an indication of lack of responsibility and accountability. If you dont tell me whats going on I cant hold you responsible when shit hits the fan. ,CLG,cqv1anc,9,t5_2v76v

Even if they are born out of passion and love for the team they are still destructive.I see CLGs hard efforts crumbling apart in their playoffs curse and I want to strengthen their backs not show them disappointment or anger.Dont you think CLG wants to win too? I dont consider you a lesser fan... as said this frustration comes from passion but I would really like fans to take the disappointment with CLG helping them rather than blaming them and putting even more pressure on them than they already feel.,CLG,cqv1fdo,-1,t5_2v76v

4077885,0,t1_crkq4bc,I said this at the end of the split...and also got upvoted hehehehe. But people kept saying it was choking. Its not choking ms. They started to fall off at the end of the regular season exactly when the meta shifted to Cinderhulk. Xmithie kept playing Vi Lee sin and Nidalee and these kindsa champions and they just failed miserably to team fight in a meta marked by heavy team fighting. They only actually choked in the third game against TL. That was a tilted team.  Loved your analysis man.EDITI guess that this fate of falling off at the end of the split contributes somehow to this fall. I mean they are doing great so they think this is the split were going to win just keep playing like weve been playing and this ends up blinding them to the fact that this is not the optimal way to play anymore so this insecurity of changing what is going well ends up costing the whole split.

When they tried to steal blue after that won teamfight was when things went really downhill IMO though we were always on the back foot this game.  Overall Im pleased with their ability to stay in the game for as long as they did without a gold lead.    ,CLG,crz2xk3,1,t5_2v76v
4203608,0,t1_crytehv,There is no way he could have camped Rush Hour when Reksai wasnt showing anywhere. I know people have been slamming both junglers early game pressure as they were on two early game champs but the fact that Reksai wasnt showing in any lane meant that Lee Sin couldnt really gank for fear that Reksai would show up. Especially since TSM had every lane pushed up. Lee Sin was honestly just a horrible pick into Reksai almost any other pick would have been much much better Vi Sejuani.,CLG,crzeh2c,1,t5_2v76v

Apollo single handily threw the nd game dying at turret with baron buff.  Their coaching staff forced Impact to play tanks and couldnt carry as hard.  Would be interesting to see what would happen if Impact played carry top instead of MaokaiShen.  Glad the team played really well over the series.  Every one stepped up.

He wouldve had another trophy to put in his trophy case.,CLG,cue7gcf,1,t5_2v76v

4918983,0,t1_cuek4hk,It could just be a movie about this year mainly focusing on Doublelift.  Movie opens with CLG down  against Curse Academy.  Doublelift feeling the pressure with the rest of the team.  Miracle reverse sweep to stay in the LCS but still a broken team and a broken man.  Then it goes into a small montage of a hyped man whos made the big plays but never won anything.  Fast forwards to the beginning of spring split.  We picked up an inhouse coach and a new top laner.  Doublelift has this super strong spring season coming in early only to feel the pain again of losing in the first round of playoffs.  Doublelifts failings continue.  Having lost for  years with nothing to show for he really has no energy to keep going.  Hotshot pulls all the punches and finds this young dude with a degree and knowledge in coaching.  He starts with telling Doublelift some Shia laBeouf level peptalk telling him hell make him into a championnot letting his dreams be memes.  Doublelift although reluctant decides to give it one last shot.  The movie journeys through the season and into playoffs.  I think you get the idea.  TLDR His story would make a bad ass fucking movie.,CLG,cuekr53,38,t5_2v76v

4949035,0,t3_3iouzl,The criticism that he gives on CLGs performance is well deserved and will help them improve greatly if they can patch up their mistakes. However stop taking Montes info as if he is some sort of genius on all of the regions. Monte grossly overrates Korea as a region and does not give the same sort of criticism to Korea as he would to a team in NA or CH because its always the other team playing like shit in NA and never a team actually being good in NA. I would have loved to see someone like Kelsey in this episode of SI and I guaranteed Monte would have looked like an idiot from the things I heard him say about the Chinese scene. Granted NA and EU teams arent on par with top Chinese and Korean teams but every time NA is brought up he immediately says NA is just soooo bad it doesnt even matter. Like how can you even say something like this without ever backing up any of your statements or knowing how regions will compare without international experience which a team like CLG has not had for a long time. Every time playoffs come up he just rants on about how good TL is and they threw but you know what ever think that maybe TSM is the better team Also constantly talks about how CLG took too long to close and they stalled out insanely hard by not knowing what to do when in reality nearly each game was around  min and pretty much a stomp so dont know what game he was watching.Monte is a great analyst FOR KOREA but honestly his opinions on most other regions are pretty worthless and you should look towards other experts for that sort of info. He seems to think that the best way to play is the way that Korea plays and any other playstyle is wrong which is extremely narrow minded he never gives credit where it is due when it comes to other regions. Regardless of whatever the fuck he said doesnt really matter CLG is not suddenly going to win worlds because they won NA but the definitely are a competitive team that has a great early game dont know why Monte called it shit lol and can compete with the top teams with if they adapt well to the new patch which is surprisingly good for CLG. If you ever actually want to learn about the Chinese teams go watch China talk or follow someone like Kelsey and you will learn far more than watch you did on Summoning Insight SI is for entertainment as far as im concerned and nothing more.,CLG,cuid6rp,8,t5_2v76v

5166417,0,t3_3lpwre,All teams are required to have one sub per the rule. Theyve had issues in the past where teams had to forfeit due to no sub so well be obligated to find someone. This rule is just for emergency purposes as a large number of teams would never use their sub. We can probably find someone from CLG Black to come be the fill if thats what we need. Theres no rule that owners cant be subs though so its possible we just write Hotshot as a technicality. We wouldnt actually expect to sub anyone it would be only for emergencies anyways.As per who is allowed to be a sub theres no ruling on who can and cant be a sub at least not on the Worlds rule page. They did however list that the coach cannot be a player or ownermanager and can be the manager only in the case that the team does not have a coach. The last clause is just to avoid punishing IWC teams that dont have a coach since every team in the four major regions have a coach.,CLG,cv8qsym,2,t5_2v76v

Losing their team doesnt mean anything for a team like TSM it also mean they have a room to grow they might go for Rush and this case i dont think tsm is weaker than clg ill consider them stronger than clg. I dont think our infrastructure is better than tsm at all.Having more authority doesnt necessarily make you a better coach.Im not saying ZionSpartan is going to change team or thinking of changing team or anything  but in his case if tsm is really interested theres no reason for him to not think about it  also having the chance to play with Rush and Bjergsen is an another factor.,CLG,cwb1fts,1,t5_2v76v

5558771,0,t3_3r9ev0,I think what may have happened was due to Chris getting fired. Im guessing that after Chris left and scrims started again for IEM San Jose there was no one there to keep Doublelift in check.

5597061,0,t3_3rqjki,What I feel the worst about is that we were finally the better team. Like winning MSG  was the perfect retribution for all those years of suffering I didnt even care for the fail at worlds it was our first worlds and all NA failed so it was kind of expected. And suddenly we are now perceived like a shitty team who dont care about their players. Like all the work of last season was all for nothing. It really sucks reading in the lol subreddit how it is better for doublelift to be in tsm as it is a better team and aphromoo is saving him I know it is just a meme but still hurts. Well that better team just got  at MSG finals and had to dump all their rostercoaching staff because they werent working.People act like CLG is the worst organization when all the releases in the offseason were well justified Chris had the breach of trust even he agreed that he had to leave because he fucked up. Pobelter had the Huhi situation which was perfectly understandable. Doublelift is debatable but if Aphro took this decision he knows better than all of us and it may really be better for the team. They even tried the best to lead him to another team and I think it was just bad PR and lack of agreement with doublelift so both parties didnt have to cause all this drama.Honestly the worst of all of this is both Zion and Aphro not being sure if they will stay. The whole Zion applied to TSM and Aphro is considering other options is what makes people think well if everyone is leaving is because there is some shitty situation going on why would they leave the team that took them to st place last split. All of this after stating they were now actually feeling as a real team and they were on the same page. This is why I feel betrayed as a CLG fan seeing how my favorite team after finally doing things right is seen as falling apart and with no assurance that things will be alright. I will still support the team as I dont think theyve done wrong decisions I love the history of the team and I cant really support TSM. But I think we as fans need some type of videovlogetc that hype us and tell us things will be alright like we need Captain Aphro to grab the CLG flag and say CLG FANS WE ARE ALRIGHT AND WE WILL WIN or idkSorry for the wall of text I had to vent some frustration with this whole situation. And for people arguing what real fans are some people like the players some people like the history of the organization some people like the colors wtv.

We know Hotshot has his flaws he can get worked up and exaggerate stuff.

However Doublelift also slumped for a season and then stepped it back up this year so its not unreasonable to assume Turtle could do the same.My only issue with Turtle personally is that we have seen him on the world stage when he was at his best and he was pretty average there.  I am optimistic that he can get back to being at least top  in NA next year with the right support and coaching plus a change of environment may help with that anyway.

You obviously know nothing about Counter Strike and this team so why are you acting like you do? They are invited to LANs that no team with a better record than them in their league is invited to simply because they are CLG.

5720093,0,t1_cx63t9b,Theres so many reasons why NAEU are still playing melee. The games mechanics are mostly why people still love to play it. Melee has a much higher skill ceiling than all other smash games. It has super fast paced gameplay and theres techniques specific to this game that are not in any other fighting games it was really revolutionary when it came out and is still amazing. The techniques such as wave dashing l canceling shffling etc are exclusive to melee. After seeing the game being played competitively nintendo mostly sakurai was highly against it because he wanted smash to be a fun party game to be played with friends and family and not something hyper competitive. So in brawl he took out alot of the things that made melee great and unique such as the advanced techniques. The game was made much slower and noob friendly so when top level players tried to transition to brawl they shortly after went back to melee because they thought the game was terrible. When smash  was coming out the esports scene was growing huge and they realized they shouldnt reject it entirely like they did with brawl so sakurai and nintendo tried to embrace the competitive side of smash bros while still keeping it casual so alot of the things about brawl that were absolutely terrible were fixed and smash  is a much better game than brawl but even so its still very similar to brawl and the techniques that melee had that were taken out from brawl werent added back in so alot of them still dont like the game or at least most dont like it as much as melee. In terms of balance Id say that smash  is the most balanced smash game right now because they are patching characters and nerfingbuffing them constantly. Brawl was stupidly broken. Melee isnt super balanced but because its competitive and the skill ceiling is so high theres all types of people pushing all the characters in the game to the limit so if youre better than someone but theyre using a better character than you youre still going to win  times out of . Melee is definitely the most interesting smash game to spectate and the game has been out for over a decade so theres so many players and rivalries and storylines which make it so enjoyable to see how tournaments unravel. The reason why Japan doesnt care about melee and is always playing the newly released games is because of the culture there smash  is new so theyre playing it and trying to be good at it. They are very good at smash  but NAs top players still beat the top Japanese players but its still very competitive. Japan doesnt play many computer games and are still very much in the arcadeconsole days and they will always hop onto the new fighting game that comes out and all their friends will try to be the best at it for example Tekken  Street fighter  Pokken tournament blazblue guilty gear etc. Once a game gets old the reason to play it gets thrown out of the window and they move onto the new game. I hope thats a decent explanation sorry for wall of text amp lack of formatting.  ,CLG,cx64tuw,3,t5_2v76v

I remember when CLG got Pob the next SI they were just saying that it was an upgrade but it wasnt nothing big and they said that people should just stop believing that CLG was gonna win the split with that roster cuz it was very unlikely and we remember what happened.To be honest I think Monte is a really smart person but him and Thoorin actually doesnt have many information about CLG right now they both even say they didnt see huhi play yet but they just assume hes bad so I still think we should wait and see what CLG does in IEMAbout the name is prob Forgiven but Ive been having second thoughts on him in CLG. Even though I dont think hes a toxic teammate I think hes still has a strong personality and thats not really coachable which doesnt fit with the CLG objectives especially with ziks as a coach who doesnt seems like the guy who will get a player with a big ego and put him in the line.

6580432,0,t3_45t78q,WHAT THE FUCK was that Ashe pick???  Terrible PampB.  TSM is weak and CLG got crushed by them!!!!Kalista and Graves are hard to hit with binds with their jumpsdash I think that Janna or Soraka wouldve been solid picks to mitigate the burst.  Doublelift and Sneaky have said Ashe was shit so Im inclined to believe that to be true.  Any of TSMs champ can destroy an ADC without a gap closer.  Pretty much at any time Graves presses R on Ashe shed lose about half her hp so you need to address that.  Pick a different ADC or a different support.  Also all TSM has been playing was Kalista  Alistar you need to find a proper matchup.  Furthermore I think Ashe should build BT not Essence Reaver because Ashe is so fragile and needs to compensate with some durability.  IE on Ashe first item if doing well BT if you are evenweaker imo.  Essence Reaver is theoretically good with manacdr but I dont think the fights are long enough for you to benefit from it.

Granted some of this criticism is valid however aphro knows the atmosphere and mentorship wasnt there for them. Aphro has slowly been building CLG into a true team. Where atmosphere and motivating each other are key. Aphro is basically saying Look guys we had two rookies and we grew them into good players Im sorry I was too late in creating the team I wanted.

7294088,1,t1_d27790j,it was a passive aggressive dig at DL after he lost a very close Bo and was humbled. You go from DL CLG made the right decision... they outplayed us mechanically in every role... We knew they would be good but thaaat good.. to Aphromoo just shitting on DL after the team won and it changed the narrative completely. Even if you believe that  of the blame is on DL and that hotshot is god Aphro should have kept his mouth shut as it was neither the time nor the place to fire shots at DL. umangaguy said it better than me below so Ill just quote him heregtI think its dumb because it overshadows the expected and justified kudos CLG deserves for their victory.gtWhy dredge up the laid to rest argument about Dlift being a cancer when you already won the split and proved haters wrong? Let it go. Praise your teammates. Share in the victory. Prepare for MSI. Instead you turn a lot of people off and reopen a fault line in the League of legends community and the CLG fan community by bringing up that high school level drama again.gtWhat is he going to do a Reflections like Hotshot too?

7735230,0,t3_4l8wtd,I think i have some good things to say would consider myself a VERY early fan of CLG preCLG when they were on mousespaz. Probably one of the few who started off as CLG CSGO fans and transitioned into a LoL fan and such.I like all of the players on CLG they all have amazing personalities are friendly etc at least what Ive seen over the years from streams interviews etc. However I was never fully confident in the team. No matter who they played I was always nervous about the outcome. They seem to play exactly at the level of their opponents except recently where they just lose to everyone as it seems.If this team truly wants to be a world contender I would present the following build around JDM and Tarik let Hazed and Cutler go. The former two have shown to be world class players on numerous occasions but I feel that the latter two always fall short. If pita is calling then what exactly is the point of Cutler right now? And Hazed has NEVER been a consistent player as far as I can remember. Frankly at this point I would let Cutler and Hazed go.Now comes who do you replace them and FugLy with? Im just gonna name some people who I see on the Stier ESEA list who are teamlesson a lowerlevel team and go from theredesiIm not joking thats all I see. And anyone who knows stuff about NA CS knows that desi has a longstanding history of attitude problems. At this point I would be hopeful of a LiquidCLG shuffle and the following team would come out on CLGs side nitro elige hiko jdm tarik. ,CLG,d3lfvdp,1,t5_2v76v

7916124,1,t1_d45l3p2,So what? Everyone knows that TL is a relegation zone material. That doesnt mean that Piglet isnt better than Stixxay which he is. The amount of delusion is absolutely insane on your subreddit CLG fans.,CLG,d45uigw,0,t5_2v76v
7925122,0,t1_d46rmg2,Youre not wrong but I would say mid lane has the highest impact in the game its just how the game is designed.  If youre behind in jungle you can just hide in the jg for a bit and catch up in xp because thats how the xp mechanics work in the jg plus the jg isnt going to kill you.  You cant really hide from the enemy mid laner.  Mid is the role where theres a lot of versatility you can put a support a control mage or an assassin mid.,CLG,d46uxea,3,t5_2v76v
7925917,0,t3_4nssou,Ok I just watched the two games.  I think people are overreacting because of the loss.  Huhi got dicked on all of game  but he got camped by Meteos.  Huhi just has to use his claw better this can be resolved easily.  He also shouldve flashed right as Meteos flashed then activate his claw.  C knows that Huhi is weak so camping him is the correct play.  Game  was close by the  min mark they group up v for the first time and come out even trading  deaths.  So imo it wasnt that bad.  It just snowballed afterwards.  Huhi is getting a lot of blame but as I look at the greater picture bot lane playing healing supports and top lane wet noodle slap fest nobody else stepped up to carry the game.  They snowballed mid and won the game.Stixxay and Xmithie did fine I have no comments for them.  Darshan just needs to extend a bit less and get caught.  All opposing teams of CLG know that all they have to do for top lane is to play passive and not let Darshan get ahead if you go even you will probably beat CLG thats what C did Top laners vs. Darshan just have to not die.  They HAVE to play passive because they know Xmithie will camp top so if you play play like a pussy you will go even.  In regards to Aphro he needs to stop playing Braum I love you Aphro but your Braum sucks.  Aphro needs to stick with Bard  Ali playing Morgana  Zyra are probably good picks as well.  Since CLG picked Sivir I feel like they shouldve ran Nami  Bard  Morg  Karma as supports.  Nami  Karma for speed boost catches the Koreans first used Nami for this reason Bard  Morg to run them down and cc pick kill same idea.  People are using sustain supports but guess whats OP and can create pressure vs. healing?  Zyra poke with Morellos is a good idea.  My opinion is that Aphro excels at picks that he should continue to do so if bot lane plays sustain lanes then they wont get ahead both bot lanes will only go EVEN.  So you can either play sustain vs. sustain or hard engage vs. sustain or poke vs. sustain are all options but the latter  options are best for Aphro.  I wish to add that if Huhi is struggling on Lissandra Lux Lulu Zilean maybe Zed  LB? are available options.  Assassins have always been good at picking off healers because theyre squishy.,CLG,d46y55h,1,t5_2v76v
7927379,0,t3_4nt2u9,I feel like the last  months get represented badly in this recent light of CLG fananalysis. Huhi had always problems but laning was always ok. He stayed mostly even in cs even tho being outmatched. The bigger problem were his individual fuck ups in midgame.Plus saying that Stixxay was mediocre in the playoffs is not even remotely true. I am a big time Stixxay down talker but he was integral for the playoff run. ,CLG,d4741lr,3,t5_2v76v

8021923,0,t1_d4hpxwb,OR CLG is a team where all of the pieces form something greater than any individual piece along with SKT heavily underperforming at MSI  losses in a row? Teams can hardly find a way to beat them now in LCK and RNG having to face SKT in the first round due to seeding. Sure CLG did great but MSI was NOT worlds and who knows maybe if CLG had a top tier midlaner they may have done even better. The point is now that their macro isnt so far ahead of other teams they have to try to beat those teams in lane and in team fights which they clearly arent able to do against teams with straight up better lineups. ,CLG,d4hqmv3,-2,t5_2v76v

8439434,0,t1_d5wgftc,Admittedly I was not following LoL until formation of LCS and so Im unfamiliar with the role the old players played in CLG. If a lot of people think some other players need to be added I can definitely add them in. I know for example I added Chaox and TRM to the TSM poll although Chaox was only a starter for  week in the LCS and TRM left before that.As for context although the rosters are from S the players on the poll should be judged taking into account their entire time on the team even if it was before the time of LCS.,CLG,d5wgv6d,1,t5_2v76v
8444494,0,t1_d5wnw9t,Yeah I think Chauster once pointed out that Jiji realized about smart casting at one point and started solely using it. And not the one with range indicators just the basic smart cast. Chauster said that after that he missed a lot of skillshots. Also for some reason his laning phase became really bad. He became really passive. In his prime he played so much that he had three accounts in top  of solo queue. He was also the chillest player ever. And he had a bouncing rainbow sheep over his minimap in his stream. That was cool.,CLG,d5x3lof,3,t5_2v76v
8450065,0,t1_d5xsgs6,Yeah but thats the issue. TSM also always seem to turn it up during playoffs...    Yet theyve already turned it up this whole season. TSM are the very heavy favorites and theres going to be so much shit thrown at CLG especially since TSM have been waiting one half of an entire season to shit on us for the roster swaps.    Edit Though if NVAPX somehow beat C they have two whole weeks to get their shit together! Id just fucking orgasm or something because my hope would be completely fulfilled. ,CLG,d5xsmdy,9,t5_2v76v
8458868,0,t1_d5yvh7h,The big difference was though that they had the raw talentskill but no synergy. As soon as that part came together TSM dominated. Part of the reason CLG looked so strong was because many rosters in the LCS had little to no synergy yet. Thats why impeccable synergy could beat out teams with more mechanical abilities. This split all the other teams caught up and CLGs team play doesnt seem to be enough. Not to mention the meta is shifting towards promoting laning at least by play offs. Long story short you cant really compare to TSMs play off buff to CLGs potential improvement unless every other team suddenly loses all their synergy and CLGs laners become mechanical gods in the next  weeks.  ,CLG,d5yw5t4,19,t5_2v76v

8569918,0,t3_4x5g24,Its just the bias. The best team always has the best player in every position. IMT was the same when they were consired . At least Sven didnt make it. Im not even sure hes top . Its hard to tell he never has to carry the team and gets big advantage because he can invade and steal buff whenver he wants. All his lanes can follow up well and they dive often. They make his job easy. I think Reignover and Xmithie are way better. They make or break their team. TSM could easily get over Sven sucking dicks. Hauntzer is a bit overrated. Biofrost is overrated as fuck but I dont base my opinion from this because Aphromoo wasnt good this split. But Biofrost won by default and some actually think hes legit the best which is laughable. I have to say I dont think Aphroo played better this split I still think hes the best overall by a wide margin. CLG sucked ass for too long sadly.,CLG,d6ctkj2,-6,t5_2v76v

8667081,0,t1_d6oye13,Hi there I just did not understand about being biased but now I do thanks for clearing it up  The reason I state its arguable is because it really is arguable that BioFrost is better for example he was put on the NA team instead of Aphro. I dont agree with that and I believe Aphro is better and offers more as a support but it is necessary for me to give credit to others opinions as it is extremely popular. For the others barely anyone is saying Darshan is better than Hauntzer Huhi is better than Bjerg Xmithie is better than Sven Stixxay is better than DL. thats why I say my opinions with such confidence. Ofcourse the CLG players are not bad by any means. you are right about Stixxay I should have mentioned that he has very good team fighting but I do not think it to be better than DLs. The reason I mentioned the huhi kamikaze part is because that is what happens huhi is most oftenly focused in teamfights and Stixxay is allowed to deal damage freely. In regards to the Sven part I feel like a do a good job of explaining why the matchup tilts towards Sven as his laners help him take over the game while xmithie is the solid player that helps his team get ahead. I really do appreciate your comments and I will try better in the future to produce better content that showcases both sides. I still have a lot to improve so thank you for your criticism.

If you want to make Huhi the point of it we can talk about how much Huhi himself improved as he did as so many people outside of this subreddit have attested to. And yes basically the whole team struggled doesnt change the point that Huhi and Darshan stuck out the most about it.Im genuinely not here to argue or bicker with anyone here. We all love CLG. Im willing to bet an extremely low portion of the people here are the TSM trolls that people are always complaining about.

What I can tell you about Darshan though is that he is working his ass off in Korea to make sure that he is playing to the best of his ability. Look at how many solo queue games the guy has in Korea and then factor in all the scrims that hes played. The amount of work that hes been putting in is insane. Hes been on that grind ever since they got to Korea. And thats why I got faith in my boy Darshan and the rest of CLG.,CLG,d7owpz0,8,t5_2v76v

11551685,0,t1_dg55vi5,Im on mobile and were splitting hairs soon butRumble ban was to eliminate the possibility of AD mid. That said Zikz didnt ban Eve after Elise for some reason big draft oversight allowing for the talon pick that fits Hai playstyle.CLG picked bot purely for lane and it worked barely. Not the greatest of picks but I can understand the teams choice considering Stixxay is one of our star players and he may have wanted it for a variety of reasons.Ultimately I think CLGs game  draft is better not because its a great draft but because they have more clear win conditions at the end of the game. The Renekton pick wouldnt have been influential if Darshan kept splitting and eventually Huhi could outsplit talon as well or play waveclear duty with the team. There are definitely things to be questioned about the  part of the  like the Graves insistence not even win rate but yeah. ,CLG,dg5dxp9,1,t5_2v76v

11637797,0,t1_dgernm9,we lost  games against FQ in a row which could possible indicate that our first  wins are based on their bad early gamenerve. TSM never play blow their shape too much which is one of the best feature a team can have consistency the most thing that CLG needed. If you were to use the assumption that we lost only because we fked up you can not deny the counter argument that FQ lost the first  game only because they fked up and they are still the far better team since they COULD HAVE won  against CLG. I think that is what he tried to make you cant base your prediction on what COULD HAVE happened but rather only on what Happened. ,CLG,dgf5oaw,8,t5_2v76v

This isnt the same when we called him to be benched wthe sej games. In those games he missed his ulties but he still DID something.

11802874,0,t1_dgxs8ld,gt Aphro and xmithie were top  in their roles going into worlds across all regions xmithie prob top  for a non carry oriented jungler if you look at summer and how effective plz dont think im trolling he was that good were by far the worst performers or at least the most inconsistent aphro going  on mf support in multiple games questioned if aphro was literally trolling the first  weeks.  Aphro shitting the bed wasnt that surprising if you really paid attention to his play in Summer. He was on a slow decline since MSI and if he was in the top  going into worlds it was in the low placings or they put him up higher just because of his name.   Agreed with your player expectations though. gt I think at our best we can finish  easily  Definitely wont be easy. Dont forget that DL is returning to TSM and if no disasters happen with that team well be seeing the same TSM we saw last year in Summer. Even if we were at our peak Id give it  to TSM. Those guys are legitimately so good with very little weaknesses to exploit. I still think we can pull out a split win but it will be so fucking hard to get over that hurdle. ,CLG,dgxwalr,10,t5_2v76v
