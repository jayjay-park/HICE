1819821,0,t3_2f9wpy,Fat does not equal Unhealthy is only one part of that movement and understandably the part that is most heavily criticized. However whether or not being fat is unhealthy should have no bearing on your question if youre only talking about losing weight for vanity reasons.The most important take away from the fatacceptance movement is in my mind that you should try not to be prejudiced against people who do not confirm to the beauty standards of society. Losing weight for no reason other than conforming to those standards does put you at risk of perpetuating them but I would not say that it is inherently fatphobic. The goal is to be accepting of all body types and appearances after all. It is when you start expecting others to conform to your standards and treat those who do not badly that it becomes fatphobic. Whether you believe obesity is a matter of lifestyle or genetics and whether or not you believe it is unhealthy or not really should not matter all that much as long as you try not to be prejudiced against those who are.,SRSQuestions,ck8h2eb,2,t5_2tduo

And do you really think its necessary to hear from all sides?That said ranarchism has a general conensus of being social justice oriented and feminist but theyre a lot slower to banremove people who arent so there are often good discussions there.,SRSQuestions,clt9kw2,3,t5_2tduo
2424257,0,t1_cmb62bw,I probably mischaracterized my views on the whole basilisk thing. And I did primarily read the RationalWiki treatment as you mentioned but saw far more of an affectionate treatment of LW than the entities they really hate there. Reading between the lines I feel I got a pretty good view of things. I mainly find it pretty fascinating that a series of such localized interests and particular ways of talking about things could intersect so perfectly into an idea like that which ends up having so much more meaning for one group of people than anybody else could possibly fathom. Im sure most people just viewed that as a thought experiment which mapped pretty well onto their interests and background Like any other community there were probably a vast majority of people who merely found that idea interesting a smaller number who found it inextricably ideologically wound up in themselves so much they were unable to really consider the idea as just an idea in the way that followers of various schools of philosophy might latch onto particular ideas which seem innocuous to you or me.The Yudkowsky thread you linked certainly makes that clearjust the way he seems to reason through the idea and the lexicon hes working with and the sway he clearly has within that community in setting the terms of the debate leads to a very odd and foreignfeeling discussion of something which when distilled down to its basic principles does end up feeling a lot like a thought targeted to irritate or enthrall people who process things in a certain way. Its like an extreme version of people on SRS who see something laypeople might regard as innocuous as pretty offensive or loaded in its meaning once youre a part of a particular discussion with a particular culture you just cant process things in the same way.Thanks for the discussion . Like TVTropes but in a very different way the LW community seems to represent the way that I muse to myself when alone thoroughly enough that Ill probably give it a deeper look. There are things to learn there and things to disagree with there and yes theres a little cult of personality there and a little ideological weirdness flitting about the seams as again the Yudkowsky thread you linked indicates. But Ive seen insular little ideological fiefdoms full of maniacs Conservapedia and this is nowhere near the top of that. I generally have very positive experiences and discussions with people influenced by LW and detect a lot more humility and genuine passion for knowledge than people who are superficially similar in terms of demographics and some viewpoints on Reddit so I could never really knock them even if really internalizing a lot of the beliefs of LW seem to distill into a worldview in which it seems more and more important to donate to Yudkowskys foundation which may or may not have any of the expertise or potential to gain the expertise to even get close to pursuing their goal.,SRSQuestions,cmbcgqj,5,t5_2tduo

These dudes will completely fucking ignore anything anyone says if that person is below the level of Manager or Sr. Manager. They will just pretend you dont exist and that they didnt hear what you said and will only speak to someone at the Manager level or above. Its like youre invisible.

6147894,0,t1_cyoeinq,gt Do you mean you were oppressed as a woman before you knew you were one?yes. at the very least i internalized misogyny to a huge degree even before i consciously labelled myself as a woman and looking back at my experience in childhood other people clearly treated me differently than boys.gt Do you mean not passing is dangerous?a large part of that is the consequences when people read us as trans but it goes beyond that as well. often in situations where we are readknown as trans or forced to disclose we need to convince people that we are actually women. consistently wearing feminine clothing having a feminine demeanor and dating men help immensely in various circumstances.that clip of Butler was helpful. thanks! it confirms what i have read elsewhere about it but i am still not comfortable saying i understand her ideas.,SRSQuestions,cyog963,2,t5_2tduo
6905016,0,t1_d0yzu48,Being sad even being depressed is okay. Suicidal ideation is not. If you are legitimately considering suicide because you feel betrayed by a tragic love story no matter how legitimate the betrayal you need to visit a health professional because you are not in a secure state of mind. Handwaving that suicidal ideation as a normal reaction is shitty and a betrayal to people with mental health issues.,SRSQuestions,d0z04dv,6,t5_2tduo
6962455,0,t3_47f7me,Absolutely. This is the same reason why faggot is such a bad word. I mean Louis CK has some funny bits with this word that I laugh at because its ingrained in my head a certain way. He even says that where he grew up in Boston it didnt mean gay. I had a similar experience where it meant something else. However as that cartoon stated insults work by associating something with something else badrepulsive. So even though you say neckbeard to mean sexist pig or faggot to mean douchebag another example those words are insulting because theyre tied to something else that you consider bad or that people considered bad when coming up with that insult.,SRSQuestions,d15j36d,3,t5_2tduo
