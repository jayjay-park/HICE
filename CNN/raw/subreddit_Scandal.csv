8371918,0,t1_d56hhfa,Agree! So many times in the show have they shown she has ZERO loyalty. She will have sex with Fitz or have one of those beautiful moments which I feel is what captivated a lot of people at first and then she will be easily seduced by Jake. She lets herself be touched and felt by him like nothing like he doesnt need any permission like if she was his. Not once has Olivia rejected an advance from Jake it is like she is incapable of resisting her sexual urge she is a slave to the . Some might say well Fitz was married but uhm.. Olivia was well aware of that and it is not like Fitz had sexual or any romantic relations with his wife. Married and all he was actually way more loyal to Olivia than Olivia has every had the grace of being to him. I know were past that and this last season has put Jake at center stage but just had to release that anger and to remind that she doesnt love anyone. Also after understanding Jakes life and traumas a little more thanks to season  details it breaks my heart Olivia ended the season abusing Jake like that ,Scandal,d5o1fyi,1,t5_2tigs

The show is boring without them point blank period. Whether u hate the couple or love them at least they give you something to talk about. When other ppl whove never seen this show reference it for we reason its always referred to as the show where the main character is in love with the president even though they havent been an item on the show in forever.
