He is tapping his foot on the floor repeatedly creating a beat of rhythmic annoyance. He looks up at the camera and runs his hand through his slightly wet hair.LA Fine. If you want to put either Jon or I in matches that have absolutely nothing to do with what we want. . . WHAT WE DESERVE!! Then feel free. Well destroy every single person you throw in our way! We WILL get whats ours by the end of this!He cracks his neck to one side and then begins tapping his fingers on the table to the same beat his foot is making.LA Terrible I know youre upset. I know you wish you and your beloved brother had won your match under other circumstances and you think that by putting yourself in this match with me somehow youll find a sort of redemption. Allow me to tell you a story my friend. In my entire career I have taken part in one singular hardcore match. I was in Japan taking on my most storied opponent Gousuke. We had been trading wins for over a year and the fans wanted a final decisive conclusion and answer to who the better man was. So we decided to give it to them. We fought for over an hour and if I were to shave my head you would be able to see some of the terrible reminders I have permanently etched onto me from that match. Now I didnt win that match but I did do one thing. I brought a man to his very limits. I hurt him in ways he had never been hurt before. I ended his career. Lucian smiles.LA You heard me right Terrible. The only time little old Lucian ever stepped into a hardcore match the other competitor never wrestled again. Keep that in mind when you prepare for House Party. If I was willing to do that to one of the only people in this business I ever respected what would I be willing to do to a jobber like you?Lucian stops tapping his foot and hand. He leans back in the chair.LA You want someone to tell you nice job out there? I dont think Ive ever heard someone compliment a man for being murdered before. Lucian chuckles.LA In time my luchadore friend. Fade to black,wrestlingisreddit,cnam8dj,1,t5_31cre

6703915,0,t3_47ebwp,Very quick review. NovaMcCarty was fine little formulaic but solid play by play between commentators. I felt Brodies promo was strong attacking fans is a good way to avoid Brusier BrodyBrock Lesnar face turn.To be honest DylanBuster didnt grab my attention as much as I wouldve liked. Is Dylan supposed to be a face? I didnt really know who I was supposed to rootsympathise. CreateAStable had a passable promo I guess. I find the NXTECW method of booking effective where everybody has a place a defined character and are booked well. Wouldnt mind debuting vs CAS Good heel work from Anchor. ArrowAppelbaum was short but effective I felt it was a little quick but that didnt hinder the match quality. .Man Clusterfuck truly lived up to the name. Result had interesting implications. Hwo amp Russ are guys I found myself intrigued by. I enjoyed the tag match. Mightve been my favourite of the night I really like The Warlords and thought the result was for the best but turning Warlords face might not be for the best.....unless a certain heel tag team soon debuted . Main Event was encouraging it showed each of the competitors better qualities Kaitlyns Power KSJs resiliency Fayes Opportunity Taking. Solid crowd work with the pissing contest at the expense of Faye. The result was the right one. Im probably going to get a lot of hate for being so nip picky and criticising the card. Dont take it personally Im hard to please and can be really judgy hence the ratings out of ten.Overall ,wrestlingisreddit,d0cqqy6,8,t5_31cre

The front door opens and Tyson Zamura dressed in a lovely white tshirt and white jeans walks in slightly ducking to clear the door frame. He throws his keys at the sink in the kitchen area and turns to face the camera.Zamura They said I needed to show everyone Im a regular guy or something...Apparently Ive acted like a total sociopath and its bad for PR and all that good shit.He makes his way into the living area as he sits down. He glances at the bong and quickly hides it under the table.Zamura Alright you can cut it just delete all that and well start from me on the couch.Cameraman Nah just keep going.Zamura No seriously you should probably just erase that part. Cameraman Why erase it?Zamura Theyre trying to make me look like a good dude and the first thing they see is drug paraphernalia? Seriously just cut that part out.Cameraman Alright fine well cut it.Zamura awkwardly stares at the camera for a few seconds while he digs through his pants pocket retrieving a crumpled piece of  paper and a pen. He mutters five four three two... under his breath and a smirk appears on his face.Zamura Whats up guys Im the Forest City Fiend Tyson Zamura! Get ready to open your third eye and let your soul flow free because youll be feeling the aura soon enough once I eliminate  other people fromTysons eyebrows furrow as he suddenly stops. His eyes glance slightly above camera staring at the operator behind it.Zamura Its a seventeen man battle royal? Seventeen? Not ten not fifteen not even twenty we got enough for seventeen?Cameraman Yeah its you and sixteen other people. Good job on the catchphrases by the way. Id say you need a few more.Zamura clicks his pen and starts writing on the paper.Zamura Alright so we got...Forest City Fiend...check...feel the aura...check. Alright thats two.Cameraman I mean open your third eye sounds pretty cool.Zamura I could market the shit out of that.Cameraman Totally. So I guess thats three?Zamura Three it is. Zamura throws the pen and paper on the messy table and looks into the camera grinning wide.Zamura See Eric Matthews I guess I made a mistake. I made the mistake of forgetting to put on my mask. Yknow the one that hides all my insecurities and tantrums? I guess when I dropped my finisher on both you AND Klondike for the win I exposed myself a little bit even if nobody saw any rods. So forgive me Im making a list of all my empty catchphrases. I want to get all my shit in but I guess you still dont know much about that do you Eric? I heard the crowd I heard them make their decision. And I still won. Do you really think in a ring with a bunch of other athletes who want me out that Im focused on what the fans think? If theres one thing you should know Eric is that I dont give a...Tyson pauses for a second pursing his lips and shaking his head. He reaches over to the table for a beer shaking a few empties before grabbing a full one. He sits back and takes a gulp.Zamura Im a giant. Im a fiend. And Im not going to let you pull that psychological bullshit on me. You lost a match get over it. The fact is Ive been jumped by groups of wrestlers before. Ive been sabotaged Ive been betrayed and I always come out on top. Ive done a hell of a lot worse for a hell of a lot less. And thats why Im the Forest City Fiend.Cameraman Do you want to tell the full story as to what happened in New Brunswick that day?Zamura I won a match so what?Cameraman I saw it on YouTube you didnt just win a match. You broke a  year old mans neck. What sin could have possibly been committed to cause that?Zamura Oh you want to know?Cameraman Yup. Were still rolling.Zamura Fuck you you dont get to know. All you need to know is that Im stepping in the ring with  other people two of which I know I can beat and  others I feel pretty secure that I can beat. Im going to win this match then Im going to beat that vanilla midget Dalidus Nova and take his Undisputed Championship. Fuck him Ill break his neck too.Zamura places his beer on the table and stands up. He makes his way towards the kitchen grabbing his keys off the ground near the sink.Cameraman Well do you have anything to say to Joey McCarty? He interrupted your match!Zamura He interrupted damn near everyones match. So the higherups decided they wanted me to straighten him out. I guess its nice they have that kind of faith in me. So Ill tear him apart and later hell go into the battle royal and everyone else can tear him apart too. Play stupid games win stupid prizes. Tyson shrugs as he walks towards the door. He opens it and turns around in the doorway.Zamura So youre just gonna stay here or...?Cameraman Yeah my roommate is picking me up at .Zamura glances at his watch and raises his eyebrows. He gives a quick nod to the camera and leaves closing the door behind him.
