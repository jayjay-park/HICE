237249,0,t3_1wtxsf,What? No. Actual grease paint should only be used on foam latex appliances unless your talking about cream paints instead. Either way I would definitely suggest alcohol paints over all because gelatin slightly melts when applied to the face so your colors would mush and slide if you used cream anyway ,sfx,cf5ca1o,2,t5_2tj4g
667549,0,t3_21hgij,Dont use liquid latex to apply a bald cap unless you absolutely have no choice. If you can get some Telesis  just dont forget the Telesis remover or it will take the hair and the skin with it when you remove it. The Elmers thing is a good idea most makeup companies make a hair release but they all work about the same. Vaseline can corrupt your adhesive and make it not adhere correctly and it degrades the bald cap material which can stop you from reusing it if you need to.,sfx,cgg5e7h,1,t5_2tj4g

1847524,0,t1_ckbm2vo,Aquacolor is like a cake makeup. You activate it with water like a watercolor.ml should be good. Its super pigmented.Using an eyeshadow to contour is a good move too. Play around. ,sfx,ckbtlw4,1,t5_2tj4g
2004297,0,t1_ckud1lk,Ah that makes sense. Did you use scar wax too? My only thought would be to add some shadows under the eyes and maybe around the nose to give it some more definition. But I still really like it.,sfx,ckupsk8,2,t5_2tj4g

2202503,0,t3_2katnc,Are you planning on doing a fullface prosthetic or do you just want the ripped eyelid?Youll definitely need to start off by covering your eye with something like a Latex or D Gel prosthetic. Then youll probably want to attach a fake eyeball to said prosthetic. After that its pretty much just shaping the rips with Latex or Scar Wax and filling them with D Gel to emulate all that gooey stuff under the skin. And after all of that youll need to colour it. ,sfx,cljsiro,1,t5_2tj4g
