1130674,0,t3_272gqa,Answering question ME priests work in preren because monsters arent that strong yet. In renewal when you get to third class monster HP is simply too high to just rely on ME.ME is still the only AoE skill ABs get.Battle ABs are usually melee and rely on ctrlclicking and autocast gears and also duple light which procs more damage with ctrlclick attacks. A lot of autocast gears are available on official servers from cash shops but they have yet to reach RedditRO since many autocast gears dont drop from monsters.ABs also have a single target Holy element magic damage skill Adoramus but it is pretty shitty compared to the skills of other classes.They can be really cool but they are gear dependent A decent iRO guide ,RedditRO,chwt6ro,2,t5_31tns
