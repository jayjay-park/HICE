8154131,0,t3_4qxysu,Im digging the sound of this album. Enough like old stuff to be familiar enough for me to like right away but different at the same time. I couldnt say the same of Port of Morrow quite as much.,TheShins,d4wtbed,4,t5_2qy6d

11022664,0,t3_5xczlk,He did say that it was based off of a real situation that a friend of his was involved in. And the conversation James had with that person. But I think thats as much detail as we know.,TheShins,dehe09q,3,t5_2qy6d

11392572,0,t1_dfn20dd,When So Now What was released I didnt like it. I think it was the vocals. I wanted that When I GooseStep James Mercer Sound and it was too produced for me. I forgot about it. I saw it come out again on this record and now its one of my favorites from the new material? So I dont even know.Im also a fan of Half a Million although I think Ill prefer the slow flipped version. More fitting of the lyrics. I prefer the flipped version of Spilt Needles? Taste is an interesting thing.,TheShins,dfnby1e,1,t5_2qy6d
