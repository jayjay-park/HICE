You see that a lot in terminal patients.  gtSimon and Catherine learn that Simon died shortly after his scan in  and his scan became a template for AI research. How did Catherine not realize? She probably wasnt up to date on the legacy templates.  It even says that the researchers mostly ignored them as they were less developed.  It was only the WAU that started falling back on them.  gtCatherine admits to using Simons scan so how would she not know him?Did she?  I dont remember when.  She talked about how his template was probably used as a template for AI but I dont think she ever used it herself.  Or if she did she probably didnt pay attention to whose it was  just that it was a legacy scan.  gtNo weapons. None of the people from before the monsters used any kinds of weapons against the monsters. The game is better because we cant fight but it seems surprising there was no way the humans could fight.Well they were research stations at the bottom of the ocean.  Presumably there wasnt a huge need for weapons down there.  That being said I have to assume there was some kind of security team so there should be guns somewhere.  gtIt is implied that the monsters only attacked to get structural gel however why then would they attack the humans?Most of them are extremely mentally unstable and aggressive because theyre unable to cope with their new existence.  Notice the female proxies you meet in Omicron have their heads in their hands cryinghyperventilating before you approach.

Up until Simon woke up in Upsilon maybe even Johan Ross the WAU had only ever encountered structure gel independant of itself in its proxies which it controlled.  Simon and Johan were completely independant of the WAU.Even though its implied that the WAU made Johan the way he is and just about spoon fed to us that the WAU made Simons Upsilon Body it may not have been expecting a sentient creature to inhabit those bodies.To clarify the WAUs prime directive to preserve human life was simplified drastically whent he comet struck the Earth.  Realizing that resources were now critically limited it stripped down to the most effective way to perform its prime directive.  What the WAU fails to realize is that to humans living is the keeping of our consciousness and freedom  not just the continuation of biological processes.  As such it restrains humans and puts them into life support.  From there its constantly working to improve its systems to make its charges a little more self sufficient and capable of gathering the resources that theyll need to continue their biological processes.Coming at number  for directives would probably self preservation andor preservation of the facility.  The integrate structure gel would simply fall under its self preservation directive since the structure gel is a resource that it can use to further the progress of the Prime Directive.,soma,cwk9gje,2,t5_2ra4z

Ever since Ross was brought back to Omicron hes been trying to contact people of the site by sending dreams and information through their blackboxes while the WAU was trying to both stop them from receiving the info about how to destroy it  probably jamming the signal somehow. At the same time had to follow the protocol and resurrect Ross so by the time his body was all done and he could communicate at his full potential him trying to reach people at Omicron and WAU trying to block him off caused an overload.From both the notes and files on the games website its possible to say that the WAU started to become progressively more selfaware. Perhaps it was trying to save itself from being destroyed or maybe its way of thinking was that it was the only possible solution to save mankind and therefore by killing the WAU people would ultimately doom themselves as well  which was against its protocol.,soma,cwl56oj,1,t5_2ra4z

Yes Strohmeier was the security chief and its implied that he also has some level of security clearance at the other stations as well. So no hes not the big boss man so while he did have a lot of leverage there were still things he didnt have the authority to do.. Pathos II is both an underwater research facility and the caretakers for the Omega Space Gun which from what I gather is the preferred method of launching things like satellites into space in the SOMA universe. So they get a lot of stuff like supplies and jobs from various entities around the world. I dont think theres anywhere that explicitly says what company or nationality officially owns Pathos II but they do mention Lisbon more than once. That being said theres also a whole lot that Carthage is doing in Pathos II as well so its not all plain and simple.. I dont recall her ever being at Omicron. She was a Systems Engineer at Theta and up until the trip to take the ARK to Phi I dont think she ever really left Thera for any notable reason. As far as her mockingbird at Lambda which is what Im assuming you meant that wasnt her cortex chip. It was just another cortex chip that had Catherines brain scan loaded onto it presumably by the WAU.. They contact each other using the LUMAR relays which according to Catherine had fallen into a bit of disrepair. And Robin mentioned Catherine not being able to scan those at Omicron because yes the suicides might lead to Strohmeier shutting the project down which is what happened.

9086546,0,t1_d841fed,To be fair that might just be an oversight by the developers. I understand your point though but there isnt any other logictheory in why that monster teleports from what Ive read so far.,soma,d8421gy,10,t5_2ra4z
9216815,0,t1_d8k6jcr,This. OP is the one that completely missed the obvious distinction between how the characters of the game understand whats going on and try to make sense of it and how the game itself portraits the actual truth to the player.,soma,d8kasei,9,t5_2ra4z
9225818,0,t1_d8c34qa,Which short story? ,soma,d8lfuxk,1,t5_2ra4z
9291510,0,t3_57ixc4,Amnesia ? It should be a Amnesia  game. AMFP wasnt really a true spirtual successor Amnesia  more like a spin off. Some people actually think AMFP was made by Frictional Games. ,soma,d8trkfi,1,t5_2ra4z
10189986,0,t1_dbu1eu4,Maybe but the ARK was already  days into the simulation. Deleting an existing Catherine with  days of memories who might have made some friends for the first time sounds like a pretty bad thing doesnt it?,soma,dbz3azb,1,t5_2ra4z
10266629,0,t1_dc7r8mh,Thats probably the one then. A lot of evidence points to the WAU not enjoying the idea of the ARK project. Not only did it result in a lot of suicides but it would need Pathos II staff to travel through the dangers of the Abyss and past all of the WAUtouched sea life. The WAU seemed to be completely against the project but its curious why it wouldnt make any moves to assimilate the project when it was locked in Omicrons medbay along with Sarah Lindwall. Its shown that it can leak structure gel from any location but it chooses not to during the months that it was situated there. It might have just been the result of game design and writing opposing each other but itd be really curious if it wasnt. ,soma,dc7s18j,2,t5_2ra4z

10838864,0,t3_5ux0y2,Glad you enjoyed it! I can definitely agree that the ending was one of the most powerful experiences Ive ever had playing a game. The atmosphere story and characters are all so well constructed that it felt like I really was trudging through the abyss. Soma is truly a gem that Ill probably never forget.,soma,ddxya4i,4,t5_2ra4z
10897561,0,t1_de3rc7o,Ahaha this game has the best achievements ever basically only going through the game once without doing anything but following the path to the end nets you all of them. How peculiar ,soma,de4088r,2,t5_2ra4z
11373681,0,t3_629jtd,I love the girl from the short story about climbing the space gun to see the surface one last time. Also Sarah Lindwall similarly because we know so little about each of them and yet they made it so far. Just imagine what kinds of stories Sarah last woman alive on earth must have geeze. ,soma,dfl6pu2,4,t5_2ra4z
