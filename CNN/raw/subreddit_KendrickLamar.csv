GKMC was a whole different album. TPAB is in its own genre of rap. I like to think that Kendrick wanted to make an album that was right square in the middle of conscious and commercial with GKMC and I think he did it perfectly. Now that hes already cemented himself into the mainstream scene he has the freedom to take a risk and make something a lot more conscious than mainstream. ,KendrickLamar,cpkirri,2,t5_2v28g

4758998,0,t3_3fdqiv,Sort of a weird comparison. I mean besides both being amazing albums they have little in common. DSOTM was spacey and experimental in terms of sound with some loose structure. TPABs greatest strength was its lyrical content and the difficult social subjects it tackled and how it did that.If anything TPAB would be closer to The Wall because of the linearity but I dont think those are comparable either because the content is so different. I think TPAB is so powerful because there isnt a fair comparison from a previous generation and I think the same it true with a lot of great albums.,KendrickLamar,ctuf0wk,3,t5_2v28g

6755817,0,t1_cziqhke,Damn homie. I always respect the brutally constructive criticism. I understand what you are saying today at least. I was far from soberfield in that last comment. I appreciate the advice I do kinda already sing out loud to myself all the time nobody is near enough to hear me lol One thing you havent garnered isgt If you wanna work on your writing a bit more Id need to know your current writing patterns.This is  unwritten. aka FREESTYLE you know before the word became something for rappers to hide their writtens behind knowing god damn well that the average joe automatically thinks OFF THE DOME with is now required to specify what is happening.The difference here is its not exactly about how it sounds. You gotta listen to the lyricist as he thinks as quickly on his feet as possible in the hopes of throwing together something at least somewhat coherent. When you freestyle.....off the top.... it becomes much more apparent how the average listener listens wrong. Which sounds silly but it isnt. Its about quick thinking and all that. The more I practice that exact aspect of off the top freestyles the easier the melodiousness and such will come. Anyway thanks for your time and effort I will think more about the whole singsongy half of hiphop on your advice.come check out rfreestylerap if youd like to check out our modest community,KendrickLamar,d0i3wf5,1,t5_2v28g

6875115,0,t3_49wha4,I like the live vibe on TPAB but the voices and the way it cuts out is a bit annoying.  I understand that the point though is in response to the negative criticism of the studio most of which attacked him for being to upbeat.  I think that criticism is BS though and i is a wonderful and important single. Like a couple other songs on TPAB the point of the version of i on the album is to show the difficulty getting through to people he wants to reach in a positive manner as the crowd backlashes against his message of self love.  Continued focus by the public on the gangster aspects of his music and ignoring the underlying message e.g. how Swimming Pools became a drinking song which is completely oblivious to the point of the song is the drive for a lot of the more personal moments on TPAB especially when he goes after himself for failure and hypocriticism.  So really musically I like them both but really the single is a stand alone song with a message and the album version is a personal critique about his relationship with his audience staged as a skit where he performs his single so its hard to compare them.,KendrickLamar,d0vlvvt,15,t5_2v28g

11589017,0,t3_65d1cb,Lemme say this....seems like most people are thinking the hypothetical second album would follow DAMN. Damnation or whatever. And yes he does die in the end. But what if the second album actually comes before DAMN.? Perhaps itll be called God...and this makes sense with the graphic designplacement of the title on the DAMN. album cover. Theres a period at the end as well as his death though this might not be a normal death...but Im not gonna think about that.Edit Also though Im not super familiar with the Matrix the red pill represents reality right? Or being inside the Matrix? The blue pill isnt simply the story ending its just an alternative to the red pill. So if the red pill is reality the blue pill is choosing to ignore a reality you know ignorance is bliss type shit. And though I dont think Kendrick would think this way if the album were called God...thats an illusion to many now this is just the atheist in me talking. ALL THAT SAID Kendrick could certainly flip the meanings of the redblue pills. Doesnt have to follow the Matrix closely it can be his own loose interpretation. Plus you could certainly argue choosing some sort of fake reality faith is a good decision. Its up to the audience to choose.,KendrickLamar,dg9mf6s,7,t5_2v28g

11589902,0,t3_65f12w,There very well may not be a second album which Id be cool with anyway since the one we got is amazing but Sounwave tweeting this is sort of pointing out the obvious about his previous tweets. It doesnt  negate the possibility of a double album. There are many things about the album itself and its release including the blue brick Spotify photo that still hold together a pretty solid theory. And we know how conceptual and biblical Kendrick can get. Another thing to consider by tweeting this Sounwave is helping to make the surprise factor if there really is a second album much bigger. Just a thought. By tweeting about the leak he accidentally contributed a lot to this theory and to make up for it hes tweeting this now so the impact of a double album can be greater as it was likely intended to be. Anyway enough ranting and reaching haha.,KendrickLamar,dg9q1m8,113,t5_2v28g

But in that logic why rewind why wasnt their just a end to the album like Ill use this as a lesson later on in life goodbye til then. becuase with the rewind he will always get shot like all the struggles that happened whether it was me vs world me vs me none of it matter beacuse be he will get shot by the woman. Thats why I always had a little ray of hope for nd album like something else happens in the beginning I dont know maybe Im over thinking it.EDIT but then again what happens on earth stays on earth makes sense now like when he dies hell truly be free of all the conflicts of life. Im starting to think with all these themes so perfectly illustrated in this it might be is best album. DAMN.,KendrickLamar,dgdz54h,1,t5_2v28g
11627440,0,t3_65xoa9,Alot of people just dont understand what he is saying in his songs and take it at face value. Some of my friends dont enjoy his voice for whatever reason. Honestly im ok with people not liking him but its when they dont realize or give him credit for his impact on the music scene in general that gets me mad.I feel like kendrick speaks to the listener better than any other rap artist today and his albums reward you to think about what he is trying to say or to see from his perspective. He not the only one that has complex meaning in his songs or is trying to speak to a certain message but in my opinion he does it the best. ,KendrickLamar,dgdzdy6,6,t5_2v28g

11631249,0,t1_dgcmnt1,It doesnt matter why Frank took four years. The point is that he still had all of that time to perfect his albums.I compare Kendrick to Frank because they are extremely similar. Top tier artists in their genre IMO  in their respective genres. These artists take their time theyre perfectionists. They will not put out anything until they are  satisfied and that process takes a while.You see Drake for example he releases an album every year. But its evident that not a lot of time goes into these projects. Damn. is much better curated than More Life and you can hear the difference in quality. This isnt to say More Life is bad. However I think you can hear the difference and see that Damn. is more thought out and coherent.I say again to expect  albums from a top tier artist like Kendrick within this small time frame is to expect too much.I cant respond to the other claims that MF DOOM has made  classics in  months because I am not familiar with him. Its on my todo list. I am just going off the artists I know. I retain my argument that top tier artistry takes time.,KendrickLamar,dgeexpe,1,t5_2v28g

Rodeo is better than Birds but if anyone denies how dope Pick up the Phone is their prejudice against that kind of music is preventing them enjoying some of that genres best. Doesnt have to be lyrical Travis has some of the best producers making catchy visceral beats over which he can adlib ad infinitum and croon decent to great hooks. He can get pretty much anyone on a track and usually brings out their quirkiest performances. I like Travis but I love Kendrick.,KendrickLamar,dgf83xy,3,t5_2v28g

He never gave any examples of what any of these interpretations could be other than the one he decided to judge the album on coincidentally being the worst interpretation he could come up with. He gave kendrick no benefit of the doubt that the depth he went into tpab with might also be found here instead his attitude when talking about specific parts of the album Israelite references clearly showed he was personally bothered by them and that likely affected his judgement on the overall goal of the album whether he liked some songs or not.gtHe probably understands the album better than you ever willSorry but you dont know me and you have no basis for this claim.,KendrickLamar,dgj6y9c,14,t5_2v28g

Darth Plagueis was a Dark Lord of the Sith so powerful and so wise he could use the Force to influence the midichlorians to create life He had such a knowledge of the dark side that he could even keep the ones he cared about from dying. The dark side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so powerful the only thing he was afraid of was losing his power which eventually of course he did. Unfortunately he taught his apprentice everything he knew then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. Ironic. He could save others from death but not himself.,KendrickLamar,dgjdjg7,4,t5_2v28g

11684093,0,t1_dgkdl6w,But original sin is washed away with Jesus isnt it? And have you heard of Christian meditation? Its a process of contemplating the word of God and abiding in a thoughtful or quiet prayerfulness. These are some of the processes that monks and nuns participate in at their monasteries and convents. The purpose is to fill the mind with Godly thought which is arguably what basic prayer is for. If you think of God enough eventually it will be the only kind of thought that can survive in your mental environment.In other religions like Buddhism for example alongside a pressure towards correct and pure actions and intentions in sure you know that they practice their own forms of meditation. The purpose of their meditation tends to be about focusing on the mind and allowing thoughts to run their course and be digested without feeding them like fasting from mental stimuli until they gradually slow down where they become capable of greater and greater control over their thoughts being able to see them when they arise.  Similarly fasting serves to allow people greater control and distance from the earthly drive to consume and Jesus fasted for  days once. Then they strive to stop all thought and worldly desire while fully conscious which in Indian theistic religions unlike Buddhism produces experiences that would be associated with being close to God.I believe the function of religion is to give us ways of becoming less attached to the world and more focused on God or more focused on wisdom and emptiness in the Buddhist context. This process seems to be the only path to lasting happiness true beauty wisdom meaning and possibly the capacity to help others and attest to the creators glory using holy miracles by nonoccult means.,KendrickLamar,dgkeqp0,1,t5_2v28g

Is just not right but i do understand why he scored that so well. At the end of the day scores dont matter. Its more about what he says,KendrickLamar,dgpjbew,3,t5_2v28g

11729687,0,t1_dgpfot0,Acts hit Edmonton and Calgary pretty frequently though. Though come on Edmonton is a bit out of the way for a tour. I definitely agree with your second point though. Thats why I have major respect for guys like Dallas Green. Like I know hes nowhere near Kenny big but hes not nobody and that dude plays Campbell River. Like fuck no one outside of BC knows about Campbell River. ,KendrickLamar,dgpl9rx,2,t5_2v28g

11731213,0,t1_dgpmgu9,Personally in a musical sense I think The Beatles are God but even Mozart isnt everyones cup of tea so I will explain to you why the Beatles matter and not why you should like them. The Beatles are the source point for almost everything we know of in terms of modern western music including hip hop. They revolutionized multitrack recording and helped create the idea of using the recording studio as an instrument in and of itself and the album as an art form. They were the first artist to use samples feedback distortion backwards tape and invented many of the effects still used today as the back bone of musical production. They basically single handedly made it so every respectable musical act was expected to be a songwriter and artist rather than just a performer doing other peoples work and shifted the sound of popular music towards a more working class and middle class reflection of society they lead the cultural vanguard of the s by being ahead of the curve in regard to politics music art drugs fashion sex etc. They built the blue print they broke the ground they put in the work and they sounded damn good while doing it. I could go on about their inventive use of chord structures harmonies and the revolutionary nature of the beat centered music but that is a whole other subject. Without the Beatles there would be no Kendrick Lamar.,KendrickLamar,dgprht0,6,t5_2v28g
