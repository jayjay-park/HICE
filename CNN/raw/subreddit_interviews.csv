5384177,0,t3_3dyjr7,I have. Im on mobile  at the moment so its gone be a little short. Basically Im sure hes just going to ask you a  mix of personal questions and qualification questions. So be ready to be yourself. As for eating go with a salad!! Its cheap not messy and it should be impossible to get something stuck in your teeth. I offered to pay at the end as to not seem greedy like I was expecting him to pay but Im not sure if thats a good idea or not I got the job regardless. Maybe at least make an attempt to go for your wallet slowly or even open it up slowly. Hopefully he will catch you in the middle and say no no no Im paying for it. Again Im not sure about the etiquette in this situation.,interviews,cvzw0tk,1,t5_2qity

7460099,0,t3_4gooqf,Seven days is a pretty long amount of time. Did they ask for a background or credit check at any point? It is possible that HR is just dragging their feet getting the offer letter together. Youd be safe to ping him with a quick email checking on the job and thanking him for the opportunity. If you are working with a third party recruiter on this one have them do it for you.,interviews,d2q60gi,1,t5_2qity

8303871,0,t3_4s88ii,I wouldnt tell them that you felt like you werent your best that day or use the word unpreparedness. It looks bad but also the interviewer may have been completely fine with your answers. Maybe just send an email thanking them and if they had any more questions for you that youre more than happy to schedule another meeting and that you hope to hear from them soon. ,interviews,d5fjho9,2,t5_2qity
9374158,0,t3_58k1dh,gt  What is this years goal for the companies revenuegt What has your company done for the community?gt How long has the company been around what is its story and history?gt What are the opportunities for job growth? gt What are the companys overall goals?Whatever you do these questions should not be asked.  You can easily find the answers to these questions by either going to the companys website or by a simple search on Google.  ANY question that can be answered by Google or via company website should not be asked.  It only shows that YOU have not done your homework on the company.  Do your research on the company and then ask questions based on the research.  Questions   biggest challenge and most rewarding and why work here can be covered with one question I ask the interviewers  Something like Tell me about your experience working here.  How long have you worked here and what have you found to be the greatest reward and challenges of working here? The answer can really say a lot about the person.  Someone who has only worked a month and is already giving huge praise seems to to give the company a sketchy feel while someone with years and years of experience giving you all the insight seems like someone with more credibility.  Question  on what they wish could be improved is probably something to stay away from.  Companies will try to give you the positive traits and try to steer away from the negatives.  Unless you know of a negative aspect of a company that you want to address and is safe to address I would steer clear.  For example if you are applying for Wells Fargo as a manager you can bring up how the fraudulent account scandal is being handled at a the particular branch you are applying for and how it might affect your position in particular.  Question  and  I would save to the near the end and phrase it as Based on what I have discussed with you today what concerns do you have about how I fit in to this position and have I not addressed anything that would help you to determine whether I would be best for this position?   Dont just ask if they have any more questions for you.  Be specific on what you want from them in terms of a question.Question  and  are questions that you should be ready to answer rather than the other way around.Hope this helps!,interviews,d948opm,1,t5_2qity

9685913,0,t3_5dsoqz,If you cant think of when X Y Z happened at work in a spontaneous manner at least do some preparation.  Think back to the examples of difficult situations or x y z situations at work that have happened and start jotting them down.  Have a list that you can compile of situations that you have encountered at work.  If youre getting behavioral interview questions now youll definitely be getting more later especially as you move up in the ranks.  google the term in italics as you will have numerous example questions.  The better prepared you are to answer these questions and the more examples you are ready give with these questions the more you will impress the interviewer.  ,interviews,da6zskz,2,t5_2qity
9749881,0,t3_5epu5h,Yes absolutely but Id phrase it  If I perform well in the role is there any potential for the position to be extended or perhaps become permanent at the end of the initial fixed term?  Im asked this regularly and its on my good question list. It shows the candidate is interested in working hard to earn an opportunity and places no commitment at all on the employer as they can just say possibly depending on a variety of factors in addition to individual performance meaning general financial and business concerns,interviews,daevxlz,2,t5_2qity
10436395,0,t3_5p23bh,Did you send them a resume wherein you detail your knowledge and experience?Ive been called in for interviews as a graphic designer with companies where the experience they mention in their brief as being required isnt even mentioned in my resume. I think when putting out ads for staff companies often try and cover as much ground as possible for things they may require to some degree but that are not actually realistically essential. At the place where I am currently working Ive had to put out ads for hiring extra designers many times over the last  years and quite a few times weve ended up hiring people that didnt really meet all the requirements but we were willing to train them in the necessary areas so that they can at least START to carry some weight and pick up the rest as they go along.In reality there is no such thing as a plug and play employee. Some degree of acclimatization will always be necessary in some degree.  So mayhaps you have the necessities necessary to start the job and the rest they will expect you to learn either vocationally or they will provide training for it. Its worth asking this in your interview I bet because no one wants to look like they did not do their research. If youre being interviewed by the City of Toronto officials... or whatever they call themselves then it would go without saying that they looked at what you sent and decided to call you in for an interview because you obviously have at least the bare necessities.,interviews,dcr19xt,1,t5_2qity
10578205,0,t3_5r6ku7,I dont think there is a hard and fast rule. But usually if its good news I get a phone call if its bad news its an email with an offer to set up a phone call. But it also could be a request for more information and they do not want to spring anything on you and want you to be prepared.,interviews,dd725i5,1,t5_2qity
11321127,0,t3_61068b,It usually takes a phone interview just to see if the candidate is worth the time allotted to an interview. Then there are usually at least  inperson interviews before actually hiring the candidate. Not everyone will be available the first time to meet the candidate. Usually the hiring manager and HR at least would like to meet the candidate and in the case of startups the founders usually like to meet the new team member before the decision is final if its still at an early stage. ,interviews,dff8bgi,1,t5_2qity
