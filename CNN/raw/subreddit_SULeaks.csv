8559290,0,t3_4wzg1x,I noticed some pretty significant differences in the murals. First they seem to have a huge difference in the flair and intricacy depending on the Diamond. White Diamond has by far the most detail and accessories she has a giant flowing dresscape like thing with a ton of detail and the most planets under her control. Yellow Diamond is second her capedress is intricate though not as much as white she also has fewer planets. Blue Diamond is third hers is rather simple but she still has something of a cape like design but only a small number of planets compared to White and Yellow. Then Pink Diamond has no cape design at all and only one planet.. Perhaps this is the order of the Diamonds in terms of age?Pink Diamond is also the ONLY mural with a stand or energy type thing at her feet. Perhaps this symbolizes her only recently emergingforming?,SULeaks,d6bhkwa,2,t5_3flv3

You try not to think about it. Then more start to arrive. You try to ignore it. Then they start swarming and get so large that you cant ignore them any more.And if you never learned to deal it you get crushed under the weight. It consumes you to the point where you could lose your friends family loved ones even yourself. Despite the terror you live in inside your head each day what scares you even more is fighting your demons of facing your problems head on. Compared to that the butterflies seem tolerable.Thats what anxiety is like. Thats what reliving trauma is like. You have all these butterflies and no ability to make them go away. And thats why people get so stuck and feel so helpless and why therapy takes so freaking long. This whole episode just hits home for me.

8953321,0,t3_52x1ck,This episode actually has a really poignant and slightly bittersweet feel to it.Heres the thing I think so many theories popped up around who or what Onion was what his deal was that the true inner layer of Onion kind of got lost  hes just a nonverbal young kid with comedically destructive impulses but also a caring human side.  We see the latter when Onions around his family and today we see it here.   Onions not a diamond hes not part of some homeworld plot to destroy the fabric of human civilization with random violence and vegetable puns  hes a quiet kid with a dad he sees infrequently and friends who he only really gets to see in the summer.  Everyone he cares about  except Vidalia Sour Cream and Steven  eventually leaves again for a while  but they always come back.Moreover the ending and themes around todays episode foreshadow the elephant in the room with the fandom right now Look at the schedule  if it holds as currently scheduled were heading into another hiatus and this might well be the last show before it.  Our friends Steven and the Gems who weve spent all summer with  are going away for a while and like Onion here assuming the hiatus comes no new episodes are scheduled as of now were going to be really sad for a while.But our friends will be back eventually  and until then we can always look back on all the memories we had this summer and before.  The Summer of Steven is over and Fall is here and with it likely another hiatus. And until our friends return we still have our memories and we still have each other and theres a lot of awesome things to see in the fall and fantastic things from the past to look fondly upon.  Thats what I got out of it anyway.  ,SULeaks,d7o20gs,75,t5_3flv3

She hoards everything that reminds her of her sister and has allowed herself to be consumed by grief.Perhaps WD could represent another third unhealthy way of dealing with grief.   Perhaps she is caught up in bargaining and obsessively researches ways of putting a shattered Gem back together.

11399029,0,t1_dfo1gka,You may think this is new to me but I actually made this observation some time ago.The problem with this is though that what this show wants to be is kind of boring  it drew people in because it balanced those aspects and now it just wants to be slice of life. Thats kind of the opposite what people expected. It implied to go from adventure with slice of life to spaceopera with slice of life. In the end it became just  dare I say  a soap. The issue is that an adventure show with slice of life aspects has huge appeal and the individual aspects do not need to be that strong. Action can carry slumps in writing and the occasional deeper plot or character arc can raise the stakes and increase viewer investment. If you on the other hand just want to do a slice of life show or a soap then better damn well make sure that those aspects are entertaining that your characters are on point and that their issues are well presented. The lukewarm reception of the last few sliceoflife episodes should make it clear that they fail on that front.In the end I just want them to play to their strengths and deliver action plot slice of life and lore in a fun package. This is what got the show popular. The implication that it would go even farther Jailbreak! made it explode in popularity. You cannot just axe or underdeliver on those parts of the show now and expect people not be disappointed.,SULeaks,dfo2d0i,12,t5_3flv3
