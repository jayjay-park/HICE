While were counting the coins to collect the first  drinks at Rs  each offer coupons one of the bouncers  a lady  rudely remarked that no sandals allowed and they cant let us in. We stood aghast on hearing that and just left the place in search for friendly pubs around the corner. If she was more professional and polite I wouldnt be writing here.Ive dropped them a mail few minutes back. Good if they take the feedback in the right spirit. ,bangalore,d90hq1q,7,t5_2qhvf

There is a lovely chief scientist there i forget his name who is very enthusiastic about his work and will share with you all you probably need to know at least about the dust and pollution levels in the city. I myself had spoken to him a year ago. And the office itself will indulge you if you dont seem to negative or suspicious.  ,bangalore,da7y101,2,t5_2qhvf

10272067,0,t3_5n30s7,Me and my wife had been looking for an apartment to move in. Our requirement was an underconstruction appt. The few different options you can look at are  Online sites  Commonfloor magicbricks etc  This was the main source of information and connections to markettersbrokers builders etc for me. Credai expos  Credai organizes a lot of expos where you could find out a lot about new projects developing areas and also bank finance options. Credai Expo This should be a good starting point. Brokers  You can directly approach individual brokers but in my experience they have information only about few projects.For us we went to a credai expo that helped us get an idea about the range of projects and area where we might find a good project. We followed up on a few projects from there. MagicBricks and Commonfloor was also good. But only when we knew our requirements a little better. We entered into an agreement for an appt. on harlur road. This was through brokers we contacted on magicbricks.I hope this helps. Brokers and builders should not be trusted. So be cautious. Once you have found a project you are interested in try to find reviews online about the project.If you would want to go in for a loan then I suggest you also talk to govt banks for loan options and features.,bangalore,dc8e8bp,9,t5_2qhvf

Somehow the rest of the world does fine without speed breakers.Maybe if we werent all treated like imbeciles who cant follow rules from the start wed actually follow rules.
