578179,0,t1_cg5zb09,A very good suggestion and I think we need to reconsider the traditional mechanics used in the paradox grand strategy series especially when it comes to combat. In a matter of fact there is alot of mechanics we need to rethink since we are building this from scratch. Not only to improve the mechanics but also to tailor them in regards to our development team to meet our ambitions.For instance the RTS nature of all the paradox grand strategy titles is going to be challenging to reproduce with the limited resources we have. Not to mention when it comes to network programming even paradox havent got this working properly with the resources they have. The constant desync issues is largely because of the RTS and all the information that has to be synchronized over a large network within a limited timeframe.Im going to make another post soon with some suggestions to how we are going to approach this with this in mind.,coldwargame,cg5zroj,1,t5_30ut8
