3727318,0,t1_cqgzrjw,You were ruining other players game play experiences. As a group you managed to get our maxed population from  to  players and move on to our second server to do the same thing. That is a lack of respect for this community in general not to mention the admins who were more then fair with you guys in several situations. under  hours of you guys being banned from the server our pop is back up to full... Its pretty sickening how you can come here and deface this reddit post after the damage you have already caused... Please move on with your life thanks,ReignOfKingsServers,cqh50vz,1,t5_37hk2
