1836590,0,t1_ckah3yz,Yeah I think the merchandising really had an effect on the show. The Perfect Zector was shoehorned in without any introduction at all.

2013528,0,t3_2ht8hg,In my opinion its the exact opposite. Haruto is simply the boy scout the guy who could do no wrong in other words hes the messiah archetype but Shunyas acting is so bland we have or at least I felt there was no reason to rally behind him. In comparison Kouta is the exact same there are episodes where Koutas messiah arc makes him dull and naive and predictable but at least Gaku Sanos spectacular acting saves the character time and time again until he becomes interesting again. Koyomi isnt just easy to dislike shes just hard to connect with. Now it could have been different if she wasnt played by a very popular talent because a lot of the shooting interfered with her other works but her lack of screen time gives us no reason to lament her death. Were supposed to want to save her but since she has no characterization I honestly felt no sorrow for Haruto when she disappeared. Honestly Beast was a waste of a character granted he does have a decent arc and probably the one that actually drives the plot while Harutos being the Savior of all. I feel that the Secondary Rider title should have gone to Maya she is the one whose sister became Medusa and she does have a larger motivation to stopping the Phantoms than to save her own hide. It would have been a lot more interesting for Maya to get more characterization than just the two introductory episodes and the last few episodes at the end. The story just ambles on and on until the last quarter of the series when Sou reveals himself as the white wizard and starts gathering Mages. If the last quarter of the series was extended and the gathering of mages started earlier in the series as well as getting more characterization the show would not have been so bad. But since the early  of the series is nothing but filler its just gets boring. Flashy choreography can only carry a show so far and Wizard is probably proof of that. ,KamenRider,ckvtryc,5,t5_2s8q8

Urobuchi wants the old haunted mystery driven awesome Rider storytelling back and so hes trying to create a dichotomy where cute and friendly meets terror and horror. as he always does. which is... okay. because hes a very good deconstructionist. and not in a bad way.

It adheres to the thenstandard rider formula so much that people were literally able to guess the big endofseries plot twist from the very first episode. Individual episodes tend to give more character development to oneoff characters then the actual protagonists. The secondary rider is given an interesting introduction and then has his entire character arc concluded in the very next episode. The suit designs are conceptually interesting but look somewhat unfinished. Generally speaking the fight choreography is pretty good but the big powerup reveal fights are generally underwhelming. Overall you might want to watch it at some point just for completions sake but overall its a pretty boring show. ,KamenRider,d0hosor,2,t5_2s8q8

8145348,0,t3_4pv6nl,Also blade was one of those shows that got very dark very quickly. I dont think I can just pick up the series towards the end but here are my thoughts on the riders.Blade He kind of started as a bland character but grew on me very quickly. I wont talk about the ending because spoilers but the first time he turned into King form was a huge moment for me.Garren drove me up a wall. Seriously the first part of the series with the tank thing. WTF was that! Seriously he was probably the worst character. Like the entire series could have worked without him.Chalice I liked a lot as a character. Although his Henshin belt didnt make a lot of sense. I mean technically when he transforms hes only changing to the form of the ace card. Same with his human card. Shouldnt that mean the other cards should turn him into those undead? Its just a weird thing that never quite left my mind.Leangle Dear god this kid became such a drag. Seriously he was a boring character. Thats literally all I have to say about him.For the brief moment it switched hands to the new guy I was like THANK GOD! But then NOPE back to boring kid. ,KamenRider,d4vpqux,1,t5_2s8q8

The only thing I didnt like was the awkward midsection where they made it seem like Glaive then Larc then Tachibana were all evil in the space of ten minutes before settling on Glaive being the evil one again. I loved that it had the opposite ending to the show proper though  rather than Kenzaki sacrificing himself for Hajime Hajime got to sacrifice himself for Kenzaki. And I liked the way the deconstruction in Kenzaki becoming a garbage man  being a Kamen Rider is a truly thankless job.,KamenRider,d57cgko,1,t5_2s8q8

8421696,0,t1_d5u07od,I know this is MY head canon but I found the PUT ON command to invoke the Cast On forms to be engineered and developed as a supposed effective defensive maneuver INITIALLY and positioning to work in giving the Riders options and demonstrated by Kabuto in a partial manner hence most of them save the Hopper brothers have such a default transformation FIRST into their armored forms.Later as the course of feedback of use of the Masked Rider systems it was ultimately deemed that a good defense is a good offense  striking before the enemy strikes  i.e. the proliferate Clock Up forms and subsequently Hyper Clock Up.,KamenRider,d5u95z8,1,t5_2s8q8

I want to see an Aqua solo thing maybe also see what all those other medals could do that we saw Kougami working on. Need more Nadeshiko and would love to also see more of the Space Ironmen suits from the Fourze movie and also the new Inazuman and Akumaizer stuff. I also wouldve loved to see more done with the Gaim Gaiden exclusive suits specifically Tyrant Sengoku Duke and Kurumi Jimber Marron. Dark Drive was cool but Type Special and Chou Dead Heat theres legit no reason to not see more of. I also dont at all understand why Rinna didnt go back and make more of the mass produced Mach Drivers for the Special Investigations team to use there is no excuse at all for Kiriko not to be able to transform at this point. None. And that pisses me off to no end. Or hell if Gou was able to get a second Mach Driver made for himself and another one for Tomari why the fuck couldnt they make a legit full Mach Driver for Kiriko? Let her have something already dammit! Especially now that Krim came back and all give her the spare Mach Driver and Dead Heat. Or if she cant handle Dead Heat give her Machs base form and let Gou use Dead Heat on a more regular basis theres no reason not to anymore.Sorry kinda went off on a tangent there.

10845605,0,t1_ddxl7fa,While I would both love this and hate this but only because the idea was not in my head before and now Ill never be able to not think about it I thought the idea behind Mighty Brothers was that one of the two of them was the Bugster sort of and thats fought Pallad hasnt it?,KamenRider,ddync4h,2,t5_2s8q8

10893867,0,t1_de3mew6,Thats fine! Ill definitely check it out. Lately Ive just been turned off by all the recent kamen rider series. It might be the aesthetic and feel of the new ones that are turning me off not sure though.  I feel like the old series are just a tad darker? Ehh maybe its just me. Thanks for the suggestion though!,KamenRider,de3mikx,1,t5_2s8q8

11009859,0,t1_dedm05w,And most of KR villains is often the generic big baddie monsterother entity or the old guy who has big villain plot but he thinks he is doing the right thing a dull angst villain without proper context or a sometime forced plot story final villain characters just to be the sake of being there. Genm on the other hand is just a fresh villain who just have fun with his evilness. He has no redeeming value after what he did too Kiriya but hes just fun to watch. Genm for me is like Kilgrave from Marvel Jessica Jones.,KamenRider,defxqks,3,t5_2s8q8

11481402,0,t1_dfwty16,Couple things I like about ExAid over Gaim is the framework of the show doesnt get dropped after  eps dance battles vs. saving patients and there are fewer characters so we can have more development time on each. Also Emu is more interesting than Kouta so far. Interesting how both series had polarizing suit designs revealed but ended up becoming very beloved by the community for their plot and characters.,KamenRider,dfxexe4,7,t5_2s8q8
11513167,0,t1_dg0y9vi,Unlikely to happen  that voice is obviously to match the Kamen Rider Chronicle gashat itself.Unless there were some kind of switch toggled inside of the DX toy when you use specific gashats I highly doubt the bugvisor  II can discriminate between gashats like that.Of course its sad but you gotta roll with those punches in a toybased show.,KamenRider,dg10pah,6,t5_2s8q8

11801076,0,t1_dgxoppi,Probably because the Gashat Gear Dual Beta doesnt work that way whether by design or just by writing. Also Parad is pretty unique and can do some things with the Gashat that normal people probably cant. ,KamenRider,dgxoybg,3,t5_2s8q8
