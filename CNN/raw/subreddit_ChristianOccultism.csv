1938664,0,t3_2gtiyf,Excellent subreddit and one that was sorely needed.I am a judaeochristian omnist. I believe all godforms are real but that all are part of Gds creation.I have had trouble finding occultists open to the idea.Our views may not be exactly the same but they are definitely closer than those of the pagan movement.Thank you for creating this.,ChristianOccultism,ckmswgv,3,t5_33mib
1962080,0,t1_ckpiemf,Very interesting. I had never the Christian conception of Jesus as self.  I was raised Jewish and so Jesus is relatively new to me about  years. If Christianity holds the Self to be G.d then it is entirely consistent with LHP thinking even if there is an initiationcross.,ChristianOccultism,ckpmrxl,1,t5_33mib
2051034,0,t3_2i38mp,Looking to certain traditions of esoteric buddhism working with demonic spirits is fine as long as is it serves an expedite means to the alleviation of suffering in the world.I think think that a parallel Christian argument would be that working the Goetia is fine as long as the working is done with the intention lovecompassion.,ChristianOccultism,cl0j5kz,1,t5_33mib
2101470,0,t1_cl6qk4i,I pretty much agree with you save for your assertion that the Father is separate from YHVH. They are one and the same. What confuses most people is the different behavior of YHVH from the OT compared to the NT. In my discussions with the Archangels on various portions of the OT most of the supposed direct manifestations of YHVH were in fact Holy Angels acting on His behalf. I suspect Metatron to be Angel in question for a number of them. The OT cannot be taken as infallible scripture. It must be considered as a historical document compiled during the Babylonian exile from many disparate and contradictory sources. ,ChristianOccultism,cl6xy4h,1,t5_33mib

3787762,0,t1_cqnl21p,I asked Michael about historical Jesus vs. gnostic Jesus and he said He lived and trying to emulate him is a noble pursuit. I asked Michael what he thinks about the Pope and he said He is not responsible for the free will of others but he is responsible for how the church reacts.,ChristianOccultism,cqo19sw,2,t5_33mib

5979862,0,t1_cy37wii,Then can we all do what he did completely surrender ourselves to be led by God? Allowing him to move us to speak for us etc?I cant think of anything more exciting than taking the passenger seat to watch God do as he pleases. After I typed that I realized that is the reality of life in every moment Ahahaha. I see what those sages meant when they said there is no enlightenment to attain,ChristianOccultism,cy3hosi,1,t5_33mib
6385584,0,t3_42ne1o,I went through a spiritual crisis due to being too reckless with occultism. I joined Builders of the Adytum as an associate member and was initiated into the first degree of Freemasonry. Sometime after the Masonic initiation I became obsessed with the ideal that I was damned to Hell for eternity and started trying to make the most absurd and foolish deals with God to the detriment of other people to save myself. I eventually slipped to the point where I could see these people. I put that word in quotations because they appeared to be people obviously since everyone else could see them as well but there was something off about their eyes as if they were possessed or were incarnations of some evil soul. I then became so delusional that I thought I was going to become the antichrist if I ate food as a result I almost destroyed my body through malnutrition and another delusion I had was that any time I attempted to pray the prayers would go to Satan instead of God so I was afraid to pray. I also was afraid to say the name Jesus. I then MIRACULOUSLY I edited this to capitalize the word MIRACULOUSLY to show others how important this is was entirely rescued from this state literally overnight. Id almost entirely lost the ability to sleep for a while but I then regained it my mind started clearing up and I became filled with Life again. So in your estimation was this demonic possession or just interference? Obviously there were psychological factors but it was a psychospiritual issue. More particularly a psychological problem resulting from a malicious force. Also what do you think the people I was seeing were? There were some that I encountered who were good as well they never said it directly but seemed to know what was happening to me and tried to guide me towards passing the tests. Except these ones didnt look evil they just looked like normal people. tldr Demons fucking hate you and want to see you destroy as many people as they can get you to before you destroy yourself,ChristianOccultism,czfh1te,1,t5_33mib

7841250,0,t3_4mpb46,Not one specific thing but I cringe when I think about the stuff I did as a novice. The ritualscorrespondences were just pitiful. I imagine in a few years Ill cringe at what I do now.But that said all that silly stuff was effective. I read back in my journals and kick myself for not being more consistently active in attainment.,ChristianOccultism,d3xfau1,2,t5_33mib
9902454,0,t3_5h32oa,gt Ive decided to become a Freemason due to some discussion about Masonic esotericismIve been a Mason for going on five years now. Ive witnessed a large number of degrees and have taken part in discussion groups sidebodies and gatherings.I say this in order to stress that you may not find what youre looking for. You may but you would have about as much chance of finding what youre looking for if you joined the Catholic Church looking for deep insight into the works of Augustine Scotus and Aquinas. Its not why most people are there and few of them understand the deeper principles on which their organization was built.,ChristianOccultism,dayb9pp,2,t5_33mib
