658071,0,t3_21oj9l,Im honestly disappointed. I cant believe we didnt set some Saints record for biggest premier league win in that game. Newcastle were absolutely awful we absolutely ran rampant but I actually feel  wasnt enough. We sat back for a while after getting the second which worried me because weve lost a few    leads doing exactly the same thing. Luckily Newcastle were perhaps the worst team Ive seen play saints this season other than perhaps Fulham. I am of course exceptionally happy with the win and really the disappointment is one of mild amusement as its hard to be sad after a    win. Still... could have been   for Rodriguez  for Lambert  for Lallana and maybe last one to WardProwse.,SaintsFC,cgf2m0n,3,t5_2tboa

The way the club has dealt with their loss has been first class.Im happy with this new direction we are going in. Blood young English talent that can be sold at a premium buy in some cheaper foreign stars to maintain the quality in the first team. This could be our way of dealing with the FFP nonsense.Next year Im still confident of top ten. But thats more to do with the lack of quality in the lower reaches of the Premier league.

Its been a great start to the season even with the lackluster game against WBA had signs of a good season ahead. Now I cant wait to see Mane and JRod competing for a starting role with Sam Pelle Tadic Lloyd and Long not to mention Sam McQueen James Morgan Jack Victor and Steve duking it out for midfield.

2532424,0,t3_2oosb4,Incredibly frustrating. We should have won that you can point to singular events like the back pass or Longs header but to be honest we didnt do enough to kill the game. When were that dominant its not good enough for one mistake to keep making the difference between a win and a loss. I dont know what Mane is doing in training but hes a liability in games and shouldnt be starting. I can forgive him for losing the ball now and again when he takes a man on we need a guy like that. But its the constant misplaced passing in attack thats killing us. No excuse for it. That much said. There are still positives to take.Pelle scored and it did him the world of good. Made better runs and seemed more confident shooting.Tadic seemed more himself again. Hes been a bit absent last couple of games but he was better tonight.Most importantly we actually made some clear cut chances tonight. It felt like we hadnt made one in the last  matches. We were playing balls in behind and one or two crosses were dangerous. Villa we were bad but weve gotten better with each match since. Still not as good as we can be the breakaways in particular ran out of steam pretty quickly but it was better.Still need to fix the corners though. At the moment it might as well go out for a goal kick for all the threat we create from them.,SaintsFC,cmp4has,5,t5_2tboa

4019186,0,t1_cred4bx,Lopes will definitely play next year  hes only got one year left on his contract so if we dont play him hell leave for nothing and that is something the management wont allow. Hes improved so much at Lille too honestly Id have rather seen him in our team this season at times. The owners are really big on the youth players making it through and mansour gets what he wants most of the time. Everything is in lopes favour really he just needs to take the chances hell get. Iheanacho also just said he doesnt want to go on loan so I think well see him next year occasionally too in the same way Pozo got half a dozen games Nacho will get the same and with Dzeko and Jovetic heading out he might end up th choice. My only worry is that with Pellegrini leaving next summer he has no real incentive to play the youth players. Also not to be defensive but I hate it when people try and compare our youth policy to Chelseas. Theyve had  years of money weve had  and its only been  years since we had a starter from our academy before that we had a midtable academy where the good players like Sturridge left us for bigger clubs. Also a lot of our guys are Mancunian   of the FA youth cup final starters so its not like we are buying them all in. Theres a few foreign lads but they are a monirity. ,SaintsFC,cref1ts,3,t5_2tboa

8435315,0,t1_d5vuq1n,Right found the restaurants! The first one is a bit hard to find and you have to book but if you are staying in a hotel you can get them to book it for you it is worth it. This is my favourite place to eat anywhere in the world! It was recommended to be by a local I met whilst traveling about  years ago. Its called Societa Canottieri Firenze which means Florence rowing club and is on the river front down below the promenade. You have to go through this unmarked green door and you walk through a bar out onto the river terrace with a view of the ponte vecchio. Classic Italian food they will only have  or two options for each course but they will all be great!The other one I can recommend is osteria del porcellino very nice and authentic Tuscan food.The food in general is very good and there are multiple osterias trattorias where you will be able to get good cheap food.Other things to try florentine steak a specialty although I dont know the name of the restaurant where I had it it is basically a huge like you will need three people to finish it steak cooked over a wood fire definitely worth it but can be a bit pricey.The local peasant food is a tripe dish the name of which escapes me which you will get from street food vendors all across the city it is a lot nicer than it sounds and dirt cheap good for a quick lunch whilst site seeing! Enjoy I have gotten myself excited and am currently browsing last minute flights to Italy...Edit oh and in case you didnt know already dont bother with pizza its northern Italy go for pasta or polenta dishes the pizza isnt great anywhere north of Naples!,SaintsFC,d5vyce3,2,t5_2tboa

8674061,0,t1_d6prnzu,Ok Ill try as best I can.Its everything about America really but what it boils down to is the way it moves me I can be watching a perfectly normal film and then Ill see this landscape it could be a highway surrounded by huge pine trees with a mountain in the back it could be a crossroads with generic stores off of these roads but not hugging the path the way they do here. And I am in awe. Its the space the architecture the landscapes the sheer vastness of the country you could travel its length and see a multitude of different environments each as beautiful as the last in its own way I could walk for miles and miles just appreciating my surroundings in a way I cant do elsewhere.Its the culture the people these incredibly outgoing people despite being the polar opposite myself who say hi to you walking down the street as if they know you their genuine interest into your beliefs your culture anything about you. The genuine conversations you can have with them that just goes on and on as you expand into different topics. Its their passion whether it be for country politics or sport its so grand in comparison. Its their accessibility to whatever the hell you want its America they have everything whatever you want and you probably dont even have to travel to far for it.Its the sheer scale people will travel hours to go to a shopping mall we would travel maybe m tops for a good one how they can just go on road trips enjoy the drive and the people youre with if youre out of a city the world is yours its not like youre stuck on the A cause some turd burglars want to stare at stones.Its the trust they put in you someone my age could get a  litre plus vehicle a truck or whatever and the insurance would be reasonable for it. And myself looking for a new car at the moment is in bewilderment . is the highest I can go and the cars are expensive in America the price of vehicles is ridiculous and being a lover of cars Im jealous. American Muscle is my thing yet here youre looking to pay k and its not even worth it for these roads.Its literally everything about America it makes me feel a certain way in side I cant even explain I could go on and on but the sad truth is its unlikely Ill ever be able to live there Ill have to spend s of thousands of pounds throughout my life visiting a place I want to see the whole of yet Ill likely never even see half.,SaintsFC,d6pvoq4,2,t5_2tboa

9074018,0,t3_54jw8l,I like the aggression they have been showing. I noticed someone sorry was on train home from the game and didnt really see who say that Redmond complained too much but I think thats the case for everyone they all want the right ball to be played when they feel it is best. Take Austin when Cedric maybe could have cut it back to him although from where I was a million miles away at the other end so probably not the best view it looked like one of the centre backs might have cut it out anyway. But anyway Austin went absolutely mad at Cedric but why wouldnt he he felt there was the opportunity to make it  and was frustrated that he couldnt.As far as I am concerned the aggression is just from a hunger of wanting to do well  Romeu for instance is aggressive in getting the ball back and doing well for our team  I dont think his mistimed tackles are exactly because of Puel and our new aggression hes always looked a bit prone to a bad tackle. If he stays on his feet like the second half hes fantastic.If we lose the aggression we have then we could end up like West Ham are at the moment. ,SaintsFC,d82jszh,18,t5_2tboa

The facade is going to split people like marmite but I think thats its been nicely detailed and put together even if I dont know whats its supposed to be taking inspiration from.  Yeah it clashes badly with the existing but thats because the existing is an ugly box. Literally no finesse to a lot if the exterior at all. A weird cloud is better than a cheap brick box.Also its finally provides decent access. I mean to get from thr high street down to where Argos and stuff is now you gotta go through west quay or down a car park. Lets be honest theyre not going to put on events and shit in that stepped areas like they claim but it should be a nice outside space with the old wall there.Ive not been down there since it opened so I cant comment on the transition between the existing and new yet either. I have low expectations about how they managed that.Basically I like it a lot compared to the ugly existing box.

10971421,0,t1_debgudx,Cdric may not be the best RB in the world but I genuinely couldnt like the guy more. Hes quiet gets his head down puts in a good shift and has I think game on game improved his form. His Euro win hasnt gone to his head the players seem to like him and most importantly he seems to genuinely love the club. Hes increasingly performing media duties constantly talking to the cameras and the press and talking about how he feels more and more responsibility to the club and to the team every day. He seems to take the role to heart and genuinely appreciate playing for us  I think this is his level and this is as good as it could be for him and if we can keep him around then I dont really see any downsides. Yes an amazing RB like Walker or Clyne would be great for the team but I would rather have a very good RB who loves the club than an amazing RB who will run when a good offer comes through the door. ,SaintsFC,debmhnl,11,t5_2tboa
11013508,0,t3_5x6fon,Official Pompey twitter replying to random guy tagging official Saints into it... yeah they were asking for it. And we won it.  Maybe they should have sold their  year old trophies when they were begging fans for pennies!,SaintsFC,degcm82,7,t5_2tboa

11063993,0,t1_dem2xmx,Im not that bothered by the loyalty in football from anyone other than youth players Shaw Chambers etc. They get bought and sold like commodities have a short career and I can barely stick at a job for a year without wanting a change so  or  years or something at one job in Southampton where theres fuck all to do! is plenty.  The disconnect for me is when players in the PL talk about providing for their families. If rumours were to be believed and he was on k following his pay rise last year then he earned m in a year. Considering m is an absolutely life changing amount of money for someone like me or you he should always be careful saying about doing his best for himself or his family because to us the difference between k a week and k a week is negligible because of how different those amounts of money are to what we live with.,SaintsFC,dem36ur,8,t5_2tboa
11119881,0,t1_desal6k,Personally from where i grew up its nothing. But going from my friends and the city people were panicking when we got into cm. They didnt stop traffic or anything like that but they stopped our rec league at least few time which i thought was weird.But hey thats just the culture difference i guess..,SaintsFC,desfhaz,1,t5_2tboa

11790903,0,t3_683ytu,I really liked the  kit but it shouldve been a Liverpool retro kit not a Saints kit.  For us though the  home kit is my favourite. The I house the stripes are back kit is probably joint with it.  If UA took away the bra looking part from our home kit it would be my favourite though. ,SaintsFC,dgwjed2,1,t5_2tboa
