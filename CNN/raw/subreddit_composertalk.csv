378232,0,t1_cfjrmp6,I think there are so many dimensions to be explored. Tonality or atonality microtonality or total lack of pitch altogether ... and rhythmic complexity for example are super easy to pick up on and use to categorize my impression of the OP but then Part is clearly exploring an entirely different direction.I also find it interesting that some branches of art like music are so hung up on needing to be a new style or new form or otherwise breaking barriers. On the other hand the vast majority of serious modern writers have no problem writing novels in much the same style and in much the same form as they were written a century ago.,composertalk,cfjywnd,2,t5_2t4cu

9239047,0,t1_d8n25v8,I think youre right but I do think that process is important.  Being a composer is essentially the ability to hear whats not there.  Give me a crappy ideaand all my ideas are crappy at the startand Ill spontaneously hear some slight improvement or some subtle variation.  I just hear something and work it until its out.The benefit of process is that it gives me opportunity to hear.  Take a crappy idea but now work it through the process invert it double it halve it break it into its constituent parts play it backwards put it in a blender whatever.  Take the A part now and flip it with the B part make the A part loud and the B part quiet and vice versa if this were a sonata what would it do?  A rondo?  A minimalist voyage?  Each time I hear another variation or run through some experimental process it give my ears the opportunity to hear something thats not there.Very rarely does a composer hear an entire work start to finish from pure silence.  Typically he or she starts with something and then works through a process.  During the process spontaneous improvements are heard.  Do enough processes and listen carefully enough and eventually you might have a nice piece.  Its not the process that writes its the ears.  But without a process the ears get bored.,composertalk,d8n47kb,3,t5_2t4cu
