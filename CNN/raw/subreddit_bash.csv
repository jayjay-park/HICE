2112831,0,t1_cl883ep,Oh come on theres never any excuse to set mode  and especially NEVER on regular files.What you should do is this. Create a new group call it whatever you like but lets say you call it shared for the following example snippets. Add all the users that should have access to the downloaded files to the group shared. Change the group ownership of the download dir to shared    sudo chgrp shared pathtothedownloaddir. Change the mode of the directory to     sudo chmod  pathtothedownloaddir. Set transmissions umask to  if it is not already set to that.After this all new files that get created in the download dir will get mode  because of the umask and inherit the shared group ownership because of the setgid bit the  in . That means all members of the shared group will have write access to the files.All new directories that get created will get mode  and also inherit the setgid bit so really  and inherit shared as group owner. So any new files in those dirs again will also be writable to the members of the shared group.All other users will have readonly access to the new files.Note that this will only apply to new files after the above five steps have been done. Youll have to fix the ownership and permission of the already existing files manually.See  for more on file permissions.,bash,cl8dwr4,1,t5_2qh2d

7407880,0,t3_4gr92u,The sed tool can work on more than one of those s rules if you use it like this    sed saaabbbg scccdddg seeefffg ...The goal could then be to create a long command line for sed with all parameters turned into s rules for it.Theres a command shift that you can use to walk through a long list of parameters. It deletes the first parameters so you need to give  and  another name to not lose them.You could use a while loop that repeatedly turns two parameters into an s rule saves that uses shift continues as long as theres parameters.Going through your script with those ideas I get this        !binbash        infile    outfile    shift     pdftk infile output uncompressed.pdf uncompress    while   gt   do        rulesrules sg        shift     done    sed rules ltuncompressed.pdfgtmodified.pdf    pdftk modified.pdf output outfile compress        rm infileI didnt try this script.That  in the while loop is the number of parameters.

7604665,0,t3_4ilfnz,gt but turns out I cant really make it without some additional scripts and I want to make on on my own. however I cant think of anything that is actually possible to write in pure .sh format.Shell command language is a full Turingcomplete language that can technically do anything that any other interpreted language can do.  Whether you would want to do some things in shell command language is another matter.  Its a very awkward and sometimes slow language for some things.Ive written a few somewhat large programs in shell command language including a selfhosting compiler and some curseslike TUI programs like a PONG game demo and an interactive application both without using other programs like dialog or whiptail.  Ive written shell scripts to automatically install OSes manage configuration files build software packages etc.  Ive even done OOP and implemented goto in SCL.Older versions of a lightweight package manager like dpkgAPT were written in SCL.  I know of at least one blog engine thats written in SCL  A few ACME clients for Lets Encrypt are written in SCL.  Other examples include debootstrap much of debianinstaller many programs in Debians devscripts package and FAIIve even seen games that people have written in sed which is a far more awkward limited and incomprehensible language than SCL is.So there isnt really a limit to what you can do in SCL or any other language.  You can do almost anything with it although its really only popular in software build and distribution tools installers utility scripts etc.  Some projects are written primarily in shell command language but many projects use SCL somewhere e.g. in their build system andor in a scripts directory even if their primary languages are C or something else.,bash,d36m08k,1,t5_2qh2d

E.galias newCommandNamepathtonewbinaryYou will need to make sure that the new binary file is executable to call it directly. You can run the following command to do that.chmod v x pathtofileFor this to persist through sessions youll need to add that line to your .bashrc file.,bash,dbfwvbr,5,t5_2qh2d

10662359,0,t1_ddfon8f,Well in your other comment you mentioned being on Windows and CR LFgt i gave this a try the formatting was done in notepad Windows CR LF changed this to the UnixLF mode saved and ran the script again but it still produced the same errorSo perhaps you didnt save the file with Unix line endings as you thought? Because the carriage returns CR were still in your file.,bash,ddfqotd,2,t5_2qh2d

11309587,0,t1_dfce5pt,The default value for RS is newline which means awk reads linebyline     awk  print Record NR print   ltltlt onentwonnthree    Record     one    Record     two    Record     Record     threeWhen RS is empty records are separated by blank lines     awk v RS  print Record  NR print   ltltlt onentwonnthree    Record      one    two    Record      threeSo it allows you to process in blocks or paragraphs as opposed to lines.Because the original input is block based  using RS allows you to put each result into its own file. uipadkid says they expect it to be exact and only a single result but I think youre right in saying they dont want thatI dont think it fully works though because its hardcoding the content length with A  and not all entries have the same amount of lines at least in my varlibdpkgstatusSo you could just use the awk directly without hardcoding the line numbers    awk v pkglinuximage v RS   Package  pkg  print gt control NR  varlibdpkgstatus,bash,dfdxaj0,2,t5_2qh2d

11641133,0,t3_6636ag,Two terrible ideas. chronic will run a program and buffer its output and then only print the output if the program exited nonzero i.e. it failed. So if you can find a filter that unconditionally prints all input to output but exits according to whether a match was found you can stick that into chronic. I dont know of any filter that does this but I decided I wanted to try my idea out anyways so I implemented it in Node only environment with a process.exitCodelike facility that I know of        git status | chronic node e process.stdin.resumeprocess.stdin.setEncodingutfprocess.stdin.ondatafunctiondataifdata.matchnothing to commit working tree cleanprocess.exitCodeprocess.stdout.writedata. If you know that your output wont be too long you can abuse greps context facility        git status | grep C nothing to commit working tree clean,bash,dgfjaxm,1,t5_2qh2d
