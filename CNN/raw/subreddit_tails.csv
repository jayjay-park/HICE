591366,0,t3_20wvmz,I managed to boot from a burned DVD using the failsafe and nosplash options. Used Tails installer to copy it to a USB stick and it seemed successful.Now trying to boot from the USB...same exact issue as before. It never reaches the greeter. Failsafe and nosplash no longer work and now I just wind up with a screen full of errors and an initramfs with a flashing cursor.This update SUCKS. I have never had a problem with Tails in all the time Ive been using it. Are they patching the security holes in .. by ensuring . doesnt work? I guess its pretty secure when not even the intended user can access it.And of course I cant roll back to the old version because its not available and any time anyone asks about it on the website they are pedantically lectured about the issues of using outdated software.,tails,cg7hq4l,1,t5_2u3sb

8692853,0,t3_4z1xb7,Tails and Kali will both install to a flash drive.The point of using a pen drive is to run the Operating System from something other than the Hard Drive. This allows the session to disappear completely when the pen drive is removed no trace is left on the system.Tails and Kali have different tools and are used for different purposes. Tails is exceptional for keeping you anonymous while on the web. Kali is used for hacking.If your purpose is to use the web and stay anonymous then Tails is custom made for that purpose. If your purpose is to penetrate a network or explore computer vulnerabilities then Kali is what you want. Because both are run from a USB stick either will disappear when the system is powered down and the pendrive is pulled However Tails is better at this since it overwrites the RAM before shutting down so absolutlely no trace is left.The easiest way to try both is to buy  pendrives. Install one as Kali the other as Tails. That way you can take both for a test drive.What your friend suggests if hes not mashing the two together is that you install Kali over Tails ?. That would require virtualization since the Kali Operating System and the Tails Operating System cant both run equivalently at the same time.Tails by its very nature is quite lockeddown runs by default in a nonprivaleged setting and is very security conscious. Kali in contrast runs typically as a super user as root... though both can be made to run with greaterlesser security privalege.If you wanted to run both from the same flash drive then you would also need to install a virtual machine. There would be a lot of work involved. Youd need to boot from the USB into Kali then load the virtual machine Virtual Box then loadin the Tails on top of that.Ive presented this as TailsontopofKali only because the configuration would be easier though none of this is necessarily advisable. KaliontopofTails would be very involved since youd have to undo all the protections built into tails drop into super user mode load packages and dependencies not anticipated by the developers etc  and thereby subvert the purpose of using Tails in the first place.An excellent way to use both is to get the two pen drives. That way both behave as expected without conflict and without difficult configuration and setup.After all if you are going to hide one pen drive in your bedroom you might as well hide two  Thats what I do. That way you can focus on learning the two systems themselves rather than trying to learn how to run virtual machines at the same time and figure out the difficult cross configurations.For example Kali may not see your wifi adapter if run within the confines of a virtual machine  and other such quirks when trying to run both OS concurrently. It can be done but it is a huge headache and can break things.There is a warmfuzzy feeling you get when you plug in a pen drive power up and get a completely new and dissappearing Operating System booting up. Play with it as you like then poof! its gone. No spying. No targeted advertising. No personal profiling. No trace. And both Tails and Kali are a lot of fun.With the  systems installed on separate pen drives adjust your computer BIOS settings to allow a bootfromUSB. Different Mother Board manufacturers have a different button to push to get into the BIOS settings it could be F F  perhaps escape or F. Make sure that boot from USB is before the hard drive in boot sequence. Save and exit the BIOS settings. Power down gtplace the USB stick into any portgt Power up... It will boot into Tails or Kali automatically.A word of warning. Windows  has enabled secure boot ASHOLE !. It means that the BIOS may not be able to run anything but Microsoft signed software. The UEFI boot from a USB stick could be a problem if you are running Windows  and the secure boot has been enabled. If you are lucky your BIOS will either a not have the secure boot or b will let you disable it so that you can boot an Operating System other than Microsoft from a pen drive.Way to go Microsoft... Start with poor security by design sure Grandma should surf the web as a super user!. Next be shocked! at discovering rootkits everywhere. To solve this we will just um... lets see.... make it impossible for software to run on computers unless we signit.Journalists and people living in rd world oppressive regimes can only run microsoft approved software once Windows  locks down your computer. How many lives has Microsoft just endangered.rant,tails,d6s8i9e,2,t5_2u3sb

First put the USB you have down and do not touch it.Next get another USB and follow These instructions When you get to  Install Tails Step number  says Click on the Install by cloning button.
