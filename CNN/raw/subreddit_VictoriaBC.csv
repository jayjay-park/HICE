Fortin hasnt demonstrated any leadership with council and Lisa Helps seems out to lunch on some issues. Ida Chong is a joke and Riga Godron is just a fly on the wall. That only really leaves me with Stephen Andrew a local broadcaster who has no government experience. Hes a very good journalist but that doesnt necessarily translate to being a good politician although it doesnt mean he wont be. Ill probably vote for him because Im not happy with the status quo but it wont be an enthusiastic vote.On the council front however there are several extremely capable candidates. There are some promising younger candidates Andrew Reeve and Ian Hoar who would both be a breath of fresh air on council and Id like to see them elected along with more seasoned candidates like Hilary Groos and Justin Stephenson.

She intends to bring a systemic approach to City Hall in Victoria BC to radically improve services and create new opportunities for all of the citys residents to prosper. We wish her and other likeminded leaders every success. A search for Angela Montgomery CoFounder of Intelligent Management and Lisa Helps will reveal tweets retweets and Facebook likes indicating some sort of established relationship.The article provides context in regards to her recommendation of this corporation stating gtHelps said she met Intelligent Management founder Domenico Lepore before the recent municipal election but he neither worked on nor contributed to her mayoral campaign. Sure Domenico Lepore may not have contributed to her campaign as she says but by the sounds of it Angela Montgomery certainly did.EDIT Turns out Lisa Helps is also mentioned at the start of the business novel The Human Constraint which happens to be authored by none other than Angela Montgomery.EDIT Thanks for the gold kind strangers!,VictoriaBC,cmrcmsy,279,t5_2rbsy

It argues that people die more often when they are hit by a faster car. It does not discuss the frequency of accidents where it was the drivers fault or pedestrians. It does not account for the adjusted frequency of accidents happening in the different speed zones.The Ontario study only focuses on carperson accident occurrence. Some interesting points from the study more populated areas have more accidents less lighting  bad old people die often but represent an expectable percentage of incidents young people represent an unbelievably low value in all categories pedestrians that are hit have alcohol in them  of the time  of pedestrians caused it  of drivers had just committed an infraction hitting someone harder will kill them more often and traffic is bad.The Australian study is amazing. It has formulas datas conclusions... amazing. It points out the obvious but it also gives a mechanism for why the speed should be lowered.

In these days of eBay and Craigslist its probably easier to move stolen goods than ever.Many years ago when I lived in apartment a cyclist friend of mine who also lived in the apartment convinced the landlord that we should be allowed to keep our bikes in our suites as opposed to locked in the storage area. He did that by showing the landlord how quickly he could take the parts off his bike with just a couple of allen keys and a wire cutter he didnt actually cut the cables for his demo.Bikes are ridiculously vulnerable.

I cant stand on a moving bus so I have to do all of that when the bus is stopped and frankly it takes time that often I just dont have.

6515483,0,t1_czt8nc1,Ebay fees are minimal the buyer typically pays shipping in addition to the sale price and neither the ease nor value are exaggerated. I pulled those estimated price ranges off of quick ebay searches as I was making the post so they are accurate and current as of today and it literally takes less than five minutes with a phillips head screwdriver to remove the hard drive and ram. As mentioned the screen is more complicated but thatd only be removed for a hobbyist nerd project anyway so isnt really part of the equation.Youre right about the possibility of bad sectors though as well as gb ram sticks being valueless. Its pretty rare to find a chip less than gb these days though and for  for the lot its worthwhile rolling the dice on bad sectors on the drive which are really closer to  prevalent in my experience though that depends on how old the drive is and whether its from a work machine or a homerecreational machine.,VictoriaBC,czt92tf,1,t5_2rbsy

Then although Id been so patient with them for so long they decided they didnt need to refund me for the service Id never received The connection seemed fine except I couldnt get a single website to load properly. They claimed it looked like id used over a GB of transfer in that time so obviously it had been working.

6770820,0,t1_d0jqopb,gt actually. But it doesnt matter because all three of the stabbings were not random. This does not make it any better! Oh dont worry the stabbing was meant for a specific person does not make it magically acceptable or even lessbad! I dont care who is stabbing who for whatever reason the fact people have blood outside of their body because someone else has a knife AND witnesses refuse to help the cops after is plenty bad enough for me random or not! Th fact it has a direct link to residents in tent city just means its a point worth bringing up.gtThey have no actual justification for making that change other than that they have an irrational fear of the homeless.How about a RATIONAL fear of a place where a major crime was committed and not a single witness would cooperate! gtMove out of downtown if noise is an issue for you. Its inherent to the area.Yes the noise from a now semipermanent  person tent party is inherent to being downtown any major city. I must have just overlooked that part in the near dozen places Ive lived otherwise.Finally once again you  assume based on no evidence I think all homeless people are criminals. Guess what I dont think that. Im sure a solid majority are nice people trying to get by. A vast majority crime free. But that still does not make tent city any sort of solution.You cant go around accusing people of prejudice because it...helps your case? Find proof otherwise I stand by my statement that plenty of homeless are good people but tent city is a detriment regardless. EditExtra As for the protest thing  if they want to protest they are free to protest. I  support free speech I am in full support of protest any protest even if I disagree with the message within the confines of CanadianProvincialMunicipal Laws. What people arent free to do is destroy private land as they pile pallets and tents on a once grassy field which my tax dollars will fix when they are gone violate city bylaws which they do every time they have a noise complaint obstruct justice by refusing to cooperate with police when crimes have been committed that they are witness to or have open illegal drug use which also creates in a litter of dangerous paraphernalia. NONE of this would happen at any other protest it would delegitimize it immediately. But somehow its alright for this one?If their protest didnt directly causeresult in such obvious breaches Id be all for them. But they do so Im not.,VictoriaBC,d0jr52d,3,t5_2rbsy

There is venison sausage clams etc etc. Its pretty shitty to be so critical of a restaurant for using completely normal ingredients. First Nations cuisine is a thing that exists and is fluid and changes just like all cuisines do. Its not an ancient art from the past it doesnt belong in a museum its people making food for other people to enjoy and in this case its a business which needs to be financially viable to succeed.First Nations chefs are allowed to use olive oil and cultivated mushrooms. just because they are a First Nations business doesnt mean they can only use chantrelle mushrooms which are super expensive and difficult to source and are also not in season on the west coast btw. Its crummy to see people jumping to criticize a restaurant not because of the quality of the food or the service but because it fails to live up to their vision of what a First Nations menu should be.

9119957,0,t1_d881k15,I have to agree with this position.The more traffic is constricted along the main arteries the more traffic ends up diverting itself to the residential sidestreets where pets roam and kids play.Ignoring the fact that traffic density continues to increase throughout the city the proposed plan is not only logistically unsound it endangers the safety of pets and children.To make matters even worse that reckless endangerment is not even serving the philosophical purpose its intended to establish  the ethos behind constricting car traffic in favour of bike and pedestrian traffic is to help in climate change reduction but as electric vehicles become logarithmically more prevalent the need to reduce the amount of vehicles on the road becomes inversely proportional.In laymans terms by the time this project is complete it will have become pointless. More cars on the road will be electric and there will be more cars on the road than there are today so all that extra cleanemission vehicular traffic will still need a route to get from A to B.Id prefer if that traffic were on the main drag rather than endangering my pets and kids trying to dodge the bottlenecks by angrily speeding down the sidestreets. Id much prefer to have cyclists divert their routes to those residential sidestreets where they wont have to share the road and air with mainartery traffic at all and where they pose significantly less risk to kids and pets than angry motorists.,VictoriaBC,d882jq8,10,t5_2rbsy

9188530,0,t1_d8goazz,My museum work was only during the summer slowly weening off of it near the end as I found the other volunteer work to be much more interesting to me and rewarding. After that I went back to school in September and applied for jobs though I actually didnt have much luck getting interviews as I only got two. Funny thing is that I didnt even apply for the job that I eventually got with the pesticide company the coop office notified me that the company was interested in talking to me randomly during class in January. So I guess a bit of it was dumb luck but my efforts probably didnt hurt. Im not sure how the jobs are in other departments but I sort of get the feeling from a lot of Coop employers that they are a little biased and lean towards people with relevant reallife experience even though the purpose of Coop is for unexperienced students to get a taste of their field which is a bit frustrating for students looking for their first job. This is primarily the reason why I urge people to get as much relevant experience as they can before pursuing coop especially for biology wildlife where the stuff you learn in school is really not enough.Sorry for the rant it probably wasnt really relevant to you and your department.

9266852,0,t1_d8qmo13,There are probably some good reasons why thats not desirable. Victoria doesnt need more homes it just needs more affordable ones apparently.The idea that we need more homes and need to grow the City is flawed by the fact that the region is already beyond capacity with regards to infrastructure. We dont have the traffic engineering to handle even  of the load we put on the region now. We dont have the medical facilities. There are almost no family doctors available for new patients right now and many walkin clinics have stopped operating or are so busy that getting into them can sometimes not even be certain. There are numerous other similar issues where our population is overburdening the systems needed to support it.Victoria simply cant grow further without something bursting. Increasing housing density to stuff more people into the already packed area would be even worse.If they improved the major road connections to the further communities so that commuting between them was easier then it would alleviate most of these problems because people wouldnt need to try to break the bank just to keep their commute under  minutes. If you could drive from Sooke to Victoria in  minutes then living in Sooke would suddenly be extremely attractive and its already very affordable.I think fix traffic issues and everything else pretty much slots into place comfortably. Unfortunately they are doing the opposite. The city is bent on reducing speed limits even more and most of the provinces improvements to our highways have been changes that reduce traffic flow in the name of perceived safety. Reducing a lane highway to a single lane for instance. The McKenzie interchange might be a very minor improvement but the fact remains that its only a single intersection being improved and Tillicum Rd only a few hundred metres down the road will be the new McKenzie bottleneck.,VictoriaBC,d8qn13j,10,t5_2rbsy

You may find places with fancier storefronts and a wider range of products but you wont find anyone more knowledgeable on Vancouver Island.EDIT At the VCBC they only require doctors notes for psychological and chemicalimbalance related conditions. For physical conditions they just require proof of condition  that can be any official document that lists the condition eg if hes on disability then on one of his disability papers it should list the condition thats enough for a membership.However you dont need a membership if all you want is to come in and get information about what the best treatment might be for whatever his condition might be. Indica is better for some things sativa for others for some things smokingvaping is best for others eating medibles is more effective etc.I usually go to Farmacy or Trees because they have a wider range but VCBC is definitely the first place I would suggest for people wanting to learn about it.,VictoriaBC,dbvmcm3,5,t5_2rbsy

11059103,0,t1_del3eme,Hard to say. Youre right no one knows but there are alarming indications that the housing markets in Victoria Vancouver and Toronto are not stable. For example the household debt to income ratio hit a record high in   This was widely reported We also know that Vancouvers economy surely cannot support the housing market. When your average household income is k and your average single detached house is . million you have a problem. The concern is that people are buying at prices they cant afford if interest rates rise. How affected will Victoria be if Vancouvers housing market crashes? I dont know but I suspect the same factors that affect Vancouver affect us too. Our housing and rental market in the past tended to be in line with Vans. Our economy is stable but our average income is close to the same as Vans.What I do know is that financial markets have bubbles and crashes. This is historically true. Have you heard of the Roaring Twenties? The Great Crash or Black Tuesday was the aftermath of that and was the beginning of the Great Depression. source This quote might sound familiar Despite the dangers of speculation many believed that the stock market would continue to rise forever.People have said that housing unlike every other financial market ever is stable and will only go up  despite an egregious example to the opposite occurring literally next door to us  US Housing Crash and despite historic evidence to the contrary. Do you remember the dot.com bubble and crash? The  energy crisis?I dont want to fearmonger so Ill just say that as long youre prepared youll be fine. It could be decades though I doubt it before theres any serious correction to the market. It could indeed just rise forever or to a point where only the . can afford to buy aka London Paris etc.. And if you bought your home to live in or retire  then I guess thats probably not so bad either since you dont plan to sell. But for anyone thinking of buying please please think about whether you can afford an increase in interest rates  and if you really want to be stuck in the same place for  years if youre buying above your means you will be paying off your mortgage for a long long time.Final note I seriously doubt your house will be worthless even if the market crashes.

11385490,0,t1_dfmhbzs,Im not saying the government should force landlords to charge really low rent at all Im saying what is happening now is totally unsustainable. To say its a purely supply  demand issue is ignoring the reality of housing stock commoditization here and in places like Vancouver Toronto San Fran Australia and elsewhere. These arent purely driven by being a nice place to live and pop growth met with low supply though those are certainly a factor in any increasing market. You can add as much supply in Vancouver as you like and it will be greedily gobbled up by investors as fast as you can build it.   The majority of the explosive valuation growth is driven by speculation and expected market returns. The government doesnt want to restrict this growth because they make a ton of money off of transfer taxes not to mention developer kickbacks and donations and have no incentive to try and mitigate. The fixed term lease loophole among other things allows owners to bear nearly no risk in that they can always make profit on holding the asset by raising rents. Combine this with eating up a big chunk of available stocks for short term rentals and you are fueling an out of control bubble. The government should immediately get rid of the fixed term loophole enforce the existing rent increase controls curb foreign demand with the tax which was sort of effective in Vancouver and in general do what they can to cool the market down to match the economy here. There is very little economy or industry to speak of in BC especially in Victoria but also in Vancouver. Wages have been flat. So its either do what they can to do their jobs as regulators and regulate or Victoria will become just like Vancouver in that its a resort town playground for the wealthy while the locals flee the city for elsewhere. ,VictoriaBC,dfmiy1k,2,t5_2rbsy

The westshore and up island is almost feasible but the municipalities cant be arsed to provide reasonable transit.The whole not entitled to live here argument is so short sighted and completely idiotic. People want to live and work here. Do you propose the city tell them to go elsewhere? Squash their largest growing industries? Tell teachers nurses and other public servants they have no business living here? How dare they want to live in small condos in the communities they serve the entitlement of these people.,VictoriaBC,dg5hwri,5,t5_2rbsy

11620550,0,t3_65twkd,A single room goes for  significantly more the closer you get to downtown victoria. For your budget you probably want to look into getting roommates. Deposits from landlords is half a months rent for a securitydamage deposit. The barnight scene isnt as great as big cities. On weekends everything wraps up around  week nights its a ghost town. Working as a bartender or server in this town is a good place to start we have a ton of restaurants and hotels. Our bus system is pretty good covers pretty much the whole city. Biking is a good plan here we have lots of bike lanes although we do have a pretty serious bike theft issue going on. Just a heads up finding a place can take months. Our vacancy rate for rentals is below  at best it will take a month or two at worst it could take a lot longer. October is a rough time to be looking as we are a universitycollege town and all available rentals will be scooped up by students at the end of august. Make yourself a rental resume get at least one rock solid recommendation letter from a previous landlord. If you dont smoke and dont have a pet it will be slightly easier and if youre willing to live far out from the downtown core.  I dont mean to scare you or turn you away I just dont want you getting here and being homeless for an extensive period of time. We are a beautiful place to live but we are the third most expensive city in Canada and the whole overcrowding thing isnt helping anything.,VictoriaBC,dgd77u0,4,t5_2rbsy

11728847,0,t1_dgpe5gv,I understand it can be frustrating when people spend frivolously and then complain about the cost of living. I tend to live fairly frugally and save as much as I can. Im not the kind of person to go and get a new phone every year. The phone Im typing this on is a budget phone from nearly  years ago. I drive a car that I saved for and could afford to get without having to involve a lender. Im not saying fuck you Im just saying you and I have been fortunate enough to be able to save some money. There are lots of people that cant save at that rate for that extended period of time.As an example lets take a k  bedroom condo. Youre right they do exist. To put  down on this a person would have to save  per month over  years. To afford that kind of savings youd have to be making k assuming a fairly modest rent and reasonable budget. Thats a pretty high salary. If someone came by that salary at say age  theyd be living in a  or  bedroom apartment into their mid thirties before they could afford an sq ft condo. Even if they could land that job and save that much that probably doesnt fit well with their other life goals for their mid thirties.,VictoriaBC,dgphueg,3,t5_2rbsy
