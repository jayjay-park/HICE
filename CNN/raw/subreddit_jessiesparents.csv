1922741,0,t1_ckksvl0,It was her father. It was impossible to not believe her a three year old couldnt know how to explain in detail and in her own words  things about the male anatomy or the physiological response to stimulating said anatomy. Originally the prosecutions plan was to use her testimony from the previous trial and the judge agreed that we could. However it was the defense tactic to call into question her competency because she made statements as a thee year old mind you about how daddy lived in the clouds. Ie he lived on a hill which was usually in or above the cloud line. That would have required her to testify on the stand. The termination of his rights is only happening as part of the deal. As such he cant be charged for the same crime twice. I try to tell myself that him being in prison wont change the fact that he abused her and either way it still happened. But its little comfort.Edit Also I appreciate your response thats why I came here. To talk with people who understand and know how difficult this is. I get a lot of comments from family and friends and they just dont understand the complexities of this. How difficult it is. Of course I want to see him in prison but at what cost? I often get the  if that happened to my daughter Id kill him. Thats a fine statement but its so far from reality. Its also kind of insulting like I havent done enough to protect her or defend her. ,jessiesparents,ckkvkkk,3,t5_2zool

Especially with my dads history I dont think my parents would be okay with not confronting him. ,jessiesparents,d5ctkyy,2,t5_2zool
