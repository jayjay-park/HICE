3275003,0,t1_cp1izhp,I go to the Yellowstone lake public range about an hour southwest when we feel like fucking around no range fees. Havent ever seen a park ranger swing by.So long as you can not be a jackass and play nice with others its a great place to shoot.Milford hills isnt bad either especially when its cold and noone wants to come out to shoot. Their RSO is also a fuckin dude. And will you leave you the hell alone if you can show that you can be safe,WIguns,cp1ksgb,2,t5_31h5i
