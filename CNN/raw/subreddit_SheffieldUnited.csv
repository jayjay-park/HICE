2885498,0,t1_cnw0uo5,Wow that was random! Haha. Not really no. This season has been incredibly unpredictable in that market so I went on a bit of a hiatus. Last year there were  teams that were always nailed on but this year its been unpredictable and was a total loss. I tried a few myself recently without sharing them but they went terribly. I might start back up at the end of the season if fixtures look good though. Look out for me in the sub! ,SheffieldUnited,cnw30qj,1,t5_2xyw8

5475584,0,t3_3q1dmg,Had possession didnt do anything with it.  of the worst goals well concede in a while or a week going by this season. Were scoring enough but were still managing to bugger about with the ball in and around the box and miss so many opportunities. Defence? Sack the lot only K. Wallace has a shout at staying in that back  rest are toss. ,SheffieldUnited,cwbk2b8,1,t5_2xyw8
