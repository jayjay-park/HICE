5076286,0,t1_cuxmntf,Wow next time I make a character who violates physics in an interesting way Im going to be prepared for more questions. Thank you for your interest in the character.. No. She can have at most one piece of herself outside and inside at any one time. So she couldnt stick out two arms from her shadow form at a time either.. She can only become a silhouette on solids although she could become a shadow on the bottom of a lake or something like that. Ice is fine. If she were to washed off a wall as long as the wall remained solid and in one piece she wouldnt be affected.. Wallflower and the rod are ejected whole and unbroken from the brick.. What happened to ? No. Cant project on organics. However a snazzy hat might help you out here.. Yes. Unless she reenters D partially or fully she is as silent as your own shadow is.. She cant feel texture pressure wind heat and so on. She doesnt see so much as sense sort of like echolocation within ft I just realized I forgot to add this to the RT. So she can see everything around her within ft that isnt blocked by a wall or something solid. Her speed should make her natural shortsightedness less of a disadvantage and she can always poke her head out to see for real if necessary.. Yes but only if those walls are connected by a corner or something similar. There must be a solid connection between the solids she is inhabiting.. The smoke grenade is temporarily frozen in time and does not continue spewing smoke. It continues to spew smoke after being returned to D.. She has to remain in contact with anything she takes into D.. Everything she takes with her is frozen in time and cannot function while D. Guns cannot be fired out of the wall cellphones have no reception etc. Additionally a smoke grenade taken into the wall would continue spewing smoke as soon as it was released and a torch would still be on fire.. No organics so probably no. Unless were talking about a synthetic being here in which case this might not be a good idea for her anyway.. She can D up to her current weight limit counting her clothes. Any object larger than that cannot be Ded even partially.. Breathing works via metahuman powers being bullshit because seriously how do you expect me to create a D character and explain how she breathes?. She also requires no sustenance and doesnt age while a shadow. No laws of physics or normal biology really apply here.,WhoWouldWinVerse,cuxvtv7,1,t5_39o7y

5247327,0,t1_cviehox,Why not just have mana be a general field? Closer to like a fabric of spacetime or gravity or something this can be moved around but cannot be created or destroyed what it can be used for is to create energymass via moving it in precise ways. Stuff like wells are points in the mana field that are unusually strong for whatever reason this makes them points however on the other hand it lets them exist anywhere you might find one deep underground or in space. Ley lines are as mentioned lines between a well and its closest neighbouring wells this has a side effect that ley lines are strongest closest to wells on planets as since they are a direct line that is where they are closest to the surface. As well as allowing for wells to be in places that arent super dense with life so you could do something like say Stonehenge is built around a well if you want.This system means that everyone has access to magic as concentrations of mana kind of like gravity everyone is their own tiny gravity well. However unlike the life based system in this everything has some mana larger objects generally having more and mana small nearby objects working partially as clusters. So basically the same as yours except in this case you have everything having tiny amounts so while life rich areas have more as living stuff have more than nonliving its not that much more also allows for stuff like water aligned mana or life aligned mana depending on what its drawn from think of that kind of like a charge? This still makes using mana all about manipulating that field cast a spell? Apply mental pressure to some mana to move it in a way that creates the right energymasseffect no mana has been created or destroyed but rather mana has been dispersed and will be collected to make up for any missing mana by other objects.Pretty sure the mods maybe budget? Not sure have said the white event is never getting explained ever to keep things vague also that its meant to be unique to this universe so making mana responsible should have it happen in others which it apparently doesnt. Alternate universes are just a thing some may just have a base level of magic thats higher than the main one ghosts are souls manipulating magic to affect the world chi may or may not be mana or life force based or whatever. Sapience I dont want to touch really but there is plenty of solutions both magical and not the simplest being evolution like the real world to stuff like souls adapting to sapience with collective improvement of their species meaning given time and nonhostile surroundings all species should eventually become sapient to something like mana doing it somehow.Conservation of energymass is a sham here most characters break it and it just gets worse as you move up to higher tiers the second character Meathead violates it with a regeneration power and it doesnt get better from there. No idea how to pull it off in a vaguely reasonable matter also aforementioned idea had mana being a static total as mentioned.Thats just one random idea and yeah the only living things have it was definitely a major part of my issues. Without that in place a lot of stuff open up stuff like wells at odd places items with inherent magic magical gemstones things like water or fire having unique properties or whatever. Maybe think of my idea like extradimensional matter? A dimension that only mana exists in with a  correlation to the real world mana can move around there which is what magic does and create effects in the real world because dunno.,WhoWouldWinVerse,cvihppw,1,t5_39o7y

5281957,0,t1_cvmrcoy,Alright so before I bein by the way someone else just found a way around the portals so we can add that to the list of weaknesses.Okay treat a portal and its parent object as one item with an invisible and intangible bar connecting them. Pushing on the object moves the portal pushing on the portal does not move the object. These are the rules regarding a portal and its objects interactions with normal matter.Another unstoppable force such as another portal will push the parent object without resistance and will push a portal as if its a weightless extension of its parent object pushing the parent object if the parent object if the unstoppable force would be able to push the parent object of the portal on its own disregarding the unstoppable force and the portal. The ruleset changes to this only when meeting other unstoppable forces not to imply that this is the only way to handle it but how would you personally deal with portals meeting other unstoppable forces otherwise?To clarify you could say that theres an order of superiority Matter Most portals and unstoppable objects Earthlocked portals and unstoppable objects since pushing on an Earthlocked portal with a portal thats locked to Jaunt would be like Jaunt trying to physically push the Earth.Good point on the intangibles I hadnt considered that. I dont know enough about Wardens shields to conclusively comment on that right now but cant bullets break them?Okay regarding the swinging speed Jaunts swords were locked to his hands. Stick your right arm out and angles your hand to the left or vice versa if youre left handed. Flick your hand to the other side as fast as you can. I got about  of a second for a  degree flick. At that speed every meter on Jaunts sword adds about  mph to the tip of his blade as such Jaunt generally tried to distance himself to hit with the tip of the sword as thats where it would hit the fastest. I saw the tendrils as being rigid objects that were only being formed into the moving shapes by Thomas would titanium tendrils bend out of the way instead of snapping at those speeds? If so thats why should have happened and the reaction of the tendrils was a physics error on my part.I thought I mentioned this in the RT but like I said before its a mess so its possible that I missed mentioning it the portal closes if its parent object is sufficiently destroyed. A fender bender wouldnt make you stop calling a car a car but if it were crushed at a junkyard into a neat little cube that would be scrap metal and any portals associated with it would close.,WhoWouldWinVerse,cvmty6z,1,t5_39o7y

7088873,0,t1_d1jw3mr,Of Bone and Ice Part My steps echo as we enter the cavern. The room is dim with wiry fires coming from a few small torches leaving the center untouched by the dim light. There appears to be another identical cell across the path from me. From it two teenagers stumble out. One of whom is a girl her eyes peering around the room. The other I know personally.I remember shaking his hand and a spiked bone burrowing into his flesh. I remember cutting off his hand the bone slicing apart his wrist and revealing the crimson below. I remeber one of his swords bright blue hit the floor and the true him showed. This him had power radiating through him but more importantly it showed no restraint. Like war itself he could decimate anything in its way. Sadly I never got the chance to properly use him.I breathe out focusing only on the situation at hand.Um... Hello. Ronin stuttered his eyes darting around the room. Even though I humiliated him on our last meeting he never saw my human face. To him Im just another meta. My partner cooly looks forward eyeing the girl.This is a scary situation is it not. Ronin eeks out meekly as if he was devoid of true power.Ignore him hes rather meek. A female voice intruded my thoughts interrupting my internal narrative.I am Elise. We have a little... Proposition. We work together opening the door and both walking through. No fighting or stealing. I may not know what powers you have but Im certain that together we can plow through this game.I think it over for a few seconds. For now I could avoid combat but something about this doesnt seem right.How do we know you all wont betray us? What if only two can pass through the door? Then what?Jack refuses to speak staring directly at the girl. Ronin speaks up. I... Assure you. Killing you guys would be easy for me. His red blade flings out of his hand. But thats not nice. His blue blade flys out of its holster pacifying the effect.Is it just me or is it cold in here? Elises voice tears through my mind. No I feel it too. Jack responds. It might be because were underground.Anyways Im Timothy. Nice to meet you two. Timothy. He even has a weak name to follow through with his personality. Timothy. The name of a pipsqueak kid walking to school. Timothy. The kid who grows up to be someones personal assistant. Timothy.Meanwhile Elises condition worsened. Shes now shivering  then shivering even more then straight out convulsing.What is happening? I dont understand.Without taking his eyes off her Jack runs toward her. Im a doctor I can help. I dont know whos doing this but I think its the man on the loudspeaker.By now no one is looking at me as I stand in the dark. I grin before I feel my facial muscles slowly start to peel off. Soon my skull is visable as my face plops on the ground but it goes unnoticed as they flock to see whats wrong with Elise.Help. Help. I can not move. Everything is sore. Jack has propped Elise on the ground now but hes suddenly knocked back by a invisable wall.Stay away.... From Me. My brain sloshes in my skull as the flesh slowly melts of and the air hits the white of my bones. In less than thirty seconds Ill transform and show Ronin who I really am.Elise stopped shivering but is now in an uncomfortable silence. Her chest slowly rises then falls even slower as her dark pupils expand. Whatever happened to her shes effectively dead. Ronin swings his swords at Jack.What have you done? The shockwave narrowly missed Jack but it clips his foot disintegrating it. He slumps to the floor. I have not done anything. Jack screams. Whatever happened her body tempeture reached a critical low level. Shes dead. I couldnt save her.The last of my flesh falls off into the floor in a final shake. Ronin turns and glares at me. Always nice to see an old friend Timothy. Freed from the weight my lovely bones sprint forth catching up to Ronin. My hands and upper arms become thin sharp blades as we clash. Bone against sword.Its so nice to catch up with each other after all these years. So tell me. Hows that hand treating you?He growls has his katanas slice clean through my arm blades. I rush and duck away from the rest of his swings. Today you will finally die.Finally more like I already did. I widen the gap between us and my arm blades regrow again. And I had so much fun I decided to do it again.He swings his red blade and a surge of energy barrels toward me. I barely manage to erect an semidome of bone before they collide and bone fragments shatter around. The second shockwave swung from his blue sword hits me in my ribcage destroying most of it. He holds his blue blade out.Try me. Suddenly in a sudden move he drops his blade retreating his arm backwards. When it hits the ground the blade bends and warps slightly from the impact. We both turn to see Jack observing the battle and then pulls put a pistol. He looks at the red sword but it doesnt move. A loud bang bounces around the chamber but the bullet does no damage.You made a very fatal mistake cold boy. The monster inside Ronin was unleased as he rushes Jack. Ah finally the beast has come out to play.I run for his back and jab my armblades into him. The bone splinters off and drives up Ronins back and burrows into his head. Suddenly hundreds of thin spikes poke through his head breaking his skull. He slumps over to the ground.Jack stumbles back breathing heavily.I...... Was afraid.... She could read into my head. Jack reverts back to his cold self after a few more seconds. So... You betrayed them!? They were going to hand us their keys.My hand bones clink as I smack them together. Couldnt have done it better myself. Now lets get out of here.Jack fetched the key from Elises body finding it in her pocket. I meanwhile gaze at Ronin one final time. I was sad to see him go I remember all those nights in my makeshift dungeon hearing him boast about how all would die. Just makes me miss the castle even more. And my ghouls. The only family I had left until everything went to hell. I pull the key out of his pocket.So you freeze people to death eh? That could be helpful.

9571628,0,t1_d9rv5s6,The Gnome and Riders Magical Froyo Fist continue to bash the large Malformed while Horizon holds it in place. The webbing from Ferner is successful but from all the damage the Malformed is receiving it doesnt have much of an effect. The Malformed starts to burn from Hitler who cannot find any dents in the bioarmor but a rogue electricity arc will most likely hit her as shes not paying attention. Stellaris easily Solar Flares and atomizes the group of Malformed but due to the speed of the others the charge of her nova may take a while. A group of Markii are launched at the Malformed but no one would know the damage he does as the large building is dropped onto the Malformed from Minos creating a massive shockwave as well as dust clouds. The Markii launched most likely didnt survive and the other Metas fighting the Malfromed barely had time to dodge the huge building. Charlie easily uses an upward baseball bat swing to launch the Strategos head into the air and the body a fair amount as well while Jackson snipes the faster Malformed with ease. Prospect is in the middle of the wave of Malformed starting surrounded but easily gains ground with her whip attacks. In the distance another wave of Malformed seem to be charging and the largest Malformed doesnt seem to be visually detectable thanks to the rubble.,WhoWouldWinVerse,d9swcmf,2,t5_39o7y
