256879,0,t3_1x1gvw,Dont implement Shariah Law so tourism may flourish and attract investments. Imagine having beer in Bru for tourists ONLY. So much less money leaking into Malaysia via Kuala Lurah lol. SPN is just weird.Braindrain is kinda sad though. If they are smart enough to study abroad then they are smart enough to realise the bleak future of Bru. Probably the biggest reason for not coming back. Diversify show that Bru is a wise place to invest money and time in. Dont restrict freedom of thinking by using religious excuses?GDP is fucked up. Yucks. Same reason for the braindrain IMO.Diversify. Refer to above points.Freedom of speech. Got none. Monarchy usually does that. It is fine since there arent really news that we dont receive via word of mouth because Bru is kinda small so word gets around. No prob here i guess.Government are mostly run by old folks emphasising on the spreading and the practise of religion. There are some real awesome ministers but the shuffling of their position places the wrongbad people at the wrong places.SME? Whats that?HM is saying pro economic but is doing proIslam and the constant front page news about Shariah Law is a proof of this.Man...sad case this country has become  kingdom of unexpected downfall?

As a matter of fact opposing Syariah Law in order to impress those who are not faithful to religion is as similar as betraying a nation for opposing the law that could be necessary.We dont need to compare Brunei with other nations what is necessarily important is to see this particular nation as an example and implement what is necessary to reduce crime rates whilst adopting Syariah Law.In the last statement we see Syariah law as a means for justice in religious sense it is an insult to our religion that the Gods law is seen as a torture.,Brunei,czhnbyi,1,t5_2s0lk

7169951,0,t1_d1t4rkl,Change is good and change is inevitable. Some short term changes are difficult but if they ultimately lead to improvement then it can be justified. The great lie is that all nations experience change positively when change is actually volatile like the stock market with its ups and downs and in some cases its a complete collapse. Change needs to come in measured quantities and its safe to say that if there is such sudden change for such a small country then it is not the type of change thats good.To add onto that Brunei is also by most accounts thus far a successful and prosperous state. Many attribute this to oil. But we see in case studies that mineral wealth in emerging countries in fact actually tend to head towards corruption and state collapse resulting in warlords and sectarian violence which is evident in African and gulf states oil. Western intervention and attempts to implement free elections and regime change almost always takes a turn in a darker direction. Analysts today mostly agree that it would have been a lot better if Saddam Hussein was kept in power than the mess that is IS that we have today.Its not too far different in Brunei. the fact of the matter is that the culture and mentality of the locals are still developing and cant be changed overnight. A sudden change in leadership results in religious backlash of which is being hinted currently in Brunei. A complete regime change would be a disaster for Brunei and the status quo currently might not be perfect but it has served the country well relatively to almost every other nation on earth.  Brunei has some of the highest income per capita and quality of life indexes in the world among the developing countries and even compete along with first world countries.This is the drawback of western influence and western styled education where students are exposed only to the superficial surface ideas of democracy secularism and modernity and fail to actually flip through the pages of history books to see how its actually failed to serve developing nations. Singapore as an example and even Malaysia was well known to be pretty iron fisted in the days of LKY and Mahatir and arguably is still so in LHLs Singapore today. If your interested you can look into SG broadcasts between key ministers and foreign thinkers. Fareed Zakaria was trying to criticize LHL but LHL gave really excellent rebuttals on how Singapore was still considered backwards despite its ultra modernity on issues like free press political suppression limited citizen rights e.g to protest Disneyland with the death penalty prisoner rights etc. Recent issues like Amos Yee being sued in court and Roy Cherng add to this. Park Chung Hee was also the iron man for S.Korea and is responsible for the success it is today and thats an interesting case study as well. Frankly American styled democracy and election is pretty much a joke to me. It worked well for FDR up to JFK but the way it is now its broken and malfunctioning as it cant manage and represent the country and public interest well enough.I find it all very curious because on this subreddit you find many many proponents of democracy and western American secularism because they watched a few Obama speeches and a few marvel movies and now think that thats the way to go but are really shortsighted and naive about politics and administration in general to fully understand these ideologies properly and see how it is probably detrimental to the country if adopted in full. The political administrations that have worked well for Asia has always been a type of fusion between east and west. If you asked me Id say theyve gotten it right in China Japan and some European countries like Germany. If full on democracy was introduced to China it would result in a worldwide collapse. And we see it failing in India as it has failed to take off properly despite its size resources and development.,Brunei,d1t5mwp,3,t5_2s0lk

7196400,0,t1_d1w4hlw,I think we pretty much agree on the essential argument but in your paragraphThis is the drawback of western influence and western styled education where students are exposed only to the superficial surface ideas of democracy secularism and modernity and fail to actually flip through the pages of history books to see how its actually failed to serve developing nations. Singapore as an example and even Malaysia was well known to be pretty iron fisted in the days of LKY and Mahatir and arguably is still so in LHLs Singapore today.The wording does seem to read like a blanket statement that you feel that democracy secularism and modernity have failed developing nations and not just because you feel they were wrongly implemented but that you dont really agree with them either. Such as where you say American style democracy and elections are a joke and standing up to liberal left wing policies and the negative tone towards proponents of democracy and secularism. My point is I dont think theres anything wrong with aspiring to all or some of these values necessarily even if they have to be built slowly through generations. Maybe its not what you meant either but it comes across that way.Also sounds like a blanket statement on western students. Did you study there yourself and do you know exactly how and what they are taught in terms of political studies?  Have you spoken directly to many and got this impression from them? When you say they do you mean Western culture as a whole or Western governments? Because I dont seriously think that some or even most Western students or people are all for intervention and forcing democracy on nondemocractic countries. Look at how many protested the  Iraq war for example loads of people in the West were against it and predicted whats happening now. I dont think its so much their education as it is partly the influence of mass media and possibly more importantly the geopolitical agenda that these governments especially the US have. A lot of what the American government does isnt purely out of some superiority complex to be a democratic superhero although theres certainly an element of that and the image trumped up by parts of the media but for age old reasons  influence power resources. Yeah a significant section of Americans swallow the propaganda and blindly support that but its not fair to paint them all with the same brushstroke. ,Brunei,d1w675q,1,t5_2s0lk

8039095,0,t1_d4j94x8,To me our oil production companies need to stop the bleeding first. Their aging facilities has caused a lot of incidents lately spill here and there. Protecting the assets is the wisest thing to do in any type of investment. On the side note CO injections or commonly term as gas lift and they are used to support the reservoir pressure which has dramatically dropped. Our oil cant produce efficiently in a natural depletion and this will helps to lighen or should I say make it less dense and easier to produce. For other readers this is not surprising as our reservoir has been producing for more than  years now. What they need to do next is to actively search for new untapped reservoirs while we try to diversify.The reality is our old proven reservoir is depleting aging and dying but there are also other assets that has not been explored and parked or just too damn expensive. While waiting for technology to advance and cheaper to make this a viable investment.When I say we need to diversify Im not saying just the government. Im saying we as the citizen need to give back what the country for what we have been given to us. SOAS did an intelligent move trying to protect our monetary value at par with Singapore. It wont last long. In my opinion and also based on what I have observed our country main strategy  to give educations for the citizen as this is the country biggest asset not the reservoir or anything materialistic also  health benefits  so the educated citizen dont die before they could do something. I dont agree with majority our leaders move and their lack of adaptations to change but some are clever and deserve recognition such as the MOH and Road Management. They are trying with their limited resources and knowledge. For us there are a lot of things we can do to help complaining isnt one of it. We just have to change our perspective and give back. My biggest worries is for our future generations nephews and niece they dont deserve it. if any one killed a person it would be as if he killed the whole of mankind and if any one saved a life it would be as if he saved the life of the whole of mankind  The Holy Quran Chapter Five Verse .TLDR Stop the bleeding in our current asset and diversify Dont rely on our leaders and do something,Brunei,d4jo45x,4,t5_2s0lk

I do have lots to say based on your post but this is becoming an unhealthy discussion. But i do want to say this.You seem to think i dont try to understand them but i do. You complained about a maid not eating with the family thats just words you try to empathize about eating alone. Eating alone doesnt sound so big when compared to being away from family and living in an unfamiliar country. You seem to judge me based on my opinion and went ahead making your own conclusions such as gt At least I try to fucking understand them you fuck unlike you.but you are very mistaken. Ive talked to most of my maids since i was a kid i always called them Aunty i always ask about their country and family because i actually cared. But as i grew up i learned that a working relationship is much healthier for maid and employers. If you cant agree with my opinion than you dont need to i just thought your opinion is very naive and i wanted to know how you formed one. Alsogt According to your understanding being professional is how we should fucking treat everyone whether they are maid or not.Yet you seem to make it sound like its a bad thing but than again youre not treating me with decent manners and respect Dont really care tho.Ill leave you with this an argument should be an opportunity to teach and learn. Instead people use it to stroke their egos by hurting others.,Brunei,d4knxu3,2,t5_2s0lk

No industrycompany so no job offers hence no income and people do crime. If the country develops more industries will lead to more job opportunities. Of course crime and unemployment will still be there but lessen. Take Singapore as an example their development is really fast. In  years time they achieved to what they are now. They have low crime rate. You can take this as an example to your lecturer and come to conclusion that fast development does not lead to higher crimes and unemployment. Indonesia is developing slowly but look at their crime rate and unemployment rate massive. ,Brunei,db4ss20,1,t5_2s0lk

What might make more sense is to encourage more men to consider this with some form of support as it is a great burden physically and emotionally to bear that much responsibility to be fair to maintain such a polygamous arrangement.

McDonalds in Sarawak were about to follow the new rules too but was stopped by the late Chief Minister because the idea of nonhalal cakes in Malaysia was deemed absurd by him.So its up to you guys if you still think McDonalds in Miri arent halal.

11414022,0,t1_dfpr9pq,Ok seriously no offense but why is it everytime I bring up a relevant criticism about microaggressions that happen in Brunei another Bruneian will always bring up that things are supposedly worse in other countries? First there were posters here who bring up Singapore nobody should deny that Singapore has had its fair of human rights abuses but I made a thread about Brunei Not Singapore. Secondly you mention about treatment of maids being worse off in certain Middle Eastern countries. I know that I have even seen the viral video of a racist Arab woman abusing a black maid. However that does not make the microaggressions and abuse against domestic workers which are still normalised in Brunei any better.I have to write like this because this is the problem  whenever relevant constructive criticism is brought up about how unfair numerous Bruneian Malays can be the ones who cant take criticism normalise it by saying behaving along the lines of Yea we did wrong but be grateful were not as bad as others in different nations. Thats nonsense like saying okay Yea theft happens in brunei the rising cases of theft and unemployment in this country are horrible but at least we are not committing police brutality like in Western countries. ?????? Yea its a known fact abuse against domestic helpers happen everywhere but that doesnt diminish the significance of critiquing Bruneian Malays who abuse their maids. Im not saying you cant take criticism as I dont know you personally but Im getting tired when Bruneians constantly bring up other countries to derail from a relevant criticism. Apologies for long post as its also for others to read.

11687103,0,t1_dgkkgqs,gt  jakarta governor Ahok who been alleged for blasphemy towards Islam.I checked the videos and concerning him. At first I would be against him however it was all allegations and he was not given a fair trial on his words. The opposition simply threw around blasphemy etc. and the majority of Indonesias poor are mobilised by it.If you are being honest about Sharia then a person has the right to a fair religious trial against his accusers and the trial must be objective and must not be mixed with emotions. I used up  mins of my time to look at his videos and his accusers.He mainly lost because his accusers wrongly used the religious card. We will see how Allah will judge the people of Jakarta. The former governor it seems has done a lot of good work for the people of Jakarta. If the people of Jakarta continues to be prosperous in the next  years that means they did the right thing ousting him. However if there is calamity or economic collapse in Jakarta then the Indonesian people better apologize to him and put on trial his accusers.Sharia goes both ways.Anyway I rather focus on our own Melayu Islam Beraja.

11745581,0,t1_dgq5c8v,Okay Ill switch off the philosophy.I would agree with you that the Me First Culture is largely generational in nature Id go so far as to add that it could have possibly started with the personalisation focus in technological amp IT advancements. Although it can also be argued that the tech followed the demand rather than vice versa but thats another story.It is an opinion of mine that thats how cultures tend to start off anyway with generationalled changes in core values beliefs standards amp lifestyles. The hippie movement of the s springs to mind here theres loads of people still rocking them tiedyes amp mood rings all the way to . It can be said that if a movementlifestyle choicewhatever garners enough of a following itll become a culture. Nowadays it gets rather complicated to equate culture with race modern day mobility is contributing hugely to the dilution of that particular distinction to the point where sometimes only biology can offer a clue to as to origins.philosophy onOnce upon a time we needed a community to survive as we huddled together around a small flickering fire jumping at every shadow and peeing ourselves whenever ominous sounds would echo out from the night into our caves. The menfolk would take turns guarding their family with their sharpened sticks amp perhaps a knife made out of an animals jawbone.Then we learnt how to make light. We discovered how to make better weapons. We learnt how to protect ourselves better. Thus we went out into the world and conquered our fears built incredible things and we as a species learnt victory.But we failed to realise one thing the further we went the more we started to not believe in one another. With our advances reaching a fever pitch we believed that each of us can be a onemanarmy against the challenges of the world.Thus each man became an island in truth.philosophy offMy opinion is that the MeFirst Culture stems from arrogance and whilst it can be liberating it can also lead to societal breakdown if not regulated which can be a burden in and of itself. The notion of mineandthine can be construed as being diametrically in opposition to the FamilyFocused amp CommunityFocused culture giving rise to potential cultural incompatibility. I dont believe in the MeFirst Culture. Humanity itself is a plural word. But I dont believe in a strict Family amp CommunityFocused Culture either due to the possible exploitation which Ive mentioned earlier. In truth Im the kind of individual who rejects being defined in any specific way. I have my own set of beliefs and values and I live by them as much as I can. I do rock the boat but I dont try and make holes in it either as I do acknowledge the fact that I dont necessarily own the boat there are other people in the boat with me as well as others whod like to use the boat when Im done with it. Theres also respecting the people who made the boat in the first place as without it I wont have any protection as I row my ass off trying to navigate the damned reefs amp squalls of the bloody big ocean that is Life. Summing things up God knows I went way tangential too many times here if I have to be shoehorned into a definition of what I perceive to be where we should be going as a country amp as a people Id like to see the BeFirmButKindCulture in effect.Intelligence grouped together with passion tolerance understanding kindness and with a smattering of good sense. ,Brunei,dgre3i9,3,t5_2s0lk
