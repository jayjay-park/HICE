While this is a fairly common thing to do Id like to take a moment to friendly remind you that it is inaccurate.  The word LEGO should be used as an adjective if it is used at all.  Instead of legos consider LEGO bricks LEGO plates LEGO beams etc. or just bricks plates or beams.  Thanks! t  t I am a bot and this action was performed automatically.
