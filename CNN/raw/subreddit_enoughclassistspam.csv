So it must be a good thing!,enoughclassistspam,dbkzed7,10,t5_3i457
10425459,0,t1_dcps953,gtI dont see anything classist about educating people about where they are on the ladder.Because it assumes they dont already know when in the vast majority of cases they do.gtThats the entire point a vanguard party if you happen to subscribe the leninistic thoughtWhich I dont. Having a petty bourgeois intellectual class leading anything is the antithesis of Marxism.gtEducating people about class is like having a peer help you study sure theyre in a better spot than you know but theyre not here to be smug and rub it your face.This is entirely different. If youre in math class and you know youre having a hard time of it is when you go into peer study. Someone coming up to you unsolicited and saying Hey you suck at this shit. Im going to show you how to do it is condescending first. Second theres a qualitative difference between studying in class and knowing where you stand in social relations. Ive been working class my whole life and out of everyone Ive known the only person who I can say really didnt get it  in terms of where he stood  was actually a truck driver that fell in and out of being a proletariat and being pettybourgeois by the nature of his work. Everyone else even the most reactionary parts of our class know where they are on the ladder.The problem isnt them not knowing where they stand. The problem often is feelings of not being able to do anything about it. Thats classic alienation and its not remedied by some socialist or leftist thinking theyre higher up on the intellectual ladder trying to educate them  regardless of whether that leftist thinks theyre doing it from the point of view as a peer.Having a dialogue with someone is more important. If youre actually conversing with someone from the standpoint of a peer you should talk to them in a relationship of equality instead of assuming theyre dumber than you and need your help.,enoughclassistspam,dcpsm65,1,t5_3i457
