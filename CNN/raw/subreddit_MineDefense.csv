1537029,0,t1_cj8dbby,Youre always unhappy about everything. You want everything to be convenient easy and fast. This is a work in progress. I think you could take a while to try and discover the new updates instead of posting every thought that comes to your head every second. Its redundant and really annoying.  ,MineDefense,cj8xx3f,3,t5_31lw2

2046884,0,t1_ckzzlcc,The  buildings will happen and none will be farms. Like I said Im not going to just leave it unfinished. However not picking the code back up again is kind of the idea.  That being said I wont commit to any schedule but sticking a few new upgrades in here and there will probably happen.,MineDefense,cl005ue,3,t5_31lw2

2605571,0,t3_2pi2ic,Yes it is the total gems stat that matters for unlocking that and that stat includes gems from delving mages.,MineDefense,cmyoowz,1,t5_31lw2
2633186,0,t3_2q2j0r,At the moment you have almost all of your alchemists on making gems but you do have the learn from the fallen upgrade! Delving mages will soon become your best source of gems and then you can devote all of your alchemists to producing units instead of gems. In the short term the regal statue can provide you with some gems keep upgrading it when you can. Dont be afraid to break gems down  every majestic gem can be broken into  great gems. Thatll allow you to put more alchemists on producing units.To get an amazing supply of gems you need to sacrifice as many goblins to the smelting pit as possible which means you need the Have Not upgrade. Your goal should be to have a level  smelting pit and M goblins then buy Waste Not Want Not and Have Not all in one go. The first two reduce the goblins sacrificed but are necessary to unlock the Have Not upgrade which dramatically increases it. So you need stone to get to level  smelting pit and goblins of course. Dont be afraid to stop the smelting pit when you are saving up the M goblins. In the long run itll pay off.,MineDefense,cn2ahu7,2,t5_31lw2

2770280,0,t3_2rqepv,I know its a different post but why not get for the perfect gems as well as the majestic gems and the adamantium get like  of the amount that we currently have eg. .Mgt.M adamantium or something like that?  To me it wouldnt be too worthless or overpowered seeing as the  will gradually go up over time and it wouldnt be a completely piddly amount.  Maybe if the autoquarry checker is on we could see exactly what amount we gained on the statistics screen and put the delay for just that to a couple minutes depending on how frequent the quarry check was.  I know theres holesflaws in this idea but at least Im getting my general idea across.,MineDefense,cniyyad,1,t5_31lw2

9861499,0,t3_5cze2n,Once I hit  HQ I found that my gem production was not sufficient to the task of making the k baggers required. Moreover my ant production was too low  My alchemists were draining ants faster than I could repopulate them. So what I did was set  Alchemist to convert Majestics to HQs then set as many alchemists to convert ants to gems as I could afford without going into the red on net ant gain. The remainder I stuck on goldtomana for lack of anything better to put them on.It took a while but after reaching  Hive queens I had sufficient ant production With a nice x imbue multiplier to devote all  of my alchemists to the task of making more gems. I moved on to the bagger goal then went back to making more and more HQs. I need more ants for my neurochrysalises!,MineDefense,dasz5px,2,t5_31lw2
