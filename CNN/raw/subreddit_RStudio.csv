7196489,0,t1_d1w1r58,So i split the data into a training and test set and then estimated the data to see how my forecasts performed thus i want to show how my different forecasts methods stack up against each other. Thats kinda what i want to show on a single plot. I will definitely play around with the info you have provided. Thanks mate!,RStudio,d1w6kax,1,t5_2wf3j

10883863,0,t1_de2k3c3,Hey man thanks for responding. Im afraid we have to do this using the exact description above for we have to hand in the R script to show that we used the required commands. Do you have any idea how to do it with the above description? Thanks in advance.,RStudio,de2ld0j,1,t5_2wf3j
11025273,0,t3_5x9qrj,What kind of model? What data are you using? Are you talking about the class factor in R? Who is David Collett and whats his curve? Nobody can answer your questions unless you give more details about what youre trying to do. ,RStudio,dehop3p,2,t5_2wf3j
11724491,0,t1_dgjwlyr,I tried but I run into other issues and after switching between RStudio versions it became even worse so I had to clean the whole RStudio user config folder and start from scratch configuring my key shortcuts etc... I just wish they would work more on stability instead of new features.,RStudio,dgp029a,1,t5_2wf3j
