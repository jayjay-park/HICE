But you little compie may call megt TRISS Pirate. pages after that....gt Z The telepad in my room is just a receiver but I can recalibrate it if I have a doctors brain computer.gt Z I can get us both out of here!gt TYE What?gt Z We have to take your doctors computer.gt Tye OO,neokosmos,czpvpvg,5,t5_3apzl

Each level seems to be for different types of experimentation on humans.Level  is for raising humans in a social environment.Level  is for raising humans in relative isolation but with virtual communication available.Level  seems to be for something much more advanced. This is Sevens level.,neokosmos,dcxjtxv,2,t5_3apzl

However the ability for humans in this webcomic to develop psychic abilities seems like a very profitable reason to discover how and why those powers develop. Looks like in this experiment theyre focusing on how social aspects influence the ability to develop psychic abilities which appears to have gone well. The high profitability of psychic abilities might also explain the pirates.,neokosmos,deegxge,3,t5_3apzl
