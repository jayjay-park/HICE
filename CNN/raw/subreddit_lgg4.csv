3940633,0,t1_cr5f5qn,Just personal preference. Ive used it for years on a series of devices. I do try other ROMs but i always end up on CM. Probably because Im used to using it and I like AOSP.Of the other G ROMs Ive tried CloudyG has always been a good one. Probably the best stockbased ROM for the G anyway. I used CloudyG all the way up until CM nightly released for the G then I switched to that. I did briefly switch back to CloudyG when . was released but only to see what it was like and I can tell you that its a bloody good ROM  but its not my cup of tea.Ive tried several others such as ChupaChups and AOSPA. I abandoned ChupaChups for CloudyG as I felt it was far better. As for AOSPA its still in early alpha so Im not confident to use it as a daily driver. Ive also never actually used AOSPA although it is very similar to CM for obvious reasons.What I like about CM is that its available on a wide range of devices crucial to me as I tend to get a new phone every year and I like them all to use a single OS  more on that later is reasonably quick to release on new devices and offers nightly updates. The fact that it often increases performance as well as battery endurance is also important to me although I do recognize that most other ROMs offer this.In comparison ROMs like AOSPA support very few devices and are extremely slow to reach any nonnexus device in the rare event that it is even chosen for legacy support. You can see this by the fact that support for the G only began last month  almost a year after the G released.ROMs like CloudyG being stockbased are only available on the G. As a rule of thumb I avoid stockbased ROMs and only use them whilst waiting for CM as getting used to one manufacturers skin and then getting a new phone and having to get used to an entirely different layout UI and feature set is simply inconvenient.With CM I can be almost  sure that itll be available on my next device even if it takes a few months. Whether it be the S G M whatever. Therefore I only need to get used to a single UI allowing for changes in base Android. Its just more convenient for me.Edit That became quite a textwall. Apologies.,lgg4,cr5gs5x,1,t5_31fm3

4200635,0,t1_cryymxu,Awake just means that the phone isnt in a low power sleep state. The screen can be turned off and still count towards the time if youre playing music downloading something the phone is syncing data or any other number of reasons. Its not an indication of how long youre able to play with your phone on one charge.Screen on time only counts when the screen is actually on and is a better indication of actual battery life to some degree as it is indicative of the amount of time you can interact with your phone on a single charge.On iPhones as I understand you cant see a figure for screen on time and usage time is similar to awake time on android.Overall Im guessing the G will likely have just as good if not better battery than your . Anecdotally Ive noticed that many new androids seem to have better battery life than everything from the iPhone  onwards.Plus if you were to buy it soon you can redeem LGs promotion for a free battery battery charging cradle and GB microSD card. That way you could quickly swap for a fresh battery and essentially never have to use a charger on your actual phone which is really nice.,lgg4,crz2deb,5,t5_31fm3

4230979,0,t1_cs2ddbv,Okay so I think I figured it out.  I had to reset the phone but now it works.  Now when I open the camera app and select the most recent photo it asks what app I want to open it with either gallery or the preinstalled photos app.  With both apps I am able to swype to view my recent photos and delete.  Both however when you click on the recent apps show up as the camera app not the actual app displaying the photosIn the play store there is a different version of photos.  When installing it  it must overwrite the one that came preinstalled since there is only an option to install and not upgrade.  If you install the play store version the problem happens again.  In order to change the default app opened from the recent photos in the camera app you must clear the default settings from the chosen app gallery or google photos not the camera app not very intuitive.  Once I cleared google photos default settings the camera app asked me again what app to open the recent pictures in and I was able to choose gallery which works as you would expect.  I wish I would have figured that out before wiping my phone but oh well.  Thanks for the replies. ,lgg4,cs2ilgy,2,t5_31fm3

Thats the only thing I can think of off the top of my head.I imagine you rooted with the method found here  Open the LGRoot.zip from rooting and use the ports.bat tool to see if your G is being recognized at all by your computer. If it is recognized by your computer then it is an ADB issue if your computer is not recognizing it it is probably a driver issue and you should install the LG USB drivers.Sorry this is all can think of. I hope you are able to fix your phone! Best of luck!,lgg4,ctngps0,1,t5_31fm3

I dont think we will get any other version of the phone so we have to do regular backups in case of bootloop. You have  days warranty whenever they send you a replacement.As for your questions. You can log into your Google account to see what apps you downloaded. If you cant even turn the phone on you wont be able to get your current apps back or backup your phone.. Unless you sync your contacts with Google or saved it in your SIM you wont be able to get it back.. I feel like  of the phone they send you is refurbish. Just continue to use it to make sure theres no major problem. Factory restore it could help.My replacement phone has a semibroken power button....I called them and complained and theyre sending me ANOTHER replacement without the  fee,lgg4,d0ra1i8,1,t5_31fm3

See your box to know your G serial number seek for the first  numbers.    is the manufactured year  is for the month  I believe the G is the only phone with a removable battery  But some phones like the P and Z series are better at battery life.

7597354,0,t1_d31bcvb,Condensation only occurs when theres a higher relative humidity in the environment.  To protect the phone place it in a ziploc bag while outside of the freezer and get out as much air as you can. Youll leave it in the bag throughout the chilling and warming process and be fine.Then place in the freezer for  minutes to an hour worked the best for me. You should be able to get it to boot up then.In my situation I always had to completely remove and reinsert the battery in order to get it to boot.  I also found that leaving the battery in the freezer often meant that the battery couldnt put out enough juice to start the phone  so I left the battery outside while the phone chilled.Then by sticking your head in the freezer quickly open the bag and stick the battery in with it. Reseal the bag then reinsert the battery hold your power button til you feel the vibration and close the freezer for about  seconds maximize that chilling!. Check back on it and you should be good to go  Id practice your motions on your working phone you might only have a couple of minutes to get what you need.When youre done remove the phone still sealed in the bag! from the freezer and let it come to room temp  will take half an hour or so.  Then you can remove the phone without issue  it wont be any colder than the room so there wont be any condensation.I ran through the process several times over the last  hours and phone was perfectly dry after. Ive done the same thing previously with camera lenses that had been outside in the cold  seal them in a bag let them come to temp then remove from bag.,lgg4,d35s4g4,1,t5_31fm3

You are more likely to lose drop or have your phone stolen. Plus your phone would be under warranty. Having said that the chance is still there.I have had zero issues with my phone... no lag no touchscreen issues no battery problems. Most people have no issues if you consider how many Gs have actually been sold. If you need a phone with removable batteries and expandable storage you are pretty much stuck with LG choices G LV or G.

8269818,0,t1_d5ah4nj,I posted this else where but this is my issue with LGThe boot loop issue was happening to lots of phones for a long time before LG even acknowledged it. I have no issue that sometimes there is a fault with a phone or any tech product. What is important is that the company acknowledges the issue and works to resolve it. LG tried to stick their heads in the sand and ignore it whilst numerous users reported LG as blaming them the owners. It was all over just about every tech news website and LG continued to refuse to acknowledge the issue. It was only when it became widespread that they were reluctantly forced to acknowledge it. That is total BS. That is not what I expect from a professional tech company. Had LG acknowledged the issue and apologised and worked to resolve from the start I would have no issue with them at all.Also it is not as simple as one phone call. I have had  emails back and forth before I was allowed to return the phone for repair. During which they basically accused me of getting it wet or dropping it. I now have to wait  weeks to get my phone back. I realise that it cant be done magically overnight but  weeks is too long ,lgg4,d5baalp,1,t5_31fm3

The notifications and toggles in CM are way better and you can have themes for the whole interface that make the phone really attractive.I understand the complaints about the camera but in the XDA thread codeworkx made the CM Camera to work well with the G Camera look for Snap Camera GEdition. To be honest I see no difference in quality between them. I would even dare to say that the only difference is the postprocessing which can be replaced by Pixlr or Snapseed. I also find out that there is a QuickCircle app for CM ROMs so I may be back in CM by the end of the week.Edit I just read through that post and the maintainer says that the camera app in the nightly build is the same as the one in the thread so no need to install the zip,lgg4,d6j1y8s,2,t5_31fm3

Older ones might have been a bit less ones being made this year might be a little bit more but nothing that size and shape is going to even approach  mAH barring a major breakthrough which we would have heard about extensively in the news because it would be literally one of the most important developments in battery technology in decades. Furthermore mostly Chinese battery sellers falsely labeling battery capacity is a very well known and major phenomenon. It costs nothing to slap on a label claiming basically any capacity you think someone might believe and its all pretty subjective to anyone who doesnt have the equipment to actually measure it. Thirdly there arent very many actual factories manufacturing lithiumion cells. Sanyo  Samsung LG Sony and a few others maybe  its a big and investmentheavy undertaking.  A business which has achieved a  improvement in capacity for the same volume isnt going to be selling them as cheap replacement cells on Amazon theyre going to be announcing their billiondollar partnerships with Tesla Apple and Samsung.,lgg4,ddpar7q,3,t5_31fm3
