474134,0,t1_cfu1ai1,Hello do you have any suggestions on how we can promote our sub? So far I have looked into the USS the Free Press the Facebook and twitter and also thought about putting up posters around campus. I also looked at  New School Secrets and New School Compliments and I was hoping to reach out to the people in charge of those two entities.,TheNewSchool,cfu5tuy,1,t5_2sv5u
474294,0,t1_cfu5tuy,To be honest aside from a poster campaign or flyers Im not really sure. In my experience in having mentioned reddit in classes and in casual conversation it seems not too many people are aware of it.,TheNewSchool,cfu6hhe,1,t5_2sv5u
