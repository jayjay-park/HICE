When youre down a man or two you have free reign to hurl the puck down to the other end to relieve pressureget a line change without icing being called. This is the only time when that rule applies.

52387,0,t1_cekc4cd,You are correct in that it could possibly end a soccer players game...however it would be because of the rules of the game and not necessarily the toughness of the player.  There is a rule in soccer that players are not allowed to have an open cut or be bleeding on the pitch.  However if they are able to patch it up to the point where it is no longer bleeding than they can play...and I have seen many instances of this happening in soccer.,nhl,ceke7ne,2,t5_2qrrq

142932,0,t1_ceuooim,By punishing Hartley anymore the NHL is making assumptions part of their accusation. People do not get tried based on their intentions only their actions.Although it seems Hartley certainly had somewhat malicious intentions the NHL can not assume that on his behalf. Unfortunately for John he was less calculated in his response and they are put in a position where he can be punished in a straightforward manner because the evidence is clear.EDIT Also provocation is at the heart of penalties in the NHL many teams employ players who play in an agitator role to force the other team into poor decision making. It is the job of the opposing players to keep control of their reactions and not make a mistake that has a negative impact on their team.

589703,1,t3_20uywz,You can clearly see as Ranger crosses the goal line he speed checks hard like hes about to put a shoulder into Killorn... but then very shortly after decides to turn to play the puck. By the time Killorn has read that body position he has committed to making the hit because it wouldnt have ended in much more than a bit of a bump behind the net Ranger quickly changes his mind and turns to play the puck.Killorn not being able to react in time follows through as lightly as possible and still makes contact in a bad angle based on the milliseconds from the faceoff dot to the hit.Even his followthrough on the hit looks extremely weak as if in midcollision he realized each others body position and slowed WAY up on the contact.In all honesty I dont pay much attention to either of these teams... much less these  players on the teams...but looking back on the gif it looks like a poor last minute change on Rangers part and Killorn committing to a hit that he thought was coming that ended up not being there at the very last second.Its a shame Ranger got hurt but having no bias to any team and looking JUST at the footage it looks like a bit of an accidental aggressive hit.I hope Killorn doesnt get a suspension for this but Due to the severity of the injury I wouldnt be surprised if he does.,nhl,cg7ax9f,2,t5_2qrrq

Since all the games are usually in the evening in America they tend to be at around am for us that makes it hard for people to watch if they have to get up the next morning. I tend to watch them in the weekend when I can sleep in.Also I find that the importance of each game become more apparent as you see the season go on for example if two teams are tied for first in a division their games will be most impacting on that division. Another thing to do is to watch a few games and pick a team to support and watch mainly their games. This is also what I doHope this helps!,nhl,civcphr,6,t5_2qrrq

Two years ago Dustin Brown took a cheap shot at Jason Pommenviles head and wasnt punished in the game but got suspended for the next game. The wild could have used the extra PP time in the game to beat the kings but instead Brown was out for the next game and they played I think it was the Blue Jackets who the wild were neck and neck with for the th spot and Colombus won. granted Brown may not have led the kings to victory but it just kinda bugged me that the wild did not benefit from the suspension in fact you could argue the suspension hurt them!,nhl,cnmbdxr,2,t5_2qrrq

3073515,0,t1_cogb0rv,As a Vegas native living with  roommates who are vegas natives let me just put that shit to rest.  Yeah our native population is far lower than just about anywhere else but we still have people who are tied to this city.  Mayors Goodman have both done great jobs rebuilding this city to get people to have a connection to it.Also we are going to get  season tickets which are likely going to be owned by locals.  Since youve lived in Vegas you also know that to get to the stadium you dont even need to go on to the strip and that it is actually in a really convenient place.  Also as a person who has lived in Vegas you know that casinos like the Stations and Coast casinos often have local only promotions.  If you think theyre not going to be giving out tickets youre just crazy.  Also since you lived in Vegas you know that of the  million residents it is a very small portion that actually work on the strip.  Also since you lived in Vegas you know that there is more to this city than that . mile strip.  You know that they have started adding culture with the Smith Center.  You know that anytime the radio starts talking about our potential new team that they get bombarded with tweets phone calls and text messages.  Factors more than they normally get.God I hope they go with Nevada instead of Las Vegas so that when we do support our team all those outsiders who say we cant support a team wont be able to say it was because we relied heavily on being Las Vegas.,nhl,cogkg5n,9,t5_2qrrq

4188850,1,t1_crxpa3b,The numbers dont support your theory. It doesnt matter how many times its said top  attendance in the league doesnt lie Edit also how is massively cutting demands by locking out hawks fans any indication of a horrible market? the tickets still sell out in under  minutes so clearly we do have the market. I dont really like the practice its just the box seats so I dont see it as such a huge issue but its not a good thing but you cant say that theyre doing this because they dont have the demand to fill it normally.Edit  If you want my totally objective its still pretty shitty thoughts on this corporate purchases are a big part of club ticket sales for most sports in the bay area. We also have a pretty linear correlation between wealth and seating so theres no fever pitch thing where a teacher has club seats. Most of the people in our club levels are either management at companies or really wealthy people who like the sport. Those kinds of people usually dont like rowdy fans or fans who are going to be bantering they also dont like when things dont go their way. I think that the corporate sponsors and various extremely wealthy individuals went to lightning management and said we are very generous and dont like other fans so the lightning fans caved and locked fans out of club areas. They probably figured it wouldnt be a big deal since they left the really good seats and the regular seats. Vinik is very involved in nonlightning aspects of tampa bay and I would imagine he would do quite a bit to keep rich people in tampa happy. Its pretty shitty but doesnt really have anything to do with markets or fans and great deal to do with things that have nothing to do with hockey,nhl,crxq9sr,-2,t5_2qrrq

6690591,0,t1_d0bc56r,Youre completely right about what youre saying. It might be cultural but no offense intended violence and barbaric behavior is just as common in the US as in most European countries. The comedian in the picture you linked might have a good point though. He uses Croatia and Serbia as an example and most people old enough to go to their games are old enough to remember them killing each other. You have many more examples of countries or teams which hate each other because of other reasons than your typical sports rivalry such as war religion politics and so on. But there are still so many teams in the domestic leagues which hate each other and will fight even though they have no history of war.Its really not expected to fight at the games depends on what supporter group youre in but it sure happens a lot. Both in and outside the arenas and all around the home teams city on game day. Im not a violent guy but I still have a hard time imagining myself sitting close to someone with the opposing teams jersey. I must say Im actually impressed at how calm the NHL stands seems even though theres a big brawl with all the players on the ice.Edit And you are also right about the mob A vs mob B. If someone from your team gets in a fight then its expected to support him. Thats when you might see huge fights with hundreds of people. The police are really trying to arrest and fine those who are fighting but it gets harder the bigger the numbers are so that might also be a reason why things escalate so quickly. If a fight breaks loose the cops are often fast into the stands with pepper sprays all over so the fights are just as often with them as the other team.,nhl,d0bd6hf,2,t5_2qrrq

Some say this fair or backwards teams with less points can be seeded above teams with more. But if we just seeded  in each conference you have the possibility of teams in stronger divisions being disadvantaged. A strong division with more parity should have more losses to go around among the top teams while an equally good team in a weaker division would have more points from beating pushovers. ,nhl,d2nllte,1,t5_2qrrq

8012873,0,t1_d4czorn,I got TORN APART when I started a thread on how to make the game more fun. I compared to how the NBA was thriving right now and everyone said how boring the NBA is. Someone also said OMG WE WENT FROM  GOALS A GAME TO  BIG LOSS OMGOMGOMG. That is HUGE. Its why you see a  point guy if youre lucky a season compared to a couple of  point guys with many over   years ago. I just dont get how anyone can say the game is as fun as when it opened up in  and prior to the trapgoalie revolution. It doesnt feel like a game anymore it feels like a system. In football thats fun because theyre so many options and plays to pick from but in hockey it just turns things super defensive. Theres nothing wrong with a defensive game but a wide open game with a couple more goals a game would attract more people. It would allow skilled players to shine and thats something this league needs. Something Gilbert Perreault recently struck me. He said players are so well scouted you cant rely on a star player anymore. Coaches can figure out their moves. He essentially said Howe wouldnt be the player he was back then now because its tough to be great with the level of scouting on offensive games. Maybe Im wrong who knows but I havent seen a game the likes of SabresSens  barn burner in  that had that much energy beyond the scoring. Its lost. I want it back. Sure someone here is going to say the Sabres suck and thats why you think that.

10871103,0,t1_de129cl,Doesnt work well. Since you are from the UK I will use the EPL as an example. The furthest distance a team would have to travel to play a game is between Sunderland and Bournemouth which is  miles which is about an hour and a half plane ride.In comparison the largest distance an NHL team could travel would be from Miami to Vancouver which is  miles which is about a  hour plane ride.The massive distances involved are prohibitive to not having divisions and playing every team  times a season. As it is the NHL tries to schedule games in blocks of travel to eliminate as much of it as possible.,nhl,de19z34,9,t5_2qrrq
10873650,0,t1_de1h9v6,The counter argument and I think its a strong one is that the NHL should be striving to reduce travel issues not increase them. East teams that enjoy never playing an intraconference game reg season or playoffs in the Eastern Time Zone would be rightfully ticked off to have horrid playoff travel. And it doesnt even anything up to have the Bruins play their current schedule the Sharks play theirs and now both teams have horrendous playoff travel. That still has a net effect of disproportionate torture on west teams.E.g. Hey Sharks to make up for your worst travel schedule in the NHL your road in the playoffs takes you through four rounds of Eastern time zone opponents. Suck on that.IMHO thats horrible for everyone especially west teams. ,nhl,de1jfr5,3,t5_2qrrq

But when your team starts losing and you start screaming fuck you calling women stupid bitches and calling men fucking faggots thats no longer passion for the game.

And if you dont like it go to church where your god can save you from all those noisy board pounders.  Wahwahhwahh.,nhl,dfj7ueq,1,t5_2qrrq

11457904,0,t1_dfulyzw,Thats sort of the nature of public discourse. If you put yourself out there people may say or do things youre not comfortable with.  Them doing that is different from there being no repercussions. The whole point of Facebook is to make it easier to get in contact with people.  Anyone too precious to have people engage them should set their account to private or better still dont make one. Messaging a stranger is no less creepy than replying to a strangers comment on facebook or even reddit.,nhl,dfuquif,5,t5_2qrrq

11489899,1,t3_63zlap,Easily one of the most unlikeable players in the league. The Hockey News did an article about Kane last summer and it certainly didnt paint a very good picture of him.,nhl,dfydn6i,0,t5_2qrrq
11503725,0,t3_6414o4,Two powerful organizations with interests that run into the billions failed to come to an agreement that worked for both.  This isnt about what is fair to the players or what matters to Canadians.  I suspect everyone wants this to work out but that what the IOC was willing to offer the NHL wasnt enough to make the deal functional for the NHL.  Its as simple as that.,nhl,dfzy4dt,1,t5_2qrrq

Hes had years with the same basic core of people and theyre not getting it done.Vesey may have been trying but hes been a complete nonfactor this series. Where has Zibanejad been? Youre not going to have too much success when your best line has been your th line and Tanner Glass is tied for nd in team scoring. ,nhl,dgdeugu,1,t5_2qrrq
