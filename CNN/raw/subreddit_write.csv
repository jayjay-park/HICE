178026,0,t3_1vnwpx,. SEMICOLONS! Just forget about them. Youre not using them properly and it looks ridiculous.. You jump into the Did I kill this man? way too quickly. That conclusion needs to be made logically. If anyone saw a corpse their minds wouldnt immediately make the assumption that they were the murderer unless there were some obvious clues. Let the character unravel the mystery when he finds the body.. Dont just describe how the character feels. Show it. Make it alive. He was scared alone and confused? Really show us that. Tell us about the darkness that surrounds him the lack of people the soundless room etc.,write,ceypmv4,1,t5_2qm75
222995,0,t3_1wnrje,Do the characters reference the mysterious light bulb? What do they call it? Does it have a proper name like the everburning blacklight of the bloodchild? But even if the light bulb had a proper name if I were to spend any amount of time unraveling the mystery of the mysterious light bulb Id probably just call it the bulb. The bulb. And that could be your title.Bulb is an odd word though and if you repeat enough it starts to sounds all funny like. So maybe it wouldnt work.,write,cf3ueoc,2,t5_2qm75

960065,0,t3_22xl0g,Ooh funs.Making both the author happy and maximising readability is a real challenge and for most works is a pagebypage effort.Some fairly common standard to help you out would beMargin amp Gutter Most professional printers have requirements so it limits you a little. But a standard I stick with is gt Stick to above . leftright margin.gt I tend to make the outside margin larger so you need to know whether a page is going to be printed left or right.One set of margins Ive used isgttop.gtbottom.gtinside .gtoutside .For the gutter Id set it between . and .... It really depends on the number of pages produced.Font Something sansserif. Means no curly bits. Personally I favour Helvetica World but due to licensing this isnt always an option. Calibri might be however.Size Depends a lot on your font. With Calibri Id use something around px but with Helvetica World Id use between px.Spacing Double spacing is your friend. Spacing paragraphs out makes it far easier to read.For individual kerning Id say stick with the standards unless you are willing to spend a lot of time say  months on finding the optimum kerning.Pagination A quick tip I found somewhere when you deal with numberinggtPage numbering shuld be in the header or footer area of the page  on MS Word click INSERTgtHEADER.gtUse the page number icon to insert a page number  word will automatically put the correct page number in and readjust if you add an extra pagegtNumbering can be changed by the use of different sections BREAKgtSECTION BREAK and the first page of a section can be set to NOT show a page number.I find its better to start with a blank document when building something for printing set up all the formatting first and then add your text.Always check your numbering and section names. Most programs get finicky around them.Also even though you arent doing at the moment never convert directly from Word to any eBook format. It is far better to write from scratch when building an eBook or youll end up with a crapload of CSS... And most eReaders simply block out the authors CSS and make it display with their own. Better to make yours friendly to all eReaders and use standard CSS styling.,write,chdf2l2,2,t5_2qm75
997380,0,t3_25hdtd,I liked it but its largely incomprehensible to most people as your abstract metaphors are a little too abstract shall we say. I found the same thing in my writing when I was suffering major depression. No one sees the beauty in anguish sadness is something to be chased or medicated away everyone must be happy and cheery all the time OR ELSE. Its frustrating sometimes.,write,chhnqya,2,t5_2qm75

7478805,0,t3_4hmt9i,Wow... Thats a bad day. Fired then evicted then embarrassed by a Russian lady at the library then death. Assuming youre Russian yourself from the Cyrillic?I got the sense of dream logic running through the piece  some of the events could seem farfetched but the whole thing feels hazy and inevitable enough that it takes you along with it. Wellpaced. Also loved the section with the fax machine strong descriptions there.One thing that did stick out is tenses keep an eye on whether youre in past It was... or present We see.... The story flows better if this is consistent.All in all good piece. Looking forward to Episode  D,write,d2sapkx,1,t5_2qm75
7799008,0,t3_4lf7qk,gt I have seen the sunrise the last ten days in row and not because I wake up early and go for a jog before driving downtown to work at my internship but because its hard to fall asleep at an appropriate time when you have an abundance of adderall and psilocybin laying around the apartment and even if you run out its cool because the dude with the addy lives right downstairs and the dude with the shrooms is just across the street.I have written my fair share of good long sentences but I can call them good because I include commas where they need to go in order to space out the pace and make it easier for the reader to know where to pause. I would change this sentence like I have seen the sunrise the last ten days in row not because I wake up early and go for a jog before driving downtown to work at my internship but because its hard to fall asleep at an appropriate time when you have an abundance of adderall and psilocybin laying around the apartment and even if you run out its cool because the dude with the addy lives right downstairs and the dude with the shrooms is just across the street. Just check the rest of this work for commas and other punctuation like this. I know its meant to be a streamofthought type of work but its effect is lost if readers cant even decipher it. ,write,d3so3lq,1,t5_2qm75
