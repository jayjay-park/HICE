5334544,0,t1_cvtj99y,Yeah but they had a real chance at being happy. If it werent for Sands reminding threatening him that he is under their thrall Brian would have totally went through with staying with her. Im just thinking he could find a way to make it work get out of Eddies thumb and keep the girl.Its totally a logical decision by cutting off Shauna he has one less variable to worry about if he does decide to attempt to break out of Eddies control.,limitless,cvtjpep,1,t5_2vrxa

5442411,0,t1_cw79ijl,I agree. You shouldnt be downvoted for having an opinion. Its just that people dont like to be told that they are wrong or made a wrong decision so they tend to search opinions and views that are on part with their own point of view and reject others. Is nothing personal just human nature. ,limitless,cw7bk0z,4,t5_2vrxa

5657897,0,t1_cwyacng,You have good points that text thing was funny and pretty unrealistic. BHe just wouldve had to made sure he got Naz back. i mean he really had nothing to lose if this guy wins Brian goes to a cell where they do tests on him all day in DC or he makes a joke that takes a shot at a guy with a big ego. Still youre right super unlikely to happen. They didnt make the pinball thing very convincing. Im sure there was some type of payment there. I mean if Naz paid that one pirate  million and had that apartment Im sure a financial transaction couldve been worked out.,limitless,cwyf14o,2,t5_2vrxa

6153860,0,t3_3zuir6,There is no math shown.  All hes doing is showing the distance formula and the slope formula he used and the answer he derived from it. Plus he had to work within  or  seconds so it was most likely a rough estimate as Rebecca revealed later.,limitless,cyp4omj,9,t5_2vrxa

What it does though is improve your brain health overall and benefit you in all areas whereas some others will only help one. It gives you energy improves mood improves focus improves memory etc. If you want to improve in one area I.E focus other drugs will help more than this. However if you want to improve all around this is the best by far. ,limitless,czb28rg,1,t5_2vrxa

6635048,0,t1_d03ltww,Yeah but thats why shed need Brian. She can point him at the problem and say Go solve it!. Also just because her cover is blown one place doesnt mean her cover is blown everywhere in every jurisdiction. E.g. its not like N.Y. gangsters are going to keep track of blown undercover L.A detectives right? So its possible that she could still work in other field offices else where. Unlikely but still possible. Especially with a little bit of disguising and makeup to change her appearance.,limitless,d05md9k,3,t5_2vrxa
6938952,0,t1_d11pb93,So long as we still have access to the knowledge of how to make those things e.g. through books nonelectronic resources and people with experience I would think that it wouldnt take that long to start picking back up where we left off. I mean the reason why it took so long to build computers in the first place was because we simply didnt know how. In your scenario weve already solved the complicated problems with how to build things like circuits and so it would just be a matter of implementing them again except this time the process will be much faster since we already know how to make them and dont have to spend years figuring it all out.,limitless,d12uy36,6,t5_2vrxa

7152192,0,t1_d1ql4f2,If there is one tiny nitpick I have of this series to date it was that.  It was out of nowhere and again out of nowhere oh we went out once and it was really awkward so......... I guess they had to show Brians feelings of jealousy somehow so went with that.  ltshrugsgt,limitless,d1r4seo,5,t5_2vrxa

7410430,0,t1_d2j6hra,Morra can absolutely run for president as the FBI doesnt have any real PROOF that hes on NZT or of anything else hes done really. Theyve got a lot of theories and conjecture like say....all of those people that Sands fed them were Morras people........they have no proof of that nothing to link them to Morra they just think it fits the facts and theyve got what Brians told them which wouldnt be enough on its own to put away a US Senator and presidential candidate not by a long shot but not much in the way of proof. Which is why they were willing to make a deal with Sands.If they started throwing around accusations without enough evidence to bury him Morra would either laugh it off or destroy their careers. Maybe both. And potentially their lives if he felt like it.,limitless,d2kimrd,2,t5_2vrxa
7470985,0,t3_4g15r3,Unfortunately I have a feeling that it is in serious danger as a show.I could tell that the writers were called back in midseason to see if they could wrap things up should things go badly. The same thing happened to Babylon  in its last season.In both instances plot lines that should have played out over multiepisode arcs were rushed through in just one or two episodes.  The legion of whom and the SandsMorra conflict could have filled an entire season but it was crammed into the final few episodes almost seeming like an afterthought twist.I hope it does come back.  I found the energy and pace of the show to be thoroughly entertaining.,limitless,d2remgv,2,t5_2vrxa

I guess theres just too many dipshits out there whod rather watch complete trash. Just another good tv show cancelled to make way for probably more shitty reality shows.
