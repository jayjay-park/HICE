We have been taught from a really young age not to stand up to authority. Have you ever been in a courtroom? Its all gold trim and stupid expensive crap and fancy suits. Its all to make you feel that you are powerless. ,UnitedBeatsDoctors,dg2rvh1,27,t5_3jyeh
11529463,0,t1_dg2u5ls,From the sound of it you seem to be retarded and cant even use a simple program like Excel.Its not unreasonable to ask a passenger off the plane but when the passenger says hey Im a very important doctor and I have patients I have to see in the morning you should probably see if theres another option. Its also completely unacceptable to beat a passenger unconscious and drag them bloodied and bruised from the plane. We get it mistakes were made that caused them to tell passengers to get off the plane. That doesnt excuse how they handled this situation especially with someone that needed to be on it to potentially save lives. Bottom line is youre wrong youre retarded and youre a piece of shit for defending this kind of brutality.  ,UnitedBeatsDoctors,dg2v7hq,19,t5_3jyeh
