My point is that you say you know you did something wrong but you dont seem to be showing much contrition and you dont seem to be doing anything to put things right i.e. to ensure that the rightful owners of these accounts have secure access to them i.e. not compromised by strangers accessing them without their knowledge or consent and that their reputation has not been tarnished by the actions of anyone playing on any servers using those accounts.,TeamStumble,cilp9i8,1,t5_30yr8
