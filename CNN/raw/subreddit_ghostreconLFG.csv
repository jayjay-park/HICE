11178189,0,t3_5zh2xv, We operate on the mindset that we should have roles and classes so everyone can feel involved.Think Demolition Support Assault ReconSniper. We have limits on what each class can have. Each person also has a light role play for their character. Squad leaders also exist and the other  players in a squad must listen to the leader as to get things done quickly and in a good stealthy fashion. Or in a non stealthy fashion. Depends on how your squad operates.We also have a Assault squad that prefers to go loud a hybrid with a healthy mix of stealthassault and a stealth squad. Sound fun?
