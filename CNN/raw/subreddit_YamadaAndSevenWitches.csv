4207879,0,t1_crzv5sm,seems like a pretty big oversight but whatever I still like the show and plan on reading the Manga although stuff like this might deter me from reading it all because new or old establish rules can just be overwritten for the sake of the plot or a character some sort of convenient deus ex machina..  thanks tho... ,YamadaAndSevenWitches,crzvx4e,1,t5_33ftt

4527675,0,t1_cswnrup,You two are in pure denial. The whole point of that moment was symbolic in that her love for yamada is still the same as before. Not the opposite... If anything shes moving away from her old apparent love of Ushio.,YamadaAndSevenWitches,ct1cmto,1,t5_33ftt

4895076,0,t1_cubk1y7,Have you already read chapter  and ? Those chapters show that Yamazakis predecessor had to deal with two groups that were trying to hold the ceremony yamazaki and leona  yamada and his gang We already know that Saionji was the one who took care of Yamazakis group and the only person left to take on Yamadas group was Asuka. Throughout the manga it has been made it clear that no one besides the president and hisher assistants must know anything about the witches or hold ceremonies. Asuka manipulating himekawa into asking nancy to erase everyone memories was the perfect solution all of this while saionji was busy with yamazaki and leona. ,YamadaAndSevenWitches,cubkax4,1,t5_33ftt

5011467,0,t1_cuq27ot,She has set Shiraishi aside and I think thats probably her way of easing her out of the story so there can be a softer reaction when Yamada and her break up. I mean the chances of them splitting are so high and what with Himekawas vision of Yamada liking someone else the someone else has to be Odagiri or Nancy which we know are both up for it. My money is on Odagiri. She was in the story as much as Shiraishi was up until she started helping Tamaki with the election. Then not only did she come back much faster than Shiraishi she came back during the streak where Shiraishi wasnt in at all. It feels like theyve been swapped out. This doesnt mean Im not gonna be upset when they break up btw Im just ready for it. My only hopes is that best character Itou gets a happy ending.,YamadaAndSevenWitches,cuq2l06,2,t5_33ftt

9032213,0,t1_d7wlkn3,Spoilered just in case someone has read ahead I guessHimekawa had the Witch Power which allowed her to see a memory of the person she kisses specifically a memory of the person that person loves. Himekawa had a crush on Yamada in first year as theyd previously spent a lot of time together so she kissed him but the memory which she saw didnt involve her  more than likely it was Shiraishi. Himekawa went to Yuri heartbroken but the next day she had no memory of who Yamada was. Its implied either Nancy or one of the previous th Witches erased her memory at her request.m,YamadaAndSevenWitches,d7xj20j,2,t5_33ftt
