6815447,0,t1_d0mc0il,I think Monarchs rank was low in part because of his actual arching history. His arching of Dr Venture wasnt Guild sanctioned yet he keeps trying to do it anyway. His henchmen were constantly Murdered by Samson. He killed the first eight of his actual arching assignments and DMTM made it really clear that the Guild was not happy about this. How he was allowed to arch JJ on any basis trial or not is kind of a mystery maybe JJ wasnt as established as he was at the time of his death but he didnt do a very good job with that either and used it to springboard into arching Rusty again anyway which was technically allowed but probably still not something that they were happy about.,venturebros,d0otu00,2,t5_2r8d8

We didnt resolve the Blue Morpho. We didnt resolve Venturian. In season  we had a picture of The Monarch and Rusty playing as children that just kind of evaporated I guess? We didnt even finish repairing the fucking house. We even opened a can of worms with Billys mom being an important character and he never even confirmed that she was a member of Team Venture.We had so much ground to cover and instead we got some awkward nights with Copy Cat. We got some awkward dates with Hank. We spent a bunch of time getting Dean to college so we could have a SINGLE college scene with Think Tank. We kept talking about getting inventions for the science convention that never happened. Dont get me wrong I love the show but with  episodes you need to pick and choose what youve got time for and I think they could have resolved something.I caught the first episode on Adult swim  years ago but tonight needed to payoff all the long running plot threads. We didnt finish anything.Season  had an enormous amount of payoff for the investors the OSI Molotov Cocktease Garys Journey as a Hero.

7009207,0,t3_4bmcyl,This season was extremely disappointing. It was easily the worst one. Out of the seven core characters Doc Hank Dean Brock Monarch DMTM and Gary only two had any real development Hank and Monarch. There were literally no episodes about Doc in the whole season and he is the foundation upon which the entire new setting and dynamic are based. The only hint of the looming specter of JJ was the alarm clock. We didnt even get a Dean episode. I know they basically gave him a whole season but I dont think its asking a lot. The show is called Venture Brothers for gods sake!The only new villains from this season that didnt die Copycat and WideWhale got barely any more screen time than the ones that did.It was not worth waiting  years. And I think Venture Bros. is one of the best TV shows of all time animated or otherwise.,venturebros,d1au8ix,5,t5_2r8d8

7820187,0,t3_4memro,I watched the new season of archer before watching season  of the Venture Bros.  The change for Archer felt to me like the creators are just fulfilling some sort of contractual obligation and I was worried the change in location for the Ventures would lead to a similar feel as in Archer.I was very happy with the Venture Bros.  The characters continue to grow and evolve often in incredibly surprising and always hilarious ways even if the change they experience is profound I guffaw anyway.We live in a glorious time my friends.

10434233,0,t1_dcqrx5z,Ahahaha I totally agree that some episodes are a big ramble and that makes a lot of them even more hilarious. The whole idea where they had tryouts or arch enemies is so fucking ridiculous indeed. Youre supposed to get an arch through something happening where the arch fucks with you or something like that. I feel that Torrid totally pulled this off by kidnapping Triana none of the other antagonists put anywhere as much effort into getting picked as Torrid did. However I think he just took advantage of his situation when he ran into her on the toilet. An RPG or MMO would be really cool. The thing about games especially ones that are based off shows like VB these days is that a lot of them are exclusively for mobile platforms. Im not saying this is a terrible thing but I think it limits how far they could go with the game. Mobile devices are getting more and more powerful every year so soon trey will be able to make games that would also work well on a desktop or even a console. I just think it would turn out as something like pocket mortys. Not saying that game is bad its actually pretty great but its a straight up mobile game. ,venturebros,dcqsgbj,2,t5_2r8d8
