For example if developers take the time to come to the Groupees chat and answer questionstake feedback it goes a long way to making a lasting positive experience.  You support the cause of the bundle such as charity. Your game has been out for a year or two and you want to drum up interest for a new game you are releasing such as sequel.,GameDealsMeta,civd1yl,5,t5_2u7nb

And if a person feels that its just outright wrong then he is going to say it is not ok to do it. And then of course there will be some people who are in the middle saying yes and no.The only reason why you would be asking this question is that you are one of the person stuck in the middle and just want someone else to convince you that pirating is either rightwrong.

2085693,0,t1_cl4ul4c,Yes its free for them to get all the keys they want from Steam but they didnt promise everyone would get keys so theyre under no obligation to just give out  keys to be the good guy indie devs.  And they did give out Steam keys to people who actually played their game and commented to them about it showing that those people actually took an interest in it.  Just because you have it sitting unclaimed or unplayed in Desura I dont see why you think you need to get the Steam key for free now.  Its just one of those things that happens when you buy in bundles you get what you pay for at the time of purchase.  If a Steam key is promised to be given out in the future then yes you can get mad when they go back on that promise but this is just a case of a guy giving out a very early version of his game in a bundle and now wanting to get paid for his work beyond the few cents that were given to him by each bundle buyer.,GameDealsMeta,cl4xr77,1,t5_2u7nb

4405635,0,t1_csm8sp9,Again not really something I was interested in discussing here. And as I said none of this is black and white I was merely turning your argument on its head to show that no it isnt that simple.gt It could be easily ended by legislation and I think in practice it often depends on collusive pricefixing that is already illegal.Thats probably the point that would bring us back to the original problem at hand. The authorized reseller rule in its current form completely dismembers the first sale rule in a market where just about every player has already worked very hard and with impressive success to eliminate it. Price fixing collusive or otherwise has never been easier and this rule is aiding that tremendously.

5689692,1,t1_cx2csuj,Producers not being aware that they are selling their keys is shady. If WarnerBros tells you Hmmm... GMG isnt affiliated with us and GMG says Hello my friend come get our lovely legit keys here it is shady.The keys may or may not be legitimately acquired but the process is shady nonetheless if they refuse to mention how they acquire them.Also its not not showing an online forum confidential contracts its not showing a subgroup of moderators enough information to guarantee your keys are legit.,GameDealsMeta,cx2d0zv,-9,t5_2u7nb
5689694,0,t3_3t0p9m,I didnt read the whole of this thread but I have followed the ongoing discussions about GMG recently.Personally I think the ban  and the rules and considerations leading up to it  are flawed. Here is why  uGMGPlayFireCS is consistently here to help users and reply to whatever he can. This suggests the site is legit because theyre going out of their way to provide customer service  compare to GA or even IndieGala who would like to advertise their links everywhere but do everything they can to avoid actual customer communication. Its clear that many of the people  demanding more information from him have not worked in a publicfacing role customer service or otherwise  if he cant talk about aspects of the job he cant talk about them and its not up to him to make that call.  Hey utastesofvanilla can you please send me a copy of every PM and email youve ever received from a company rep? I wont repost them. No??? Why are you avoiding transparency  I just want to make sure youre not being paid by some of the companies here. This is as reasonable as what you request from retailers. GMG as a whole is extremely reliable. Whether their keys are obtained directly or indirectly is in my opinion a moot point. There have been occasions where their keys appear not to be directly from the publisher. There has never been an occasion where they clearly cheated customers out of what theyd bought  keys from them dont get revoked they dont disappear suddenly and they do give refunds or replacements if a key doesnt work. This is one of several points which sets them apart from sites like GA. Gamedeals is happy to accept price errors. Taking a pricing error as a deal is not better than buying at Mexican prices. Similarly regional deals are posted all the time. In the end if a key is region free whether you buy direct from a Mexican retailer or via GMG or another site it makes no difference in terms of where the money  is going. If youre in gamedeals youre looking for the best price on the game youre not here to pay the publisher the most you can. As others have pointed out tier  support for many companies may not know who their approved retailers are. Its almost certain that t support for many of these companies is an outsourced call centre and the rep just looked at the published list of approved retailers. GA and other resellers come with the likelihood of buying a stolen key. Regardless of where GMG keys are from there has never ever been an incident where a company revoked keys from them as stolen. Publishers can use region blocks on their keys  if they think GMG is buying from cheaper countries and I am fine with that.,GameDealsMeta,cx2d1bb,110,t5_2u7nb
5691659,1,t1_cx2jncy,gt I dont have a list because there isnt one afaik.And you wonder why GMG might be hesitant to share contracts with a group of mods that cant even keep track of a list? AHAHAHAHA.,GameDealsMeta,cx2ltct,2,t5_2u7nb
5692499,0,t3_3t0p9m,Im not sure I trust the Ubisoft response tier  customer support often just works out of a support manual for the most common problems and may have just checked the websites listings to respond to the request which is something the public can do anyway. But the Activision response coupled with the keys being from different batches is pretty suspicious.Thats a shame.,GameDealsMeta,cx2pkhb,26,t5_2u7nb
5692938,0,t1_cx2qk3p,No we banned a company for not complying with our rules. We did not ask GMG for direct contract information and did not ask for any trade secret information. The discussion did not get that far nor did it need to. The open and clear due to GMGs CEOs reponse fact that GMG is selling responsibly sourced keys instead of directly authorized keys means they do not meet the current requirements to post here. This fact was made clear to them during the Witcher  incident and their probationary status would be removed if they there was further evidence that they were not meeting our requirements. ,GameDealsMeta,cx2rj2d,5,t5_2u7nb
5693480,1,t1_cx2tc9y,Yes like I already stated I get all that. But you are making this whole thing seem black and white when it very much isnt.That piece is based on a number of assumptions. Take this entire paragraph for examplegtA common misconception is that keys bought from resellers are cheaper because theyre bought in bulk and they can pass the savings on to the consumer. This is not the case. Instead these keys typically come from regions where theyve been priced for that economic climate. Based on what info?gtWhen we buy from sites that resell these keys we are actively encouraging publishers to increase those regional prices or implement region locks on their games. To dodge the region lock many resellers now requestrequire buyers to use a VPN or proxy to activate and play the purchase.This is more than just an inconvenience it is a violation of the Steam subscriber agreement and could get your account banned.For example buying a key elsewhere in the EU should not get your steam account banned and Id be suprised if Valve did because theres a lot of attention on Eu laws Valve are dodging. The point of the EU is a free market and blocking items behind reiognal locks within the Eu is breaking the law also.gtThe most obvious risk is simply that a key can be rejected. Resellers have no way of verifying if the key you have is valid or not and cannot provide support without extreme measures such as watching your screen during activation. In almost every case youll simply be told youre out of luck.Are GMG telling peopel this? So why are GMG offering refunds for things like Batman.gtResellers better known as graymarket or unauthorized key resellers are retailers that do not work directly with publishers to sell their game keys. Instead theyll buy codes from regions where games are cheaper or through thirdparty sellers. These thirdparties are generally unknown to the end buyer which makes it a blind purchase.Most the time its a blind purchases wherever I buy  most authorised lists are selective and incompelte. As the getgames rep said elsewhere they dont feature on many of these lists same with Gamersgate yet they are buying direct. How would I know this as a consumer? I wouldnt Im blind. According to this I shouldnt buy games from supermarkets as they are almost never listed as official resellers.To highlight the point of how outdated or inaccurate these lists can be just look at your own safe sites. You still list Desura  a site that is now bust that many people never got owed keys from and many publishers never got paid by....IMO only having sites that are authorised to sell with the publishers decision only gives more power to publishers to do dodgy things like price fixing or withholding titles to damage competing platforms like CDPR with GMG.I am well aware there are a number of risks with resellers so dont take this is a dismissal of that.,GameDealsMeta,cx2ty6n,0,t5_2u7nb

I know RES makes some changes to tables to make them sortable so this would be a simpler test caseIf you could leave the W selected in the inspector so I can see the CSS sidebar here thatd be helpful.  Id also like to see if RES modifies the HTML markup in nontable posts.If it does and those classes have any styling in the sidebar my next suggestion would be to try disabling unchecking those styles and seeing if that has any effect.,GameDealsMeta,d1ysfit,1,t5_2u7nb
