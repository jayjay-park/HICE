11406830,0,t3_62siu3,We should launch a full scale offensive against the black and yellow parts of the german flag.,TheFarLeftSide,dfoy7vz,6,t5_3jsf1

11413797,0,t1_dfpqnlm,hmm that seems a bit harsh on our part. I prefer a dark grey or brown solution to this problem.,TheFarLeftSide,dfpqr4f,1,t5_3jsf1
11418331,0,t1_dfq8rls,Because I suspect most leftists around the world have come to hate imperialism more than anything else and are rather quick to support the victims of Israeli violence. Many YPG fighters having faced ISIS firsthand see conservative fundamentalism as a much closer threat and are suspicious of the conservative Islamist forces within prominent Palestinian groups.,TheFarLeftSide,dfq98a1,2,t5_3jsf1

11429366,0,t3_634kce,I propose writing a stalin did nothing wrong somewhere on the flag or at least a CCCP.,TheFarLeftSide,dfri8pj,2,t5_3jsf1
11429501,0,t1_dfrimcp,Imperialistic? Dont compare the Void to the glorious Empire! DWere a potent ally in the war against the void. We even diverted attention from our cog to defend the trans flag when it was encroaching onto the far left. Were nothing like the Void!,TheFarLeftSide,dfriso6,14,t5_3jsf1
11429557,0,t1_dfriwq2,thanks!,TheFarLeftSide,dfrj0vj,2,t5_3jsf1
11435031,0,t1_dfs48fl,Yep. Thats the problem advocating genocide is protected by freespeech so long as its done within the rules of reddit. Organizing a group that defends puppies is brigading and therefore not permissible.Thats how fascism and opression always operates all by the book all within the rules or at least doing its hardest to maintain that image. Its like a termite infestation it corrodes the foundations from within without being obviously destructive. Once the first piece of the structure collapses its too late to fix it.Anyway I dont know what I was getting at but I understand your frustration that we cant employ a by any means necessary tactic otherwise were the ones in the wrong. The whole order over justice problem MLK talked about in his Birmingham Jail letter.,TheFarLeftSide,dfs5e16,39,t5_3jsf1
11436503,0,t1_dfs7g10,I agree that Unity is what we must stive for. Im not here to advocate for a One Party State or any State really but if our common goal is a classless moneyless stateless society then we need a revolution perhaps this century. And a revolution is alway is always an authoritarian action. We must discard all ideology be it statistantiauthoritariananarchistcommunist and concentrate our efforts to abolish everything that creates conflicts e.g. private property capital punishment abstract free will.We cannot abolish hate racism the prison system gender inequality when we ignoring their cause.,TheFarLeftSide,dfsbee5,4,t5_3jsf1

11442749,0,t3_63c7c0,Dont beat yourself up over it at they end of the day it was really fun. And as the other comment said do read some on our ideology worst case scenario you stay the same.For starters Id recommend to watch some of the talks Richard Wolff has on his YouTube channel and for reading The Portable Karl Marx is a good book to get a general grasp on Marxism. Id also recommend you read The Communist Manifesto Socialism Utopian amp Scientific and The German Ideology as they arent long and adress many key belives of Communists.,TheFarLeftSide,dft0wy4,11,t5_3jsf1
11444454,0,t3_639jd1,Lol I see some of my comments there. The Battle of chan was one of the more fun parts of rplace fight!
