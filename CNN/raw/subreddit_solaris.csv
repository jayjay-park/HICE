3018867,0,t1_coava4w,Sorry for the mixup on the Solaris Version.  I got thrown off by the Sun OS Secondary Boot Version . on one of the other screens that normally pops up during boot.This is an original install.  I personally have no real way of copying the machines software off of the HDD to then put into a new install.  I assume there is some way of doing this but its likely out of my league though Ill try anything.I have  ISA boards that need to be used.  They are what communicate between the computer amp the servo drives of my CNC machine.  Also as I found they are required for the machines software to correctly bootload.  So with that in mind I do not know if the legacy software is compatible with any of the stuff you listed.  I also have no way of getting the CNC program software from the manufacture.  I do buying a whole new computer control from the OEM but Ive already been down that road several times with more  spent on this than I care to think about and Im still in the position of having to deal with failing processorsboardsetc.Im still seeking out a way to be able to access whatever error log to see the exact error Im getting.  If there is any other information I can provide that would help let me know.,solaris,coawit2,1,t5_2qhwj
3321942,0,t1_cp6obim,Right. If you want to extend the current solution then step one is to figure out what sort of raid we are talking about. If its hardware raid and it can sync in new disks then you can extend the filesystem with growfs.There are ways to shrink a filesystem but only offline and not with supported Solaris tools. Do not do this. Even seasoned Solaris admins break out in cold sweat just thinking about it.Personally Id just build a new machine and move everything over.,solaris,cp6xhcb,2,t5_2qhwj
4053852,0,t3_32y6oj,Did  vlans on a  way lacp last year dont forget the alternate Mac addresses for each anet. Create the vnic with pvid and id to strip off the vlan tags amp pass intrunked traffic directly to the zone saves untagging it thereAlso use vanity names like vnic or it gets confusing fast.Also this was a cluster of ldoms so ymmv,solaris,cridbt9,1,t5_2qhwj
