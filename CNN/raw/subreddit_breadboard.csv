4334217,0,t3_3amq1y,It just boggles my mind that someone can get an EE degree and not have a multimeter.  It boggles my mind even more that someone with a degree cant even specify what they want in a meter.  You can spend anywhere from  for a cheap Harbor Freight meter to  for a Fluke  to well over  for a bench meter.Dave Jones eevblog has done a number of multimeter shootouts in the various price categories.  That would be a really good place to start.,breadboard,cse71z9,0,t5_2rugg
6329175,0,t1_cz8zc9u,ah the  how many did you test? I remember connecting pin  to VCC and pin  to GND frying some ICs before checking the correct pins for Power...  also check that VCC is in the lower part on pin ,breadboard,cz9239x,2,t5_2rugg
6973165,0,t3_49ykx6,R and R form a resistor divider which provides some portion of the output voltage to the feedback sense pin.  A feedback loop in the chip will vary the output voltage such that it sees some fixed voltage which will be specified in datasheet at its FB pin  you can program different output voltages by selecting different resistor values.C reduces high frequency loop response so the chip wont make huge kneejerk reactions to tiny brief variations in load.  C provides a charge bucket on the output which reduces ripple caused by load variation and ensures the regulator remains stable.  This output capacitor is required for stability by many linear regulator types  without it they can go into oscillation.L and L are chokes used to isolate two separate output lines one for a digital supply and one for an analog supply.  The chokes suppress high frequency pollution on one of the power supply rails from infecting the other one  typically one worries that the brief high current transients due to fast digital circuits switching may make it into your sensitive analog circuitry via the power supply.  C and C provide a local charge bucket on the loadside of the chokes.  The chokes wont really do their job without these capacitors.C isnt immediately obvious nor is the function of the NRSS pin to which it connects so we go to the datasheet.  It says this pin is a noise reduction pin that bypasses the internal bandgap reference.  So they made an external connection point for you to attach a capacitor here that will take some of the random AC noise that develops across the bandgap and shunt it to ground.  The bandgap reference is the critical internal component the chip uses for making precision voltage comparisons so reducing noise here is A Good Thing.The bare minimum critical components here are the linear regulator IC itself the divider network R and R and output capacitance C.  Everything else is there to improve noise improve regulation make it more robust etc.,breadboard,d16qunm,2,t5_2rugg

8083273,0,t1_d4fubf6,Well this is embarrassing. Apparently the email sat there in the draft folder waiting to be sent. Ive resent it now. ,breadboard,d4omu9p,1,t5_2rugg
8683782,0,t3_4l23d1,Just buy through hole header pins if they have a . in pitch. Otherwise for my esp r  I made a break out board and etched it my self. Id share my kicad drawing,breadboard,d6r3jul,1,t5_2rugg
