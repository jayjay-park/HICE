381118,0,t1_cfk9esy,gt I would ask why as an anarchist you chose a particularly hierarchical religion.Sort of a long story here. I guess to start I dont choose what religion it is I believe in its just what I believe in. I was an atheist for most of my life then an agnostic and recently I converted to Catholicism I have been an Anarchist for much much longer. I feel faith in the Church but I feel the Church is corrupted to the core from what it was meant to be hence I wish to reform the Church. Its also worth noting there are calls for decentralisation of the Church in fact in many ways my ideal Church is more of a downup system of organisation think of Priests Bishops Cardinals etc more as delegates in an AnSynd system in the way I wish it could be. The Church has a long history of internal disagreement and without it we wouldnt be going anywhere and we havent even come that far in the first place tbh. I think the biggest pointer for me is in the presence of a poor simple Church filled with many workingclass men women and children I feel the serenity and peace of God there but in the Vatican? All I feel in those massively dressed up goldgilded corridors is a sort of scary ominous centre for pseudospiritual dictatorship thats really the summary of my faith. I REALLY wanted to be a Buddhist when faith began dragging me back but I just didnt connect with it I was connecting to Catholicism and I one day sat down and accepted I believe. gt I would also tell you that no one threatened you and that its stupid to see these arguments happen and all the sudden everyone is moving to ban each other.He called all Catholics fascists then directly said he will shoot Fascists. He also said dont worry ill make it quick immediately after telling me anyone who puts God first in their lives completely ignoring any and all theological interpretations of what this means is an enemy of the revolution. I take these as direct implications of his wish to kill mefellow Catholics.,metanarchism,cfk9nv8,1,t5_2s3sb

1724105,0,t3_2e5wan,I think the notion of consensus is largely missing from both this post and your comment with suggestions. Im kind of new to actually participating in internal organization of anarchist groups but I was under the impression that true consensus  continuing to talk through it in good faith until everybody agrees on a decision  was one of the key ideas that makes anarchism different from other leftist groups. I think we should be clear that true consensus is always the goal.Regarding blocks Correct me if Im wrong but I think oppose means I endorse this proposalnomination but only if a supermajority supports it and I am not part of that supermajority. So if a proposal has  suport and  oppose there is a true consensus  that  support in this vote gt the proposal should pass and so it passes. Block means I oppose this proposalnomination even if it has a supermajority supporting it. If someone is blocking then it doesnt matter if if its  or  or   there is not a true consensus. We have blocks because we think it is that important to value everybody and avoid tyranny of the majority.Yes this sounds subject to abuse. Its something that used to make me roll my eyes at anarchist organization styles in general. But the impulse to dismiss the mechanism because of that is based on a lot of assumptions about human nature humans are individualistic selfish actors who always act in their own self interest even at others expense that we basically believe because liberalismcapitalism tell us theyre true not because we have any real reason to think they are. Kind of like how we believe in the idealistic notion that there are alternatives to the state and capitalism we believe in the idealistic notion that people can work together in good faith.In what little Ive seen here thats how blocks have been used uVindalfr initially blocked the proposal to ban uthisisarecountry which prompted more discussion which eventually led to uVindalfr withdrawing the block. And in the entire nomination thread there were plenty of opposes and heated discussions and drama and accusations of cliques and whatnot but there was only one block. It is a mechanism those using it take seriously. And since the nomination block we have had more discussion of how to justify ignoring blocks than weve had actually trying to engage uvolcanoclosto and have discussion and address their concerns which is not right at all.Basically the rules guidelines? are secondary to consensus. Liberal states put stock in the fairness of their rules which enables them to assume anything that passed their rules is fair. Anarchists recognize that no set of rules we come up with is going to be fair in the way that liberalism believes its own rules are which is why we avoid rigid legalistic structures. The  and whatnot are supposed to be tentative informal heuristics that are valid only as long as we have a consensus that they should be used.Finally as a procedural point uPipeBomb didnt clearly have  support even before considering uvolcanoclostos block so thats not even the deciding factor here.,metanarchism,cjwhkm1,7,t5_2s3sb

2349549,0,t1_cm23t9h,. Perhaps you misunderstood me. Im a security nerd. Security is extremely important to everyone and even moreso to activists of all kinds. We face incredibly powerful adversaries who have used lethal force and even things arguably worse against our comrades in the past to disrupt and suppress us. Leaving the only thing standing against the potential controlannihilation of ranarchism as one moderators reddit account which may be subject to U.S. court seizure I should add or even a few accounts is incredibly dangerous even momentarily. Such an occurrence could in fact be precisely what state powers are waiting for. For this reason I was very disheartened when I discovered whatever it was three years ago that almost all the ra mods had been removed including myself I never investigated further or reapplied for modship. I honestly feel much much better about there being many many moderators. The way that they use their delegated capabilities can be subject to regulation without inviting profound security threats.. Im grateful. This proposal should be tabled immediately until such a point as that has happened.. I would not block that component of things on an experimental basis as long as moderators were not removed and possibly with some added frankly but thats just my opinion. Perhaps you should start by only proposing that. In fact I really think that that is a much better idea than this burn it to the ground approach which has many many serious problems.. The problem lies with what the expectation of moving forward means. If  of the trolls brigading this thread support this proposal will you or any of them then demand that it be adhered to? Or does that simply mean that more specific terms will be laid out and then submitted as a later proposal? Or what? What you have here is not a specific plan  it is hardly even a proposal  and implementing it would be extremely subjective and I can almost guarantee that many people will feel upset about the results on both sides no matter what happens with it. Thats just one of the very serious problems with a vague proposal.Honestly I appreciate the critique and respect your intent behind this even if I disagree personally but this is just not actually an actionable proposal in any kind of real sense as it is now. Shape it up simplify shorten and clarify it include whatever amendments have been brought up here and resubmit your revised proposal later. Until then this thing should be tabled. But I look forward to seeing the next incarnation.,metanarchism,cm245sx,3,t5_2s3sb

People use offense as a way to censor or silence others not taking anything else into effect.  Why would one hold a position why did someone say something and what facts support the position.

The first is comparing the fervor for Bookchin with sexual infatuation which is frequently complicated emotionally and rationally. The second is explicitly a degradation of sucking dick. Then theres my favorite shut your fucking cock holster.

Referencing an action oral sex in general that is generally subservient and then associating that with social domination. It just strikes me as an attempt to stigmatize the interaction largely because of its sexual content. gtFor me not weaponizing sex is entirely sexpositive because I have sexual trauma which is frequently triggered by that kind of language.I dont disagree.

Freedom of speech does not restrict a community from deciding what it does or does not want to hear. Just because you are free to speak doesnt mean we have to listen. Unlike most subs we have a meta which does bans fairly democraticly. The community decides what we want and dont want. What speech we do not want to here as a community is posted.. You have the whole rest of the internet to say what you want about trans people gays furries black people poor people me or even anarchists in general. Heck even many reddit subs support that sort of thing.Youd have a point if the entire internet was restricted to the point where access to a platform to speak was a big issue and capitalism or some other force aritficially limited who could post what. But it doesnt. Reddit lets anyone make their own subs and there plenty of subs which conform to your views and would tollerate your comments. r is not one of them.

After I posted it another user also agreed that it was wrong to be movedgtIm certainly not a doctor and Im not speaking from a sort of medical perspective its more of metaphorical perspective I guess. The social conditioning that causes racism in people is a pervasive anxiety and fear of people of other races brought about mostly out of ignorance isolation and hardships like poverty. Many people are taught from birth that people of other races are out to get them in a general way or in some specific ways. Often they are taught that this other race or races is responsible for their hardships or are taking away something that is rightfully theirs.gtSome people overcome this conditioning with reasoning and empathy some are unable to which leads to antisocial behaviors obsessive behaviors and in some extreme cases psychotic breakdowns.gtEssentially I look at racism as an engineered phobia. Whether its your parents or your community telling you that black people are dangerous and you should avoid them or its Fox News telling you that Muslims are dangerous and out to kill everyone. Someone you trust has told you to fear something and you believe them and you internalize that fear. Fear leads to hate hate leads to anger anger leads to suffering etc.gtWhat keeps me from hating people like this guy who wants to kill me because Im black is the fact that I know on some level he is suffering. He is delusional has broken all remnants of his humanity and for all intents and purposes is completely insane and will most likely lose his life or never be allowed back into society again.gtOn a very real level I feel sorry for this guy. I know thats easy for me to say because I didnt lose anyone I personally knew in this tragedy. But this human being was given a disease and that disease ultimately consumed him.gtWe understand that people in abusive relationships often are conditioned to remain in the relationship by their abuser. They are conditioned to a lifestyle that constantly threatens their wellbeing because they believe thats whats best for them. We can forgive those people because we understand that theyre suffering from something thats clearly causing them to behave in a way that puts them in danger or makes them fearful.,metanarchism,csoiyhs,-2,t5_2s3sb
4441546,1,t3_3bw34n,Hey guys I am the u in question I suppose. Im kinda speechless right now. Heres my takeI love ranarchism. I go there all the time. Today someone made a post that he or she was stealing and cops came looking for him or her and asked if there might be charges pressed.First off no idea why that post was there. That isnt what the sub is about. If anything the OP should have gone rlegaladvice. I dont know OPs story but I believe that stealing is wrong. If you would not like it done to you then dont do it to other people. Sure if you need to feed your family and the only way is to steal then I dont see that as immoral and I also dont believe that stealing from walmart is immoral either because it isnt hurting anyone directly however many people would disagree. Interestingly enough everybody keep assuming that this person is stealing from walmart when that was never really said. In fact there is barely any information given. I dont think it was appropriate for the sub so I commented. I am always ALWAYS open for debate and if anyone thinks that my beliefs are stupid please explain how and please do so like an adult. uneedstrangersadvice is all over the freaking place in that thread. I dont pay attention to the us I just reply. but after going through it again I realized that more than half of my replies were to him. Reading some of the comments here it seems that some of you think that Im wrong so please let me know how and if you are correct Ill correct myself. Thats how I became an anarchist in the first place. As far as him digging through my posts thats a little creepy and I hope uneedstrangersadvice didnt spend the whole day building a pretend internet case about me and wasting the beautiful day we had assuming its a sunny summer day where he is too.

4934620,0,t1_cuginw5,I think it makes sense for a private sub like ranarchism to have a no soapboxing rule when it comes to making threads a reactionary shouldnt be able to make endless posts there just for the purpose of telling you about how Trump is going to make America great again and that you should all go get jobs or whatever. But its currently reached the point where even if somebody was to try and engage one of you in the comment section in ranarchism for the purpose of talking about your differences about pretty much anything theyd get banned on sight just for having the beliefs they have rather than for anything having to do with their behavior.

Even though there is a user tbh its a group of users and I feel that you are in it that are only here to make the discussion of Anarchism less productive. We dont talk about ways to improve rAnarchism or even about the main sub at all. Its just bullshit how Mods are too authoritarian or this troll did that and another troll responded with this.Yall are making this place a nightmare. If a user creates such a ruckus that there are consistent ban threads about them its time for them and the people stirring the shit to get booted.

4959986,0,t3_3iu4h8,IDGAF about this community anymore and will be taking a long break from it so I dont much care about the outcome of this vote. Ill only oppose for lilits sake if desired by lilit.Getting rid of min should not be controversial at all its the obviously right thing to do I cant even comprehend how this is a big deal or why this should be a monumentally arduous process. But because of the institution put in place and a few bad actors even if min gets removed there will always be a struggle to get rid of the next minThame sock or no sock and I dont care for it anymore. Reddit democracy is broken as implemented or working as designed Im not too sure which.Furthermore there will always be friction in metanarchism and its unavoidable as long as the Lets just make r into an outreach tool for nonanarchist white straight cis racist sexist queerphobic fatphobic ableist fascist redditors like almost every other subreddit demographic or the folks who are very opposed to that idea for good reason are allowed to participate. Expect it even after Enkara andor MinThame or any of the other actors are gone. Expect petty bullshit in meta because it will remain so long as the reddit democracy experiment continues.Eliminating ideological enemies is normal in an environment where peoples interests and needs are fundamentally opposed. Consensus is impossible in this world if its allinclusive and a major social overhaul hasnt occured. Since there are already tons of other anarchism outreach and debate subreddits that let in a lot of bullshit my position has always been that r should not be that.SRD threads are normal and a sign that you are operating in an unusualforreddit manner as you should. If nothing else open subreddit politics is a spectacle on reddit theres always gonna be SRD posts and ignorant fucking redditors who dont understand why you would ban people who say cunt unapologetically. Dont get frazzled by it.Allowing enough freeze preachers to participate in meta guarantees the eventual dissolution of AOP and any such ideals so long as the reddit democracy experiment continues. This is REDDIT. So if you value such things you oppose such people. Thats not even going into the rules min has broken and the constant trollingjustenoughbutnotenoughatoncetoevergetbanned behavior I have made threads outlining months of such behavior and it only gets removed by syncopate. I make a thread calling for his ban with no links and it gets removed by syncopate. I remove min unilaterally and it gets undone by syncopate anyone notice an pattern?But getting rid of meta entirely only silences the fundamental disagreement and likely just moves it to r though it will remain so long as any elected mod is really just there to keep spam under control and do whatever else is within Syncs comfort zone.People are gonna get alienated either way so choose one way or another and be upfront about what kind of community r is.,metanarchism,cujqup7,4,t5_2s3sb

5826265,0,t3_3v0okg,. Ban proposals dont need to cite any specific rules broken but it will really help a proposal pass if it does.. Yes if theyre spammers obvious trolls doxxers part of a brigade or violate the AOP in some way. Its kind of squishy and subjective and applied differently by different mods thats just how humans are. Random users who havent participated in the subreddit before are usually seen as less trustworthy and more expendable by most folks who would vote in a ban proposal or mod. Anyway when I was a mod I preferred to err on the side of unilateral bannings when I thought people would generally be cool with it and ban proposals in other cases.. Having a lengthy vote process for every user that needs a banning isnt practical some folks you need to get rid of more quickly so they can stop causing damage in r. In any case at the very least bans can be appealed in meta unless someone goes and does something asinine like call in a reactionary brigade.In Fuckspeciesisms case they responded to a ban proposal for them by calling in a brigade from SRC which is a known very reactionary subreddit which in my opinion and based on precedent is grounds for an immediate ban.EDITFour. The problem with relying exclusively on user votes and excessively caring about established rules on a platform like reddit is that the voting system in meta can be gamed really easily so it can never be treated as completely infallible. Rules on voting eligibility have been established multiple times but even then it would be easy to create a batch of sock accounts let them post and mature for a couple of months and then manipulate meta votes.,metanarchism,cxjckg4,3,t5_2s3sb
