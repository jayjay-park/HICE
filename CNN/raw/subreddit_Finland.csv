46384,0,t1_cejpgph,The beginning sounds like kyllp sin rautaa oh boy some iron youre... but the last word doesnt make sense since raiskailet is as if youre joyly raping the iron. Raskasta would fit with additional word meaning some gym activity kyllp sin rautaa raskasta nostelet gt oh boy some heavy iron youre lifting or so or rakastat as in love but that doesnt make much sense.  It also could be kyllp sin rauhaa rakastat  oh boy you love some peace or so if its not neither iron or raping. But this is already really farfetched.

I think this whole discourse has gone in a strange direction. We havent in any way tried to criticize or make fun of FinlandSwedes but more of stereotypes. The Kvarnbck population has in contrast more reason to be shocked in regard to their reputation as alcoholics and drug abusers and being violent.Interviewer But are they alcoholics drug abusers violent?Svartstrm No. This is about stereotypes..I guess I would have needed to know wherewhat Kvarnbcken is to find this funny.

Also they havent defined a different amount for women which I find lacking. Anyway the definitions vary greatly I dont really know if they can be so neatly compared since the surveys in different countries do not use the same criteria.,Finland,cjovkfp,5,t5_2qztz

1679513,0,t1_cjquvyt,gt This doesnt require statistics its just basic common sense. Why are you so aggressive here?I apologize for coming off as aggresive.gt Its much harder to flee your home nation particularly when you are destitute or an addict or some other kind of shitbag that wouldnt pay their rent than to leave one and return home. To leave to another nation requires much more money than simply to return home. Typically the returning person has friends family contacts e.t.c all waiting for them at home where a local would not have these connections.So the thing is that just because a person could theoretically flee the country more easily that doesnt mean that they are the kind of person who would actually do that. You are making a direct connection between having the possibility of doing something and the probability of doing it without any evidence that this is the case.gt Common sense.I think that what you call common sense in this case is reduced to prejudice.,Finland,cjqv5ka,-2,t5_2qztz

The big change happened in the s and s and consequently a huge number of apartment blocks were built around that time in every city in the country. It was really more about quantity than quality. Not that you have many options for resettling a million people and of course it was still a huge improvement for most people moving from old farms.

3690260,0,t1_cqbw886,Moved back to Finland after living in Scotland and there were a few relatively simple things that made me incredibly happy besides friends and family of course. Houses that are not cold andor crafty andor humidmoist andor mouldy. Seriously a proper warm home isnt apparently a thing to be taken for granted. . As you said bread. Bread that doesnt just disappear if you squeeze the thing tastes like something and actually fills your belly. . As a German you might be able to understand the longing for a good sauna.Especially with the houses they have in the UK. You cant get warm and clean in a way that is even comparable to a sauna in the UK.And lastly. Salmiakkisalty liquorice.They opened a Nordic Affr where I lived a month or two before I left so it helped a bit and visiting friends obviously brought some as well but its nearly impossible to get anywhere else and once you get in the taste its really really something you cant go on without. Anyhow welcome to our silly but affable country.I have to say that youre on the right track with the charming smile and a nice word here and there itll help heaps when dealing with the officials. Unfortunately Finns often forget this. I dont know what you do for a living or what youre interested in but if it has anything to do with gamesdevelopingIT or youre just interested in geeky things we have a IGDA International Game Developers Association event every month in Helsinki not too far from Porvoo. Pleeeenty of expats there so youd feel just at home. As far as I know even a bunch of Germans. Its a bunch of geeks meeting having a few drinks one or two is usually provided by us and a good time with likeminded people. All for free.Let me know if youd be interested at all and I can send you more information.Tervetuloa and all the best!,Finland,cqcwwtg,11,t5_2qztz

Then theres the fact that having discussions in your native language is always easier and as it happens most people interested in things relating to Finland are Finnish.edit If you compare the subreddit statistics of rFinland and rSuomi you can see that before the introduction of geodefaults they were more or less the same in terms of growth and size rSuomi actually being slightly smaller.

I think Im going to go with maple and pine for the bulk of the building palletwood or pine for the floor with basswoodpoplar lattice on top. I think the gumresin of the pine comes out of knots which I tend to knock out of the boards anyways much easier to plane that way.

6402503,0,t1_czh24m3,gt Facts are that most NonEU students leave Finland on their own terms after finishing their studies and never had any intention of staying here past getting the free education.gt I would have to disagree with this statement based on some published data available that was looking at his particular question Do international students of Higher education stay in Finland after graduation? The information is now older dataset from  published in  but the findings were interesting the majority  of students continued to stay one year after graduation and  of graduates yet to complete their degree are definitely considering staying and  would like to stay provided they can find a suitable place of study or work. gtdue to the generous amount of work you can do on the study permit. Most of them if they arent total couch potatoes can legally work enough to pay for everything they need including booze.gtIf we look at the work permit situation NonEU students are very restricted compared to their NordicEUEEA counterparts with limitations on  hoursweek or limitations set by the study program. As parttime or coop positions are hard to come by and nonEU students have to fund all of their own education there is already a barrier there. While  hoursweek seems like a great deal  potential full work days when combined with a full credit load  creditssemester it becomes quite difficult to squeeze work and study and not have the studies suffer as a result. Additionally based on available data employment varies depending on nationality and the Finnish labor market does not really make use of foreign skills.gtSo really you cannot blame the government except for making it so damn easy for nonEU citizens to come here study and work and not give anything back into the country  in the first place. Seriously.gtAdditionally your statement about working in Finland and not giving anything back is confusing. One of the fundamental ways of contributing to a society is working and through work comes taxes. Taxes pay for various social services infrastructure research and other projects and benefit all of society not just students.gtIll agree that its a bad decision to cover up and even worse one that weve had for ages but it seems a lot of people in this sub are really nave as to the intentions of these students. Because trust me I know first hand that most of these people never had any intention of staying here after their studies. Absolutely none whatsoever.gtThis argument seems like an attack on the credibility of the individuals in this particular sub and casting doubt on any knowledge or skills they might share. Since there is only an anecdotal statement what you think some students might do I can share my own the majority of nonEU students now in the high hundreds that I have known through many international programs and multiple universities across Finland have intended to stay or are currently staying. They like Finland they like the fact that Finland accepted them shared its culture with them and allowed them to pursue something they were interested in. Some are entrepreneurs setting up businesses in Helsinki Espoo Turku and Tampere. Others are quite happy working for companies here while others are pursuing masters or doctoral programs for research. Finland is changing and that isnt a bad thing.

I just was under the impression that such revisionist history interpretations werent really popular outside the current winds in Putins Russia where Stalin is being whitewashed with almost hilarious efforts like trying to make the Winter War a heavily disputed subject.Do you really need more sources than what were mentioned in Wikipedia that the puppet governments of Finland and the Baltics were formed by the Soviet Union or about if the Baltics were annexed or not? Or is that not under dispute but only if the Terijoki goverment of Finland formed by the Soviet Union at the onset of the invasion wouldve decided to join the Soviet Union or not?,Finland,d2xr3g0,25,t5_2qztz
7527532,0,t3_4ifmdw,Ill try my bestLike others have pointed out the claim that the Soviet Union only wanted a reasonable safety zone is a post war reinterpretation. The Soviets tried in  to set up a new Democratic Republic on the complete territory of the Republic of Finland and then negotiate some border adjustments with this new state. Today the designed role of the new Finnish Democratic Republic is often conveniently forgotten and only the planned border adjustments remembered.Some suggested readingThe Soviet foreign minister Vyacheslav Molotov spoke to the German ambassador to the Soviet Union on November a day before the proclamation of the Finnish Democratic Republicsaying This government will not be Soviet but a democratic republic. Nobody will set up soviets there but we hope that it will be a government that we can reach agreement with on safeguarding the security of Leningrad. Geoffrey Roberts. Stalins Wars From World War to Cold War . London Yale University Press. . p. . The Finnish Democratic Republic the Terijoki Goverment under Otto Wille Kuusinen was established complete with ministers and led by Comintern member Kuusinen within  hours of the Soviet attack on Nov th . Within another  hours Kuusinen and Molotov signed a mutual assistance agreement and a secret protocol on  December  in Moscow. According to the new agreement the Soviet Union would cede a much larger area Eastern Karelia except for the Murmansk railroad in exchange for the same territories that the Soviets had demanded in earlier negotiations from the Republic of Finland.

7752911,0,t1_d3n5t7i,I know what you mean but Finns tend to value equality solidarity conformity and the deep yearning for blessed mediocrity above individual aspirations. Just look at the comments in this thread for confirmation. I dont think its a bad thing to put the talented kids in the same classrooms with the rest for as long as the smart kids are not being held back. Unfortunately that is often the case and you cant realistically have it both ways. When kids are past yo the system should most definitely start guiding them onto different paths according to their skills talents and interests. The ones who are for example good in mathematics should not be weighed down by morons in class just for the sake of social harmony. In practice either the smart kids get ahead or you flatten their interests by ignoring their boredom. Sadly the system often chooses the latter. The situation always depends on the teachers and the parents but too often society chooses to waste developing talent for the sake of trying to raise welladjusted adults. I think its misguided but I know my point of view and yours I surmise doesnt get much support.Actually to put it in slightly different words... I think the absolutely worst part is that the smart kids are implicitly taught that schools easy for them because theyre inherently smart. This promotes a terrible lesson for them. Its far more important to value practice and perseverance and be socially functional than just be complacent in ones giftedness. Kids should be taught that success comes through systematically working towards their goals and usually with other people and not from some innate talent they posses. Something needs to be done so the smart kids dont get bored and sidetracked in class. It can probably be done within the confines of a normal peruskoulu class but it requires attention and extra work from the teachers to keep the smart kids engaged.,Finland,d3ng55r,0,t5_2qztz

In most places you pretty much have to risk your life to be allowed to cross the road or then wait what feels like an eternity. Even in really crowded touristy places like the Helsinki Kauppatori area people drive like they are fleeing from a nuclear explosion not even thinking about what would happen if a bunch of tourists just walked into the street. Also more often than not its completely irrational not to stop because theres a red light ahead anyway. Just. Fucking. Stop. Its. The. Law.Whats worse is that Ive started to do this myself. I understand that its sometimes a little hard to see in the city and mistakes can happen. But it really feels like people have been taught that this is okay. But its not.

8986872,0,t3_539caz,I have one or two things to say in this matter.Guys belonging to the same organization as the fascists featured in the news story tried to do pretty much the same thing to the thenchairman of the local union Im a member of in here in Sweden two years ago. A group of them were doing a flier action in central town pushing leaflets inciting to violence against certain groups of people and also arguing that the massmurder of jews during WWII didnt happen. When some people stopped to express their dissent with the nazis one of them proceeded to stab the chef his profession with their flagpole apparently they often use these as weapons and thus their top ends are sharpened and the others pushed and kicked him so he fell into a HampM store. In broad daylight with bystanders. This is standard modus operandi for them and they also described the assault as disciplinary measures against for a for them unwanted person in their media following this.We have to wait and see what the investigation turns out but be aware this organization usually operates like this and has a proven policy of hiding members wanted for murders or other crimes in an adjacent Nordic country. Hopefully the police in Helsinki will be more thorough than in Uppsala where they folded the investigation twice. Only media attention managed to make things move again as journalists could point out that the police hadnt done forensic analysis of good video footage they had had access to even early on and in which you could see the attack and also identify the assailants  some of which were already wanted for a previous attack.These people use violence to try to scare people into staying silent and have a macho kind of ethics where it does not really matter if things result in sentences. Luckily even despite threats after this event and vandalism against his apartment the chef is back in full health and says he will never stop doing his union work. His spirit is much like that of mildmannered Bjrn Sderberg another syndicalist trade unionist. Bjrn was murdered by nazis in  he had exposed a nazi who had infiltrated the local social democrat union club in the warehouse they were working  therefore they had to shoot him in the morning outside his apartment with Bjrn only wearing underwear socks and a college shirt. This is the face of racist violence just because people say that everyone on the job should work together to make the workplace and the world a better place. In Sweden there is a day which is honoured to his memory the day of civil courage on October th. My hunch is that the bystander who died acted in a way which would have made Sderberg proud.

9417565,0,t1_d99pfz1,Maybe not the best thing to happen but Nokias downfall had its upsides. I used to be close to Helsinkis startup scene between about  and  and Im fairly sure its development wouldve been stunted if Nokia hadnt stumbled. Nokia in its heyday was a too big a firm for Finland and it was affecting our economy and even politics in an unhealthy manner. It vacuumed plenty of the smartest graduates and the focus of our politicians and like the quote above implies Nokias downfall freed andor forced these people among others to do other things and look at things differently.The business ecosystem and startup ecosystem in particular got a boost in form of talented people who had got extremely valuable and in Finland still somewhat rare international experience and exposure in cutting edge hardware and software business. The contacts alone were extremely valuable to many startups not to mention the skills many of these guys brought to the table. For what its worth my belief based on working as an occasional product development consultant to Nokia from  onwards is that the downfall was very much a result of the management from middlemanagement upwards becoming bloated while being blinded by its own success. One guy summarized the situation as there are too many people who can say no. Partially because the management had drunk its own KoolAid partly because middle managers became very afraid of risks and partly because the management bloat promoted some people who perhaps shouldnt have been promoted there was a widespread resistance towards doing things in any other way than the Nokia Way which was the bestest and the only way there could be. And it only took one guy with a veto power to scupper any sort of change.The product development and research arms did great work even though perhaps with a little too much creative freedom and not enough focus at times and from early s had little doubt Nokia would have to move towards an application ecosystembased business model  which was arguably the key to the success of iPhone and paved way for Android. It was the availability of all sorts of useful and fun apps combined with a very usable design that broke the bank for iPhone not design alone. But for a variety of reasons these initiatives were ignored or crushed internally and Nokia continued to do what it knew the best churning out a dizzying variety of phones which all but destroyed the possibility for an app market in a lucrativeenough scale and relying on its excellent logistical and manufacturing competences to churn those phones out with low costs and for a time high profit margins. In fact it was not a too much of an exaggeration in my opinion to say that Nokia was a logistics company design and all other considerations played at best a second fiddle despite all the hoopla about the design efforts which were real enough Nokia put to its phones. In my opinion these were major factors behind otherwise strange decisions like the decision to keep soldiering on with resourceefficient Symbian even long after it ceased to made any sense.But this recipe  flooding the market with cheap phones  had propelled Nokia to success when the phones were simple and downloadable apps were at best a curiosity. This had also generated the enormous options that had made some early Nokia managers and key developers very wealthy indeed  and left others without any extra compensation whatsoever in what was often a very arbitrary and unfair manner. This caused plenty of resentment and led to several smart people leaving the firm.So the product developers knew Nokia had to introduce a platform device that would enable a thriving application ecosystem to develop. They even had prototype devices ready in about  or so with design and specs quite like the iPhone. Though they still had the problem of running on Symbian which wasnt the most developerfriendly operating system to say the least. But one of my contacts told me later that the reason top management ultimately pulled the plug from that project was because Nokia didnt own all the patents required and this was against company policy at the time unfortunately capacitative touch screens were among those patents. This line of research did result to exploration in form of Nokias internet devices like  but these were never anything more than a sideline. My personal breaking point with Nokia came when I was tasked to run headtohead usability tests with iPhone an early Android device and the horrorshow that was Nokia N iPhone killer. Not one of our test subjects could complete the test protocol with N every one was able to do so with the iPhone despite having no instructions and most having zero experience with the iPhone. Even I struggled and only after I thought well how would I do this thing in Windows . of  vintage did I finally succeeded. That was precisely the moment when I concluded the company that had built much of its reputation with easytouse phones had gone beyond saving. ,Finland,d99qpl1,8,t5_2qztz

So makes easier to manipulate equipment radios rifles stoves maps important documents etc. in the dark. The field tents are rather dark and badly lit also so it helps to find way around the tent.Though with those one must remember when to and when not to use one. Since waving around a bright light during exercise when one is supposed to be hiding is a rather bad idea. Might include shouting by trainers in the end about Jaeger x being dumb and giving away whole platoons position.Extra tip. If you have the cash to fork out some headlamps include a red filter or separate red color position. Helps to keep ones night sight being blinded by the white light.

9798448,0,t3_5fat2e,Ill rather answer this as a student of urban planning myself. But seriously more specific questions would help. There are plenty of articles and videos online about life in Finland.The lifestyle nowadays isnt significantly different from other Western countries. Office jobs fast food restaurants pop music jeans all that jazz. Stereotypically Finns value personal space and keep others at an arms length  except in the sauna. The society is relatively egalitarian and safe there are no real ghettos nor gated communities anywhere and the President can call a radio show to ask about parsnipsFrom an urban development perspective its important to note that Finland urbanized very late or arguably almost never. As recently as the s half of the population still got their livelihood from agriculture or forestry a good  of the country is covered in forest while the number has dropped to  now with ever increasing automation.People really started flocking to the cities in the s and s. At the time dense cities were seen as outdated relics everywhere and Finland was no exception. In response we didnt get Americanstyle cookiecutter suburbia but loose clusters of concrete apartment blocks and singlefamily houses became the norm. Even so many people remained in the countryside. Finland is entirely split into municipalities that is there can by law be no unincorporated areas which are mandated to provide basic services for everyone so its comparatively easy to live in the middle of nowhere.More recently with a continuing shift to a servicebased and digital economy an aging population the ubiquitious sera apartment blocks requiring expensive renovation and the small rural or exindustrial municipalities increasingly running bankrupt from the aforementioned services with state support keeping things barely running the trend towards urbanization has continued more strongly The two biggest cities Helsinki and Tampere are currently especially planning around significant expected growth.,Finland,dakvcc1,1,t5_2qztz

Not sure if they even pay for train trips that long every leave...But yea with a hour trip basically everyone goes home. Lots of people serving in KarPr from Helsinki who have pretty much the same trip timewise.Free time gym swimming jogging if you want to exercise. Sotku for coffee newspapers tv or you can watch tv at the company building too. Sotku might also have a few computers for conscripts to use same for the tv room at the company building. At the garrison I was at the local hunting club was having a course for the Finnish hunting license using the garrison auditorium and conscripts were also allowed to attend if they wanted so I took the opportunity. Evening classes  times a week for a couple of months forget the details. I did my service a couple of years before laptops really started getting ubiquitous enough ok someone probably had one but e.g. my brother a couple of years later already had several guys in his room who had laptops with them. You might want to get good mobile internet to be sure to have access to that though I doubt the garrisons have landline for the conscripts.gt I didnt have anything personall but as advice Id say just go with an open mind and have fun make friends. If you want it to suck its going to suck and if you want to make the most of it youll probably exit the service with fond memories and good friends.Huge  to this.

If it helps Russians are historically a tribal confederation a third of which consisted of Finnic tribes from what is now the Estonia Novgorod St. Petersburg area  the last of which had barely any Russians at all until the th century so you will see remnants of Finnish culture in Russian culture that doesnt exist in Poland Slovakia or Croatia.
