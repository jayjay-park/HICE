And yup thats sliced Parmesan from the Caesar salad we ordered from a burger place Saturday night and refried beans from the Mexican restaurant we ordered from about a week ago. Its been a delivery sort of a week but yesterday we made bok choy Provencal for dinner Im hoping well get the chance to cook a bit more often going forward.

1969304,0,t1_ckqeroo,Thanks! I love the planet box for my kindergartener it helps me make sure I have a well balanced lunch which in turns helps me fill up the other boxes.  Granted it can hold a lot more than she can eat right now which will be perfect for years to come.  It is bigger and a little heavier but not by much compared to other kids lunch boxes and so easy to clean. ,Bento,ckqi314,2,t5_2qqd8
2015400,0,t1_ckvy6h4,Yeah its really easy! I actually really like the Cooking with Dog recipevideo for fried rice. She calls for ham but I kind of switch it up and use whatever is around.

5753548,0,t1_cxa9mm8,Yeah they have a brickandmortar store in San Francisco. I live in the American South so going to the store is out of the question for me too haha. Thanks for the info! I imagine itll be quicker and less expensive shipping for me since it wont have to go through customs or anything. The great prices they had made me suspicious that the shipping might be super high but it sounds like its pretty reasonable!I like the size of the molds to be honest. The small one is a bit on the small side but I thought the large one was just right! I dont know how many carbs youre limiting yourself to per day but the big one packs about  cup of rice depending on how full you fill it. I use small bento boxes for myself  ml since I have a hard time getting my bentos filledup to the point that theyre tight and dont shift around and these seem to be a perfect size for smaller boxes! Looking forward to seeing what you do with them. ,Bento,cxaa6l0,1,t5_2qqd8

Goose is fairly similar to duck in flavour but Id call it a little bit gamier and a little bit more livery in flavour. Sausage making is really fun.

6958860,0,t3_4azhq0,I always pack my bento the night before but I have a pantry at work so I can stick my lunch in the fridge and then microwave it. The process of allowing it to cool to me is just to reduce condensation on the underside of the lid. For children at least they are not going to be able to microwave their bento or freeze it they will be eating it at room temperature. Thus the reheating in the morning to achieve at least a lukewarm bento by the time they eat it. I dont know l whether eating food that has been allowed to naturally warm from the fridge is safe but I think most mothers would kind of not want to take a cold box of food out of the fridge and hand it to their kid. ,Bento,d154dnd,4,t5_2qqd8

7219436,0,t3_4eaoei,Ive been cooking for a few years now trying to keep a good balance of vegprotiencarb for my husband who wants to lose weight and just generally eat healthier. If youre not trying to lose weight and are active you could easily stay fit on  carb  veg  protein. But of course the less refined carbs the healthier. You can count fruit under carb really unless its high fiberlower sugar such as fresh orangesmandarins. I like putting as much veg in my meals as possible usually because I personally think thats the best option for less active people.If you know how to make riceprotein you can easily add vegetables into that equation. Lets say youre making chicken teriyaki easy example all you need is some cabbage either on the side or mixed in some julliened carrot bean sprouts broccoli onion... really you can add any crunchy veg in and it would be delicious. Otherwise on the sidenot part of the protein there are sooo many good side dishes for bentos including classics like spinach goma ae kimpira broccolicheese grilled kabocha any nimono... A lot of times I just fill my veg space with a small green salad if I dont have much time or leftovers.,Bento,d1ysm6v,1,t5_2qqd8
