991102,0,t1_chgfvgm,CircusMaximo gave a pretty well reasoned reply. I will try and add what I can to it.Sound is very important. If its in your budget hire somebody to make sure the sound is perfect. If its not most people have a friend or know somebody who knows something about sound. Ask around. Also theres some audio professional subreddits who might be able to help if you ask nicely.From what I know concrete bounces sound and brick absorbs it. Best comedy clubs have immersive sound that surrounds an audience. Low lights make people forget inhibitions and low ceiling captures sound. They both encourage the audience to be a part of a community. Its easier to make an audience laugh than an individual. Tall ceilings make it hard to control that sound and get that sense of community.It might be easier to see what clubs comics love most and then deconstruct why that venue works so well.For me its the comedy cellar in NYC. Low ceilings brick walls  people jammed into a basement bar. Its a perfect spot. Look at pics online to see what Im talking about. Good luck man!,StandUpComedy,chgy1v5,1,t5_2qrp8

1433820,0,t3_2aj5l0,This was hilarious and I cant believe youre in high school. That was really superb!A few thoughts take them or leave them. I felt like at times you were a bit overrehearsed which some others here kind of alluded to. When you have the perfect wording written out then your brain is busy trying to remember to say that exactly right rather than focusing on cadence and pacing and tone. There has to be kind of your own personal happy middle ground where you are rehearsed enough that you know your stuff but at the same time you are still able to be spontaneous and play with your delivery.. When it comes to delivery obviously everyone is different. But it seems to me that the most successful comics or speakers in general always seem like they are heading somewhere  to some sort of point I mean. We dont know where and what they are saying right now might seem to have no point but were sitting there avidly waiting for the punch. This comes down to delivery where your voice is teasing some hidden humor in what you are saying. You did a great job of varying your pacing and cadence for things like talking about riding the train but to me it also felt like you were losing the thread some. I didnt feel a sense of buildup to something else since your voice wasnt teasing that. Note that it can be absolutely killer if you go the other direction and become extremely dry or deadpan but that didnt seem to be your style I felt like you were caught in the middle a bit.. Great job with things like the rule of threes the IRS was a great line.. Remember to be economical with words. I have so much trouble with this myself Im not a comedian but my job entails a lot of podcasts and interviews and I have to be entertaining off the cuff. Anyway if you already got the laugh move on. You really had the audience with the mascot on several spots and then you went on a bit too long after each very excellent setup. Its something that a super polished entertainer would not do and it just takes practice with each bit. Not dire by any means.. There were a few places where you made an awesome joke and then immediately explained the joke. Remember to trust your audience. A follow up is hilarious at times but just explaining what you already said is not. Im thinking here of the Phillies being the laziest name for a sports team. That was killer and everyone laughed but you didnt have to explain why it was lazy. A better approach might have been to do an imitation of the thought process of the people doing the naming. I forget the comedian but there was someone talking about the Double Tree hotel chain and what a stupid name that was. Guy one in the boardroom suggests Tree? And someone else there is like Naw DOUBLE Tree and the suits go nuts congratulating one another. Something to that effect. It leaves a mental image of what happened versus giving us a description that was much more vague. Basically the classic writing advice of show dont tell.. Working more personal emotion into it would really help too. And I say all of this with the caveat that you were already quite good amazingly so for your age. Im thinking here of the Ice Tea bit. That was hilarious but it could have been delivered quicker and with even more humor. Something to the effect of And this place though its a ripoff! Look right here on the side  you cant see it but whatever  it says  cents.  cents! But I give them a dollar and I never get a penny back! That seems like the joke right there and its not very funny. But your tone and so forth is funny enough hopefully that people are starting to chuckle at least. And this is when you crush it. You bring out the quip about diabetes followed right up by the  cans for the price of  and everyone is even more in stitches because they thought you were making one kind of lame joke but actually you were just setting up two enormously funny jokes in a misleading way. Does that make sense? Its the difference between them waiting for any joke at all and them being misdirected to a joke they think they see coming which you then completely switch on them. You did that already with the IRS bit for example. Thats why that was so funny.Anyway I think youre really excellent and I hope to see you on stage. Please take the above in the spirit of constructiveness and know that you did an awesome job.Cheers!ChrisEdit spelling,StandUpComedy,ciw08bb,9,t5_2qrp8

1443814,0,t3_2ao08p,Professional comedian amp comedy promoter here. I dont think its a case of hearing it all or becoming jaded. not in my case anyway. Making someone laugh while youre on stage is just as much about how you act as to what you say. ive seen comedians who have beautifully constructed jokes die over and over because they dont have the delivery to make them connect with an audience just as ive seen acts smash audiences over and over with lackluster material because of their delivery. what i do find on the flipside of that is that i observe a performance differently now Im more focusing on the craft the delivery the writing and direction of a joke and the development of an act and as a result i dont necessarily shit my pants laughing every time i see something but i recognise when funny is funny no matter how many times ive seen something.Hope that answers your question! ,StandUpComedy,cix9b30,20,t5_2qrp8

Concentrations would be things like probability topology algebra analysis partial differential equations stuff like that. They get short names because people talk about the things quite a bit. When you get deeper into things though then you start getting all sorts of crazy names for things since maybe only  people worldwide have ever even stopped to think about the thing. And they only talk about it when theyre talking to each other since no one else has any idea what the thing is. So they dont talk about it often enough to bother giving it a shorter name.Example I had a professor whose dissertation was titled A study of rings whose proper cyclic modules are quasiinjective.

None of those greats made it to their s to perform but it never detracted from what they did originally. Meaning your example of a person peforming into their s absolutely means nothing when regarding something that is already done.gtIm not saying laughter isnt important in comedy. Im saying theres more to comedy than laughter. George Carlins priority wasnt laughter. If it was he couldve just filled his sets with easy hack shit like Kevin Hart doesEVERY COMICS PRIORITY IS LAUGHTER. WITHOUT IT THE MATERIAL IS LITERALLY TRASH. The need to express yourself is a motivator or a need to be recognized. But the simple most IMPORTANT thing in comedy is the laughter. Youve failed if you dont get it. The ideal is to be able to express yourself WHILE making them laugh. Carlin couldnt have filled his material with anything like what Kevin Hart did and succeeded. He could have only done what he knew what his life dictated he thought. The same is with Kevin Hart. Im not comparing the two. Carlin is my all time favorite. But youre detracting from a person and making a judgement of them without knowing them or studying them. gtHart is a Hollywood stooge. Its all about the money and fame for him. If comedy died tomorrow guys like him would go back to the movies.Its because of people like him that comedy is NOT dead. Why dont you show a little respect for the people who put in the effort to create the art form you cherish so god damn much?How about this?

3649309,0,t1_cq81mfe,The statistics shes citing are ridiculous and thoroughly debunked. Rape has to be looked at on a casebycase basis. A man and a woman having drunk but consensual sex that the woman later regrets is not the same as the violent forced sex act the word conjures. A woman being groped by a homeless man on a walk home is not the same as a woman having a gun put to her head and being forced to give her attacker a blowjob.And yet to get the statistics shes citing you have to lump those groups together. I have had a drunk girl grab my penis. Could I call that rape? By her standards if shes being honest yes. But for me to call it that would be trivializing the horrific experiences that many women just not  in  have actually lived through and been traumatized by.,StandUpComedy,cq88y4y,5,t5_2qrp8

If they are cheering it isnt edgy because clearly most people agree and it also isnt particularly funny.Saying something brave can still get laughs but not the cheering. Making an antireligion joke in LA thats the opposite of brave. The brave joke there would be a proreligion joke. If you can write a proreligion joke that gets a big laugh thats a really good joke because no one wanted to agree with you.You see it with edgy comedians that get a big following. Late Carlin and Stanhope couldnt really be called brave even though its edgy stuff because they are just playing to their own audience. So they get cheers.

Like they built up the Beast and ended the streak just to feed him to the final third of the shield Which he still is to me.Im not saying anything that hasnt been said at this point obviously but the point of the story is that the Philly crowd doesnt give a fuck how they wanted the crowd to react they reacted how they wanted. Showed WWE that they cant just control the crowd with mediocre talent. Hes not Rocky or Austin or Cena or HHH or Taker. Hes a football player that had the right references on his resume. And when everyone wanted Bryan back in it again they fed him to Roman too. The only good thing about it is that we got Rollins cash in and title reign out of it which I have enjoyed thoroughly.Sorry Im done ranting about the subject.

Bad taste I guess if that isnt your brand of humor? He is a comedian though. They say things that they dont believe for laughs and money after all. I dont agree with this being called racist.

If you are interested in standup go to open mics preferably free ones but potentially drink minimum ones. No one can teach you funny since so much of it is experiential and about tapping into what makes you funny. The standup program will not help you get your foot in the entertainment door. It will force you to get up on stage which has value but you could force yourself to get onstage without paying someone  or so. ,StandUpComedy,d8c5loo,4,t5_2qrp8

11198294,0,t1_df0z859,I know this post is a bit harsh but its not a snipe as mentioned. I interpret this in relation to the amount of work needed to perfect your craft. I hate writing and Im sure everyone feels the same but its necessary. One thing Id add on to this is to ask your friends for honest feedback! Tell them your bit and see what they think. Also see or hear if on the phone how they react while youre telling them your joke. Then you can rework it if needed before you tell it on stage. Lastly and I know this was previously mentioned but have fun! ,StandUpComedy,df1ba6y,3,t5_2qrp8
11205952,0,t1_df13asl,Well yeah you want to put more influential comedians on the list but a list like this one is just the top four that anyone would have to agree with. OP asked for your Mt. Rushmore so Im taking that as a more personalized list. I didnt know who Lenny Bruce was until long after my taste in comedy had been more or less set so I couldnt reasonably put him on my personal list.,StandUpComedy,df26ido,5,t5_2qrp8

11280981,0,t1_dfahuus,I saw him back in October of  and he definitely had some very similar jokes that he used in his new special. That being said those jokes were much better the first time hearing them and live. But to be fair I had already known what was coming while watching it on netflix so I could be biased on that. Although I would ever so politely disagree with the fact that they were unpolished. In fact Id say he polished them up too much and for me IMO the jokes that I heard previously sounded too word for word like he had been practicing the joke so much it came out like he was reading it of a prompter. So Id agree in that sense that it felt a bit hacky to me. The longer I write this shit the less confident I feel about what I said and wonder if I even made sense.I cant entirely recall if his closer was the sandwich joke but it was fuckin great live and I thought it was pretty good on his special too. I try to remind my girlfriend of that one but maybe that dream will never come true...,StandUpComedy,dfaol4t,1,t5_2qrp8

11458370,0,t1_dftyxof,Let me explain what I meant cos I sound a bit like a dick up there. Ive just noticed that in general comedians respect each other a lot. Heres Katt Williams talking about Chapelle and all the way from George Carlin to Joe Rogan comedians seem to talk differently about their colleagues than for example in music business. And I think it is because humor is more of a mind game when music is based more on the emotions.,StandUpComedy,dfusr1u,5,t5_2qrp8
