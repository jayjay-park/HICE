4856066,0,t3_3haujo,One plus about the hardertosell doll market  unscrupulous people are less likely to steal them.Ive moved twice. Did not have trouble with anyone stealing any dolls although I would not label anything in a way that would attract attention to any specific box. Just in case ,Barbie,cu6n6le,1,t5_2r31h

On the same note it kinda bothers me that clothes wont fit across all of them but I do like where its going over all. Im hopeful that the curvy mold will move into their other lines like monster high and ever after high,Barbie,czfa7k6,2,t5_2r31h

Also I found a picture of the doll I had  and she was def an american idol one. Anyway I remember I really liked her enough that mum put her head on another body when she was broke.,Barbie,dgaw95d,1,t5_2r31h
