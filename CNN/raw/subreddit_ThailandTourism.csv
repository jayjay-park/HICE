2318150,0,t3_2lsxjc,Just for some general information for everyone condoms do list sizes on them on the back of the packets.  Sizes range from something like  mm to  mm.  For reference the average diameter IIRC in most west countries is something like .  In regard to general sizing of magnums the actual measurement as those listed above is nominally larger than the largest you can get and length is even more nominal.  There are a couple of specialty stores mostly wellness centers that do have imported stocks of a variety of condoms but they do come at a much higher price.  Again the sizes are listed on the back in western numerals.  So just look out for the largest you can find. ,ThailandTourism,cly8kqx,3,t5_340kd

Check my video from our trip to the temple hereSomething to be said with the experience of walking with tigers and being able to pet them. Tigers seemed lethargic and my wife straight up asked the guide if they were sedated. They reassured us they are well fed and a mix between over adequate diet and the heat makes them inactive during the day. We talked to several volunteers who were expats and they did come across as being very adamant that they tigers are treated well. When we walked them to the canyon to let loose it seemed to me to be a pretty as a good facility the canyon was big open full of shade and water. Still I had mixed feelings doubt Id ever go back but its certainly and experience you wont find elsewhere.To answer your second question we hired a driver for  baht for the day to drive us to the Tiger Temple and Erawan Falls which I highly suggest if you are in the area. Having our own driver was well worth it we set or schedule got to Erawan early to beat crowds and he managed to get us Tiger Temple right on time for the daily walk.

The main tourist complaint about taxis is that they often refuse customers who arent going to a destination they want to go to  in this case you just ask the next cab until you find one that will take you.

9592225,0,t3_5cazli,I recommend EVA air premium economy for LAX to BKK. Very wide seats very quick service nice high end toiletries. I had a one way ticket for about  USD. I did get stuck in a one day layover in Taiwan though  For internal flights I use whatever is cheapest. They are all the same I think. Quick service basic food planes that stay up in the air and go down when they should. The three biggest ones are Thai Lion Nok Air and Air Asia and they fly out of Don Muong Airport in Bangkok. I suggest booking directly through their sites,ThailandTourism,d9vfsix,1,t5_340kd

They will also make sure your standard vaccinations are up to date as well.When I went to Thailand last month I only got the Hep AB and the Typhoid vaccines. My friends that went with had neither and they were fine as well. Honestly though better safe than sorry.
