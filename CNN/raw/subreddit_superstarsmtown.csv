She is so feminine no matter what she does and she is so caring and always concerned about what is going on around her look at her during Yeouido fansign event she kept asking the fans why they were crying and then she told them not to cry and gave a tissue to a fan .And OMG look at her Isnt she super cute ,superstarsmtown,d1hlca8,2,t5_34a74

You know Im always looking at the note counter I mean the combo in the middle of the screen when youre playing not the notes tho lol.And I just did that and until the day I got  stars for those hell songs!

9304960,0,t3_57w472,Its because each song has different number of blueyellow notes and different length in time. Its to make the maximum score you can get per song the same.For example TVXQs Dream is longer and has more notes than TVXQs Spellbound so Spellbound will have higher point value for the same card compared to Dream.Also with card ratings the higher the card rating the higher the point value. And keep in mind that usually the cards arent in the same order for each song which can determine point value. For example the best place for your highest TTS card to be in for Dear Santa is nd.
