8768361,0,t3_4zq6fp,I was thinking about this today and I was laughing to myself as I was thinking about how he could lift himself if only for a short time.  Im not talking about jumping but if Jack hit himself upwards hard enough he could get some lift.  I know its not humanly possible but I wanna do the math anyways Lets say the average person weighs  kg that means the force pulling down on this person by gravity is roughly  N.  If this person were to exert a force greater than this in the upwards direction they would get lift.Now for simplicity sake lets say the mass of a persons hand is  kg I dont know the exact number too lazy to look for it then both hands together would be  kg.Now in order to gain lift this persons hands have to smack his own ass with an equal force to that of gravity.  Since Force  mass  acceleration and we know Force   and the mass of his hands   kg hed have to move his hands with an acceleration of . ms to get off the ground.  That means your hands would have to be going from nothing to . ms in one second.  Granted you wouldnt stay in the air for long  but you would have gotten off the ground. Theres one problem with this though the human hand cant swing this fast.  Even if it could youd break every bone in your butt if you tried and thats being generous.  I know its a silly theory but I just found it humorous and I wanted to share it.,sanspantsradio,d71pj9w,1,t5_38gun

11536831,0,t3_64ms8o,Cant agree with this enough. Sanspants has gotten me through a rough couple years of anxiety and depression and they really deserve thanks. Their shows have such a unique charm no matter what show or whos hosting everyone bounces off one another so well. They really do make the perfect pick me up. ,sanspantsradio,dg3pa81,9,t5_38gun
