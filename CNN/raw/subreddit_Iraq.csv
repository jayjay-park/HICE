I wasnt trying to point out how well supported ISIS is merely the reasons behind any support they have amongst Iraqi Sunnis.I do not disagree that factions currently aiding ISIS outnumber them in terms of personnel but ISIS isnt going to turn over full control without a fight.

Because if its not religion then people will only find some other equally pointless argument to draw battle lines and kill each other over. What matters is that you share power give equal representation to all. All parties representatives and the common rabble must play by majority rule minority rights. It is literally the only way forward. Willingness to share power is the missing ingredient not only in your governments but in attitudes. It is the reason you cant have nice things.

I am always taking the piss though. That was an example of that.gt if they were willing to fight they would have fight ISIS.I recall that they formed militias but dont have much in terms of armsfunding and many applied to join the army. The army certainly isnt lacking in manpower already though. What they do lack is heavy armor artillery and aircraft. They have the opposite situation of Syria.gtCome on now you cant even compare KRG to Iraqi governmentThis is true. One cannot compare an outright dynastic dictatorship to a rd world government that is semiauthoritarian but also trying to practice democracy and has its successes and bright moments.gtThis is another wishfull thinking man Kurdistan has superior allies and have the thing rest of Iraq lacks Unity against enemy. Besides that peshmerge isnt like it was s Kerkuk being under peshmerge control while Iraqi Army ran proves this.Their only ever useful ally was Iran. Iran is no longer their ally. Now Iran supports Iraq far more. Turkey is concerned as long as some money is to be made of it but theyd be willing to work with the Iraqi national government too which they already do. Iraq is no longer the  enemy of the US like it was from the s to  except a brief respite where Khomeini took the  spot so you can count out the US. Russia has very close relations with Iraq for over  years. China similarly has strong relations with Iraq. So do a host of European Latin American African and Asian countries.So what superior allies are there? The mountains?gtUnity against enemy Besides that peshmerge isnt like it was sThis is why in every Kurdish insurgency in the s s s progovt Kurdish fighters outnumbered the Peshmerga nevermind the Kurds in the massive military itself? Also different Peshmerga branches arent exactly united. I dont think even clans and tribes are united.gt Even the bombs exploding everday proves thatThey know Baghdad is the center of power and the most important target and also tons of Shia there thats why they put in all their effort to bomb it. Of all the fighting and terrorism ISIS does between Syria and Iraq suicide bombing Baghdad is their  effort.

8599692,0,t3_4xm10e,By Toby DodgeBest Defense guest columnistI have recently returned from two research trips to Iraq the latest one at the end of March as a member of the Atlantic Councils Future of Iraq Task Force.We got great access and I spent time talking to senior decision makers both in the Kurdish Regional Government and Baghdad with an interesting day discussing Iraqi politics with the ulema of Najaf.The big point I brought home is the profound crisis of the post political system. The recent Sadristled demonstrations in the Green Zone are simply a recognition of the fact that there is a near universal sense across Iraqi public opinion that the state and its ruling elite have completely failed them. The whole nonKurdish political elite recognize this but does not want to resolve the crisis in a way that will involve limits being placed on their own party political power or their personal ability to financially exploit the Iraqi state.The Shia members of the ruling elite blame profound corruption for bringing the system to its knees without recognizing their central role in that corruption.The Sunni Green Zone politicians see the systems persecution and marginalization of their constituency as the key without recognizing that their constituency does not and probably never has recognized them as its leaders.The Kurdish politicians see their own internal money worries as a result of the relationship with Baghdad with some recognizing that it is partly the weakness of their own rentier system. For the regional government in Irbil Baghdads profound weakness has the upside of limiting its ability to put pressure on the Kurdish Regional Government. However their own systems structural weakness its bloated payrolls and party personal corruption mirrors and is statistically worse than Baghdads with the KRG as a nonstate actor having less room for maneuver.Barring Grand Ayatollah Ali alSistani Muqatda alSadr and Prime Minister Haider Abadi no national actors appear willing to embark on a reform process that will limit party political power whilst all acknowledge the pressing need for change.The most probable short term outcome will be piecemeal and reactive reform with the system continuing to limp from one crisis to another. If this is the case Prime Minister Abadis call for reform will achieve little but the further weakening his own legitimacy and chances of him retaining his job.However the causes of the crisis will not go away In the short term with low oil prices the lack of government cash is what is worrying the whole of the ruling elite. The next problem they will face is the undoubted societal pain that will come with International Monetary Fund driven economic reforms. Finally the fear of another civil war or a popular uprising against this failed system increases with every passing day.Against this background what can Prime Minister Abadi do? He does not have control over his own party over the parliament or the cabinet.Nuri alMaliki the previous Prime Minister was a far more astute player. He attempted to bypass the ruling elite and cabinet by building a shadow state to run Iraq keeping Shia popular discontent in check through sectarian fear mongering. Easier to do this with oil at  plus a barrel. In pursuing this strategy sectarian ideology coupled with shadow state building while leaving elite corruption to flourish Maliki drove the rise of Daesh and simply delayed and hence exacerbated the current crisis.For better or worse Prime Minister Abadi does not have the Machiavellian capacities of his predecessor. This means he is either blamed for authoritarianism because he bypasses cabinet in the decisionmaking process or blamed for incompetence because he cannot get laws through parliament or implement meaningful reform. He and his teams proposed solutions are rational technocratic longterm solutions to the economic situation focusing on increasing the efficiency of government while sliming down its payroll. They do not and probably cannot address the structural faults of the post system the muhasasah or apportionment system which was built in at birth and needs to be confronted if the Iraqi state is to be saved.In order not to run out of money the Government of Iraq will have to do a deal in April with the International Monetary Fund which will lead to a cut in the food rationing system basic commodity price rises cuts in the government pay roll cuts in government wages and increased charges for government services.The most likely outcome of this will be another Iraqi summer. A return to Sadrist encouraged but not controlled popular protest in the face of a failed reform program electricity shortages and more stories about the industrial strength corruption that has done so much to undermine public support for the Iraqi state.Ironically in the face of geographical though certainly not ideological nor organizational military success against Daesh because of the problems laid out above we will see rising levels of extraparliamentary protest and violence and the further delegitimization of the Iraqi state. This violence will primarily be amongst those groups claiming to represent Shia public opinion not Sunni.I suppose whether Abadi survives as Prime Minister is not really that important it is whether the Iraqi state can survive and avoid a return to civil war a war which looks as if it could be fought amongst Shia groups fighting for what will be left of the Iraqi state.Dr. Toby Dodge is the Kuwait Professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science and Director of its Middle East Centre.,Iraq,d6gjytt,2,t5_2qhke
8689826,0,t1_d6rtwye,Utter rubbish. Your post history says enough. Aside from that lets go with your IraqiBritish refugee argument. Iraq can NOT have the exact same legal system as a first world western nation right now nor does it have the proper facilities to hold THOUSANDS of ISIS terrorists while making sure none of them escape or are breaken out. Aside from that Iraq is in the middle of an existential WAR. How do you like them apples? So yes they need to execute as many of them as they can reasonably put through trial. I know your ilk loves to use fake arguments to protect ISIS as does the Western media in their antiIraq propartition glory. But your ilk will keep losing and hanging because the real arabs of Iraq not some second generation emigre DO fight for their country and they DO know who put ISIS in Iraq and they do know who iswas helping them.

The societies were tribal barbarians like many Iraqis. Even SK when it was poor was x better and more peaceful people than Iraqis even being ruled by brutal military dictatorship despite the US doing everything of value and despite the peaceful and homogeneous society.Also the US kept most of the Fascists in power because they knew they could rebuild those countries and could work with the US. The US knew it had no friends in Iraq so they removed everyone and everything that could rebuild Iraq. And Dawa and other Islamist parties was already Irans bitch for decades. The US just needed to put them in a place of power and that was an already done deal. The US knew how autistic Iraqis were. They knew what Saddam and his predecessors had to deal with.

Not only does this split the votes into several lists but each list is separated from within making it easier for larger lists to pressure smaller lists into conforming to their standards. Theres also the fact that many candidates are automatically disqualified by the IHEC due to links of Baathism a corrupt way to make sure only those who fit current leaders standards can run leaving even fewer options.Contrary to what some users on this sub think the vast majority of present day Iraqis want a fair and nondiscriminatory government.
