10427002,0,t1_dcpnsw4,Honestly I know it got really bad review but I absolutely loved Homefront The Revolution. It really engulfed me in to the world and made me feel like I actually had a reason to be fighting not just mindlessly slaughtering enemies. Also Firewatch was just great a few people didnt enjoy the ending but I felt that it fit the story well.,KillMyBacklog,dcpywnr,1,t5_2xgnt
