5570644,0,t1_cwgnv6g,i think my two biggest issues that maybe you can give some guidance with are The part that the handle holds on the inside that has the button and spring  is that supposed to be all one straight piece? Mine seems to be bent so I dont know if that needs to be replaced.Because of the positioning Im not sure if i can get the two bolts off that hold the handle in place. If I DO get them off Im worried I wont be able to get them back on and would have to take it in just to get the handle put back on. Do you have any tipstricks for getting those two bolts on and off?,Tiburon,cwnl8kn,1,t5_2x02q
