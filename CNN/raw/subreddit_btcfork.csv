8489418,0,t3_4vxdr1,In all honesty you may as well go to Gavins BIP and just change the initial rise to mb them progressively scale it up to gb and finally have an open limit. Frankly BIPs mb is still fine IMO and we shouldnt even be wasting our time with mb as we no it never pleased those that disagreed with mb. But hey work done by other users has shown an open limit is going to be fine as it has its own upper limit to keep blocks capped.,btcfork,d62q3i5,3,t5_3fpq3

8537942,0,t1_d68s2kz,What make you think ASIC resistant PoW alone is a guarantee to success?On the other a ASIC friendly PoW is a guarantee of failureThe hash rate is irrelevant what matter is the costdifficulty to perform a  attack and how hard it is to censor transactions now that Bitcoin is centralised.. All this is very easy to perform..This post from maaku is very tellinggtZane this is many times larger than the block reward for the duration of time that has elapsed. Have you considered getting a list of transactions to blacklist and getting miners to reorg the theft? The window of time for that hasnt closed.gtIf this happened in the last day then thats . blocks   BTC in subsidy. Thats ampampamplt of the hack.gtgtEDIT Posting more information here since this is getting linked to.gtThe security model of Bitcoin rests on the economic incentives which prevent miners from working on large reorgs. Those economic incentives go away when the possible gain is many times larger than the miners normal income. This is a fully known property  is discussed in the original Bitcoin whitepaper.gtIn this case Bitfinex could promise to pay the miners say  BTC per block for however many blocks it takes to reorg out the theft transactions and replace them with a spend aggregating the funds off of BitGo and into cold storage. As long as this is less than a few thousand blocks it makes economic sense for everyone involved simply because of the enormous size of the theft.gtThat this is possible at all is a failing of bitcoins decentralization. In  or  it would have been very difficult to just call up  of the mining power and do a business deal. Going forward we should do everything we can to make sure that bitcoin is made even more irreversible than it is now and that such mining deals are more strongly disincentivised. I hope that this serves as a wakeup call about the dangers of decentralization.gtTo be clear I have no money in Bitfinex. Never even opened an account there.gtEDIT To be absolutely clear I hope that this doesnt happen. If it does Im not sure what value proposition bitcoin would have left. Uncensorable nonpolitical money is what bitcoin is about and without that it is nothing. If this manages to go through I hope the outrage pushes people to fight for more decentralization and fungibility at the protocol level. Otherwise I dont know what future bitcoin would have.,btcfork,d68t5mi,1,t5_3fpq3

8604655,0,t1_d6h5qrq,gt you are referring to max.  bytes per block if anything at alll for merge mining? Is it noteworthy?Merge mining implies validation validation implies downloading... Just adding a hash is not mergemining....gt Does the concept extension blocks allow upscaling in a bitcoin unlimited fashion? then why havent I heard of it before?  tell me more.I think so. Its like a mergemined twoway pegged sidechain. Coins would not get burned but would get send to a spendall transaction like segwit. gt Isnt this the same for any chain? usefulness  participation  network effect. On this respect I dont see any disadvantage over btcfork.Not really some things are useful even without participation. Network effect doesnt always apply. My weak blocks  transaction compression idea doesnt need full participation of both miners and users to become useful. ,btcfork,d6h6cu8,2,t5_3fpq3
8607413,0,t1_d6hhoj1, MB blocks cant be achieved without massive centralization. If youre OK with that then just create a federated sidechain like Liquid. These sorts of highfrequency trades are exactly why Liquid was designed and the federated security model is far more secure than relying on arbitrary miners. Another option would be blinded bearer certificates which also provide extra anonymity.The idea of Lightning is that everyone only has a few open channels not one per service. So you overestimate the requirements anyway.Im not concerned about competitiveness or market price. Let other cryptocurrencies do risky things and maybe get ahead for a while. If Bitcoins price crashes due to it but Bitcoin keeps functioning then so what? Bitcoin is a project to create the perfect money not a moneymaking scheme. While other cryptocurrencies rise and fall Bitcoin will be the currency that stays functional and decentralized decades into the future. And that itself has way more value than pretty much any hypothetical feature enhancements which can in many cases be eventually softforked into Bitcoin after extensive thought and testing anyway.,btcfork,d6hisq3,2,t5_3fpq3

8799996,0,t1_d758l3w,If a fork has minority support it can still lead to a viable new flavor of Bitcoin like ETC is to ETH. It just cannot outright lay waste to the other chain because there are still users that find value in its proposition.Same goes for Bitcoin in my view.On the hard fork spectrum BU being emergent is somewhere in between elective forks like the BIP ones with their miner vote counting and nonelective hard forks like satoshisbitcoin. BU doesnt change the POW so its block production depends on the SHA mining community where I believe power has devolved into the hands of very few decision makers. BU cannot in its current state lift the block size without the consent of the current miners. Im not sure myself if and how BU wishes to address this question if it is to present a solution to the scaling problem which is rather a consequence of mining centralization.Thats why BTCfork is about hard forking with or without the existing miners. We believe that the decision should not merely be up to them. It may be that BU chooses to present a solution which only covers the with aspect and not the without. That remains to be seen. But the fork is not limited to BU alone. Thats my point here.,btcfork,d75n1gt,3,t5_3fpq3
