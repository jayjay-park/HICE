33708,0,t1_cei94qa,Ah. This offseason will let me know how to feel.This FO brought this team back along with the Soccer Silicon Valley foundation. That cant be thanked enough for. Yet it can feel many times that they are out of touch with the club and its fans. Whether that be the clash between the Ultras and the FO President Kaval insisting they talked with supporters about the new stadium while the Ultras are complaining that the Supporter seating isnt convenient for many things that they can do at Buckshaw such as the famous avalanche of fans after a goal is scored.The acquisitions have seemed to be more on the side of trying to buy the players that intersect at cheap cost and decent qualityunknown gambles. The acquisitions of Stewart and Goodson were huge yet it looks like So far the club is losing more quality players than bringing them in sending out Morrow likely Chavez losing Beitashour most likely Attakora etc. I really will be judging the FO on this preseason because it looks like they can make strides where they used to fall short...but as a fan Im cautiously optimistic or maybe even pessimistic so I can have a low set of expectations for the club this season.,SJEarthquakes,cei9p5b,7,t5_2sgyl

5516761,0,t3_3qmkij,gt TLDR How should counteract the influence of bad rumormongering within our fan community?Id say we should try to be knowledgeable as fans and continually adjust our perceptions of certain outlets by how right or wrong their info ends up being. For example your stock went up with the Godoy signing while other sources have gone down with the Vela and Chicha rumors. Those wont go up unless they happen.I want to play devils advocate here though the reason why I pushed the Vela and Chicharito rumors so hard not saying they were true was because the Quakes had never been linked to a player of that caliber before. Even just a few years ago we were foaming at the mouth about rumors of us signing Jaime Alas Championship players or unnamed Honduran internationals that Muma was trying to recruit. Then out of seemingly nowhere we have been linked with two huge Mexican internationals which is stunning BUT as you said...it may simply be that Quake fans havent been exploited enough for silly seasontransfer season viewcounts in past  years and so different writers decided to pounce. Also as always Ill give a redditcentric view for what we can do in the community itself. On the sub the mods could definitely set up link flairs for posts to be labeled in certain ways. From Official Beat Writer RoomerRumor Disputed etc. That definitely would give a perspective on how official something may be. For example we could differentiate between a random Spanish tabloid and someone like Taylor Twellman tweeting about a transfer or Quakes related rumor. The community would be able to judge at a glance about different rumors.Personally I feel all rumors can and should be discussed here...but we definitely have to take them with a grain of salt.,SJEarthquakes,cwgtdy7,2,t5_2sgyl

Kinnear played Innocent at left mid early in the season before he got hurt. Do we put Innocent at LM and use Wondo and Quincy or an upgrade from Quincy up top?

11260782,0,t1_df8a3tx,Heres my translation for the nonGerman speaking folksDoubled Pleasure for JungwirthFirst Goal and Dream Come TrueFlorian Jungwirth scored his first goal for the San Jose Earthquakes. However its not just the goal that has conjured a smile on his lips.So far Flo Jungwirth has been able to secure two wins with MLSs San Jose Earthquakes. On the weekend however the yearold had to accept his first loss. Against Sporting Kansas City he and his team lost . Nevertheless Jungwirth scored for the first time for his new club. His strike in stoppage time came too late however and he and his team could not turn the game around.Still more good news for him can now be reported. Bastian Schweinsteiger has transferred with immediate effect to MLSs Chicago Fire. The world champion from  ends his engagement with Manchester United and plunges himself into a new adventure.For Jungwirth a small dream is coming true that he might play against Schweinsteiger at this stage in his young career. In the introductory interview prior to his departure for the USA Jungwirth had expressed his disappointment with the fact that the exnational team player Schweinsteiger had transferred to England after Jungwirths climb with Darmstadt into the top flight of the Bundesliga. I still hold out hope that Basti will transfer to the USA in the summer said the midfieldallrounder at the time. With Darmstadts promotion to the Bundesliga I was especially looking forward to playing against him and then the transfer to Manchester. Perhaps after a year in England he goes on to play in the USA. Then I can finally play against him. Then Im satisfied.Alls well that ends well! Jungwirth had the right intuition. Schweinsteiger has decided to end his career in MLS and the young man from Karlsfeld can still have a chance to compete with the  time capped national team player.,SJEarthquakes,df8e5o0,5,t5_2sgyl
