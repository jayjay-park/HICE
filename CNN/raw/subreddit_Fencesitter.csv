4188680,0,t1_crxphko,I suppose its harder when the matriarch is also your mom speaking for my cousins. Im  and when Im not behaving the way my dad would want me hell often threaten to call my godmotherauntmatriarch. My mom thinks the whole thing is ridiculous.,Fencesitter,crxpku3,3,t5_38fvu

4327456,0,t3_3aiwax,I dont think its totally nuts. Its reassuring to see people you know and like and who may be similarly situated survive it and tell you theyre happy with the choice and would do it again. Not being the first in your social circle also means you already have some parentfriends when you become a parent which seems like it would offer at least a little bit of support and people to talk to who have been there. The idea does feel a lot more realistic and concrete as more people I know are having kids and thats partly because it hasnt been overwhelmingly isolating for them. It effects how often and when they can do things with other adults of course but I still see them and I dont have kids. ,Fencesitter,csdfm60,7,t5_38fvu
4435312,0,t3_3bt6ni,Having even one child can and does put a lot of strain on a relationship or marriage in many different ways.  That is especially true if the husband is on the conservative side and thinks all work related to house and children is womens work and refuses to do anything.Funnily enough those same conservative husbands start pressuring the wife to have more kids after a while and if she refuses saying shes done after the number of kids she already has in my case it was  the marriage goes downhill anyway.  So yes becoming parents often ruins a marriage for many reasons.  ,Fencesitter,cspr9sv,7,t5_38fvu

4941440,0,t3_3iew63,Agreed with the others here. People claim that hormones cannot make you want a baby only sex. But I disagree with that notion. The only time I find babieschildren bearable and think about having them is certain times during my cycle. Figuring out that was the source of my desire made me feel a lot better when I started getting baby rabies.You may also be feeling the pull of pact mentality. Usually if everyone around us is doing something we feel that we want to do it too to fit in.But also dont completely ignore the feelings youre having. Keep track of whenwhy youre feeling that way and how often. Nothing wrong with keeping your options open if youre still not  sure either way.,Fencesitter,cuheor2,3,t5_38fvu
5034701,0,t3_3dx2h0,Im against having children for moral reasons. And not only against having them myself but also in general. To quote philosopher David Benatargt Parents may benefit from procreation but only at serious cost to those brought into existence. Its hard to see how imposing these costs can be justified especially since nobody is harmed by not being born.,Fencesitter,cusvfl1,2,t5_38fvu

6297647,0,t1_cz4u3sq,What are some things about raising a child that you and your SO should agree on in your opinion? I always hear people say that but I cant quite wrap my head around what types of things you would disagree about. ,Fencesitter,cz5gz4x,3,t5_38fvu
7538867,0,t3_4ilunt,This study isnt quite new but I hadnt seen it get much press before. I think the aim of the author of the study Israeli sociologist Orna Donath is quite commendable. Instead of the usual narratives of blissful parenting postpartum depression or Its very difficult but ultimately worth it gt she wants to allow mothers to live motherhood as a subjective experience one that can combine love and regret one that will be accepted by society no matter how it looks.I feel women are still easily shoehorned into either loving their kids or hating them being a good mother or a bad mother but I think even this small sample shows that regretting your choice is much more nuanced than that and doesnt exclude love caring and other positive emotions as well.,Fencesitter,d2z4s4i,2,t5_38fvu

7880770,0,t3_4n7p1f,It sounds like regardless of whether you eventually want to have kids you dont want to have one now. Theres nothing at all wrong with getting an abortion now and then choosing to have kids a few years from now if you eventually come to that decision.  ,Fencesitter,d41veju,6,t5_38fvu

9794166,0,t1_dak4999,A very good point. The image that first comes to my mind from the word fencesitter is someone very anxious to gain clarity and make a decision but that is far from the whole picture.,Fencesitter,dakccxm,2,t5_38fvu
10191676,0,t3_5lv9s8,I joined this sub a few months ago with similar feelings and now Im pregnant. So that happened.I dont know if this will mean anything to you but one thing that helped me in decision making was thinking about the more long term family thing. Im very close to my family like my parents and sisters and that is something I think I would like to have myself one day. Babies themselves sure they can be cute but Ive never been a massive baby person. Even now Im pretty convinced the newborn stage is going to suck but thankfully they grow out of it and Im hoping the long term benefits will be my reward!I am not at all trying to push you into having kids! Its obviously a very personal decision and completely valid to stay childfree. And possibly I am the only idiot to whom the idea that babies arent babies forever came as a bolt of enlightenment!,Fencesitter,dbza778,7,t5_38fvu
10286019,0,t1_dc1sdq3,You offer some great points. If you havent already I encourage you to read the article I linked it offers some interesting counter arguments to all of the point you have made!Im obviously still a fence sitter on whole issue but at the end of the day the best thing we can do is educate our children how to care for the planet. If I do decide to have children this will be really important for me and how I raise them. Awareness is everything.,Fencesitter,dc9z6av,1,t5_38fvu

10709941,0,t1_ddkn1f8,Yeah all kinds of reasons. Wrong sex season poor health. Infanticide is documented as more common than wed like to think in ancient history. Also abortion has been practiced for thousands of years too. Fortunatey its safer now.,Fencesitter,ddknesm,3,t5_38fvu
10859136,0,t3_5v8g9v,I dont think its bad but the thing is kids grow up. So what will you do when they are older? You dont want to be the stereotypical overbearing mothernightmare motherinlaw because you have nothing going on in your life except living through your kids even when they are teenagers and adults. Also staying home with kids is not all Pinterest. Right now I have a toddler and its hard to do anything at home without her wanting me to play which is sweet but distracting or playing by herself and making a GIANT mess and endangering her life by climbing on things. That is just the toddler stage but Im just saying I had a lot more time to bake and make crafts before I had a tiny human tornado.,Fencesitter,de01klp,17,t5_38fvu
