1728183,0,t1_cjwyj3x,We are nonreligious as well but in making a choice between competing harms my sanity and wellbeing have to come first.  Babies and toddlers do not understand anything of the religious agenda.If I have to choose between being abusive or exposing my son to a little bit of Jesus I pick Jesus.,RBNChildcare,cjx038f,3,t5_31krd

4248834,0,t1_cs3dxjl,I accidentally did this and it worked like a charm!    My son  and I were walking to the grocery store and he was nagging and crying literally all the way to the store inside the store and continued on the way home. What was he bawling about? That I wouldnt go to  the toy store with him so he could buy new toys because he didnt like the ones he had.    I tried to remain calm and firm but compassionate saying things like I said no. We are not going to buy new toys. I understand his upsets you. But that didnt work and in the end it was grating my nerves. Then I asked him Ok if you went to the toy store what would you want to buy? We engaged in a discussion which soon turned into a happpy game of imagination. No more bawling no more whining he was completely happy to just talk about it. Its been a few weeks and he hasnt brought up thee subject of new toys since. ,RBNChildcare,cs4k1z9,3,t5_31krd
5524227,0,t3_3qh1ss,When I told my Emom she said I am not ready to be a grandmother. But she turned out to be the best loving grandmother and has been dead  years. Her death put a hole in my kids life. The Ngrandmother was all over it and wanted to brag about her grandkids but did not do anything was a horrible ignoring grandmother. That one the N got all excited when we announced the pregnancy. So dont assume they will react in any way try to have no expectations. A card might be a good idea they may call and stuff anyway. ,RBNChildcare,cwhrpt0,2,t5_31krd

5572301,0,t3_3qf5mg,I have a  year old stepson. He has been going from our house to his moms every week. The rules are different in both houses and unfortunately we do not see eye to eye on how to raise him. I have way more rules than she does but now that he is able to understand basic reasoning there are fewer and fewer rules because instead of laying down all these rules like a dictator we discuss why they are in place and what the natural consequences are. I feel once he understands why a rule is in place it is easier for him to accept it.We have a ping pong ball reward system and season passes to a theme park. Whenever he fills a bucket with ping pong balls we go to the theme park or the pool or some other freecheap place of his choosing. I have used this for many behaviors like enforcing handwashing or drinking more water or trying new foods. We started this when he was  and it greatly reduced the nos. It turns a situation where we would normally butt heads into something we can achieve together. He had a real problem with juice and I could not get him to drink any water even if I tried to secretly water it down hed notice and stop drinking. We offered him a ball for every glass of water he would drink we told him he can still have juice but he wont get a ball for it. He has chosen only water ever since. Once this was an established habit we retired it to make room for something new. The habits formed this way stayed with him even after we took the rewards away. And he can still drink juice but it counts as a sugary treat and those are limited so he usually chooses something different like candy so hes good with drinking water.  Bottom line he has the choice even though I control the choices. I hope this is helpful I dont have much advice about how to control your own reactions to the defiance but hopefully this helps reduce the defiant behavior and you can get a little break. ,RBNChildcare,cwnsnab,3,t5_31krd
5949790,0,t3_3wsye4,I dont like time outs I dont believe they work and Im scared they would only create distance between me and my daughter.This is what I think about it Having said that I believe that it is us the parents that sometimes need a time  out  a break from the intense feelings and drama. Specially since we ACONs are often triggered and scared about that kind of stuff.My suggestion is that if you cant time in at least dont give time out to your child. Just let the tantrum happen breath and try to keep your cool. Soon enough your child will learn from your behavior.,RBNChildcare,cxzjq5z,2,t5_31krd
7178642,0,t3_4dpr0g,I wonder if this idea could help Try imagining the day AFTER the birth. Youre resting holding that precious little bundle of joy. All the stuff that happened to get there? Irrelevant. Honestly in this day and age the mom just sorta lays there amp pushes amp suffers all of the knowledge all of the responsibility is on those doctors amp nurses in there. You just follow their directions. You can hit cruise control and just wait it out. The whole time its happening just think about that baby in your arms. And next thing you know itll be there. Disclaimer I am a man that has been through  kids births. I am not a mom so if any of what I just said is B.S. ladies correct me!edit  also i wanted to say the Medical Interventions you mentioned? those are pretty much the standard. Are you holding yourself to some higher standard of Natural childbirth wherein any woman who accepts help aka modern medicine is a sellout? In my opinion that stuff is total Bullshit.,RBNChildcare,d1u5anl,2,t5_31krd
