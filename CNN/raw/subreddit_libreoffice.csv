2245230,0,t1_clp6opn,I thought about that as a possible issue... The only reason I use docx is because most work I submit is online to the schools DL system. Most classes dont require physical copies of essay or homework anymore so because of this I switch to Docx so that my professors can open my work on their computers to grade it. An ODT file wont open for them. But youre saying if I fix it in ODT and then save it as docx it wont screw up the formatting? I suppose pdf could potentially be an option too if you think that will work.,libreoffice,clp7zgd,1,t5_2s4nt
2950728,0,t3_2tx0tg,What version were you upgrading from and which operating system do you have?Looking at the screenshots it seems likely that its a font issue. Do you have the original file and is it possible for you to share it in a bug report so the devs can look into the problem.,libreoffice,co3ifdn,1,t5_2s4nt
3194330,0,t3_2w9818,Go to  Styles and Formatting F or Sidebar gt Character Styles gt Numbering Symbols and then right click select Modify and pick the font you want.It will change them for the entire document. You can also change color or whatever else as well.If you create a custom numbering setup you can also specify the formatting per level space etc. Then its best to setup a paragraph style that automatically puts your numbering into effect.,libreoffice,cot3bym,1,t5_2s4nt
4750862,0,t1_cttbi53,Do they allow free software in their app market? I remember they had a good TampC for FSF and OSI approved licenses in Windows . Is that still there? If the free software license contradicted the Terms and Conditions the license prevailed.,libreoffice,ctte3by,2,t5_2s4nt

7264104,0,t3_4ewc2e,I presume this has something to do with its support for NPAPI. If thats the case it wont be an issue starting with version . since theyve already said support for it will be removed.,libreoffice,d23vlaq,3,t5_2s4nt
7857579,0,t1_d3tjjco,Thanks. Got round to this today but bug is still there. Could it be a Plasma thing? Then again I dont see this kind of behaviour on any other application.,libreoffice,d3z9gwp,1,t5_2s4nt

11092286,0,t1_dep9h53,  The only characters of text appear to be on the title page  That is all I could select and that is all that pdftext or a couple of online extractors could pull out however when I extracted all the images with pdfimages fully expecting to see large images of text there was nowt to be seen but that graphic on page  was extracted as a px   px blob occupying kb... No wonder it was a little hard on the eyes..    Never did find the text...   I thought about a transparent graphic over the text which would prevent selection within Okular but that wouldnt prevent text from being extracted from the file itself... Odd...    The high res version is MB the low res one which rolls in at MB is here  ,libreoffice,depau22,1,t5_2s4nt
11719568,0,t3_676qjk,Hi first off are you talking about Writer? What operating system are you using? If you open a new Writer document and hit enter three times do you get three horizontal lines?Maybe a screenshot would help try imgur.com.You could also try resetting your user profile in the menu Help  gt Restart in Safe mode. Try continuing in Safe Mode to see if the problem persists.,libreoffice,dgofwp7,2,t5_2s4nt
