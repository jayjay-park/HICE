2329655,0,t1_clzms2v,Im going to answer your FPV question first because I just got back from a test flight where I only had  seconds of air time with my goggles. Ok Dave so why talk about it at all if only  seconds? Because it was that freaking cool. Watching the videos you see the cool maneuvers and landscapes but what you dont get to experience is a strange feeling of being detached from your body. While the quad was in the air I could hear it next to me but from my view I was clearly looking at myself. Its liberating and unsettling at the same time. Unfortunately I missed a loose nut on my preflight checks so I cant comment on length of flight time. Last night I took a battery fresh out of the box and it gave me about min of time. That was real easy LOS flying and without the added weight of the video gear.Frame and flight gear    FPV Spec Kit HK   FrSky DRII Receiver Aloft Hobbies   CCD Flight Controller HKRadio   FrSky Taranis includes battery HKFPV Gear   FatShark PredatorV  Camera  mw vTX HK   SpiroNet Circular Polarized Antenna HKSo thats what got me going with the FPV craft. I also picked up a bunch of spare props a second frame with LEDs and a few extra mwh batteries. Final bill for whats on the table was about  before shipping costs.Add to that the cost of the small Syma XC I picked up to train with and its another . EditFor what its worth Id recommend against this kit. The front gimbal is cool but its more work than needed and the servos will add weight thats not really needed. This is an awesome entry level kit for LOS flying but cramped for space for FPV.If I did it all over again Id keep these components but pick a frame thats got a mount for the FPV cam and more space for components like this I had a ton of zip ties handy but if I didnt this could be very frustrating trying to get everything on the frame.,fpvracing,clznpgk,2,t5_2xnbi

3272181,0,t1_cp16mv7,I actually had an idea a few years ago voice to action software keeps getting better and better. The guys playing Elite Dangerous SWEAR by voice attack... so if you took a voice input program used it and some scripting to transmit a coherent signal... you could actually have an RC sailing ship that you controlled by giving orders just like a captain. Mister Tenover point of note I like the victorian custom of addressing officers by name not the modern of calling their station Mister Tenover  points alee Mister Potter Prepare the cannonsAgain completely doable... and it seems like it would be amazing fun.

4677253,0,t3_3eogwt,Im super new so buyer beware.  I bougt a Minion with the  prop arms  in the mm thick carbon setup. Thing is mental rigid and very simple. PDB for it is very well laid out and only has a video filter and a few LEDs as extras which still keep it minimal. if I step up my volume maximizing game a bit I can totally swap the mm standoffs for some mm and have a chopped and channeled version battery closer to middle. After I build an RX the next  ish class frame Im interested in is the InversionRNot as simple as the minion which is lame but the engineering is intriguing. The main principle is that the front arms reach further rearward on the fuselage and the fpv area in the front is slightly longer. Idea being that youre battery can take up the rear on the same lower frame plane better COG vertically and the lifting force is closer to that rearward mass.Not too many reviews but everyone Ive read has people super excited about its flight characteristics. I guess its quite noticeable.Im an occams razor guy when it comes to design. The minion is hard to beat.,fpvracing,ctk47fb,1,t5_2xnbi

5436688,0,t3_3pi79z,I havent fully examined the source code of something like cleanflight but I can imagine this scenarioYou are sitting at half throttle nose down  deg. Your front motors are running at about  max rpms your rear motors have to be running a bit faster to maintain angle say . As you increase throttle at some point you are going to hit a point where both the front and the back motors have achieved maximum rpms. You might be telling them to try and go faster but they just cant. At this point all your motors are applying equal thrust and you level out.Again this is total conjecture.,fpvracing,cw6lai6,1,t5_2xnbi

Yes there are some tight gaps and you have to have a really consistent line through the turns due to the neon semicircle gates but theres no elevation change no technical slalom and its not really high speed either.

7193375,0,t1_d1vakv2,LOL I didnt mean to spark such a fire storm. Were all here because we love quads and can be passionate about them. But in terms of flying experience which have you had and which have you enjoyed flying the most?Or is there any difference between flying a QAV to keep it simple i understand less drag and an Uber granted putting big motors and triblades its power to weight ratio is huge? Also my thought process behind the various sizesconfiguration of the motors does it give them different flying characteristics?,fpvracing,d1vtsr6,1,t5_2xnbi

7389243,0,t1_d2hzw6d,I personally love my Hubsan x c but I dont recommend it as a way to learn to fly FPV specifically because it has altitude hold.  If you arent giving it throttle it hovers in place.  This was a big hurdle for me when upgrading to a  FPV quad.  If you do get a Hubsan make sure you get one that does NOT have altitude hold if your intention is learning to fly in a more FPV style.,fpvracing,d2i3uca,1,t5_2xnbi

But now after following your advice and buying my Taranis first then spending the last  days learning to fly in Freeriderper per your benchmark of s on the desert course now Im confident enough to start ordering quad parts. By the time I get my first quad in the air I will have a solid foundation of flying experience.

10020300,0,t3_5j3s39,I think the prop wash would make things worse but I highly doubt anyone could be accurate enough to properly fly a quad in a draft within inches of another quad consistently. They change direction and altitude far too often. Cars work but there is a set path. You can see to on the track and everyone hits the exact same apex every time. ,fpvracing,dbdo8my,1,t5_2xnbi
10160831,0,t1_dbvs258,best bit of advice i can give you pick up a good transmitter for when you get a quad something like a Taranis Radiolink ATS or if you want the cheaper option a Flysky I can order them off banggood you can get a usb cable for them and play with a simulator FPV Freerider is one of the go to ones its free but i personally prefer Liftoff on steam little more costly at  but well worth it!worst case scenario sell on the radio not really lost out P,fpvracing,dbvsby3,4,t5_2xnbi

10344172,0,t1_dcgjqgc,OK it could be a motor sync issue. Cause by a bad ESC. Also see if you can recreate the problem by powering up the quad with props off and wiggling wires around the ESCs. Also check that the bellmotor shaft do no wobble excessively this could be a bearing doubt it if it only happens in acro mode. Judging by the video Im tempted to say that its motor number  thats failing perhaps not but just the way it falls points to that. I would switch the ESC out on motor  after trying the other things. But we defo know its not a loose prop. I would also reflash the ESC to see if that works if you havent done so. Still thinking what else might cause it. ,fpvracing,dcgkjqq,1,t5_2xnbi
