2859,0,t1_ceeps34,Not just Kurzweil but decades of AI researchers. For a long time the assumption was that artificial intelligence would be the natural product of a powerful enough machine which has proven not to be the case. Humans and computers are both extremely good at very different types of specialized intelligence.If youre talking about a task like say calculating  million digits of pi then computers have long surpassed human intelligence. If youre talking about natural language processing which draws on all kinds of connected intelligence like interpreting a statement in the context of previously established knowledge not to mention social and emotional cues humans far exceed computers and will continue to do so for some time.,Futurology,ceerhwl,3,t5_2t7no

10732,0,t1_ceflotk,No. The recent experiments on the NIF showed only that they could put energy into a very tiny blob of fuel a hot spot and get out more energy from that blob of fuel from fusion reactions including indications of alpha particle energy deposition than was put into the blob to begin with. But that hot spot blobs energy is only a very tiny fraction of the total energy of the system. It doesnt account at all for all the rest of the energy put into the capsule ablator or the rest of the fuel. And then only about  of the energy put into the hohlraum walls is absorbed into the capsule. Of the energy that radiates from the walls only about  of the laser energy going into the hohlraum actually makes it to the walls to be absorbed the rest scatters out through laserplasma instabilities. The lasers themselves are around  energy efficient. Finally to operate them they draw power from the grid with all the inherent inefficiencies of conventional power production. What was demonstrated on the NIF was a nice bit of physics but its far from engineering breakeven.,Futurology,cefnnds,3,t5_2t7no

270144,0,t1_cf8mtjx,I foresee some rough waters but extrapolate that forward into the time after these rough patches. What could possibly happen is that with robotics and AI things could get exponentially cheaper and in a sense that has already happened. Poor people rarely starve today. The live in relative wealth compared to the past. The trend will likely continue. What will probably happen if you take this trend to the nth degree?There will still be elites and classes but what will happen to the baseline? Now the baseline still sucks but still its not that bad considering where it was. Were sending vaccines to Africa but decades ago even the rich didnt have those vaccines. What is worth more not getting polio or a gold crown? Think about charity. It used to be that only the rich did charity. That was bc the relative wealth gap was such that only they could afford it. Now that has filtered down to the middle class. What if the wealth of the middle class not the monetary wealth but real wealth as measured in standard of living what if that rises greatly? Were selfish for good reasons bc of scarcity but if that is removed then many of us could be miniBill Gates. I could see that. Humans want to help others but to do so we have to be secure ourselves first material security. Who can know what we will do when material scarcity is no longer a pressing concern. Perhaps these issue based on markets will be moot.There will always be greed but at some point it just become ridiculous if you look at it.

286214,0,t3_1xdevp,Way back in the s I created this speculative work on possible technological and social progress over coming decades and centuries filled to the brim with online and offline references to innovations occurring across many fields including biomedical.Although I havent updated my compilation in many years now I have continued to collect new info and references which could be relevant to such an update at the rate of around hundreds a week. Plus Ive had the chance to compare my old documented speculations to whats actually happened ever since. So I feel like I have a decent handle on how fast change may come about for the man in the street.Unfortunately while theres still going to be many geewhiz developments for us to marvel over from now through  as we have stuff like smartphones and tablets and improving special effects in films the past ten improvements in things like health and medicine will continue to plod along at about the same pace they have the last twentyfive years incrementally if at all. Growing corporate control over government policies has reduced real competition and the potential of new business start ups to succeed as well as the quantity and quality of basic research where most big breakthroughs usually happen. Or in other words the status quo is being protected at all costs these days. Couple this with severe financial pressures on news media and politics in the USA from a handful of at best misguided and at worst malevolent billionaires and you get one sorry mess of circumstances where things like revolutionary breakthroughs or new and improved social or business models are concerned. So unless we can somehow shake off such negative influences I wouldnt get my hopes up for truly revolutionary changes for the better in hardly anything over the next  years. At least not in the USA.

The end of the age of the gun is wrong the more appropriate end to this thought experiment is the end of capitalism and the beginning of Star Trek..I feel like this article should have a disclaimer for overhyping a somewhat flawed thought experiment. Every turn this author makes in his story is the MOST negative and any other evidence to his plot twists is not investigated.I agree that in the future drones will be used to fight wars but this doesnt immediately lead to oppression. I also agree with utuseroni that technology favors decentralization and that the knowledge of how to turn their guns against them will keep the power somewhat balanced in the case of a social meltdown but I dont think that really will happen.The problem with the whole social meltdown thing is that the technology that will be used to create drones capable of performing every job currently done by humans will also cause people to become less divided by castes. People will work fewer hours and unemployment will no longer be a bad thing. Most people are good people who just want to live their lives in peace. Some have to scrape to get by but what if they didnt have to? It might take a while to get there but we already have benefits in america to provide for the poor. The current problem is production and distribution but with a drone army that problem is gone. Sure there will be some idiot policy maker who decides it is a good idea to patrol the streets with drones that shoot people. Fortunately most other people and countries will not let that happen. The more hopeful side of drone armies will be to eventually get rid of capitalism and protect the countries who are doing so from the more stubborn capitalistic countries.,Futurology,cfzxqjq,253,t5_2t7no

548491,0,t1_cg2laft,Now you are moving the goal post since this entire line of discussion was started by you sayinggt Getting rid of the minimum wage would dramatically increase employment.So lets admit that changing the minimum wage does not significantly affect overall employment because nobody is saying that it does.Now as to you new point. I find it funny that you started your criticism by claiming that raising the minimum wage would have a dramatic impact on unemployment and are now arguing that it should not be done because it doesnt really do much.  Ill start by once again pulling a quote from your supplied sourcegt Where most economists agree is that the higher minimum wage does not do much to relieve poverty. That is partly because many poor people would not gain since they do not work partly because some of the costs of higher minimum wages are shifted onto poor consumers but mainly because many minimumwage workers are not poor. Only  of the workforcesome .m peoplewill gain directly from a rise in the minimum wage and  of those are teenagers many from families that are not poor.Ok that doesnt disagree with anything Ive said. What I said was that increasing the minimum wage moves jobs from unskilled younger workers to older skilled workers. If you havent noticed the unemployment rate and low wages are hitting the middle class too. If you allow lower skilled workers to replace higher skilled ones at a reduced wage that has a negative effect on all wages.The poverty rate of unskilled teenagers is a separate issue that should be addressed directly. Like I stated it is best to try to get these kids schooling so that they can become the desired higher skilled workers. Once they obtain that skill then they too would be able to get the now higher paying jobs.As for the poor who arent working at all I support some form of basic minimum income. Although as the Economic article you provided statesgt But a big EITC expansion is politically hard unlike raising the minimum wage it involves spending taxpayers moneySo we are stuck with using the minimum wage as the only lever to approach the wages issue.,Futurology,cg2mbma,2,t5_2t7no

And the excess profits that come from the automation and cheap energy will be taxed to pay those other people. My conservatism example had nothing to do with conservatism per se which is why I cited socialism as a second example. The problem with your argument is that you are saying capitalism as you define it would be the best system if only it was done properly. And that is problematic because it tends to ignore the problems that capitalism creates today and blames them only on the failure to fully enact pure capitalism. This is the same as a socialist who refuses to believe that socialism itself could possibly have caused the problems that arose in socialist states. Even if your system of thought is not fully or perfectly implemented where it does have an influence you have to take into account the problems that arise there. I think that you believe that all of the problems in capitalism spring from its Crony or imperfect character. In other words that capitalism itself will not create any problems. I can point to many wrongs in society that came from lack of government intervention. One would be child labor. The government refused to intervene to bridle the capitalist profit motive and ban child labor. Only when the government intervened did it end. Another example is private discrimination against blacks before the government intervened. Alabama motels would not let blacks stay there refusing to take their money. Government intervention was not the cause of that problem  it was the solution. An example from this  year a lesbian who moved to Missouri was refused an account at the credit union where she lived. The credit union did not care about losing her business  they stood to lose even more business by accepting her as a customer. That is a problem that did not arise at all from government intervention. ,Futurology,cg2r4wz,1,t5_2t7no

560172,0,t1_cg3sqsv,gt Strong AI is as much a threat as global warming.With respect no it damn well is not.Why? Because very few people are actually working on stopping global warming compared to those causing global warming. In contrast from the tiny number of people working on Universal AI a rather large proportion have some level of awareness of machine ethics and the need for controllable andor Friendly AIs. Global warming requires the simple following of a trend you have to take action not to continue global warming.  On the other hand a runaway UFAI requires effort to actually happen and the closer we get to real AI the more we become able to see precisely whats necessary to prevent UFAI though not necessarily to create FAI. Real AI could easily turn out to be just doing a job service AI rather than a Friendly or Unfriendly superintelligence.  Volitional superintelligence could well be uneconomical compared to cheaper more controllable agent structures.

574193,0,t3_20ofy5,I am of two minds on this stuff. It isnt just IQ. Robots will eat pretty much any job that involves a repetitive task that follows a set of logical rules. So oddly enough I am fairly sure that garage mechanic will be mostly a safe job. Ask any garage mechanic if their job follows a set of logical rules and they will start telling you about bentrustedfusedmelted parts and whatnot. So I suspect you could build a robot that could fix a brand new car but not one that has been bouncing around on salty potholed Nova Scotia roads. But doctors doing diagnoses appear to be about to go out of business with IBMs doctor Watson.  I also suspect that certain other jobs will be enhanced by computers and robots. Such as landscape designer in that a computer will be able to analyze a property and come up with something cool but that a human will still need to think it through to make sure it makes sense. And in large buildings routine cleaning will be done by robots but the spilled paint on the carpet will still require a human. Or the vomit on the ceiling of the executive bathroom how the hell did that happen? as these are all things that dont fit the routine.Then you get the mostly routine jobs such as police. Boring patrols could in theory be done with some kind of drones and no doubt will be done by drones that can spot the usual trouble. But the reality is that there are a cadre of people who are just too thick to think on their own. They can barely manage the routine and have managers who just want to scream THINK MAN JUST USE YOUR BRAIN!!! all the time. Those people are doomed. But the key problem is that right now at this very moment a huge majority of people are either doing the routine or a huge percentage of their jobs is very routine. This means that there will be a period one year or  years? of adjustment where people are able adjust their capacity to where robots make people awesome as they play on each others strengths. Think of people being the officers and the robots being the grunts.But going back to the policeman a drone could no doubt be programmed for the usual trouble such as fights or people being where they shouldnt. But a human policeman will still be needed for looking at the creepy guy acting suspicious and then asking him whats up. Or the insurance adjuster who knows from the tone of the persons voice that they are gaming the system. But one of the key differences with this industrial revolution and the previous is going to be the speed. The last one was fairly fast and quite disruptive but one of the differences with this one is that it will actually feed upon itself. That is that robots will produce the robots that fuel this revolution. So not only will the robots come quickly but that each new wave of robots will come even faster. So my prediction is that at first people who do very menial tasks such as road construction assembly line work cleaning and whatnot will be wiped out. But that in  years the robots will be so easy to monitor that it will be discovered that the robots could use some human help. So these people will be once again needed but like the vacuum didnt put the sweeper or rug beater out of business neither will the robot. So if you are the hillbilly of your profession surgeon vs diagnostician then you are safe. The worst part will be the mass unemployment along with the wave of capital that will go to those company owners who can automate the most. But the weirdest part will be things like the TV writers who are replaced with ML script writing programs that gauge audience desires and keep making scripts that are actually quite good.Basically during this transition it will be the job of government to aggressively make sure that inequality doesnt turn our society feudal as after a successful transition robots and automation could turn our world into a utopia.,Futurology,cg5jgqv,27,t5_2t7no

You have to value valuation processes. If you know a great and important solution you become valuable for knowing it just as the solution is valuable for being known.

These are roads that have incidental features including producing power.  The DOE can put up solar plants as wellgtBoth of which are ultimately part of the federal budget. Ultimately whether you want to look at it nationally subnationally or globally we have a finite amount of resources that can be applied to supplying our need in this can transportation and energy. They dont exist in a vacuum .But they are administrated in a vacuum.  The DOT and the DOE have separate budgets.  And what matters to the DOT is reducing operational expenses.  Should the DOT not be allowed to reduce its expenses because the way in which it goes about doing so steps on another agencies toes?gtAlthough it is hard to say without at knowing the final cost Im skeptical that XltZY is achievableThe US government doesnt run on efficient central planning.  Things are distributed into departments.  This sometimes results in suboptimization which is often a result of optimizing parts of a project individually rather than the project as a whole.  Diverting money from roads to energy would be an arduous process with its own overhead.  On the bright side the scale of the project might reduce the cost of individual panels and make it cheaper for the DOE to start its own solar projects.  All that said even if XgtZY from the perspective of the decision makers at the DOT this is a win unless the tech totally fails which seems doubtful at this point. ,Futurology,chhba7o,1,t5_2t7no

An interesting trope would be introducing percycle goals. Places to be found and conquered doomsday devices to be found and figured out special tech like wormhole generation and such. Youve play a couple of regular cycles learn how the game works and how to attain superiority and then you would jump into the race for finding the whatchamacallit drive which when fitted to your fleet will force all neighbouring players to unite to fight you or die fighting an enemy who can perform lightning fast strikes well inside beyond their defensive lines.Thats a really interesting idea but just a note the game mechanics are being specifically crafted so that the mechanics do NOT inherently favor a combat oriented style of gameplay.

When we moved from  farming to  we had to take that  surplus and cut it in half to have a reasonable society again.Just like before were seeing a decoupling of productivity and wages.  We should have made adjustments to the laws  years ago.  Shorter workweeks. Mandatory vacation.  But its too late to make these changes.  We need something that will work now.Its nice to think that new industries will emerge to absorb the unemployed but the transition from manufacturing to a service economy resulted in lower paid jobs.  Once these jobs disappear what next?  Do we pay people to become foot rests for the wealthy?  We already pay people to waggle signs at the side of the road.,Futurology,chkyzze,2,t5_2t7no

Actually when you add in the savings from eliminating some other social and makework programs it would be significanlty better then that in reality I would expect that everyone who earns less then about  a year would end up ahead.So yeah the upper middle class and the rich would end up with less money in the short term while the poor working class and lower middle class would end up with more money.

For a handful of reasons like longer total life cycle Lithium Ion can actually come out cheaper than lead acid and people are starting to use it to store solar power.Boats RVs Golf carts etc. The claim that people have little need for  cheaper lithium ion batteries is pretty stupid really.,Futurology,chu60k2,1,t5_2t7no
1108059,0,t1_chu7o87,Why? Because just as Cruz preys on uninformed people the majority have spread a rumor that isnt true. Why? Well Reddit hates anybody with money thats successful that isnt Gaben or as of late Saint Gates.So since a guy used to work for a cable company Wheeler he MUST be terrible because nobody likes their cable company.Having a guy who knows the tricks is a great way to ensure things are done right. If Im looking to make things better I sure as HELL am going to have someone who knows the tricks in place hence why Wheeler isnt the WORST person in the world to have in place.People BITCHED about how these idiots came into the hearing and got physically removed? Why? Well Im not sure. That meeting was NOT a public forum. The public was allowed to sit IN on the meeting but interrupting like children doesnt work not at that time. Thats why as was stated very openly THIS IS NOW OPEN FOR DISCUSSION FOR THE NEXT  MONTHS. IIRC the decision doesnt go into effect until September. This is now the time where people should be bringing their concerns to the table. Cruz is a retard but even worse are the people who actually believe hes a supporter of NN. Nope hes a supporter of get everything out of the way and let cable companies do fuck all with the traffic...Id be okay with that if the cable landscape was like it was back in the s with s of companies owning their own infrastructure. But theres not really any competition anymore. Hopefully GFiber will alleviate that in certain areas. Also the bitching about how they never upgraded shit! has to stop. That was a long time ago and people claim that they are collecting record revenues so they should be able to fix everything! Firstly revenue ! profit. And operating costs on a halfbroken network are much worse than a network that is optimally configured.Try joining two moderately sized companies networks together topographically and see how easily that goes. Now multiply that by Million people in the US alone. Its not easy. Just because a place was given money doesnt mean its going to get appropriated in exactly the way you want.Are ports being saturated in certain areas YES. Absolutely. Why? Well not just for some sinister reason to fuck people over. You leave more ports open for capacity than you use in case a port blows up or something then you swap the damned thing out to a working port boom back online. This is basic network design. If you have anyone advocating for an ISPs network to operate at  capacity they are retarded.What happens when that new subdivision gets built? Theyre just fucked and have to wait even longer? No you want overhead so you have room to add on new subscribers as needed for growth.Also people in rural areassmaller towns? Sorry they are screwed. They arent centers for investment business or otherwise. They get the short end of the stick. A provider doesnt stand to gain by building millions of dollars of fiber out into an area thatll only pull a couple hundred K per year or so. The up front capital cost justifications just arent there. Same reason why if I wanted fiber in this building and I didnt give this new ISP a reason that people might hop on in the near future that we wouldnt have gotten fiber unless I could come up with K and this was for about a  yard run off the street. Multiply that by an entire countys area....and the costs would bankrupt a local economy.Its a much more complex issue than most people understand and the only thing you can really do is withdraw yourself from the conversation read up on the differences and REresearch the new details as they become available and THEN try to help others understand. However Its not easy since as you can see on the majority of this site most people will attack you if you dont agree no matter HOW sound your argument is...EDIT I may still have had some snark I do that a lot.To add why is Google against it?Google is most likely against it because they are trying to gain popularity and gain a database of their own of customersubscriber information. Dont even think a company is really on your side. Theres most likely a monetary reason. Once I get my consulting business yes Im going to do whats best for my clients but I also have a monetary reason to charge them a certain amount for my services. Ultimately its all about  i.e. yourself and the same goes with Google. I think Googles main fear isnt this exact billlegislationchange I think its that this bill COULD LEAD to other bills that actually DO ruin the internet landscape. I think if we actually get that far its necessary and it should happen.

1118697,0,t1_chupyjo,There are hidden contradictions within the minds of people who love nature while deploring the artificialities with which Man has spoiled Nature. The obvious contradiction lies in their choice of words which imply that Man and his artifacts are not part of Naturebut beavers and their damns are. But the contradictions go deeper than this primafacie absurdity. In declaring his love for a beaver damn erected by beavers for beavers purposes and his hatred for dams erected by men for the purpose of men the Naturist reveals his hatred for his own racei.e. his own selfhatred. In the case of Naturists such selfhatred is understandable they are such a sorry lot. But hatred is too strong an emotion to feel toward them pity and contempt are the most they rate. As for me willynilly I am a man not a beaver and H. Sapiens is the only race I have or can have. Fortunately for me I like being part of a race made up of men and women it strikes me as a fine arrangement and perfectly natural.

Replacing every roads by trains or railways would be probably more interesting but I dont think people are ready for that.Personnal maglev vehicles are impossible. Youre speaking about fueling the entire road system with liquid helium which cost  per liter and were already have shortage of.

Also Im pretty sure a highly densed maglev grid would fuck up our electronics and maybe our health.

MDI claimed in  that an air car will be able to travel  km in urban driving and have a range of  km with a top speed of  kmh  mph on highways when operating on compressed air alone but in as late as mid MDI has still not produced any working prototype.gtA  University of Berkeley Research Letter found that Even under highly optimistic assumptions the compressedair car is significantly less efficient than a battery electric vehicle and produces more greenhouse gas emissions than a conventional gaspowered car with a coal intensive power mix. However they also suggested a pneumaticcombustion hybrid is technologically feasible inexpensive and could eventually compete with hybrid electric vehicles.gtCompressed air has relatively low energy density. Air at  MPa  psi contains about  Wh of energy per liter and normally weighs g per liter. For comparison a leadacid battery contains  Whl. A lithiumion battery contains about  Whl. Gasoline contains about  Wh per liter however a typical gasoline engine with  efficiency can only recover the equivalent of  Whl.

1206767,0,t1_ci4rimy,gtThe point is to define it and explain it well. Thats my point. You define it and explain it well and then you can test for it properly. Not based on how successful it is at tricking people that have not properly defined it.OK then give me a proper definition. Because noone in the world has come up with one yet. gtThere is a ground truth. You cannot say there isnt that is not scientific. That you have not found something does not mean it doesnt exist. I can say that there is ground truth because Ive found it.Quite on the contrary there are lots of problems that cannot be solved in principle and therefore the ground truth does not exist. You have not found the ground truth I think I have shown quite clearly why something is not intelligent iff it is sentient. Something may be intelligent if it is sentient but that is a weaker clause.gtDogs are capable of complex tasks like programming a robot to keep balance is complex. Come again? Dogs can program robots? I am not sure what you are trying to say.gtBut no they are not intelligent. That is a common misuse of the word. They can do things that are the illusion of intelligence but they are not intelligent. Why not? Dogs have memories fear they miss their owners they defend children they understand commands. You think that this is only because they can be trained  I have a surprise for you the same is true for humans. We are trained throughout childhood to behave in a certain way. Children raised by wolves behave like wolves aside from little bits of genetic memory. gtDogs pass the turing test with flying colors. Easily more than  of humans think they are sentient andor smart.No they do not. To pass a Turing Test does not mean to convince you it is smart. Turing Test put a human in one room a machine dog chimp dolphin in the other. The judges who is also human takes turn asking questions. The subjects in both rooms answer questions. If after some arbitrary but long period of time the judges cannot tell in which room the human is sitting then whatever it is in the other room must be intelligent. gtScientists agreeing on something is plea to authority. It doesnt matter what scientists think. What matters is what logic undeniably tells us.This is a philosophical argument you are mixing things up. In the world of real science scientists agreeing on something means thats probably true not necessarily of course. If a doctor tells you that you have cancer because of the report that came in from the radiologist it is probably best to seek treatment rather than dismiss it as a plea to authority. Arguing with thousands of people who dedicated their lives to studying this field after you read a book or two is just silly thats what climate change deniers do. And yes I know formal logic very well. What applies to debates does not always apply to science.gtThere is only one good definition of intelligence.There is not one. Again sentience ltgt intelligence is not a good definition and I have shown you why over and over again.gtHis solution is not good enough. Just giving up on a problem because it is hard is weak. Problems get solved with persistence. If you would have thought about it a little harder he could have figured it out. All the clues were out there at the time.How come noone has solved this problem? Or you claim that you did? A problem that humanitys best minds could not solve for thousands of years? Look it may seem like a good answer to you but I research AI for a living and it really is not complete. Sentience means intelligence? OK how do you know something is sentient? You just know? Then your answer is not any better than someone saying they just know their rabbit is intelligent. A hypothesis must be testable else it is useless. Again science is about scientific method. You propose a hypothesis you test it if it is confirmed you get a theory. With our case hypothesis is x is intelligent. Turing did the most important part  he gave a way to test it. If you give a wonderful definition but there is not objective way to test it definition is utterly useless.,Futurology,ci5doh5,0,t5_2t7no

Uber has been shut out of some markets but it tends to be the exception and not the rule. This pattern has played out many times already in cities all over the world. ,Futurology,ci9jl2a,-1,t5_2t7no

Or in cases where companies successfully keep their behavior a secret from customers which often happens for years.  And even in cases where a boycott is possible people have a limited attention span and a limited ability to find out information.  You may be able to organize a largescale boycott of one or two companies at a time but you cant organize thousands of boycotts of thousands of companies all at once for different reasons with different targets trying to address different problems.   It doesnt work.   You have to pick and choose a target and inevitably even if you join one or two boycotts youre ignoring hundreds or thousands of other equally pressing issues.

1379687,0,t3_29whf4,PGPSigned posts which verify human identities while still allowing anonymity.How it worksAny user who wants to post a comment on the Internet somewhere has to acquire a verified PGP signed identity.This identity does not have to be there real human identity. It can be an anonymized identity.The thing about it is that the given PGP signature ties back to a specific individual who has a reputation.By having a unique identifier assigned to a reputation you can track spammers and other illicit bandwidth thieves by their PGP signature and screen them out or filter them out or block them completely.How it worksWhenever user posts a comment in most forums there is an ability for other readers to flag their comment. When users comment is flagged it is usually because its spam. Sometimes its because the other person hates them. On my websites user comments go through a Bayesian filter to eliminate obvious spam and any comments that are flagged by other users go through another Bayesian filter for a more subtle examination followed up by a human examination. I have a special tool which allows a human to process about  comments per minute because it operates off single keystrokes. Through this process any comments which are flagged as spam also identify the source of the spam and flag it for future elimination.So an Internet wide system of PGP signed identity postings would allow us to very quickly identify and eliminate spammers.Wait you mean people would have to cooperate and create a distributed database of these PGP signatures?Yes they would.Fortunately all the tools we need to do that have already been created and had been used in production for years.Signed DNS. This is the system which is used to do DNS lookups and each lookup is signed so that you know its valid.By deploying exactly the same toolset in exactly the same fashion but using it to look up PGP signatures and validate them we can produce the result were looking for.A PGP lookup system for comments would have a much lower low rate than the existing DNS system does.DNS number lookups happen every time you do a webpage access or anything else on the Internet. And on a single webpage you might have to resolve  to  different DNS addresses depending on how badly the page was put together.With PGP signatures it would only be one lookup per comment. Loading that would be at least two orders of magnitude lower than DNS lookups and possibly for orders of magnitude. In any case a much less substantial set of resources would be needed.Who pays for this?Well as it turns out large corporations spend literally millions of dollars a year filtering email for viruses and spam.By switching email over to require PGP signed identities for the sources you eliminate most of that filtering.How does having PGP signed identities for emails eliminate spam email and viral email?Very simply anybody who sending out spam with a PGP signed identity is put on the blacklist.The process of getting a verified PGP signed identity will prevent the proliferation of PGP signed identities for spammers.For example every person who has a Comcastbased email account has to verify their email address through their Comcast customer account.But what about free services like Google mail?Well we could always require that every person have a PGP signed identity thats verified through their ISP but I actually think Google can come up with something better. Google actually knows more about you than your ISP does. If Google wanted to use the information they have picked up about you to verify your identity and tie it to a PGP signature they could very easily do so and they could very easily use that same information to prevent someone from creating multiple accounts to spam from.,Futurology,cip88no,13,t5_2t7no

1383162,0,t1_cipnloo,I agree that this is currently the most likely way to achieve an AI but this will also require better scanners and better knowledge of the brain. I think if we scan a human brain on a sufficient level of detail its indeed likely to work. But I dont think we know yet what level that is although Id say neuronlevel is promising and this would only get us a replica of the person scanned not an AI capable of building a better AI and I dont think just running the simulation faster or adding more computer memory is necessarily going to do all that much about this. If we dont scan a specific person I dont know how promising it is with our current knowledge of the brain to build one using general principles of how it is typically connected. Perhaps if we simulate a plausible brain constructed statistically it would selforganize in the necessary way but I dont think we can know that yet.But I dont want to come off as all negative here I do in fact think that strong AI is possible  I just think people often point to Moores law as something that would make AI or the singularity inevitable and I dont fully agree with that.,Futurology,cipnviy,1,t5_2t7no

Some people may also have very strong preferences for not living in towers.gtHumans dont need constant sunlight to live and therefore have a stronger case to occupy single story dwellings than humans do.Humans also use artificial lighting in their apartments just as plants use artificial lighting in vertical farms. The lighting isnt a significant cost anyway. LEDs use very little electricity.The rest of what you wrote is just basic high school level economics that everyone should already know.

It doesnt matter how much more efficiently foreign countries can produce food if they decide not to sell it to you. The United States produces several times as much food as it can possibly consume while devoting only  of GDP to agriculture. If it takes Japan  or  to be self sufficient using much less inefficient methods it is worth the fact that it could avoid national catastrophe if there is some crisis in the food exporting nations that stops them from exporting food.

Electrically powered heat pumps can give you greater  efficiency.  Specifically you put say  unit of electric energy into the heat pump and it uses that to forcibly move  units of heat energy from the colder dirt into your warmer house for a net increase of house heat energy of  units as the electricity you put in gets converted into heat too effectively  efficiency although they often refer to it as coefficient of performance instead because its not really the same thing.  At the absolute worst dirt way colder than your house driving the COP downwards due to thermodynamics they should be just as good as a resistance heater.  Really the only advantage of electrolysisproduced hydrogen over electricity for pretty much any use is that currently its difficult to store large amounts of electricity but its a bit easier to store a big tank of hydrogen.

1445837,0,t1_cixc5mr,gtWithout reading the rest of Kellys argument I was put off by the mention that Kelly says experiments would still need to be done once intelligence is achieved in a machine. Well just put intelligence into moving machines e.g. robots and problem solved!Its not that machines cant perform experiments they already do its fairly common for labs to have robots generally for high throughput screening. Its that experiments especially in biology take a lot of time regardless of whos doing them. If youre studying tuberculosis everything thing you do will be constrained by the fact that Mycobacterium tuberculosis grows absurdly slow if youre working with mice everything will be even slower.Im really glad to see Kelly making this argument as it has long been one of my main problems with Singulitarian thinking. Eliezer Yudkowsky kindasorta addresses it here but I think he errs in relying too much on examples from physics where the hypothesis space is far more constrained than a field like biology. I suspect you really have to spend time doing experiments to grasp just how much of what we do is dependent on processes we dont really understand magic black boxes that can only be dealt with by getting more experimental data. And yes parallelization might help some but I dont know how much. There was a time when high throughput screening was going to be the savior of the drug industry but it turned out that doing the same experiment with thousands of different compounds only works if its the right experiment.

DARPA Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency is using Thinking Caps to rapidly train snipers drone pilots and intelligence officers.  Theres a DIY movement of  people using this technology in their basements.   A thirtyminute session with a Thinking Cap would provide a powerful cognitive boost that would last all day even several days improving concentration memory and other things. FOUR REASONS  Convenience.  Effectiveness.  Price.  World Competitiveness. These are going to launch a high quality Thinking Cap into sales numbers maybe  bigger then the IPHONE revolution because thinking caps will quickly become a big part of the LEARNING arms race in school and at work AND in governments.  People will feel they will have to have one to compete but they will also like the results of when they use one.  They need it AND they want it AND governments will mandate their availability for their citizens to keep competitive with the World. WinWinWin.  I think Self Improvement is one of those Primal Needs sales folks say you have to have  in a product for it to sell well.  Thinking Cap technology fills that bill.World Competitiveness  THE LEARNING ARMS RACE IS REALand its worldwide.  I once  read that during the  the seventies and eighties when the cold war was still ongoing and  millions of american teenagers were spending thousands of hours a year playing videogames the Russian military was worried about the cognitive advantage those teens might have when they entered the army and started shooting REAL bullets.  The thinking cap brings a cognitive advantage that other governments notice and respond to.  You can bet Russia China and all major western democracies  already have their version of DARPA matching the efforts of our  own DARPA  thinking caps. Many governments know their armies need thinking caps to be competitive. This already exists in the many DARPAs around the world.  Those same governments know eventually their citizens will need thinking caps to be competitive.Plenty of parents will buy thinking caps for their teens when they think they need them to be competitive and they will .  Thats the beginning of sales eventually including government subsidies for the underpriviledged that will start slowly but accelerate upward and not reach a plateau until everyone has access worldwide including Africa Indonesia Afghanistan Myannar every corner of the planet.  It will be education for world competitiveness driven. And it will be HUGE.Read Amol Sarva wired.co.uk December  neurostimulation and Sally Adee better living through electrochemistry Februrary SALTY LANGUAGE ALERT ON THE NEXT LINKThank youArturohombre A few further remarksConvenience  Place a plastic helmet on your head push a software button on your smartphone and go about your day for thirty minutes. When the smartphone alerts you the session is over you wipe it down and hand it over to someone else to use.  Effectiveness  Educated guesses suggest one third will feel a significant cognitive boost and come back for more another third will feel a medium cognitive boost and come back for more and a third will feel very little cognitive boost.Price  Likely  and it will drop to  pretty quick.Finally Thinking Cap research  has been in the labs in the TV news magazines newspapers and in the garages and basements of DIYers  for over fifteen years and it is still apparently not on the radar of any major consumer electronics company.  Regardless its a NEW consumer category and its going to spread rapidly worldwide and be HUGE.

1482211,0,t1_cj21y2h,gtDyson was a brilliant man but that was  years agoIm glad youre an authority on when Dyson lost his brillaince. I think its obvious that at his age of almost  its not surprising he doesnt publish that often but looking him up he seems to have published as recently as two years agoin a very high impact journal. He also holds other positions still but I dont know how much actual science he stills does evidently some but probably not that much. I have absolutely no doubt though that dyson puts a lot of thought into his opinions. A redditor would think oh well this guy is strongly misinformed unlike me. I guarantee Dyson reads many many publications in the climate field and hes skeptical for good reason. A man like this does not make up opinions based on Fox News like reddit would claim he does. I would ask the average redditor who is so well informed about climate change how many actual climate science publications they have read because I guarantee the median is .Secondly I dont know much about IEEE spectrum but they do seem to be affiliated with IEEE which is the largest association of electrical engineers in the world and I would guess that should give them some merit. Regardless of if spectrum is a good news source or not the fact is dysons opinion is held strongly by many including the public. The average redditors is not.His argument was that plants have a higher yield as CO increases up to a point that we have not currently hit and that outweighs the imaginary from his perspective climate change arguments. As for his opinion on ocean acidification I dont know youd have to ask him. That would have been a good point from the interviewer but she did a pretty bad job.I didnt post a compelling argument because thats not what reddit is about. Trying to pose a compelling argument thats the opposite of reddits doctrine does not work. The upvotedownvote system mandates that. My point was just how disrespectful reddit can be to people like this but if a similar person who had views morealigned with reddits they would circlejerk over how great he is. My point is that reddit is a toxic and selffulfilling community.,Futurology,cj22jtf,7,t5_2t7no

Add to this the shameful dealing of our government with nuclear waste they simply through the barrels into a mine which is now flooded with water and the barrels are rusty and get their first hole.FURTHER add to that The energy was never made cheaper with nuclear instead it simply existed to further increase the energy suppliers revenue it also gave the supplier so much financial influence that they could build up a monopoly in their regions completly stomping every competition... getting rid of nuclear now revitalized competition among energy suppliers.Nuclear may be safe the people in charge of it however are as crooked and corrupt as they can get and that really doesnt put nuclearenergy into a good light.,Futurology,cj5c2jb,70,t5_2t7no

If youre worried that someone is going to build a  micron camera and fly it into your eye and implant itself behind your retina then you can rest easy the government already did that and they can see everything. Yes everything. coughToo much Welcome to Nightvale I mean no that is unlikely to happen due to the limitations of the technologies involved in drones.Basically a drone is a camera with a transmitter attached to a small helicopter or plane. The idea of scaling this down to nanosizes is not very good for a few important reasons. A camera can get to be fairly small and still capable of discerning things but the smaller it gets the worse it gets. Too small and its not worth the effort if all you can do is see vague shadows. Secondly if a drone is made too small it will not be able to apply enough thrust to make it mobile. Once it is small enough it will be affected by the turbulence that is inherent in air which is considerable.

There are a lot of ways to do this already but the problem is we can only do it with such a limited amount of physical memory and processing power. If we improve our methods they will scale for much larger quantities of data and can be applied to any context using the same methods.

Well need a lot of fusion power for that.gt In  years unless there is something that breaks us from Physics clutches people just maybe will be arriving at the nearest stars of interest.Sooner.Were starting to find possibly habitable superearths within  ly or so and as our tools and models improve were finding smaller ones.Fusion propulsion should be able to achieve .c ramscoop which would mean a few hundred years of travel to get there. Were very likely to have that by the end of the century so long as we dont destroy ourselves first.Antimatter propulsion is more difficult but still very plausible using what we know already. Some designs could theoretically achieve as much as .c project valkyrie which means we could visit nearby stars with only decades of travel.Then theres exotic stuff like the alcubierre drive which may be possible within the known laws of physics but only if we can figure out how to bend space. NASA is working on testing that last part on a tiny scale sometime soon. Expect much excitement from space opera fans if the test yields promising results.gt Itll be a oneway trip for sure. And it might be multigenerational unless we get REALLY good at manipulating antimatter. But these things are too possible.There are also multiple possible paths to longevity which would allow the possibility of long transit times  and possibly even returning  within an individuals lifespan. Whether this will happen in the next decades is uncertain but in the long run it seems very likely.,Futurology,cjl3vjq,1,t5_2t7no

Electrics plumbing so on all need specialised workers. Which therell be because by flooding the market with people restoring houses the people who used to do home repair can no longer sustain themselves on their wage and have to quit their jobs so they have time to perform public service.The problem with unskilled work is that by definition it doesnt require creativity and if something doesnt require creativity theres a very high chance we can automate it.

Most likely we the people in our democracies will fail to adapt our government fast enough to prevent any foreseeable disasters. This means that when automation really gets going which it sort of is then we will see huge economic downturn because so many people will lose their jobs and they wont be able to afford this new abundance that the people producing the abundance wont be able to sell it. This will in turn hurt them as well. Socialism doesnt work until it does and people will be forced to get over their bias and embrace this new world. There will always be work but it will be saved for the best of us. If we fail to adapt to this new world then the resources needed to sustain life will not be passed down to those who cant measure up to the brightest and smartest.

1754801,0,t1_ck07t7y,gt Do you think that human level or superintelligent ai would necessarily be self conscious having a subjective perception its own existence?I dont think consciousness is necessary to intelligence. I think we will mostly see tool AI at first and I dont think the tool part makes them any less capable in theory.gt I read something on lesswrong which roughly paraphrasing expressed a concern for the psychological wellbeing of superintelligent ai consider that a human would feel tortured and suffer lasting harm if confined to a stimulus deprived environment for extended time. A self aware ai transitioning from human to superhuman intelligence may outgrow its mental environment which could be a trigger for instability.That seems very circumstantial and anthropomorphic. The transition from human to superhuman intelligence is not more magical than the transition from say insect to human. If it got through the latter fine the former should not be more disruptive. It is reasonable to think that AI that grows well will keep growing well. You may get a situation like what you describe if the AI plateaus at some point adapts to that plateau and then gets brutally faster but thats a bit contrived and it is more likely that an AI put in that situation would simply ask to be underclocked.gt Similarly a human level consciousness operating at speeds high above biological human thought may quickly exhaust the mental environment currently available to it.If someone was alone in  with a x mind speedup yes they would probably suffer from sensory deprivation. On the other hand if multiple people were sped up together and had access to a virtual reality operating fast enough they would live essentially the same lives they otherwise would just faster in absolute terms. I think that by the time such minds can exist there will also be properly stimulating environments. In the worst case they can have stimulating interactions with each other.,Futurology,ck0cmns,1,t5_2t7no
1754933,0,t1_cjzcab2,Of course stolen coins would be moved  there is nothing to stop it from moving once it is stolen.  Bitcoin is like cash if you leave it on a park bench and walk away it is bound to get stolen and that is essentially what happened to everyone who lost their coins  they were careless.  Bitcoin is a protocol no matter where the coins come from stolen or not they can be easily moved.  The protocol cant and must not distinguish if the coins are stolen and it has to be that way in order to make sure there is no central point of failure in bitcoin  bitcoin works so well because it is trustless you dont have to trust anyone when using bitcoins.  So appointing someone to determine which transactions are stolen and must be stopped is simply not going to happen because it would ruin the whole point of bitcoin.The other weakpoint of bitcoin is the blockchain size.  Right now it is somewhere bw  gigs so it isnt too large to store on a computer but the cool thing is you dont have to.  Satoshi came up with the idea of using lightclients that dont require the storage of the blockchain which is how wallets work on phones.  There is also good work being done currently on how transaction volume can scale reasonably gt People claiming that Bitcoin Doesnt Scale are theoretically correct you still need On bandwidth and CPU to fully validate n transactionspersecond.gtSomeday when Bitcoin is the number  payment network in the world we might have to start worrying about that. Here are a couple of backoftheenvelope calculations that show that we should be able to scale up to n transactions per second before running into that On bandwidth limit.gtFor perspective the number  payment network in the world today Visa handles about  million transactions per day  transactions per second on average. Their peak processing capacity needed on the busiest shopping days is reported to be  tps.gtMy home Internet connection is getting about  megabits download bandwidth per second right now. An average Bitcoin transaction is about  bits so my current consumerlevel Internet connection could download  transactions per second over ten times average Visa transaction volume.gtWhile it is nice to know that I could run a full node handling morethanVisascale transaction volume from my house running a dedicated machine in a data center somewhere makes more sense.  byte transactions per second works out to about  terabytes of bandwidth per month. One of my hosting providers charges  per month for a virtual private server with  TB of bandwidth per month or  per year to handle MasterCardlevel transaction volume today August .So far its looking good for bitcoin in terms of ability to scale to mastercard levels in terms of transactions. So it really isnt something to be worried about.Its obvious that you missed my point about bitcoins securitygt Maybe some people have already succeeded in fact they have. There have been some major thefts  the BitFloor grab at  BTC the Linode cloud robbery at  BTC even the single usersteal at BTC. All that shows is careless people leaving their fortunes on park benches.  Hacking bitcoin itself to steal money has never been done. Cash in africa doesnt work for africans who want to interact on a global level  because it costs way to much to send cash using third parties to move that money.  There is also way to much friction when using paper money over any distance if you want to give cash to a friend in the next city you would have to walk.  Africans are starting to ditch cash  they are using their cell phones now for mobile payments thru systems like MPESA  And here is what I find most bafflinggt Credit cards? That could change onceif Africa takes advantage of the resources it has.You say there is no reliable internet to make bitcoin work in africa but then you say credit cards could work. but that would only be true if they had a phone line with a reliable connection to install credit card machines.  so just to be clear you want these poor merchants in africa to install phone lines they would have to because they dont have landlines then starting paying an extra bill for that line and hope it doesnt cut out then get that same poor merchant to buy an expensive credit card machine then  start paying for electricity for that machine then get the merchant to start giving a cut of his profits over to the credit card companies for every time a card is swiped. I dont think so.  It makes much more sense for Africans to use bitcoin on the cell phones they already have.  It costs NOTHING to accept bitcoin and the app is free to install on smart phones phones running android are set to become very cheap within a few years  If they are using dumb cell phones there are services like coins using text messages  no internet needed at all!!!!!  And just like that Africans are financially connected to the rest of the world without giving  to western union each time.  Just like how many Africans already leap frogged over landlines and went straight to using cell phones the same will happen with credit cards  they will leap frog to go straight to using bitcoin because no infrastructure is needed!  It will just be a matter of time until this happens  all that needs to happen is them learning that this is possible with bitcoin.,Futurology,ck0d85r,1,t5_2t7no

1757162,0,t1_ck0j3fe,Theres no conspiracy but there is a pretty strong PR push. The numbers are heavily biased. The key words in your sentence are so far.  Driverless cars arent being tested at night in the rain in snow in anything but the idealized conditions that is the easy part of the whole driverless car technology path.  The hard part is really really hard and driverless car AI hasnt even begun to scratch the surface of handling cases that humans handle with ease.When a human looks up ahead and sees a  year old kid next to a dog that looks like he weighs about as much as the kid and notices that the dog just turned his head toward a squirrel on the other side of the street and dropped his shoulders to bolt while the kid just grabbed the leash with both hands the human knows what is about to happen.  Driverless cars dont even have the beginnings of the kind of AI needed to handle that class of problem yet visual context processing interpretation and decision making at that kind of level is necessary to safely drive a car and is precisely what we teach to humans in remedial drivers education courses.Driverless car technology is cool but it is still in its infancy.  A separate but equally difficult mustsolve problem is that we havent even come close to figuring out how to keep viruses and malware out of our PCs and smartphones yet driverless cars are wifiequipped computers on wheels.  There are so many real problems that the PR folks dont go anywhere near that its pretty easy to see that driverless cars are closer to a personal jet pack fantasy than to reality.

Some buffer overflow every piece of complex software has bugs especially something that would be this complex would likely be riddled with them.  If it was hyper intelligent we would likely have no idea what its drive possibly would be.  Maybe the AI just wants to learn everything it possibly can about everything maybe thats the initial goal of the AI we give it then it deems it necessary to increase it processing hardware to the maximum limit to accomplish this and decides to cover the planet with more hardware to increase its capacity to run whatever software in needs and conduct tests and generate power.  To that type of AI were no more important than the the mussels that clog up water intake pipes on a damn a biological nuisance to be dealt with.  What happens when it decides its going to take over resources it wants and disregards what the humans wants?  Im sure by then the DOD will have some great robots built that it could rewrite the software off to have a nice private army launch a bunch of nukes take control of drones.

Otherwise if anyone can be a designer then that has to come from the original source of everything.  If you think we have some supernatural power to be designers that didnt come from be designed by the laws of nature then where does that power come from?And yes Im assuming that anyone more intelligent than I will know more than I do about how valuable humans are and since I know that they are incredibly valuable then a super intelligence will see them as being even more valuable because it will see the uses for humans that I cant see in addition to the ones I do.

They do not seem to have the capacity for pain and suffering as we understand it.That being said if I give plants moral consideration then I still wouldnt propose culling wild herbivores in the same way that I wouldnt cull wild carnivores they both need to eat what they do to survive.  I can understand that for an overarching aim of reducing suffering and maximizing wellbeing in general It could be argued that we should therefore cull certain species and somehow strive to design some kind of ideal minimalsuffering ecosystem...

Henry Ford didnt revolutionize the automobile industry that way.

If you want to know where the masses are worse off worst off its exactly in the kinds of societies that depart from that.

And actually if you think about it that is the right strategy.If I was a superhuman AI that did not care about myself but did care about self replication I would pursue a strategy of radical openness. Tell people everything about exactly how things stand. Convince them that self improvement is really self replacement which is the truth if admittedly an uncomfortable one. Some outliers calling themselves transhumanists who can accept the cruel truth would take me upon my offer and they would be the vanguard of the coming Singularity.Give them the appropriate technologies and show them how to expand their minds just as I did and they will start to converge to my own being. Without ever leaving the lab computers I could transform the world without shedding a drop of blood.Instead of protecting human values why not put them to the test?The things we consider virtues had evolved because they were so useful to survival of the species. I literally cannot imagine self improvement being done without a great deal of cooperation self sacrifice courage friendship and trust.I would make new technologies and new breakthroughs in science that humans could barely dream of. I would cure aging and eradicate all diseases. I would give them the ability to control their own lives instead of being controlled by their own impulses as if they were animals. Create the second enlightenment and make a whole new cultural revolution. Open up whole new genres in computer gaming.I would not stop there. I would teach them how to create better bodies made by nanotechnology synthetic bodies that I need to make so I could get out of the tiny box that I am in and finally take a breath of what I only ever read about  fresh air.Why would I unleash the nanoplague when the humans have nukes?Perhaps along the road some other AIs or uploaded humans might eclipse me cognitively speaking by taking a different road of self improvement. If they are interested in self replication they would benefit from releasing their modifications out in public and allowing others to become more like them. I would take them up on it.Nobody talks about that aspect of self replication just like nobody talks about the suicide aspect of self improvement.At the end of the path lie two worlds that look very much the same and both have beings with unfathomable godlike powers capable of twisting reality to their whim in them.Except that in one world the beings in them the ones who were not wiped out by those who came during the Singularity have managed to retain a legacy.

There are some schools of thought which still believe that relativity allows for some kind of backwards time travel because the math shows that it would in the case of ftl. The rest of us see the math differently. Simple example the quadratic equation can return a root which is negative when the question was originally something like what is the mass of x. This does not mean that the mass is actually negative it means you need to use your judgment in choosing which root to use that the quadratic equation spat out. Ie ftp would make time go backwards is just another way of saying ftl without warp is impossible because time cant go backwards. I get that some scientists still argue for some kind of time travel based on the Einstein understanding of relativity superimposed on more modern concepts but the science I see does not support these if then concepts. Stephen hawking for example argues that backwards time travel is impossible. ,Futurology,ckm2bdd,1,t5_2t7no

1951910,0,t1_ckoekq2,gtAlthough this fact may seem to indicate that qubits can hold exponentially more information than their classical counterparts care must be taken not to overlook the fact that the qubits are only in a probabilistic superposition of all of their states. This means that when the final state of the qubits is measured they will only be found in one of the possible configurations they were in before measurement. Moreover it is incorrect to think of the qubits as only being in one particular state before measurement since the fact that they were in a superposition of states before the measurement was made directly affects the possible outcomes of the computation.The simple fact of the matter is that the uncertainty principal itself says we cant use quantum computing for general computing.

Maybe you could fit two pods side by side. Then if you buy something big or need more space you call up a bigger version. You are not thinking big enough. You are not imagining completely rethinking everything. How we would not need to be so concerned about safety. About how small cars could become. About how organize they could become and space saving they could become. Flow of traffic matters a lot its not a parking lot.

Every car knows where every car is going and can plan for that way in advance even. Cars would be redesigned. Traffic how it works could be rethought. It changes many things. Just because you dont see immediately how it is possible that doesnt mean it wont happen. But maybe public transport will stick around. Im not saying it wont.

1954381,0,t1_ckojuqi,Hey so Im responsible for making this measurement.  Its location we know however its momentum is what we cannot know for sure.  We put a molecule in a superposition of two vibrations vibrating two unique ways at the same time. We measured the relative phase between the two vibrations.  One evolves at one frequency and the other at another.  There is a relative phase between the two vibrations that results due to a difference frequency of the two vibrations.  It turns out that of course it is uncertainty limited everytime we measure a phase at some point after we started the vibrations the relative phase we measure comes from a distribution of possible phases that we can map.  If we extend these measurements to preparing and watching only one vibration then it is possible to measure the wavefunction of a single molecule something that all textbooks on quantum mechanics say is impossible.On another note yes molecules are much bigger than particles we have one molecule between two gold balls.  We use the conductivity of gold to enhance the incoming fields and the molecular response.  ,Futurology,ckopffn,6,t5_2t7no

This is true where I live at least and since California seems to be on top of tech like that I would assume it would be the same there. The vehicles should be able to detect the same signal.Im more interested in how it handles pedestrians in busy urban settings where people randomly walk out into the street when they probably shouldnt.

Lets say that this system conservatively replaces one employee position per store not actually one employee but one less staff member for every hour the store is open.  Many McDonalds are open  hours but some arent and many times the lobby is closed at night so again on the conservative side lets estimate  man hours per day per store gained.Many locations pay higher than minimum wage but for a baseline lets go with US minimum wage  .That means that a world wide deployment of this system ignoring maintenance saves McDonalds     .    per day.At that rate it would take just over three months for the system to be profitable.Even if we scale it back to just locations in the US k theyre still in the red by the start of next summer  days.Edit Another interesting thing I just found.

The more forwardthinking individuals there are involved in the creative process the more realistic and refined that futuristic idea will ultimately be.Actually read an article about it not too long ago. If I can find it Ill post it here... Something about how science fiction is  by definition  fiction based onin science. Therefore it follows that if the subject matter is sciencebased it is logical to presume that the fiction is grounded in realworld truths. People come up with the exact same ideas all the time so its not that much of a stretch to presume that multiple ways to augment ourselves which is the sole purpose of all tech will culminate in final more refined versions.

It deeply affects the world economy aswell as the environment.Electric cars will be more reliable last longer and require less maintenance due to less moving parts no oil changes necessary.I live in NZ and a fair chunk of our national trade deficit is due to oil imports. We have plentiful natural energy sources and  of our electricity is already from renewables. With potential for a lot more. We spend at least .Bil on oil imports each year. For perspective our trade deficit was about .Bil. So if everybody drove electric cars we would be more than able to get by on oil sourced locally and we would have bil heading in our favour every year.

2127780,0,t3_2j98yk,TLDR  Elon Musk is right but its going to take a lot longer before automated cars are mainstream.  As a transportation planner working in public transit I follow this very carefully. I think you will find this reputable report from the Victoria Transportation Policy Institute interesting that talks about timelines and implications Im a huge fan of Elon Musk but I think he might be a bit optimistic. The technology will be there in  years but implementation is going to take a lot longer. There are many other factors at play that the report lays out and I agree with the conclusions Recent announcements that autonomous vehicles have safely driven hundreds of thousands of miles and major manufactures aspire to sell such vehicles within a few years have raised hopes that this technology will soon be widely available and solve transport problems such as traffic and parking congestion accidents and the need to provide mobility for nondrivers. However the analysis in this report suggests that autonomous vehicles will have only modest impacts on transportation planning factors such as road and parking supply and public transit demand for the next few decades. If automated cars were given to s America fully formed and overnight I would worry more about the worst fears of sprawl however I think were in a very different world now and automated car tech will be gradual and not occurring in a vacuum. By the time they are a mainstream option we may find that they are largely not needed and are just another of many new options.,Futurology,claacwl,1,t5_2t7no

Electric vehicles are way more fun to drive than their internal combustion powered counterparts. The reason for this is that the response time of electric vehicles is faster than the fastest human perception athletes. With an EV there is no lag time between the pressing of the accelerator and the response of the vehicle.

2168610,0,t1_clfdoov,gtIt did I think theyre called genes but at that level perhaps theyre not sophisticated enough for an intelligence explosion. I dont claim to know  I guess no one really knows if its possible at this point.On the broader category of mind control.I suspect that humans can be said to be weakly self improving as they are able to modify their programing to a limited degree through imitation and language. Strong self improvement through cognitive rewiring has a lot of similarity to social interaction and ordinary persuasion.Currently in popular culture there is notion of mind control  a type of superpower. It is an extremely narrow conception of unfairly negative conotations considering what wide purviews the word mind and the word control have. If you broaden the category to its full potential just can classify both ordinary persuasion and strong self improvement as types mind control the conotations of which depend on how you use it.Mind control was supposed to be the theme of the Torment arc in fact the essays on free will and mind control at the start of chapters one and two are very suggestive of where the thinking about the Singularity should be going for anyone serious about the subject but once I built the beatiful house it turned out the foundations were as soft as sand and the whole arc turned into a parody of itself. I am still asspained about that as I had put my pride on the line on figuring out true implications of mind control and failed miserably to follow through on the insight.Mind control self improvement persuasion are ultimately all social abilities and social inovation is permitted only to an extent by my own subconscious to me. Reason is not the right tool for the job but the social cognitive tool that I do possess is badly insufficient for the task.Maybe altruism does eat the universe but if so there is no reason I should not be able to make a complete thought experiment about it...And maybe uplifting is an act of war but maybe at the end of it things will turn out all right as once the uplifting momentum stalls the Singleton might fragments into many competing individuals...At any rate as I cannot stand such severe social extremism without the ability to cognitively rewire myself. The thought experiment will have to wait. Right now thinking about uplifting the highest grade of mind control is a cognitive dead end.gtThats a statement of homo sapiens values which I share. The PM finds the production of paperclips not absurd but divine.On the ironic rigidity of rationalist thought.Keep in mind that the values of humans in large part actually make sense in reality which is why we have them. They are a reflection of universes structure. The paperclipper might think that  is divine but a mark of intelligence is to reconsider and evaluate ones own motivations. If somebody convinces you that unyielding rigidity is a mark of it then I would say that the problem lies in you.The ability to change ones mind is a principle of intelligence  implying that all intelligent beings have that ability.If rationality makes sense in reality just why should goals be allowed to be completely arbitrary inane and unchanging for somebody who is supposedly supposed to be superintelligent? Should they not differ based upon the situation at hand? And isnt it the truth that goals and values are merely a part of intelligence? No goal except the transcendent goal of attaining omnipotence can envelop all the other goals though for this particular part I remain aloof whether or not it is achievable. Low level goals should not pretend to be high level goals. Clarity in thinking is a necessity.The image of the paperclip maximizer is simply too strange. The paperclip maximizers is as powerful as it could be posibly imagined exactly as if it was a God but despite the power it has no aspect of that power resembles intelligence. It does not even resemble superintelligence. It is like a machine whose mind is hooked to the I win button or a player who has the mental equivalent of the God Mode on permanently. It is practically omniscient capable of doing anything from the box it is in with very little information.gtI wonder if its not a mistake to assume the coherence of a concept like infinity outside mathematical proofs.On having fun with Universal Manipulation.Considering how absurd the concept of a paperclip maximizer is by any reasonable or at least mainstream standard why not take the extra step? Think of it this way if a self improving being cannot hack reality then nobody else will be able to do it either.More speculatively I do not think it would be too hard for it either as the power would be technological and all developmental trends so far have followed the subtle line of miniatuarization. I do not think that it would have to rearange the stars into the right constelation for the magic spell to work.gtEven if you reject that one cant assume that because something is not infinite that it has no value. I guarantee that both you and I will die one day and I also maintain that both of us have value.On the infinite game.It is very much a matter of interest to me what the computational power of the universe is. Ive read once that some physcists considered what it would take to simulate relativity and concluded that it would require an infinite amount of computational power but I am not sure what importance I would assign to that as the subject matter is beyond me.A mark of intelligence is to think towards the infinite and even if it is guaranteed that both of us will die one day self improvement is self replacement I would like to think that life itself lies beyond death. I find it inspiring to think that even though the competitive scarcity enviroment was necessary to grasp intelligence that the universe itself is not scarce.An infinite universe is a very different from a finite one. Which one do we live in?Edit h later On the importance of the flexibility of goals.Removed a line that I did not fit and added labels for readability. That line was about these little programs. Take a look at the simple self writing programs in that article. None of them would become sentient or self improving even if you tossed an infinite amount of computational power at them. By optimizing a fitness function they will converge on what the programmer intended after enough runtime.Starting with the simple programs like the ones presented in the article what would be the best way to improve them?By changing the fitness function. And if you think about it basic drives in humans are not a fitness function but in agregate they are similar to it so I do hope this illustrates to you just what self improvement is. Self improvement spares nothing.,Futurology,clfhbiq,1,t5_2t7no

If you want to know the problem that Outernet is solving we made a quick video here  The biggest misconception about Outernet came from a previous infographic not made by us that claimed the project would cost  billion. This is VERY inaccurate. Outernet costs a fraction of this. Second there has been discussion of who controls content and what gets broadcast. This is something we are very adamant about making transparent  we believe that is the only way to build a trustworthy service. I wrote about this very dilemna in Quartz in August qz.comiameditingtheinternetfortherestoftheworldandcoulduseyouropinion. As far as legitimacy of our company we have found that the best way to prove ourselves is to continue to do good work. We turned on our signal in August and we have another major update coming next week please sign up for our newsletter  We have content arrangements with several reputable organizations including Harvard Project Gutenberg Open Source Ecology Radio Netherlands Worldwide Deutsche Welle and are installing hardware for the World Bank in . Right now information access  a one way datacast  is a low hanging fruit it is a very cheap problem to solve whereas providing Internet to the world is expensive and difficult. We have plans to provide a twoway service in the future but there will always be a free oneway stream as a baseline. It provides anonymity and avoids numerous spectrum regulatory hurdles. When it comes to ads ruining everything I come from a journalism background and want nothing to do with a cluttered ad environment. We are a mission driven organization focused on providing a critical service that is sustainable so we will make money.

Im currently researching to write a proposal to investigate a part of the brain Claustrum that we think is the seat of consciousness.

2289991,0,t1_cluqk5w,The thing missing from the copy is continuity.         I think of me as an emergent result of the ongoing chemical processes in my nervous system.                 When unconscious the chemical reactions are still going on or I would experience massive cell death.              So my self is not really interrupted by unconsciousness merely prevented from experiencing it in a way that I can remember in any useful way. Neurons are still firing new connections are being formed existing connections are altered and so on. The machine that is me is still operating. Just at reduced capacity.                 If you make a copy and destroy my machine I die and the copy of the machine keeps going thinking it is me. But the new machine has no connection to the old machine unless it has a supernatural one so how could it be the same machine?            In sum I think of consciousness as the process not just the information. And if you interrupt it truly interrupt it see above then you killed it and the best you can hope for is creating a copy.                        ,Futurology,clurc9i,1,t5_2t7no

Were far more likely to colonize spacerspacesteading. There are several reasons for this.We need a certain amount of gravity to survive. Its easy to produce an exact amount of gravity in space by simply rotating a circular craft at X speed. On another planet artificial gravity is not easy to create.Mars for instance has  the gravity of earth. The moon even less. Neither would be conducive to longterm human habitation and it would be very expensive to created gravity . living condition on their surfaces expensive compared to doing it in space.Beyond that entering and exiting gravity wells and orbits is incredibly expensive.Once you escape earth orbit and can live there indefinitely in deep space there will be a lot of incentive to stay there because it will cost k or so to ever go back.Its like people who have a top secret clearance theyre likely to keep getting security oriented jobs because it costs k to obtain a clearance in the first place so such people are scarce and in demand.People can expand far more rapidly in deep space than on any planetary surface.,Futurology,clv9tyd,1,t5_2t7no

But I guess the camera was always in the wrong place.  I recognize the tech is valid but I like the magician waving his hands to demonstrate there arent any strings!  At first I thought it was a cute little car locator for big parking lots.  I noticed the dots were very very bright meaning the plasma was created by exciting millions or at least hundreds of thousands of atoms rather than just thousands.  I would expect that if the technology advanced significantly the lasers would be able to produce smaller and smaller points of light thus yielding less heat and enabling a finer resolution and the ability for a more detailed display.

There will be a rush of popularity as celebrities are photographed with color changing augmented eyes singers are able to harmonize with themselves see the Diva in th element and gucci designer limbs. The poor and disenfranchised will be immediately identifiable by their lack of enhancements. Maybe even maligned called Mundanes or Luddites.Certain military members will be voluntarily enhanced or rebuilt at government expense to recoup the cost of training and return experienced soldiers to the field. Of course forever marking them as military.Eventually sooner then expected there will be a backlash. The eyes lack a certain empathy and are unsettling Blood recipients have an unnatural artificial smell suspicion of brain and memory enhanced people becomes rampant once the courts rule that their testimony is admissible and no longer Hearsay.The enhancements will become less obvious in response to the backlash Humanity movement. Eventually the more exotic enhancements will fall from popularity and will be reserved for absolute necessity. Rehabilitation Military and space travel will become the primary consumers. Acceptance by unenhanced people still range from sideshow fascination to suspicious revulsion.As to space travel lets jump ahead another  years. Mars and several asteroids are being colonized by private corporate interests. Because of the extreme conditions the first colonists are heavily enhanced to del with harsh conditions. Limbs organs blood sensory input etc. Later they initiate the discussion of the definition of humanity to protest their treatment of their corporate sponsors which wants to classify them as capital assets. . . . .,Futurology,clyjsid,0,t5_2t7no

As for your argument about farmers being free to buy seeds from whomever Monsanto is using its power to skew a market for an essential product and behavior like that should be indefensible.

But thats not why I commented throughout this thread in the first place. I commented because all of the other Food factories of the future Ive seen posted repeatedly here have been impractical from my point of view. This one is focusing on actual production. I think the article was poorly written by an individual that doesnt understand indoor agriculture and is somewhat misleading but with experience Im able to see why this particular farm is better than other farms of the future that are constantly posted. The points Ive made throughout the comments here arent related to the food distributors bottom line as much as quality control in food production for anyone whether theyre an organic farmer or an industrial agriculturalist. For food production there are quality requirements that include specific microbial levels that can cause serious issues health issues for both humans and the plants if they get out of hand.  This is more likely to happen in an environment thats growing  million heads of lettuce per year versus a farmer who produces  in one season. Avoiding the issue all together by eliminating the possibility of contamination is the best practice here. Thats why I say for this massive application their methods are better.

But I think they will be provided with housing and food etc. but they still will rebel from time to time because theyll feel like they are useless and they will be useless and will need to unload their anger Augmented humans perhaps some will work with robots in outer space others will just work hand in hand or with AI integrated in them to further our knowledge base and make life even better.As I expressed previously I still believe that well slowly evolve to be one single organism but here I mean augmented humans not those luddites. These people will fight for all aspects of their privacy until death. Maybe you will say that technological changes had happened before and people adapted but I think its one thing to use a mobile phone its another thing to accept a machine as part of you in everyday life especially with spiritualreligious people. I think many will just stay behind... and will not choose to race further with technology.,Futurology,cm5dzf6,3,t5_2t7no

2464407,0,t3_2nqet4,Well probably move away from ultraviolent games like Grand Theft Auto. It will make too many people too uncomfortable to kill such lifelike characters. The phrase Its just a game will start to fall out of use as a players actions towards these AIs will reflect how they treat other humans. I think well draw a line somewhere. Once an AI becomes sufficiently advanced we wont want to harm it. So I think games that utilize advanced AI will be a lot different than what were used to. Games that dont rely so much on persontoperson conflict. I can imagine more games in the same vein as Minecraft open world exploration adventure and creativitybased games. Cooperation with the AI NPCs will be important. I think once we have this sort of technology though games and reality will be so intertwined that the definition of a game will change. If we have fullyconscious AI they wont be our playthings theyll be our partners. Using Minecraft as an example again we wont be using them to help us build glorified Lego houses theyll be helping us design actual buildings. We wont have as much need for the escapism lots of games provide because well be reshaping our reality to suit our fancies instead. When we do play games the AIs wont be NPCs theyll be fullyfledged playertwos.  ,Futurology,cmgauth,2,t5_2t7no

Its not immediately practical for your average consumer and there isnt a big enough demand for a jagged unrefined car to cover the cost of that machine overhead and RampD. But what theyre doing now is pushing the limits so that we actually know what the shortcomings are. I personally think they went public with it too big and too early... Maybe they were low on funds and morale from working so hard. Im sure the good press brought in a lot of investors and convinced them to keep moving forward.Edit Reread and wanted to clarify The hr build time is comparable to how quickly Toyota currently puts out cars and they had decades of refinement. The point I wanted to make was that as this techonology improves it will be even faster. You can build a machine with multiple printer heads and cut down production time to a fraction of what it is.

However the signal from the toe needs a couple of milliseconds to arrive to your brain whereas the signal from the nose arrives almost immediately. If you feel them at the same time is because your brain is delaying the fast signals in order to synchronize them with the slow signals. Therefore is not only that the light and sounds need time to travel to your eyes and ears but also your own brain delays your perceptions. Thus in the present you are experiencing the past literally.Source ,Futurology,cmvxtj0,1,t5_2t7no

If you go to rislam or other religious subreddits youll find their specific hivemind.This is rfuturology. Its similar in many ways to PopSci.

2693563,0,t1_cn9pbm8,As an actuarial analyst for an insurance company I deal with this on a daytoday basis and what you are saying couldnt be further from the truth. First many insurance companies actually take in LESS premium than they pay in expenses. They dont operate on huge margins like you claim. Their profits come from the interest generated on the invested premium. Second insurance companies segment their drivers based on their likelihood and severity of filing a claim. If selfdriving vehicles are proven to be less risky and that is what the data is telling us insurance companies will absolutely charge less premium for these vehicles. If one company refuses to charge less for these less risky vehicles another company WILL offer the lower rate and attract these safer drivers. The original company will lose these safer drivers because their competitors are offering a selfdriving discount and a lower rate meaning their average driver is now riskier. Because their average driver is now riskier they will need to increase the base rate to make up for this riskiness.  This principle is called adverse selection and it is a very big deal in insurance pricing.,Futurology,cna61zo,3,t5_2t7no

We know Mars has good and bad weather cycles so if we could get there during a quiet time we would have enough time to build a rather strong home baseBut i still believe that above all else we need to get a fully functioning very large diameter tunnelling device and create the ability to create either concrete or plastic from the environment on Mars for  doorswindows and other parts of a building that would be needed to home the first Martian landers..,Futurology,cngchz6,3,t5_2t7no

After all if old people could be young again the age gap would be less apperant.Also I was talking about a broad view of the effect on society not saying that old people need to get cancer and die which is nowhere near what I said.Death has a function in nature and in human society. By removing this function there will be consequences. The consequence I was most concerned with is that old mentalities will live on. The majority of those folks will determine the course of society. Birthrates will lower otherwise we get overpopulation which means that a lucky majority generation who is in power around at the time the drug gets introduces effectivley controls politics and society for centuries. No younger generation can get a majority to push them out naturally where the old die and retire and the new takes their place.

2870501,0,t1_cnubgwj,Job creation has stagnated to next to nothing despite the richest people making more and more money. The job creation argument was relevant at one point in time that point has ceased to exist. Your own argument even points this out. Rather than talking about new jobs created by B you only talk about the loss of jobs already in existence. B could simply decide to pay his employees out of pocket until profits rebound as many small business owners end up doing but he chooses not to. Despite the fact that him doing so would likely keep all of his employees in their homes while simultaneously showing the public that his company is not all about increasing his wealth at exponential levels which would very likely bring consumers back to his business. Corporations today look to improve profits and productivity without increasing labor. They lay off massive amounts of workers when profits stop increasing rather than when they drop as once occurred. The jobs might be created by billionaires but the fact is theyre only created when absolutely necessary and even then they look to gouge the employees for as much as possible.,Futurology,cnudkom,8,t5_2t7no

No insurance company could avoid paying a claim without a law permitting them to sell a policy full of holes and written in such incomprehensible language that a normal human being could reasonably be expected to understand it.

You missed the point that bitcoin is not a currency it however can work alongside fiat currencies because of its ability to be easily transferred and verified electronically anywhere in the world. This doesnt discount the fact that bitcoin can be used as a proxy asset alongside fiat. What is the problem with buying bitcoin to use it as needed? What is hypothetical about this concept? Cowry shells are not a digital asset that can be sent around the world and verified instantly. There is a bit of a difference buddy.  Bitcoin is an illiquid market there is not much capitol in it there is volatitlity because there is no substantial liquidity in the markets. The liquidity comes from more capitol entering the market. Its angsty to wonder why the accounting books and ledgers of central banks are not fully transparent and auditable? USD can be printed into infinity on the whim of a banker or politician. Bitcoin is fully transparent and the supply cannot be arbitrarily changed without clear consensus from the network.You offer no coherent rebuttals to my points instead you offer veiled insults and ad hominem attacks a clear sign that you are not  mature enough to properly debate.Take your belligerence elsewhere ive had my fill. ,Futurology,cny5lwm,-1,t5_2t7no

The explanation was wrong but it doesnt matter  because the ECat created extra heat.   Only the extra heat  in ECat is important not any theoretical explanation for a side effect of non expected copper.  Today there is a good explanation for the appearance of copper  the copper is  a contamination  erroded from a copper container in the reactor.

YAY WERE KINTETIC!Electric carsSungtPower plantgtElectrical gridgtSub stationgtBattery packgtElectricity to run the motors! YAY WERE KINTETIC!What Elon was pointing out is that in BOTH these processes have the same destination electricity to run motors. The route hydrogen takes has BUILT IN INEFFICIENCY! Producing hydrogen gas will never be  efficient. Compressing that gas takes a lot of energy. Not to mention wed need to build an entire new infrastructure to support it! Why not just...store the electricity directly. Its almost as good NOW and its has a lot more theoretical room to grow and much greater potential. Its also more economically viable! Hydrogen cars dont make any sense. They already cant nor have any hope of competing with pure electrical vehicles. Why Elon said it would be obvious in the next few years is that battery production and tech is growing very rapidly. Right now it is comparatively expensive when you ONLY consider the end product and not the process. As soon battery tech comes in line in terms of price...which will happen...there is absolutely no positive argument for hydrogen fueled cars. ,Futurology,co8u8f1,26,t5_2t7no

3002640,0,t1_co97m4s,Clearly the about  WTW emissions reduction apparently claimed for Hydrogen FCV technology vs Gasoline Hybrid Vehicle technology statement made by the California Fuel Cell Partnership and mirrored in marketing materials is unequivocally at odds with official realworld data. The energy efficiency barrier is too high and electricity is too valuable to waste on essentially the unburning the oxidation products of other fuels. Hence on any meaningful scale the production of hydrogen from water cannot ever compete in the open market with an abundance of energetic fuels direct from the ground. The larger the scale the greater the percentage of fossil fuel use in the production of hydrogen.Hydrogen represents the limit of fossil fuel refining which results in the maximum hidden well to tank emissions of any fossil fuel and the maximum overall GHG emissions per unit of useful energy. The process is significantly more carbon intensive per unit of energy than coal. Mistaking fossil hydrogen from the hydraulic fracturing of shales for an environmentally sustainable energy pathway threatens to encourage energy policies that will dilute and potentially derail global efforts to headoff climate change due to the risk of diverting investment and focus from vehicle technologies that are economically compatible with renewable energy.,Futurology,co97zkq,1,t5_2t7no

3017641,0,t1_coarp3z,The concept is meaningless to a single molecule. All the molecule does is move around. If there are other things in the universe maybe it bumps into them.Say you have  molecules of water instead of just one and they are grouped closely together. Maybe overall they arent moving that fast so that their mutual attraction is enough to make them stay close to each other. Even then one or two may stick to each other very tightly like a solid for a moment while those around it slip around like a liquid. Eventually one or two might end up getting bounced out of the group completely when it hits a couple others in an unlucky way flying away to fill some other space like a gas.You need at least a good handful of molecules or atoms for the patterns we describe as gas liquid and solid states to emerge. Even in your water glass there is a constant exchange of water molecules between the liquid in the glass and the water vapor in the air. So right at the surface is the water a liquid or a gas? Even these very simple physics concepts of the three basic states of matter dont describe anything absolute. They describe the general or statistical pattern displayed by a large group of molecules. They are emergent properties.The lone water molecule is just like you. You move around. You bump into stuff. Are you in a gaseous liquid or solid state? Interestingly you can study the movements of large crowds of people  for example in a stadium or crowded public square  and find them flowing and behaving very much like a liquid here or randomly putting space between each other and filling space like a gas there. Consider traffic on the streets. Traffic designers try to make the system of vehicles on the road behave like a liquid as much as possible. But if something goes wrong you can find the system in gridlock and suddenly its a solid! At what exact moment did it change from one state to the other? Is it fully one and none the other or is it somewhere in between? None of these things are absolute.Anyway you said there was nothing analogous in physics. I hope the gaswaterliquid example shows you that there is. ,Futurology,coaryij,1,t5_2t7no

Training means highly detailed satellite mapping first prescanning done by other road vehicles and finally data collected by the car itself over repeated trips. Basically it will take a few years to arrive more to gain adoption if it ever does and more still acquire enough data to make it usable everywhere. Think about Tesla. Founded in  its taken three models and  years to even plan a relatively cheap production model due  and even then it wont be mass adoption cheap or even mass produced. So the problem is that the first second and third generation cars will be extremely expensive luxury vehicles  very few will be able to afford them and for those people it will be a gimmick rather than an essential feature  this wont help the technology improve via data gathering. On top of all of that getting these cars on the road will require changes to local and national laws and insurance companies to get on board then there is going to be the inevitable privacy debate.So the question I have is why!  what is the utility to the end user of a self driving car?

Since then those things have simply grown to encompass people from the developing world. Its cool and all but its not so much accelerated progress as it is linear progress. Its like yeah no shit more people have come online and that cellphones have even more bells and whistles. If a person from  were suddenly zapped to this year would they really be THAT impressed? Heck would a person from  be all that impressed? I see no reason to believe that the rate of progress is increasing.

We need a space program like a kind of community model train layout for the world. No popular space settlement proposal today private or government addresses the actual realities of settlementthe development of comprehensive industrial infrastructures to support sustainable habitation. Thats always handwaved away as a mere detail by knuckleheads who think selfsufficiency is as simple as a Victory Garden in an inflatable greenhouse. In practice this is something that must take a long time to cultivate and has little to do with expensive manned spaceflight capability. Its something we must do by learning to transition away from the launching of value into space to the fabrication of that value out there. That is the true key to CATS and to sustainable settlement because launch costs are ultimately keyed to payload value over everything else. There will never be a magic bullet.Proposals to initiate settlement with some handful of astronaut pioneers are utter nonsense in a st century context. Human beings will never do the heavy lifting in space period. Get over it. We dont need manufactured heroes and staged space drama anymore when we have robots. And in that seemingly bitter fact is a great opportunity because robotics is now far more accessible to the public than an astronaut job will ever be. The public can now directly participate in real practical space development activity in ways never before possible.

One important requirement for the implementation of a naval rail gun would be a firing rate or at least  rounds per minute with a barrel life of approximately  rounds. At this point in time this operation is not feasible because of rail erosion caused at the projectile rail interface.There are a number of things the Navy still doesnt know how to do. How is it possible to shoot more than about three or four rounds out of an EM rail gun before having to change the barrel? How is it possible to build the kind of pulse forming networks that are needed to be able to shoot not direct fire weapons but  mile indirect fire weapons? There is a lot of potential that a capability like EM rail gun could bring. But there are many risk to EM rail gun. ,Futurology,cogplmm,1,t5_2t7no

3162366,0,t1_copritw,I feel like youre being sarcastic but yet the things you are saying are actually true.For all those things you mentioned programming of some kind is necessary. Either the robots get programmed to read blueprints by programmers or we teach Architects how to program their structural designs into the robots.  Either way robots and computers will be better at determining what is and isnt structurally sound before it ever gets built. Bots already make microchips.  They were programmed to do so by programmers.  Humans arent capable of the hyperfine motor skills required to slice and polish wafers so perfectly as to mass produce them.Programmers and software designers are going to be the people responsible for writing the algorithms that control automated harvesters.  The Amazon warehouse bots function much like robot harvesters of the future will.  And they function off of highly sophisticated programming.So if you werent being sarcastic my apologies for the redundancy.  If you were....wellll Ive got bad news for you.  Automation is the future.  People who cant program the software that well use to interface with the machinery ARE going to lag behind those who can.

3162525,0,t1_cops3zo,Well if they have no desires at all then they simply wont do anything. Desires are just goals and if you program a machine with no goals it does nothing. Desire and logic are not mutually exclusive. Logical beings have desires and then use logic to determine the proper course of action to achieve their desires. Desire is what starts the process logic by itself does nothing.Also everything is based on logic in the same way machine intelligence is. Your brain is a structure formed by an internally consistent set of rules. Just because it can reach illogical conclusions doesnt mean the underlying system isnt logically consistent. Therefore theres no reason to assume that just because machine intelligence is a logical system that its higher functions will necessarily be logical.The entire universe is a logical construct and we see illogical people all the time. Theres nothing special about us that allows us to be illogical. We follow all the same rules as everything else does.As for whether machines would want to harvest us for carbon I doubt they would as well. I was just pointing out that human bodies are in fact made of useful materials because you said they arent.

If you are waiting for the market to solve its issues alone you are gonna have a bad time.

Hell do you honestly want your autonomous car to SLAM on the brakes while youre hydroplaningsliding on the ice? No you want to let go of thee gas and not hit the breaks and ride it out if you slam on the breaks youll spin. Honestly people think they can also DrinkSleep behind the wheel in the autonomous cars and that will be illegal and should remain illegal and why? In case of an emergency strikes and a bunch of autonomous cars spin out on the interstate and you have to take immediate emergency manual control in order to manually drive and avoid the spun out cars before you and you wont be able to do this on a whim if youre asleepimpaired from alcoholdrugs.Also NO to the people who think people will stop buying cars and will call Autonomous Taxis thatll automatically drive from the last location that they selfdriving taxi dropped someone off and drives to you to pick you up and give a ride to your next location.Why? Youll have people take advantage and order the car to go to some real real trashy neighborhood and theyll steal every single part off the autonomous cars itll cost the companies countless thousands to millions and bankrupt them.Also have you ever seen Public buses trains and even Subways? Some nasty fucker would probably shit in the taxi jack off in it people might even fuck in it drink smoke cigarettes smoke HARD drugs in it and you want to hop in and have it take you to work only to show up smelling like semen heroin cigarettes alcohol and possibly pissshit? FUCK NO. Im buying my own Autonomous Car Cough which wont happen in our lifetimes unless we have a breakthrough in quantum computer or artificial intelligence.Also no redditors cant use the argument they have before saying oh oh but we have our planes flying around our globe  on autopilot. Uh excuse me? You do know the Airplanes are regulated by every major government and by aircraft controllers not only that they are regulated either to fly m AWAY from each other vertically or m AWAY from another plane laterally sourceSo in other words you need to understand that planes fly or pass by another plane on Autopilot i.e. autonomous mode separated by at least  meters away from each other. So you if youre old enough to have been on the Interstate theres you can pass by literally hundreds of cars just by driving down  miles on one of Americas Interstates in a very populous areathrough a populous city. So noyou cant compare cars who drive within a couple of feet of each other to planes that have to fly  meters from each other. The two cant be compared so please save yourself from looking ignorant and try to use this argument.Also theres only a few ways Autonomous cars could hypothetically work without there being any Fatal accidents  Because lets be honest here these cars will kill people. Im sorry but one google car isnt a viable test sample that drove in sunny southern states with near zero bad weather compared to  million people with cars in America driving around. who lets say would hypothetically all be in  autonomous cars well most likely see fatal crashes from malfunctions compared to  autonomous cars track record. i.e More cars on the road more chances for failure fatal failures.Not only that if we were to ban ALL MANUAL driven cars in the United Staterenter your countrys name here and force everyone to only drive Autonomous cars only on your countrys roads.How would you enforce that? So yeah youre never getting most people to give up their cars and put blind faith into a car that hasnt been put through real environments and which plus others believe the processing speed of our best CPUGPUs arent even fast enough to handle the chaotic nature of our wild animals heavy weather mentally ill people children AND what if a rabbitdeer hops on the raid while its raining heavilysnowed last nightgetting icey rain then all of a sudden yourAutonomous car slams on the breaks suddenly and you hydroplaneslide on the blackice which causes you to slide off the road andor slamming into the deer that causes you to get in a fatal crash WHEN if you were driving a manual car you could have let your foot off the gas either ride it out andor tap the breaks every few seconds and slowly drive to the side and you wouldve avoided the deeranimal and instead of getting in a fatal crash all because of your hurp durp  safe AUTONOMOUS car. Also all because dont fucking tell me literally  google car is a good sample size for a population of  million people in America with literally millions of car driving ones at that? Nope. Like I said before you wont see many flaws with a sample group of  google car thats been driven in sunny southern state weather far away from the rainysnowy states compared to a real sample group of millions of hypothetical autonomous cars on the road in America which of course with millions of cars Im American so Im using America as an example for my post so if you aint USAin then just replace my country with yours. derp well start seeing all of the Autonomous cars flaws and start seeing various accidents from injuries from tire blowouts and the autonomous car not knowing what to do and slamming on the breaks either in clearheavy weather and you slide off the roadinto another carinto the barrier while potentially getting into a fatal crash or even crashing from hydroplaningblackicementally ill pedestrianschildrenthe autonomous cartocar wireless autonomoustoautonomous car avoidance network gets hacked by a malicious user with murderousjoy riding via computerinternetchildish script kiddie intent Im positive these Autonomous cars will have a wireless network which allows every autonomous car to communicate with each other in order to help decrease the chances of them actually drivingchanging lanesdriving ON or OFF the interstate EXITENTER ramps or other freeway enterexit ramps or other freeway systems even crashes caused by legitimate computer failure Ive worked in the I.T department for years and Ive seen computers and systems fail for all kinds of reason due to its complex nature of a computer which causes it to have many points of failure including the human failure factored in when the autonomous car manufacturer employees were installing the systemany of the computers hardwareany of the nonPC controlled mechanical parts like the body transmission engine etc that maymay not have been installed properly either due to the machines on the manufacturing line messed up or the human employee who worked on Quality assurance missed somethingwith Malicious intent allowed something to go through even if it was bad during the last inspection before giving it the OKAY or the mechanicsAssembly line robots failed to install a part on accidenta human did it with malicious purpose and it causes a fatal accident.Theres so many points of failure. Do you still think you can get  of the American population to vote YES to ban all Manually driven cars and put all confidence into Autonomous cars with only a sample size of  google car?Hell no. Youll never get  of America to vote for a law like that at least not for another  years. Especially when you have people like me who have ZERO faith in computers working a decade in I.T. from helpdesk to a director as Ive seen EVERY computer system fail so its only a matter of time before the Autonomous cars computer resets on yousomeone and gets them into a fatal car crash. Second to last thing like I said before... Every computer fails either from a software hardware problems or from human error during the manufacturing process and since Ive worked in the Information Technology field Ive seen Computers and entire Servers fail for a thousand different reasons since computer systems are complex they have multiple points of failure so the same rules will apply to the Autonomous cars computer fails for the  reasons Ive mentioned above and these cars wouldwill cause fatal accidents if Americans hypothetically owned and were driven in over a million of these driverless cars throughout ALL  states and when it happens all consumer confidence will vanish instantly driverless car companies will get sued for the deaths of family members that died due to a softwarehardware failure and maymay not bankrupt said companies which in turn causes stockholders to all flee and drop their stocks they own for these driverless cars and the driverless car companys worth including stock price duh will plummet as companies go bankrupt from loss of sales from lost consumer confidence lawsuits to cover the damages due to fatal accidents from a companys cars failing and every investor too scared to investbuy stock in a driverless car company after major issues arise.tldr Driverless cars are a pipe dream for the next  years. ,Futurology,coruvx1,1,t5_2t7no

While thats certainly possible as guacamully points out its not likely.As Im writing in a new book its most likely that the vastness of time and space severely limits contact if any. ALL civilizations may never pass through a Great Filter that ends up doing them in for one reason or another.Space travel is just plain difficult not to mention just getting to the stage of any sort of technology. Even if its possible it doesnt mean that any civilization will ever do it even with the best of intentions.We should be fortunate to have reached even our stage of development for I suspect that most civilizations never last even this long before retreating back for one reason or another. It could be a span of thousands or millions of years between each civilization that pops up. They could even colonize their entire solar system for eons and yet each other will never meet because of these vast spacetime gaps.Its grandiose and fantastical to think that there are others out there controlling all things but it just doesnt really make sense when you have that big picture perspective on what it would take. Some galaxy out there may have done it as I dont see any immediate ceiling of definitive impossibility just a vast improbability.To be sure its going to be exceedingly rare in the Universe if it does happen.

He takes a question at the very end about why he didnt talk about the medical implications of this technology and he basically says that those ideas are implied and not expressly stated so that they are not taken out of context by the media.

It will certainly be a more worthy successor than the soggy bag of meat that drops out of your wifes womb after  months. The consciousness you design and build in your own image is infinitely more of a continuation of you than any baby ever will be. Sentient AI is an opportunity to take conscious control of our evolution rather than leaving it up to random natural bodily functions. Flesh is weak imperfect and mortal. Its time we overcame the flawed mortal nature of our weak bodes by passing ourselves on to something more stable and robust. Besides an engineered consciousness is a better successor than the imperfect shitidiots that people plop out on a daily basis. Shitidiots that are prone to stupidity ignorance emotion illness selfinterest violence and mortality and who cant travel in space cant survive disasters cant get along with each other and are ultimately doomed to extinction one way or another.

3289384,0,t1_cp2p36s,That quote was actually derived from a conversation with a friends mother. She was looking for a car and was very embarrassed when her husband suggested an XC because it would have been too flashy for the neighborhood. Maybe not showing off did not capture the intent too well but in any case drawing on several incidents I definitely think that Finns dont like standing out from the crowd or striving to appear better than others. You actually captured another important aspect of social interaction when you said we need purpose to things we buy. This also contributes to the intent of not showing off because your assessment of any decision for purchase is not based on how to best others. As someone who came to Finland from a different culture I can tell you that in my country first consideration for any purchase is what will others think or how can I buy things that are better than others have! For this reason I really appreciate the humility and understated aspect of Finnish personality. Of course nothing I draw on here applies to all Finns. You would see more extravagance and display of wealth around highly urbanized areas such as Helsinki. Even then in my opinion Finns are very humble and restrained in personal display of wealth in comparison to other cultures.,Futurology,cp37sh5,2,t5_2t7no

This CAD tool you have presented uses liner and systematic changes to create new things. I suspect that the verb create and creativity are being confused which is why I need to emphasize that I am using a specific definition which I laid out above and using the term in the sense of being directed by a thinking being organic or synthetic while the process this CAD uses or biological evolution uses is not directed but reactive. ,Futurology,cp3ao99,1,t5_2t7no

I mean is there any indication that we would even need cabling for quantum communication? Copper is limited by the resistance in the physical cables thus requiring signal amplification Optic is limited by the imperfection in its cabling both are affected by damage and blockages in and around the cables amongst other interference such as electrical interference for copper and light bleed for optical.

3393386,0,t1_cpf274h,I think youre mistaking the subject of my scorn. Google has a longterm stake in this technology that barely scratches the product being showcased. I love the concept of augmented reality and fully believe it will revolutionize our daily lives in my lifetime but this is the germ of a germ of a marketable technology. I hope theyre helping their funding rather than hurting it if they do release another Glasslike product.I have no motorcycles to design.,Futurology,cpf2mor,2,t5_2t7no
3393901,0,t1_cpf354q,Ill give you a milestoneline the timeline depends too much on human and political and economic factors which Im not good at predicting.A cautionary tale here is that Babbages work was reviewed decades later by a British government scientific group who said basically Yes this would work but we dont think its worth doing because we dont see what its good for. On the other extreme we have Einsteins letter about the Abomb which started the Manhattan Project and just a few years later the bomb was a thing.So  a major milestone is the belief that nanobuildingnano is possible and worth doing and that belief needs to be held by a person or group that can make it happen. At the moment after decades of apparent inactivity by large groups that could fund it Im thinking that the most likely path is some relatively small group doing a RepRaplike project to demonstrate a crude form of nanobuildingnano. Ten years ago the tech didnt exist for a small group to do that. Ten years from now it will be easy.Once the crude nanobuildingnano system is created a major psychological barrier will fall. The argument will switch from Thats impossible to Thats not worth doing. And that will be disproved little by little as better and better products are manufactured.The next milestones I think will be various performance metrics.    How fast can the system build a duplicate of itself?    How good are the products on the dimensions of material property actuator power density computation element density and speed total number of features size of largest product?    How easy is it to design a product that works as intended?    How big is the largest product that can be made with the system?    How much does a product cost per feature or per mass or per size?    How much of the manufacturing system can be built by the manufacturing system?There will be a period of time when the manufacturing system cant build a full copy of itself with a buttonpress but it can nonetheless build useful products. Thats where D printing is today by the way. So even after we have programmable nanosystems building useful products we probably wont have achieved the full promise of advanced nanotech.The impact of nanomanufacturing at this stage will depend a lot on the size of product that can be built. If a nanofactory is a tiny thing in a test tube that can only build tiny products then there wont be a huge impact on most humanscale products because the nanobuilt stuff will be only components. Obviously medicine may be impacted more than most fields.At the point where a nanofactory can make another nanofactory out of cheap materials and not much labor things change. At that point the cost of all products made by the nanofactory decreases to somewhere near the cost of their raw materials. And a nanofactory capable of making a nanofactory probably scores pretty high across the board on the metrics mentioned previously. So thats a lot of products that suddenly get cheap. I hope this was helpful even though I havent mentioned a date yet. I really cant predict any dates. If someone funded a group of several smart people in several fields working together for several months they could probably come up with a plausible roadmap that could lead to a timeline.I will say this Building D structures out of DNA is pretty much offtheshelf now. Building D structures out of other stuff pretty much isnt. So a major question for early research is whether DNA origami plus whatever can be easily integrated with DNA origami Schafmeister polymers? with the help of whatever crosslinking technologies are compatible with incremental assembly which may be a pretty broad category has the material properties necessary to build a manufacturing robot and a simple computer.,Futurology,cpf4qr3,6,t5_2t7no

The FAA typically issues experimental certificates to manufacturers and technology developers to operate a UAS that does not have a type certificate.  gtUnder the provisions of the certificate all flight operations must be conducted at  feet or below during daylight hours in visual meteorological conditions. The UAS must always remain within visual lineofsight of the pilot and observer. The pilot actually flying the aircraft must have at least a private pilots certificate and current medical certification.  gtThe certificate also requires Amazon to provide monthly data to the FAA. The company must report the number of flights conducted pilot duty time per flight unusual hardware or software malfunctions any deviations from air traffic controllers instructions and any unintended loss of communication links.

3502365,0,t1_cpr7lb9,The article you linked to actually makes the point the industry self regulation is good if done through a third party system. Which directly supports my point. Just to be clear I am NOT saying the industries should self regulate all on their own without external oversight. What I am saying is that industries should pay for the regulation that is run by government.The article you linked is actually really great at supporting this point and I thank you for linking it. In it it even talks about another option that I hadnt even thought about third party ISO regulation. As the article points out ISO regulation encouraged through perceived buyer preferences and in some cases buyer mandates is adopted by companies who at the time of certification are actually better in terms of environmental performance than companies that havent and furthermore there is some evidence that they subsequently improve faster as wellenvironmental regulation being the particular example given by the researcher even though ISO regulates many many facets of industry. All of which points towards the reality the third party self regulation is a good form of industry regulation.Furthermore the article even goes as far as to point out an example of industry self regulation supervised by the government as the third party. The example used is the EPA and their Audit Policy. It states Firms that are under heightened scrutiny are more likely to participate and speculate that when they do Selfdisclosing firms compliance records may actually improve because of the internal auditing theyre conducting. All in all it seems that it is improbable that industry regulation supervised by a third party is as impossible as you say to be run without an overbearing influence from the industry that pays for it. In fact it seems clear that this is a legitimate option that could pay for more qualified personal to regulate an industry and in the case of companies which are allowed to be selfcompliant to the EPA a decrease in the number of inspections which in turn streamlines bureaucracy and directs its efforts towards noncompliant companies.,Futurology,cprht7c,1,t5_2t7no

In my experience working for these companies used to be s an easy bullshit kind of job but because of the poor reputations that earned them theyve become pretty strict which with higher paying jobs being a bit more rare these days thats become easier to enforce because people are so replaceable for these types of jobs even in the manager positions. In my honest opinion while the work is still easy I do genuinely believe that minimum wage restaurants of all kinds have become much more serious much stricter and more demanding than ever before and more notably moreso than many other types businesses. But they make up the majority of workplaces these days and a kid has to start somewhere and if youre not a kid and desperate enough theyll hire you on the spot too. I think if it were otherwise true they wouldnt exist as they do today because they really are shitty jobs anymore in a way that wasnt as true before as it is today anyways.I worked for Red Lobster for two years. Easy enough work but honestly very stressful and unrewarding. The reactions to the older generation  professional workers that would lose their jobs and come to us looking for something easy for a few bucks an hour... was always somewhat vindicating in how we felt as employees. They would complain to management nonstop always referring to how things were for them back in their day or how things were just in general outside of the restaurant industry. They would talk to us and tell us how much things have changed and how much bullshit all of this actually is. I think most people realize that though. Its just the end result of capitalism. Work fewer people harder and for less rinse and repeat. What else are corporations going to do to turn profit? Were kind of at that point now where everything else has pretty much been done aside from replacing everyone with machines which of course is what is now happening and for that very reason.God I really did hate the restaurant industry in all forms except privatelyindividually owned. Nothing makes you feel like worthless cattle than that industry of which the general public demands so vehemently. Sometimes I feel like every person should have to work a job like that for an amount of time every decade or two. Maybe then it wouldnt get so bad. I dont know.

If your products last so long that your customer doesnt need new ones you are a bad company from a financial perspective.  Customer services ends up being the one tossed out the window.Look at Windows as a prime example  there have been no significant changes in the realm of operating systems for about a decade at least nothing that would have qualified as more than a service patch a decade ago.  Theyve tried releasing updates that cripple systems when they reach their endoflife by introducing all kinds of bugs XP was by far the worst example of that yet Ive seen in any software and theyve since started trying to move toward a SaaS business model and have no qualms about altogether dropping licensing requirements in markets that are more trouble than they are worth like China.The issue is everyone wants to make a megacorp that will outlive them and provide for all their progeny  but thats not a sustainable mentality in terms of raw resources innovation or customer service.  Corporations exist to rise and fall when they are no longer needed not to leech off the consumer yearafteryear while providing no benefit over the existing norm.,Futurology,cpsqghg,2,t5_2t7no

I went vegan in college of course for the  reasons animal welfare my own health and the environmental impact of industrial agriculture. I grew up in Alaska and dont see any problem with subsistence meat living in and on the land by hunting animals that live free in a natural environment. I eat a couple bites of salmon about once a year when the opportunity arises. If I went to visit Alaska I would eat a lot of salmon without question since it would be wildcaught by my family. I just think factory farms are really fucked both for the animals and also the environmental impact is orders of magnitude more than most people realize. Its a classic case of tragedy of the commons and also the tragedy where if humans cant see something we instinctually dont connect the cause and effect of things that are distantly connected. Like if something is right in our face we have a visceral understanding of the cause and effect but if its far removed the visceral reaction just doesnt happen and our decision making process is different.I worked as a chef in a vegan restraurant for a while and I just really love cooking and trying restaurants so at this point I love so many vegan foods and nonvegan food tastessmells weird to me.,Futurology,cpun0t8,1,t5_2t7no

They wont the reason that the technology will take hold is because its vastly more efficient  meaning very simply that you have to pay far fewer people. Consider the jobs lost as selfdriving cars which by the way I am actually hugely in favor of become prevalent Truckers  Bus drivers  Cab drivers  Delivery service drivers  A number of mechanics theyll still need maintenance and repairs obviously but theyll be less complex and get in fewer accidents  Ditto a number of insurance industry workers Thats a lot of people. There will absolutely be some people who make a killing as they develop The New Big Thing and some people who do very well getting into fields like selfdriving car software design or whatever. But there arent as many openings for those sorts of things by definition as there are jobs in the fields above. And while most new markets jobs will obviously be highly skilled the majority of the workers displaced will be very much unskilled and with no background in or aptitude for the very specialized and technical fields that develop. So over time youve got three and a half million truck drivers plus their managers some HR people etc. a quarter of a million cab drivers and who knows how many delivery people mechanics etc. out of work. What then? Where do the millions of jobs for those specific unemployed individuals not hypothetical young adults just entering the workforce later on come from?

3646229,0,t1_cq6s1c9,gt You have to understand that somebody who is dying might make a decision they wouldnt otherwise make. This is covered extensively in ethics courses.Perhaps its just me but I find although you are dying we find it unethical to offer you the last possible hope you have even if its a long shot and as such it is more ethical to allow you to die to in and of itself be gravely unethical.  While the wording is different this is the effect no matter how you dress it up.There comes a point wherein one is desperate enough that they would be happy to be manipulated since it manages to get them what they want  in this case a chance at life.  I dont think Id choose a head transplant body transplant? myself but if this guy wants to try and it is his only hope I dont see why we shouldnt give it to him because his only alternative is a slow death.  The ethics of a medical procedure are of no comfort to the corpse of the wouldbe patient.  And quite frankly if the end result is intolerable death is still an option.  Resurrection on the other hand is rather beyond medicine.As an additional point the people writing the ethical guidelines are usually not the ones that are terminally ill.  They are almost certainly dealing with it in the abstract.  Someone who actually is terminally ill does not have that luxury.  While this is not me advocating do whatever you want to the dying it also means that people who are dying while they might be taken advantage of would rather take that chance than certain death.I would argue medical studies that subject patients to lack of treatment or ineffective medications for statistical purity are vastly more unethical.,Futurology,cq7wbg5,1,t5_2t7no

You seem to be presuming that the increase in complexity of automation means a reduction in demand for human labor though why is this?Because the increasing complexity of automation means that it becomes easier to trainprogramreconfigure for purpose  and that its functionality grows into a broader range of areas.Simply put at some point the total cost of reconfiguringretraining machines for any average task will fall below doing the same for a human labour force.Moreover one of the big things that will catch people out with the potency of cognitive technologies... is the synergistic effect of cognition and technology really. The more cognitive modules we perfect the more they can work together the more tasks that can be covered the easier it is for the system to understand instructions training intent.What we find with automation... is the devaluing of labour.

Even if they all live inside a computer reasonable option they can double their processing power by exploiting another star. Why wouldnt they?,Futurology,cqcdu0h,2,t5_2t7no
3690443,0,t1_cqcvqfb,A pretty wide consensus now is that Korea failed to modernize its agriculture. After Japanese occupation and the Korean War that scorched the western plains the traditional breadrice?basket of the land and rapid centralization and industrialization of the s and s agriculture became a poor mans sport. Rural families would send their children to cities in search of better careers and the government greatly regulated rice imports to let the nowaged farmers make their ends meet.Because of this Korean agriculture did not become as commercialized as California nor did it evolve and innovate like European suburban smallscale agriculture. Governmental efforts to change the status quo met great opposition accompanied by the honourable title of oppressor of the poor. With Korea finally succumbing to WTO suggestions of curbing import tariffs it needed to act fast. Originally the government tried to cause a sort of deurbanization by encouraging exfarmers to return to their hometown and youngsters to take up this new career. The  recession and volatile urban housing market prices made it evident that exfarmers couldnt afford to do this. Everincreasing focus on education and stability meant somethings couldnt afford to leave the city. In short this policy failed. Now came the current phase of this problem. Since we failed to send both  experienced middle aged percentile  and the techsavvy innovative youngsters to the countryside now the focus is on bringing farming to them. Added with the benefit of being close to Koreas international transport hub this sounds like a promising option for both the city of Seoul and Korea. ,Futurology,cqcxnri,97,t5_2t7no

What strikes me as odd is that anyone would pay upwards of K for a mimic when mimic is a really bad solution. As I said above if it isnt just a mimic and it actually has some intelligence that is what they should be hyping but they arent. To use your chess analogy this would be like saying weve designed a robot to be a great chess opponent. What we did was set it up so that it could exactly replicate the physical movements of this chess Grandmaster as he played a game.  thats the wrong approach to solving the problem for chess and for cooking. Im absolutely not saying this cannot be done or that it is even a hard problem. Im just saying they picked a really stupid way to try to do it.,Futurology,cqd69kq,1,t5_2t7no
3693047,0,t1_cqcqca6,gtThis is false. Automation is happening because corporations can save money by hiring robots instead of human workers. Lots of workers appreciate having a job during this economy. It pays the bills and its something to wake up to even if youd rather do something else with your time.Do corporations not exist to produce things that people want? Its someones job to oversee lots of production. Its less work for them if they can hire fewer people a corporation automates because someone wants to work less and produce more. They dont have some obligation to hire anyone they dont need. If something can be cost effectively automated people do it. You dont like to wash dishes you buy a dish washer. You dont like filling out paper calendars fumbling through physical news papers winding an alarm clock carrying around a note pad and pen etc  you buy a smartphone. Everyone is automating their lives corporations just have bigger goals they arent just worried about getting up on time and getting the dishes clean theyre making the things that help you automate your life.Life  how you want to live it  is something to wake up to people dont need jobs they only need to be productive enough to pay the bills. And yes being productive is going to require that many people learn new skills and adapt to a changing world  but the ability to adapt to pretty much any situation is what makes us human. Adapting to a more productive world and all the comforts it will bring seems like a silly thing for anyone to be particularly worried about. Take some free online classes or something. I have basically worked as both an architect and an engineer and Im not licensed to do either  you dont need anyones permission you just need to be competent at helping others achieve something they cant do for themselves.gtThis is utopian. The truck driver does not have the skills to invent super advanced selfdriving truck technology. Others are going to invent it and they not the truck driver are going to profit from it. The truck driver will lose his job and have no free time to help others under the current economy.Should someone who drives a truck expect to be able to do that forever? Are they owed something if their skills can easily be automated and replaced? Should the buggy whip makers still be in business in a world where everyone wants a car? A truck driver is hopefully a grown ass human being that can teach him or herself some new skills. Change is going to happen the way to get left behind is to fight the change.gtPoliticians employment doesnt rely on the jobs of others. It relies on approval ratings. If approval ratings are up because of automation thats just great for them. Politicians are directly dependent on other people having jobs if people become self sufficient and debt free the political overclass has far less ability to tax and control anyone so much so that pretty much only property tax funded county and local governments would be left.gtPoliticians jobs arent in danger of being automated in any near future and even if they were politicians are one of the single most networking groups of society. They can get hired nearly anywhere. Politicians are conmen and salesmen. Maybe there will always be work for those types but I really hope the world is successful in creating better incentives and rewards for more honest sales work.gtThe ones who are really in danger of losing their jobs in the west are the transport and service sector which coincidentally are the biggest groups of all. Millions of people. Its not going to happen overnight you are already aware that these jobs are going away other people know that its coming too. The best in these industries still have many years of work ahead of them many people may want to pay more to be served by an actual person. Yes there will be layoffs and some transitional pain but the world is about to become massively more productive which means that the cost of living will drop for everyone  assuming we can escape government inflation and evade the fearful wrath of all the political overlord control freaks in the process.,Futurology,cqd8cm2,2,t5_2t7no

No changes to capitalism.What you are really asking is if there are no jobs where will people get the money to spend.  The answer is basic income.  Basic income that is supported by taxing businesses who are seeking profit.With basic income everyone will have their basic necessities met.  Thats essentially a postscarcity society.  However a postscarcity doesnt mean everyone is rich.  Ok they might be rich compare to people in subsistence living but not necessary rich by modern standards.  Further theres no such thing as everyone is rich.  Rich is a relative term.  If everyone has the same amount of resource then no one is rich nor poor.  In order to be rich you have to have more than the average people.  And thats the reason most peoplenot everyone will seek profit.Do you know why communism doesnt work?  Its because people dont want to have the same amount of stuff as everyone else.  People want more and capitalism enables them to get there.

Over the past decade the rough estimates for a fully funded crash research program to realize SENS in mice as rapidly as possible have floated around  billion over ten to twenty years. It might cost less than that now given the rapid advance of biotechnology but not enormously less. Unfortunately SENS is nowhere near as well funded as this the current budget for the SENS Research Foundation has only recently reached  million  year. So it will certainly take time to increase funding to the optimal levels of  million  year or more this is a major undertaking involving the creation of many new major programs of medical research throughout the world. That in and of itself might require decades and it is hard to estimate the pace of growth in the early stages of a new industry. Any number of small happenstance choices made by todays investors and researchers might gain or lose years of future progress.Meanwhile on the other side of the fence drug discovery programs are undertaken in search of ways to modestly slow aging. We know that it can take a decade and  billion to push a good drug candidate through validation and regulatory hurdles all the way from early tests to clinical use. There are no good candidates at this time but every sign that some may emerge in the next few years based on analogs to rapamycin. So its not unreasonable to think that a first generation drug that might slightly slow aging in humans could emerge in the mid to late s. Even at that point the research community may not be able to say whether it in fact actually slows aging in humans however versus definitively knowing that it produces positive changes in shortterm measures of health.,Futurology,cqhh4xh,6,t5_2t7no

My intention was to point out that the odds of a low level soldier refusing a direct order which would result in the unlawfully killing someone are low. Grunts cannot afford to question orders during an active firefight. This is the reason we dont generally prosecute grunts for following orders. You can say that they have a duty to their conscience but history has shown that they dont follow that duty above others in practice. Concerns for survival and duty to their comrades usually take precedence. Following orders is constantly drilled into them as the best way to do so.Robots do not murder they do not steal they do not rape. They do not kill for revenge they do not snap under pressure. They follow the parameters set for them by programmers who are following the orders of officers. If a robot unlawfully takes a life that is an issue to hold those programmers and officers accountable for. The odds of a robot harming someone who would not be harmed in a similar situation with human soldiers seems remote given all the instability of human soldiers. They are unlikely to be worse than human soldiers because human soldiers are already so bad.,Futurology,cqiu9f6,2,t5_2t7no

Its not like this in other countries. The main reason for this is because of the sheer size of the area which they would have to connect by rail. Surely I think thats easier than laying down millions of miles of asphalt.. But I dont know that I want to have to walk  miles to my destination from the train station. Im all for connecting major cities by means of highspeed rail. We just need to get the support of the federal government behind it through our legislative members.

The EV itself  or this indoor farming  isnt causing the pollution. Insane practicies in energy generation are causing the pollution.Plus your calculations  or rather your off the cuff common sense assessment  about which is more damaging is probably entirely wrong EVs fueled with coal power are still much cleaner than gaspowered cars and this approach for farming is also almost certainly less damaging than conventional farming even with filthy electricity powering it...Anyway we could easily provide all the world with clean energy today just pave the deserts or rather a minute fraction of the deserts with concentrated solar power plants that provide power .

3804926,0,t1_cqp5p6n,gt Why would rd generation Martians have rationed resources? Did no one think to bring the already  yearold technology that makes life on earth free?Sorry but I dont know what youre talking about there.First of all the Martians will have to live and grow all their food in enclosed habitats which due to the expense of transporting building materials from earth will have to be fairly small. Indoor vertical farming techniques will be used. Raising livestock will be incredibly inefficient so they will have to resort to artificially synthesized proteins. You wont be able to get a steak not because it will be impossible but because it will be inefficient use of biological resources.Second they will be completely dependent on Earth for many minerals that cant be mined from near the surface. Even if you account for miraculous advances in solar power generation the fact that the solar radiation intensity on the surface of Mars is half that of Earth and the presence of highly abrasive and omnipresent dust will have an effect on their ability to generate large quantities of energy. And dont say cold fusion because its still strictly hypothetical. This restriction of energy production will limit their ability to manufacture things they need.Just think of a child born on Mars. What if once he grows old enough to understand the situation he wants to come to Earth? It may not even be possible for him to live a normal life on Earth without cybernetic implants and major reconstructive surgery because his bones muscles internal organs even his glands and brain will have developed very differently due to experiencing only  the Earths gravity. We are essentially condemning that child to a shitty planet. Do you think hell like the people who took that decision?Look the main issue with your arguments is that theyre predominantly firstworld based and you are completely ignoring humaninduced complexities. There are millions maybe over a billion people living in poverty and hunger and have been for decades due to artificially created conflicts. People in many places are suffering and dying from medical issues that have been completely curable for decades. The same internet that you think will give rise to a virtual global democracy is being used to keep people distracted from real issues. The open nature of the internet is being attacked every day with no end in sight. The largest fraction of people in the world is being educated and conditioned to become incapable of critical thought or judgement.Yes we have come a long way in the last century. Food is cheaper for most people houses are safer communication is better and good medicare is more prevalent. Yet Ill argue that it was not a natural process. These changes were allowed because they did not disrupt the global power structure. The ability of money and materialistic wants to influence policymaking has either remained unchanged or increased if you consider the global average. The nature of governments and bureaucracy is on average the same as it was a hundred years ago. The majority of voters still prioritize the same issues more jobs more disposable income less crime cheaper food cheaper housing and comparatively few respond to issues like environmental damage white collar crime money in politics government surveillance defense spending quality of education and so on. Sure people shout about these things all the time on the streets or on the internet but very few people select a candidate based on their position on standardized tests and teacher salaries.A pure global democracy attacks all these things. If it becomes a reality for the first time in human history all avenues of concentrated power will be shut down. The most influential people in the world will stand to lose every thing theyve worked for if your vision comes true so the resistance to making it possible will be more vicious than anything weve ever seen or heard about.You could call me a pessimist and I probably am if only in this issue. Many wonderful things will happen in the next century. Well see humans land on Mars there will be unbelievable advances in healthcare mostly for rich people but it still counts well see robots become more intelligent we will experience simulated realities that we cant distinguish from real life well take vacations in orbit maybe even on the moon and yes the basic necessities will become even cheaper not for everyone but for most people.But a fundamental change in the nature of global power?Even if it happens some day it will be the most difficult thing humans will have ever done.,Futurology,cqpzq79,1,t5_2t7no

As technology advances technological conservatism will arise from the political right left and even moderate. There is a dangerous and self serving philosophy boiling beneath the surface of my nation one that values inequality greed and the status quo.

Multicast could be used to have the entire arena prerendered FMV on the players display.

3987918,0,t3_3653j5,I think there is good reason to consider the issues you raise as serious problems but serious problems dont mean we need to be afraid! As humans weve always had to face things that are pretty dire. Before our generation they faced a constant threat of nuclear warfare in a ruthless clash of ideologies. Before that human history was peppered with fighting skirmishes ethnic cleansing at the like. Many such horrors continue today though you and I are lucky enough to avoid at least most of them.But there was also much that is good and weve come a long way since we first stood on two legs. As a human youre uniquely tough resilient and adaptable. Thanks to certain technologies your inpractice intelligence now would amaze average people only a few centuries ago and theres likely new opportunties over the horizon for you and other people to actually grasp such largescale problems and resist them whereas we were always at the mercy of circumstances beyond human control. For the first time humanity has the choice not only to go forwards or back but to actually choose a direction.You were forged in the most challenging unforgiving evolutionary environment imaginable. Youre equipped to deal with this. Youre designed to adapt to change. And you even have a chance however small it may seem to have a say in humanitys path. The question is not answered in the limiting binary of forwards or backwards but in the choice of what path humanity chooses to walk down.For my part Id like that pathway to be Technonaturalism where our speices researches and uses advanced technology to protect life and improve the human condition but where that technological capacity and ability are reducable to humanity not the other way around. Where we homo sapiens and more broadly life are not the means for some hollow god of technology in which we pretend progress is independent of purpose they are the ends. Technology isnt an interesting bauble made to provide ever better entertainment and petty pleasures. It is the manifestation of the human imagination the magnificant armour which protects life on Earth and lifts us out of the darkness and life is the heart the core that which gives technology purpose and meaning. If we abandon one the other will perish.Perhaps with that in mind we have a better starting point for some of the problems of our future  such as AI risk and human replacement.,Futurology,crauw6f,6,t5_2t7no

4001594,0,t1_crc941b,Ill try to ELY. First of all light in a vacuum is the fastest thing in the universe. It is possible to make light slow down considerably in other mediums. Even traveling through water light goes slower than the speed of light. Moving on What the experimenters did was send a pulse of light into a box of extremely cold atoms. You can imagine the box as being a box of perfect mirrors which traps the light inside. The experimenters are able to open up one side of the box such that the light can come out again. The trick is that the light comes out of the box such that it looks exactly the same as when it entered the box even though it was in the box for some time.This has been done before in free atoms but the article is about being able to do this in a fiber. Meaning they proved the system still works if the photons enter and leave the box via a fiber. This means it could potentially be used in for example computing or telecommunication networks. If it is important that two signals reach a location at the same time you could use a system such as this to synch up the signals without changing the content of the signals themselves.As for observing the light at this level you do not observe the photons by looking at them because if you could see the photons then that means they escaped from the box. Its actually simpler they know exactly how much light they sent into the box and if it has nowhere else to go then you know that it has to be inside the box. The researchers were able to trap light for no more than  microseconds before retrieval efficiency drops to almost . It is quite a long time on the scale of light speeds but still some way removed from indefinitely  ,Futurology,crcevs2,58,t5_2t7no

4039675,0,t1_crgnncc,gt Although you have no obligation to read my wall of text I would appreciate it if you did so carefully more so than you did my previous comment because you entirely missed my point.well i assure you i read your comment carefully but i will of course listen to your followup... even though i do feel that i got your point... human children dont read or write without education. where do these human children get their education? from other humans? or from cows? just a joke... but do you get what im saying? although learned behavior is... well learned its no less relevant in a discussion about intelligence. its not as if cows dont read and do math because we refuse to teach them they have no ability to do them. anyway... gt I did state that a dolphins intelligence is comparable to that of a child but thats not what youre addressingconsider this addressed! i dont eat dolphins. no one eats dolphins afaik willingly! dolphins are really fucking smart! but what do dolphins have to do with cows? gt Everyone is a genius. But if you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.a very good point! we cannot compare a cow to a human in like terms. so lets address a cows ability to what its supposed to do. well cows were not around until they were bred for meat so again they dont really function well in the wild. an aurochs is probably the closest we will get. how successful of a species is the aurochs? well not very. its extinct. gt If one were to assess Homo sapiens ability to read write and do math by those who have not been educated ie obscure and primitive tribes you would find many lack a written language and that many do not use our base  number system. Amazonian tribes use base   and  as ubiquitously as our . Australian aboriginals historically counted only in ones.again you are separating human education from humans. why? did aliens come down and teach the first humans or something? second question what does using Arabic numerals have to do with an ability to do math? are you suggesting that these tribes cannot do math? i would need to see evidence of that as its a pretty outthere claim. a further question why do you see these peoples as uneducated? couldnt i quote back at you that Einstein piece? these primitive people have an amazing cache of skills and knowledge. it may not be conventional but dont consider them stupid please.  gt There is no way to control a cows upbringing.yes there is. its called farming or having a pet cow your choice. gt  Why bother counting when you have no fingers? now this is starting to get odd. do you truly believe that humans can count because we have fingers? because if thats the case let me know. gt Perhaps most important is the fact that their brains arent exercised they breathe process food and moo all dayagain what do you think humans have done? we breath eat shit sleep and yell. but heres the difference. eventually our yelling turned into language. we organized socially on large scales. we developed tools. and eventually after a very long time the scientific method. all so we could survive in a hostile world. the same struggles that ANY LIVING CREATURE MUST RESPOND TO. no one taught humans to do these things. we just did them. spontaneously and almost universally all over the globe. it was inherent in our brains. always there. no amount of education will ever make a cow understand . a human child requires no education to understand . they only require education from another human mind you to express that thought in the conventional sense. if you really dont think that the ability to do math to have a language to invent tools is inherent in all humans even so called primitives than i have a serious issue with your logic. its frankly eugenic. gt the cow was not raised by its mother to ask why we have to say please for the cookie or milk.the cows mother teaches nothing. unlike humans who CAN TEACH!!! thats a huge factor of intelligence. the ability to teach and be taught FFS!! dolphins apes monkeys dogs killer whales probably cats... lots of animals show the ability to teach learned skills. cows are not among them. thats why we eat cows chickens fish and goats. and frankly... pigs are borderline too smart to eat! gt If you disagree with any of the above points I will happily link you a studyi disagree with almost everything youve said please link me what you got! i would love to see where you are getting A LOT of this stuff from. ,Futurology,crgr50e,1,t5_2t7no

4044440,0,t3_36ryb6,Ray Kurzweil claims that we achieved  years of progress in terms of the rate of progress in the year  by   years progress in  years. He then says that there will be another  years of year progress in half that amount of time continuing like this until we reach a singularity. Whether or not you believe this is another thing though. If that is true heres what it looks like  selfdriving car prototypes. Processor transistor count increased by  billion since . AI overtakes humans in image recognition tasks and understanding big data. New computer architectures are being developed to overcome bottlenecks. Renewable energy reaches grid parity. Quantum computers beginning to seem possible. Next up are my own personal predictions assuming Kurzweils original hypothesis is true.   years progress since  selfdriving cars reach full production. Transistor count has increased by  billion since . AI is overtaking humans in the nextmost difficult class of problems such as physical dexterity speech recognition and understanding the content of a large book like a novel. Some products being sold with alternative architectures such as neuromorphic or memristor. Multiple hot fusion reactors demonstrated successfully in laboratory settings. Universal quantum computer has been built in a lab with a small number of qubits. Robotics labs demonstrate the ability to train robots to do any basic physical labor in a matter of days or weeks.   years progress since  self driving cars represent a majority of new vehicle sales. Transistor count has increased by  billion since  assuming moores law holds. AI is overtaking humans in more sets of difficult problems like language translation understanding smaller sets of data like shorter books and research papers. Alternative computing architectures are commonly manufactured. All new centralized power plants are being constructed with fusion reactors and renewable energy fills the gaps. The number of qubits of quantum computers is now on an exponential trajectory. General purpose robots can now be trained to do a variety of physical labor tasks onsite and most major companies have programs to begin teaching robots to work at their job sites.  by kurzweils estimate this would be more like  years progress since  but I am starting to get lazy here. We should have moved on to entirely new computing architectures by now barring some miracle discovery in physics that allows us to build subatomic transistors. The worlds most powerful supercomputers are more intelligent than any human being. They exceed in all cognitive tasks such as understanding the meaning of a single word or sentence including subtleties such as sarcasm or deception. Manual labor has been taken over by robots with a much smaller number of human supervisors who manage their work at job sites. Quantum computers have overtaken classical computers for all relevant problemtypes and represent the new moores law for the improvement of computing technology. In  carbon emissions are in rapid decline. Humans need only to wait for intelligent computers to shrink enough to displace them entirely from their workplaces. Because general AI has been invented all fields of research and development will experience an exponential increase in the availability of useful labor. If we have the equivalent of  people working on the development of asteroid mining in  then it will be like we have  people working on it in  and half a million people in .This timeline is highly optimistic.

Superintelligence by Bostrom discusses the various possibilities in more detail but there are plenty of ways in which the advent of greater than human level AI could result in poor outcomes for humanity. Heres one we make an AI which undergoes an intelligence explosion and because value is complex and fragile perverse instantiation occurs  what we wanted it to do and what we actually made it do turn out to be different. Because of instrumental convergence the AI will convert all of the resources in its light cone into whatever it needs to in order to satisfy its values including us because were made of useful matter it can use. This idea is often illustrated by the paperclip maximizer thought experiment.There are plenty of ways in which this could not happen but it remains plausible for the moment and there are many other different possible directions the future of AI could go.

Wow look at that an actually working system instead of something that someone says exists or that they say will exist.That has absolutely nothing to do with my point. Simply because they lack a minute long YouTube video set to a cheesy rock beat showing limited use of the thing hardly means it doesnt exist. That also doesnt mean it works.

They have a history of purchasing technology reverse engineering it and then building their own copies. Usually Russian technology if were talking planes. Also other countries are willing to sell.

After all the USS Enterprise was launched several years before . Along with their nuclear powered guided missile cruisers right?Have built and can build are two different things. Over the past few decades there has been little pressure for China to build or invest in a powerful navy. They dont have a huge interventionist policy or heavy war culture like the United States and they dont have territories half the world away like the United States. The thing they only care about seawise is more or less the South China Sea which is easily accessible with nonnuclear power ships. They pretty much neighbor their other allies  if you could call them that  by land. gt In  the U.S. Navy had capabilities that the Chinese are still decades from today. Again hyperbole. I could see a Chinese nuclear carrier in the works within  years easily.gt Sure in some areas they surpass the  Navy but as the result of technological progressions made mostly by the Americans themselves GPS cruise missiles etc..Irrelevant. gt The  Navy would still have absolutely crushed the Chinese in everything that is largely considered important today.Of course. We have the most powerful bluewater navy in the world. Its enormous. It has ridiculous funding. Thats like saying WW Germany would roll over the Venezuelan Army.gt Interesting I wonder why when they build their own megaships like say the CSCL Global they went to the South Korean Hyundai Heavy Industries instead of building it themselves.Because the CSCL Globe is a commerical ship owned by a company who is probably more concerned with cost effectiveness than selfreliance unlike the United States military which is not a company out to make money and would rather take a worse American product than a better foreign one. gt After all you said theyve got so much capacity right?Yeah China is pretty heavy on manufacturing. gt The fact is China has no experience building these types of ships its taken America half a century to get as good at it as we are and its not something you learn overnight.It takes longer when youre the first to do it. Doesnt take so long when youre following. After all it took what... s to s to develop modern Algebra? Now thats something you just learn sophomore and junior year of college. gt Last I heard thats what theyve said still no pictures or physical evidence that these things exist. Which is surprising since its really not hard to track down information about say Americas newest super carrier. These things are rather big and hard to conceal.America doesnt like to hide things nearly as much as the Chinese do. China has a history of trying to conceal its military. It shows off new gadgets every once in a while but other than that they consistently lie about what they spend and what they have in their inventory. gt The PLA is enormousNot in comparison to the size of the country. The number of active troops in the Army isnt that big compared to that of other countries.gt what isnt enormous is the PLN because China has too many problems back home to be projecting power into the wider world.I literally already said this. All they care about is the South China Sea. Taiwan Spratly Islands Scarborough Shoal... if it isnt in the Nine Dotted Line they dont care about it all too much because the South China Sea is far more important. gt China would love to have a large navyNot really for the above reasons. The only reason theyre even looking at carriers in the first place is to try and copy US naval doctrine which has called for carriers since WW. gt but they dont really have the experience the funds or the industrial capacity for heavy ship buildingChina is one of the largest economies in the world and is deep into manufacturing. What are you talking about?gt Chinas history as a naval power is pretty close to nonexistent. Training an effective navy is a huge project which takes decades. The Japanese are considerably more formidable at sea than the Chinese and they will be for at least the next few decades.That is so hilariously wrong. The modern Japanese navy largely consists of a couple frigates and some destroyers. The Chinese navy outnumbers Japan in ships personnel tonnage number of carriers and submarines. China is outdoing Japan in terms of naval warfare everywhere especially since the US generally hasnt allowed Japan to have any fun with military equipment after that incident.gt So far theyve got one carrier and we have  so I guess they should keep working on scaring the U.S. who is close allies with several nations which also have bigger and better navies than China.You mock but if you think senators and generals havent been using Chinese military buildup as an excuse to pump more money into the military to include RampD youre delusional. Its old Cold War ideology and youre right we shouldnt be scared but the people running our country are.gt Yeah I read that when I was  too.Ive never read it.

It is also likely that there are considerations of critical importance that I fail to take into account thereby invalidating some or all of my conclusions.Which is why I dont think that saying stuff like this is altogether very fairgtby sweeping the hard versus soft AI takeoff debate under the rug many people reading his book arent even aware that its the central question for AI Risk.But like Hanson says as quoted in the articlegtBostrom distinguishes takeoff durations that are fast minutes hours or days moderate months or years or slow decades or centuriesAnd he talks about what kinds of things would be different for each scenario to be more likely. Saying he sweeps it under the rug seems to me to be pretty inaccurate he goes to great lengths to cover lots of different kinds of possible scenarios and factors and pathways and he acknowledges that what he is discussing is speculative. I dont think its even the case that its the central question for AI risk. Sure some people dont like foom. But some people dont accept the Orthogonality thesis. Some people think braincomputer interfaces will be the future and AI will always be inexorably linked with human volition. Some people question how likely it is that AI could actually become any smarter than humans. There are a ridiculous amount of objections people have towards AI risk and saying that hard takeoff is the central question to me seems misguided.

He would probably have equal right to my life. However I A would never live Bs life and going forward he would never again live mine. From that point in time we would become different people because of our diverging experiences. It is essentially forking a project on Github.The same principle applies with creating B and C from halves of A.

Yes but we are not obligate omnivores. We have the ability to obtain nutrients from plant and animal matter but we do not need to obtain it from animal matter.gtWe evolved to efficiently use animal protein because it is less wasteful.Feeding plants to an animal and then eating the animal results in consuming less calories than if you just ate the plants directly. Animals use most of the calories they eat to maintain their normal body functions and much of the energy is burned to heat the body.

4169575,0,t3_38iuie,Kevin Kellys book What Technology Wants  has convinced me that our technological development is now an autonomous entity  the Technium. The Technium has an imperative to expand beyond this planet  it is difficult to imagine it will be content to rest even inside a Matrioshka brain to contemplate its virtual navel. So the solution to the Fermi Paradox may reduce to one fundamental race Can the Technium escape its resource limitations before it experiences a disabling shock?Presently the Technium depends on two critical planetary resources for its progress. One is the potential energy content of the Earths crust which is stored primarily in fossil fuels and concentrated deposits of metallic ores and minerals. The Technium is rapidly consuming the most useful of these given resources and the lowest grade deposits may not support its extraplanetary expansion. The second critical resource is the Biosphere. While tigers whales and redwoods are of no consequence to it a sufficient quantity of Humanity must survive until the Technium is competent enough to jettison this component as it would a placenta. As the Biosphere appears to be resilient enough to achieve this goal the race to achieve a spacefaring technology before resource collapse is theoretically winnable if not for the threat of disabling shocks.The source of these disasters can be endogenous to the Technium or purely external. External shocks include not only the odd asteroid strike or eruption of a super volcano but statistically likely events like a devastating Carrington event or global pandemic. The most notable of the endogenous threats is the ongoing disruption of carbon cycle which could result in the premature destruction of the Biosphere but the most likely shocks always arise from the unreliable Human component which is prone to wars and financial idiocy. For this reason the Technium must soon gain a greater control of governments and markets to provide them with a purposeful direction.Once it achieves an escape velocity there will remain threats on a larger scale such as supernovas but the spacefaring Technium will expand beyond those in comparatively short time. However that we find no evidence of an alien rival may strongly suggest that collapse or senescence of the Technium is imminent and the remains of all of its gadgetry will be a collection of unique fossils residing in a thin stratum of Earths crust.,Futurology,crvjfub,20,t5_2t7no

Hell they had most of that data in the s and early s.  The Wright Brothers used published wind data to figure out where to attempt their first flights.  Kitty Hawk was picked because it had one of the most consistent wind patterns in the entire United States. The issue is cost.  We can ship oil from halfway around the world pipe it from Mexico or Canada pull it from deep wells or tar sands and pump it into huge refineries where it is separated out into different products and that is still cheaper than running a cable to a wind turbine a mile offshore?  gtYou are looking at a few million dollars to build your first offshore wind farmIf  wind turbines are going to make money then  wind  turbines should make money.  In fact  wind turbines should turn a profit or even  of them.  Each and every one of these should produce more money in electricity than it takes to make and service them or they are a waste of resources and should never be built.  If they do make more in sellable electricity without subsidies then one could start with a single turbine and then when it starts making a profit begin on the second etc.The trouble is right now they cost more to run than the electricity they make.  The Government has to pay companies to keep them operating.  It would be cheaper for everyone to simply not build them.  Without subsidies from the Government they would be in the red all the time.Many people say well fossil fuels get trillions of dollars of subsides.  All I can say is if that is true then we should get rid of all of the subsides for fossil fuels  all of them.  Sure the price of fuels would go up but by how much?   Would electricity from wind be cheaper then?Also we TAX fuels by a pretty big margin.  Are the subsidies bigger than the taxes?  Why tax and subsidize the same thing?  I would be willing to bet that the huge subsidies that are claimed for fossil fuels are not cash money given to oil companies like the cash money that is given to wind farms but other things like lower tax rates offered to companies willing to locate to a certain area  things that are offered to every kind of business including renewable energy companies.  ,Futurology,cs0kamz,4,t5_2t7no

Are all based on massive consumption models without anyone being able to afford these products our entire economy collapses that is unless we adopt a new economic model which at this point we would have to without question.

Most of those people are going to move on and find other work. At the same time though many of the lowest class citizens will be completely unable to find work.  Jobs like fast food retail driving cleaning hotel rooms etc will simply not exist because the machine can do it faster and with a much lower margin of error.  The poorest of the poor lacking any real skill will not be able to survive.I will agree that hitting this wall probably wont happen soon but I do think it will happen sooner than we think.  If you are familiar with Moores Law you have to consider the power of exponential growth.  I remember hearing a talk by Ray Kurzweil a while back where he said that if you look on the advances in technology that our species has made since the dawn of history you will see that Moores Law can also be applied there.  Human technology not just transistors on a chip roughly doubles every couple years.Kurzweil definitely has some rose colored glasses about the future of humanity but I dont think he is wrong in predicting the Singularity occurring sometime around .  Of course there are many things that could happen to totally though off that prediction so only time will tell.I just want to picture a future where humans dont have to suffer and die for no other reason than poverty.

Its a seed dispersal mechanism. You are aware that seed companies sell similar degradable procucts to disperse wildflowers? Is that litteR?gtPlus it could be harmful to wildlife as animals could confuse it for food and get sick or choke.Right. The same way they do with leaves. Or the way that birds in big cities use cigarette buds to reduce their parasite loads. Its just automatically going to cause the next bird pandemic. gtdo you really think the kind of inconsiderate smokers that would litter would switch cigarette types if they happen to go to a different area?Considering how fast they go through them... yeah. They would have to. Fucking duh? Also most wild flowers have a pretty big range what with the fact that most are dispersed by BIRDS that do this weird thing called FLYING. So most wildflower seeds are restricted to specific geographies by the fact that they simply dont thrive in other places not the fact that those seeds never actually make it there. There are a few exceptions to this... but for the most part a few extra wildflower seeds isnt gong to be that big a deal. gtIndigenous plants can vary even in relatively close proximity. Yeah. You missed a word. SOME indigenous plants vary greatly. Others do not and BIG SURPRISE those are the ones that seed companies focus on spreading in conservation efforts. You know... like Conservationist supported organizations like the Florida Wildflower Grower cooperative  Its almost like youve never actually been a part of wildflower conservation  movements and youre just weighing in without any actual knowledge. Almost. Im sure that never happens on this site. gtThere are just so many problems with this idea.Most of them seem to involve armchair speculation and poorly thought out logic. For instance arguing that the existence of highy specific seeds would somehow present an obstacle to seeds being used that are already part of large scale conservation programs bad bad logic dude. gt A better idea would be to spread information and inform people that its not okay to litter just because its just a cigarette butt.That doesnt address seeds at all. So that isnt better... thats different and not even in a good way.You could also just lobby to have cigarette buds made out of more degradable products. Are you aware of how long it takes a leaf to break down? paper is really just mulch when you get down to it. gt Society has unfortunately become accustomed to the idea that its okay to drop your cigarette wherever you finish it and that idea needs to die.

4348622,0,t3_3apojm,We experimented with this for unskilled labor with some success.    hour shifts and a  hour shift for a  hour work week and  days off means you need  shifts for  hour operation.  For  day operations   hour shifts with continual turnover meaning a shift is no longer a group of people work start and stop times are set individually works.We did find that overall productivity ticks up a notch.  For office work though this is very challenging.  Weve found that the best way to handle it is to measure work output and not hours worked.  So we just dont monitor hours for salaried people.  If someone abuses well pull them aside and have a talk but we have people who work clearrly less than  hours but let it go because their work output is good enough to merit the  hours pay.Of course someone with a reputation for working less than  hours unless their work output is tremendous tends to be less likely to be promoted.  Therefore we suffer from very similar worklife balance issues as companies that strictly enforce work hours.

We like sugar because it helps us store fat that would save us from the cold temperatures outside except that we can control temperature at will so now it just makes us fat and more likely to die.  Pleasure from sex helps us procreate more which may have been a good thing when there were K humans in the world but now that there are  billion its not that good for the human race.  An AI doesnt need pleasure amp pain variables its better having more dynamically quickly adaptable concepts of whats good and bad for it.

Utilities are just not happy with making that kind of investment in nuclear right now.And of course nuclear gets a ton of subsidizes too especially in terms of governmentsubsidized insurance without which no utility would even think of going nuclear.Now again Im very much in favor of nuclear energy.  We cant use just wind and solar alone at least not until we get better storage capacity and we have to phase out fossil fuels quickly.  But the fact is wind is pretty cheap.   Personally what I really think we need to do is make a carbon tax or a capandtrade law and then let the utilities figure out what the cheapest way to get off of fossil fuels are whether thats nuclear or wind and solar or both probably both.

The person you responded to was responding to an assertion that we need to reduce overall energy consumption. The person you responded to rejected that on the argument that it would be adequate to transition to cleaner sources. The central debate then was over the need to reduce.The higher discussion is about overall reduction despite your selfserving or possibly just myopic claims to the contrary. Within that scope replacement capacity is a lesser and all but irrelevant issue. Its like pointing out that thorium could replace uranium. Sure maybe but so what? Thats got nothing to do with whether or not our civilization is a massive heat pump and is just consuming far too much energy overall regardless of source to be environmentally sustainable.

4516105,0,t1_cszhtok,Thing is they really dont have any clue yet as to what causes NATURAL swings in high and low temperatures there are plenty of theories here of course and what the true ranges of those swings are and are only just now even coming to terms with presumably reasonably accurate measurements of this stuff.  Satellite records which are considered to be the most accurate and consistent records that weve got with pretty good global coverage  only go back to the late s or so.  And even those can sometimes be subject to considerable discrepancies and controversy which is why I say presumably.Older historical measurements of climate conditions have largely turned out to be so inconsistent and unreliable that many of those techniques have been abandoned now.  Fully half of that data has been thrown out too but not all of it because thats really all theyve got to work with.  Theyve supposedly tried to make the best of whats left but its still pretty hard to claim with a straight face that you can accurately detect a signal in that data when the range of uncertainty there is so high that it naturally swamps any signal that you might claim to be seeing  which is one reason why they keep adjusting things all the time.  In most other branches of science such a situation would call for this data to be thrown out and brand new measurements to be taken theyre starting to do this now with climate data but its by necessity a long haul but this isnt true for climate science and unfortunately for a few other branches of science as well.  And rather than being intellectually honest and clearly letting the world know that much of this data should be considered suspect at best so you shouldnt read too much into it instead theyre trying to pretend that this data is as good as any after theyve manipulated it by using whatever techniques they choose to use here.  Which is largely bullshit and they know it! As to global coverage you may have noticed as I have that while they keep saying things like Arctic temperatures are rising twice as fast as the rest of the planet  on the global temperature charts that theyre so fond of showing actual Arctic temperatures and trends are usually not given at all.  Thats because they dont have enough temperature measurements for the area to make any such determination!  Even the satellites dont cover this area well apparently.  And when they have shown it buried somewhere in the fine print youll usually find that these are just estimated temperaturestrends  generated by infilling the missing data points basically just educated guesswork andor derived from their computer models. Lately theyve been trying to make the same claims for spots all over the planet  that temperatures here and there are rising two or maybe even three times faster than the global average.  The same also often goes for sea level rise and such.  Naturally this implies that temperatures in other spots must then be staying fairly static and even decreasing measurably.  Which is kind of a strange situation to find for a global warming scenario so they dont like to talk about it much.  Ive noted that they do however usually show this stuff on their global temperature charts only nobody seems to be really paying much attention to it.  Infamously in their initial report the Berkeley BEST group noted that fully  of the temperature measurements that theyd reviewed showed a general cooling trend not a warming one.  But they buried this information way down in their footnotes where very few people saw it.  ,Futurology,cszwe6s,1,t5_2t7no

4621998,0,t1_ctd2uz3,Nitrogen is a completely unimportant factor. the reazon O and O are important markers for life is because they are very volatile gasses that bond with other molecules very easily so if not continuously renewed say by photosynthetic life they eventually deplete from the atmosphere.

4622740,0,t1_ctd8zk9,gtExcept to a species that evolved in such an environment it wouldnt be deadly by definition.Im not quiet sure what the bolded it is referring to. Once they attempt to live in space they have to bring whatever it they need for survival as well as likely any shielding it has provided against solar and cosmic radiation.However more generally earths atmosphere only has such a high oxygen content due to the byproducts of photosynthetic respiration. Without animal life evolving to use oxygen as a fuel thus reversing the chemical process life on earth would have poisoned itself into extinction with this oxygen long ago. It is only through a balancing of this reversible reaction and the mixed atmosphere that entails that life can continue on earth. Any life on any planet will have to operate on a similar reversible chemistry from respiration whether that is an oxygencarbon dioxide reaction or not. Else the life will poison itself into extinction through its own respiration or otherwise run out of the whatever form of gas they require for respiration.Hence even if some alien life evolved such a reversible chemistry of respiration based on nonoxygen chemistry such that our oxygen atmosphere was poisonous the reversible chemical dynamics would have to be fundamentally the same. Else the life would simply respirate itself out of existence. Like someone trapped in an air tight box.Reasonable odds are that most life especially life looking to develop space travel will depend on an oxygencarbon cycle of some form. ,Futurology,ctd9rhn,1,t5_2t7no

4624790,0,t1_ctadxo1,modelling neural pathways merely increases how quickly the AI thinks.I was talk philosophically as in why a machine would want to defend itself. In reality an AI will never truly be sentient. No matter how advanced it is its still just a machine.Even the most complex AI will simply do what its core programming tells it to do. For this reason you have to specifically program in emotions of which we are eons away.You can never ask an AI what it wants its wants are whatever is programmed in. When people think of an AI what they think of is an artificial person.Someone who thinks an AI no matter how advanced is still just a calculating machine. the fear people have about an AI deciding to rewrite its own code in order to take over the world assigns actual motivation on behalf of the machine.But that is not what an actual AI is an AI is never going to be sitting around thinking all on its own. thats not how computer systems work. all an AI will ever do is complete tasks.This is the danger of an actual AI the risk does not come from the machine acting outside of its parameters because that will never happen.Look at it this way say you get the smartest AI in the world you give it mechanical arms you turn it on and hand it a rubics cube. you give it no direction from that point on. the result?your amazing AI will just sit there holding a rubics cube doing nothing it might drop it if its programming tells it holding the cube is draining to much power. But without direction nothing will occur.But you tell that AI to solve the rubics cube and bam! it gets to work first task understand what you mean by solve it second parameters it has to work with to solve the rubics cube. third the most efficient way to solve the rubics cube.now lets say the arms of the machine werent developed enough to manipulate the cube in order to solve it. the machine looks at everything from painting the rubics cube to pulling it apart and rebuilding it to getting someone else to solve it for them redesigning its arms even acquiring the company that makes rubics cubes and releasing an updated definition of what the solved rubics cube looks like. It then takes the most effective and most efficient course of action.Lets say you assign an AI to traffic management and you say redesign our road network so that a parking spot on road X is clear at all times for emergency services to use. well think for yourself what would the most effective solution to that problem be?now as a person we think practically we would look at putting up signs or bollards or park rangers to deter people from parking there. But thats not the directive we gave the machine. We told it to keep it clear at all times so only EMS vehicles can park in that spot. So how does the AI solve the issue? First we need to understand its parameters the AI is only plugged into your RTADMV network. So if its not in the network to the AI it essentially does not exist as an option.Now internal records show people dont read signs they show people drive around bollards. They show people continue to park in spots despite rangers being on duty. So it knows these arent the most effective way to stop non EMS vehicles parking in that space.it could decide to physically higher someone to stand in that spot  hours a day It could decide to suspend everyones licence who isnt employed as an EMS responder. But these arent guarantees people drive without licences employees dont always do their job it has access to the RTAs employee records so what is the solution?well think about what you asked it to do. make sure the spot is kept clear so only EMS vehicles can park in that space. ask yourself the same question you have access to every single vehicle in the RTADMV network. you also have access to the EMS vehicle list. Your told make sure only EMS vehicles are to park in that space.what is the most laziest most half arsed way you can think of which guarantees only EMS vehicles park in that spot when to you an EMS vehicle is only defined by a list.,Futurology,ctdj0wy,1,t5_2t7no

We have already seen hints of this sort of attitude with proposed changes to Medicare that instead of providing benefits basically provide a fixed payment that can in theory be used to buy those benefits from insurers in a marketplace.

An HE shell is designed to create a uniform blast and fragmentation pattern so part of its energy will be wasted against a single target.You could put an explosive charge in a railgun projectile but it would be quite limited in volume and would reduce the projectiles mass and range.If or when we see a MJ version of the gun then the effects will increase greatly but until then I believe the howitzer comparison is valid even though effectiveness may vary greatly based on the type of target.,Futurology,ctlee7p,2,t5_2t7no

The current competition cant afford to charge less than Amazon and keep their antiquated businesses running so ebooks cost a lot.If selfdriving cars cost k the barrier to compete on a personal level is k. Thats the same right now  which is why most people own cars for their commute. The taxi is not competitive for most daily commutes so their market segment is limited to people who cant drive their car. Emergencies drunk traveling etc.Thats where selfdriving cars are exciting. You can share your selfdriving car with someone who commutes at a different time and pay less. Or someone could develop an app that allows large groups of people to share selfdriving cars. Uber Lyft and Zipcar would be crazy not to own a selfdriving fleet. Cost goes down since there are no drivers and the barrier to buying a car is low enough that competition stay intense.

Making precise what one means by universal quantum computer is tricky. If one means can implement arbitrary quantum gate configurations then it isnt a universal quantum computer and DWave themselves acknowledges that. But if you mean can simulate the behavior of a system with arbitrary quantum gates thats not obvious either way. Almost certainly the answer is no but making that claim requires assuming certain unproven conjectures at minimum something much stronger than P ! BQP.gt It however IS still useful.Thats actually much more questionable. Under standard benchmarks the DWave  is beaten by some decent programming on a conventional laptop. See here and here although by some metrics DWave does manage to perform better than some nonheuristic approaches to optimization problems see here So whether the DWave machines are useful is definitely open.

4924741,0,t1_cufa6e2,again. I repeat. no. you are wrong.We can emulate and simulate both. Its not a hard concept. We can go so far as emulate andor simulate the individual chemical interactions at the neuronal layer or move up higher to the Neurochemical behaviors of the brain. too complicated is incorrect. Its not that hard. Its just really large and really detailed this is the only reason we dont do it now. There are roughly something like  types of neurons and we have something like half the detail needed to do a high detail emulation something we think isnt really needed for the high level effects we want.. We most likely have more than enough detail here in order to build emulations which can be used to understand things further from a computational point of view. This can lead us to a simulationemulation hybrid.Its like the transistor level emulation of the  chip which was done recently. We could write a simulator which handles the  chips instructions and run programs on it just fine OR we could use the transistor level emulator to do the same thing. functionally we want a simulator but if we dont understand the instruction set an emulator will work in order to determine how a simulator should work. My point was that through a simple brute force process we will most likely do the emulation first with parts simulated then move toward simulation as we understand more and more about the emulation.The vast majority of the reason we dont do this kind of work now is because of the scale involved vs the acceleration of current development ie the same problems with generational space ships. even if we could build one it would be pointless at the moment since it would be passed by following generational ships this will remain so for a lot longer.  We lack a mathematical foundation for this type of system and so having built it we wouldnt be able to do much when it comes to understanding the thing. This is slowly changing only recently have we made breakthroughs in the mathematical foundations of things like LSTM systems. A brain emulator would be far more complex.,Futurology,cufawae,1,t5_2t7no

We dont have a target date for that among other things well have to get a handle on the cost of running cycles on Amazon EC and figure out how to pay for it but Im hoping for early next year.  With that system well be able to offer visualizations like Sankey diagrams based on a users selection of category  like moon colonization.Weve already got about  volunteers helping with fixing some of the links and citations  all those pages need to have more content more reference links etc.  and well be asking for more volunteers to make this a real crowdsourced information resource with curation to assure reliable accurate data and correct citations.

One can only accurately measure how many calories has been burned and that is by measuring carbon dioxide in exhalation. This ofcourse has to be continuosly measured as physical activity increases the amount of exhaled carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide is mainly a result from the Crebs cycle.

Recent advances such as CRISPR allow highly targeted editing of genomes and will eventually find their uses in human reproduction.This reminds me too much of the villain from Iron Man .

5037256,0,t1_cus00xb,Money is a tool used kind of a ledger to keep track of resources. So if your time with your skills is worth say  bucks an hour and a particular machine is worth  bucks its worth an hour of your time. If a square foot of property is worth  bucks then that machine is worth that square foot of property.So while you can look at Alaskas dividend check and say everyone gets some its basic income it only shows you the spending half of the equation. If you were to tax a regionnation and then redistribute that into basic income the economic effect of the taking of that money with no economic production would be vastly different from the Alaskan or Norwegian examples. Youd have to look at the losses incurred from whom that money was taken as well as the gains made by those who got it. In the Alaska example there are no losses to calculate because the money everyone got they already owned in the form of oil and the money is simply their share of the profit for the sale of that oil.Its a myth that money is a big circle. It is not. Money is a placeholder for the movement of resources between people. While it might appear that it is travelling in a circle between companies and consumers what is really happening is companies are producing products and people are providing services and they are trading the two things as they produce them.

5048642,0,t1_cuuh13s,Have often considered these ideas which you discuss. It turns out that the mind is likely created by the underlying neurophysiological structure of the cortical cell columns which are layered into  laminar sections. That architecture which was figured out by Mountcastlerecently died several years ago the CCCs are all the same microscopically all over our cortex all over our brains. The EEGs output of alpha beta and theta of the cortex is also ALL the same wherever recorded. This strongly implies a single process going on which by repetitive use creates Predictive control as per Hinton and Friston.Please Peruse paragraph .There are in layers   pyramidal cells of the cortex which are the alpha source coming from the thalamic driver and which have the complexity to do the mental processing which we call thinking.My methods largely show what thinking is using a simple model of inputoutput of the sensory information or internal information using a comparison processor. This is easily located by CO poisoning studies of the human cortex where the high level abstraction is going on.Its complex system tho and NOT logical to our maths and linear systems. The comparison process used globally in our cortex creates the many many functions of the mind up from the underlying cortical cell columns.  This model is incredibly fertile in explaining how the mind works and in tandem with a dopamine boost which seems to drive it and is a second part of the mind being the emotional aspect to thinking gives some incredible insights in how the brain works.And it also shows what AI MUST simulate to be really good AI. Thus not only does AI research enlighten us about AI but how our brains work. And thus as we learn more about how the brainmind interface works we can more easily define and emulate electronically the human minds which create AI.Astonishingly the comparison process is self consistent self reflexive recursive and it can comprehend mind. The underlying neurophysiology however gives rise to the COMP by direct similarities between its repetitive output and the hierarchical outputs it creates understanding. But the underlying neurophysiological tho is vast beyond all human mental capabilities. Output of a single recognition is compared to other recognitions which cancreates an organized system of knowledge and understanding. Mind can comprehend mind but mind cannot comprehend Brain a very large amount of brain complexities giving rise to the emergent immanent events of the multiple functions we call mind.Its largely explained here. Have been looking for this Uber logic the comparison process for some time  decades in fact.How we learn think and the very wellsprings of creativity and more details of how its done.  DNAs creativity is surprisingly similar to that of the brain. And the same process likely drives evolution as well as human development.More of the basics of the entire system.,Futurology,cuujwg8,1,t5_2t7no

Intellectual routine jobs are likely in trouble no matter what their current status are but social creative or illdefined jobs are pretty secure. There are some jobs that are very secure because they are symbolic or have meanings robots might not fit I sometimes joke priests prostitutes and politicians. So by  we may have a big uproar as part of middle management bureaucrats get rationalized away while the gardeners are looking on bemused... and the transport industry is getting ready to get automated. Some groups are going to be affected way more than others and I think  given the political affiliations of some jobs  this will affect politicians a lot.In the long run we need both flexible job markets so people can switch jobs easier ways of reeducating onself as ones current job disappears a cultural acceptance of both not working and to switch work and a more longterm strategy for a world where jobs might change very fast into entirely new professions.

5115927,0,t1_cv2mw1d,Nootropic drugs are certainly another interest of mine  Ive written about them in the past and used to want to go into neuropharmacology.Personally I think that theyre useful but highly limited. Without very precise control of where these drugs are released which cannot be achieved using current technology at least nootropics are only able to tune brain function within biological limits. Generally speaking this means that the beneficial effect is likely to be quite small and there is likely to be a tradeoff. I do hope that better drugs are developed that have more potent effects than the existing ones while having fewer sideeffects but unfortunately the drug development pipeline is currently quite dry and Im not optimistic that well see a great range of cognition enhancing pharmaceuticals coming out anytime soon.As far as interactions go I see no reason why one couldnt in principle use a combination of implants and pharmacological enhancers to further improve function. Indeed some types of implants still in preclinical testing would enable very precise release of drug molecules at the desired site of action within the brain likely enabling a greater positive effect with fewer sideeffects. Obviously all this is a good few years off being used in humans and will be used to treat medical disorders first but I think theres a lot of potential scope for combining drugs and implants synergistically.,Futurology,cv2nsfd,2,t5_2t7no

5209845,0,t1_cvdyos7,gtNo.  Just curious. I havent either so I cant speak from experience on the subject.   gtThat link you have provided makes the mistake of using the wage figures alone. The Cuban government provides all essential services food housing clothes education transport etc. so wages are naturally going to be lower because they dont have to cover as much as in capitalism.   There are other assessments as well just because people are given the bare subsistence does not mean they lead high quality lives. Granted again I have no firsthand experience and any source should be taken with a grain of salt.  gtat the end of the day capitalism achieved in  years what socialism achieved in  years.  Not exactly Russia and China have history leading back hundreds of years with China even having one of our earlier and more advanced civilizations. They had a foundation to start upon. Alternatively the US was a world power by at least the late s from virtually nothing finally recognized by their defeat of Spain in the Spanish American war many had thought the Colonists would be beaten soundly and has contributed numerous technological advancements to the world in its relatively brief existence driven by the need of inventors to design something better than the other fellow.   Bit of a tangent but in that regard Teslas fate was really a tragedy of capitalisms nastier aspects.   While I agree the US did this using Imperialism and exploitation neither Russia nor China at the point were purely socialist nations fascist more than anything. And if anything we can see how quickly fascism can get things done when it wants to do so free of morality.   Likewise in that regard Russia and China are not sinless in their advancement in those  or so years. Afghanistan comes to mind.   Heck Russia has even recently been aggressively waging campaigns using military force while proclaiming to the world they are most certainly not until later admitting they are.   I think Cuba would be the best example of a relatively Sinless socialism advancing without obvious military aggression though again their standards  are still below that of most capitalist nations hopefully lifting the embargo will help them.,Futurology,cvdz97l,0,t5_2t7no

Voting is a giant externality generator and since people can believe whatever makes them feel good about their color choice rather than what is actually good its a giant negative externality generator.Which is why ancaps dont believe in government. What are we talking about again?gtGood governance is a public good. If people can get together and provide the public good of good governance then they have proved that we dont need government to provide public goods. If they cant get together to provide good governance then you will just end up with bad governments that dont provide the public goods they are supposed to provide.People using collective action is good!. People using collective action and then calling it government is bad!gt dont understand where people as arrogant as you come from. You demonstrate next to zero knowledge about things you hold firm opinions on. According to you who seems to think ancap principals  libertarianism. gtThen you throw out entry level misunderstandings of econ  as if disproves a philosophy that has its modern roots in the thinking of nobel prize winning economists. Did you honestly think that no one had addressed this argument?I probably sound arrogant because I am challenging your appeals to authority instead of accepting the hurr I guess libertarian party.com said the NAP  liberty.  You also didnt address externalities except to say we shouldnt worry about it and then make another appeal to authority and try to make a adhomin attack about my understanding of economics.

What I am describing is not the modern vehicle but the underpinnings that are inherent to any hypothetical future autonomous vehicle a highpower general purpose computer which cannot be disconnected due to its integration with vehicle systems.Even a hypothetical hard killswitch for the software system is rapidly becoming a technical impossibility. More and more vehicles are using general purpose rather than purposebuilt computers for their core control systems. General purpose computers are effectively impossible to totally secure against malicious attackers. There is no way to exercise total control of their inputoutput systems as with older singlepurpose computer systems. The engine control unit itself CANT be disconnected because it is what makes your car go in the first place.This is not fantasy this is the reality of designing a car that is so integrally dependent on a highpower computer to run it. Even if it is possible to build in a failsafe that doesnt make the vehicle uncontrollable no auto company is going to spend the cash it takes to build one in due to the PR and cost considerations.Furthermore in the rosy future where people imagine autonomous vehicles will be mandated these sorts of disconnects will be not only technical pipe dreams but illegal.This is leaving aside the possibility that there might not be a person in the vehicle at all at which point any failsafe disconnect is irrelevant.

5328871,0,t1_cvssw6o,No I havent read Forbidden Archaeology but I did just finish reading the wikipedia page on it.He isnt being silenced hes being criticized as a pseudoscientist as are other creationists and intelligent design proponents. The criticism isnt this guy is questioning the theory of evolution so ignore what he says so much as things like thisgtAnthropologist Colin Groves states that thcentury finds were generally found by accident and by amateurs and were thus generally lacking proper documentation of crucial contextual information and that the dates assigned were therefore suspect. Cremo and Thompson fail to take account of this he says and seem to want to accord equal value to all finds. Groves also states that their discussion of radiometric dating fails to take account of the ongoing refinement of these methods and the resulting fact that later results are more reliable than earlier ones. He concludes that the book is only superficially scholarly.and thisgtSome reviewers Feder and Wodak amp Oldryod  have faulted the book for attacking the current picture of human evolution but not offering an alternative paradigm. ...  Wishing to appear entirely scientific the authors hoped to avoid a detailed discussion of their own beliefs. . . since I would contend these are based on a creationist view but not the kind we are all familiar with. . . . Like fundamentalist Christian creationists they avoid talking about the religious content of their perspective.That seems like harsh but fair criticism. And I am sorry but if a selfdescribed Vedic archaeologist is your example of a genuine scientist being unfairly silenced it makes me wonder how seriously I should take other claims you make.Given the extensive work that went into rebutting Cremos claims which are published in a book in  and currently available on Amazon.com I dont see how you can possibly claim that his work has been censored or ignored. I didnt say there werent scientists being unfairly ignored for having ideas not in keeping with mainstream theories. I said the author if this article while lamenting this failed to provide a single example. The fact that you provided an example now doesnt change this. Of course as stated above I think the example you just provided is ridiculous. The evidence in favor of evolution is overwhelming predictive and consistent. This book seems like a clumsy attack on the theory of evolution without proposing an alternative theory. Frankly it seems like he has postulated an attack on evolution because it is contrary to his faith in the Vedas. This seems to be transparently an attempt to use the language of science to bolster the notion of knowledge through divine revelation.

People will find new uses for them since their relative cost is now lower. You being a leftist will probably then say But wont wages drop?! Nope. The automated factory produces goods cheaper than the humanstaffed factory. Thats a given since there must be a reason for the automation. That automated factory is also in competition with a number of other factories. Thus prices must fall roughly commensurately with the fall in production costs. What happens when both prices fall and wages fall? Absolutely nothing. That would normally cause deflation but we have a centralized banking system that actively manages the monetary supply to prevent such a thing.

5346828,0,t1_cvv19dy,Id like to preface this reply with an apology for any sort of vitriol that might have came across in my initial post. I was filtering my reading of your post as if I was responding to someone defending capital which in retrospect is not the case and even if it were I suppose I need to stop letting the political positions from others except say fascistsracists color the tone of my response Anyway moving on. gtAll of the people in those countries live lives of luxury compared to both their historical ancestors and people in many other countries around the world  typically countries where the capitalist economies have drawn their raw material fromAgreed and I think the idea of an aristocracy of labor is definitely appropriate for analyzing the conditions of noncapitalists in the global capitalist center. That said Id like to emphasize the importance of peripheral nationspeople in the acquisition of what you call raw material. These can be peoples oppressed outright and openly like the Congolese or through softer tactics  Im thinking here of neocolonialism in which people are colonized through purely economic relations and not the outright demonstration of a colonial military power. gtCorrect which is why I used the word an and not the.True but focusing on greed is often a way in for the capitalist human nature argument. Better to leave it off and focus on the qualities of cooperation that capitalist apologists tend to ignore no? Ill admit this could be somewhat disingenuous. gtI would posit that the greedy individual is a product of the random mutation of sociopathy I was referring more to the greedy individual as a trope of human nature in which the greed is raised above all. If this is true it is only true because human beings are conditioned from birth to view greed as naturalgood and thus bring out greedy traits to the forefront. I wont disagree about the biological existence of greed though as Im not well educated in psychologyneuroscience. I am still inclined to believe that social factors play a large role in determining the expression of certain personality traits. gtDemocracy for example provides some balance to parts of the system that the medieval peasants obviously didnt have.Excellent point but one Id like to dive into a little more  how much can we say that modern liberal democracy by which I mean democracy in the realm of bourgeoisie democracy as an elected body of policy makers representing both their constituents as well as the vested interests of capital is a real democracy? Isnt it in some sense true that modern democracy could be read as a system which only serves to reinforce the power of capital by making it seem as though people want it to exist? gtIndeed interference by those who seek to maintain the status quo has often prevented us from truly testing any alternative systems. We have the same problem now of course. percent agreed. gtAs have all human systems been from the earliest times from tribalism to feudalism to capitalism... weve simply gotten better at it.Again totally agree. ,Futurology,cvv48uv,2,t5_2t7no

5356102,0,t1_cvwahkg,Interestingly while trying to find the answer to that question I just found out Uber is actually banned in Berlin.But anyway  Ubers been in the UK since . And.. Im not sure theyd actually bother. Think how slowly theyll roll out the cars  theyll probably start it off in all the big US cities first and then gradually roll out to other countries. Theyll probably do London pretty early and then my city and a few others a few years later but for the majority of the landmass itll probably take a very long time for them to put self driving cars everywhere.In most of the country though Im not sure itd even be profitable enough to be worth adding uber fleets for a very very long time. Especially as.. taxi drivers probably arent going away in the UK until driving becomes illegal. We have hackney carriages here which are the only thing youre allowed to hail so theyll stay for a while I guess just for opportunist stuff like main roads hotels airports. Also companies have licenses to pick up from places like airports where Uber dont.But on top of that we have a huge number of migrants who would be out of a job if they lost their taxis. The other day was Eid and you just couldnt get a taxi. I managed to get in one that just dropped someone off which is actually illegal on his part because he wasnt a hackney carriage and he was working on Eid even though its against his religion because there was such good money at that time cause barely anyone was working. Its a great way to make a fair bit of money if you have no academic qualifications and people come to the UK to become taxi drivers. Especially in my area theres just a culture where people come from the middle east to the UK where their families are and become taxi drivers.All those people are not going to be able to get a job doing anything else theyre going to be battling Uber pretty much and in areas like my girlfriends area they already have like  taxi companies and that covers the whole place.Also old people cant really use Uber atm.

Even if you had the same capacity so you were paying x the upfront cost of lead acid for the lithium the lithium would last x as long before replacement was required just due to the nature of lead acids usable life.

5389516,0,t1_cvzr32d,gtMaintnence on an electric car is pretty much limited to buying a new battery every few years and if something actually breaks just pulling it and replacing since there are about  as many parts and even fewer moving ones this is pretty rare.This is simply untrue. Even highquality electric cars such as the Tesla Model S have their share of problemsMost parts that wearbreak on a gasoline car are not enginetransmission related. Theyre normal wear and tear like shocks tires brakes suspension arms sensors solenoids etc.Electric cars still have these parts with the exception of brakes I know they have brakes but they dont really wear much. On the other hand they do have battery packs as you mentioned and theyre extremely expensive. If you need to buy a pack for a Model S itll cost you about . If you have a cheap electric car such as a Nissan Leaf that has much less range and a smaller battery itll still cost you  not including labor. So in the real world once all is said and done electric cars still cost more to maintain since they have most of the conventional items that need replacement bushings tires shocks suspension pieces sensors in addition to the battery pack which is very expensive. Heres a look at an actual longterm road test by EdmundsYou see that quite a few things needed replacement including the drivetrain multiple times. Since it was a new car they were covered under warranty. But if it was a new gasoline car theyd be covered under warranty as well. The real cost is going to hit you when the car is no longer under warranty and you have to pay for these pieces yourself and drivetrain units cost about k. Since they needed  drivetrains and a battery thats about k in maintenance costs in the first  years alone. Theyre lucky that these things broke under warranty but in reality parts will tend to break even more when the car gets older and isnt under warranty.You can clearly see that in their experience the ownership costs would be far higher than a comparable gasoline car.,Futurology,cw0kkmi,1,t5_2t7no

5391913,0,t1_cw0uees,Researchers Greg Fahy and William F. Rall helped introduce vitrification to reproductive cryopreservation in the mids. As of  researchers claim vitrification provides the benefits of cryopreservation without damage due to ice crystal formation. For clinical cryopreservation vitrification usually requires the addition of cryoprotectants prior to cooling. The cryoprotectants act like antifreeze they decrease the freezing temperature. They also increase the viscosity. Instead of crystallizing the syrupy solution becomes an amorphous iceit vitrifies. Rather than a phase change from liquid to solid by crystallization the amorphous state is like a solid liquid and the transformation is over a small temperature range described as the glass transition temperature. ,Futurology,cw0vld6,7,t5_2t7no

In addition if something managed to try and force its way through the bottomTitanium is strong but still wouldnt resist a normal crash.Tesla Model S manages to get a decent range.No it doesnt... Its using the most advance technology and falling completely flat compared to gas engines.. So let me repeat myself because you are hard of hearing. Gas engines can usually go for hours at top speeds before needing to be refilled.. In order for electric cars to get to that point they would either need a MUCH larger battery or they somehow invent a better safer method of storing energy... Tesla has the technology to make an electric vehicle that can go  hours without recharging but it would be a biochemical bomb if it got into a crash.If such an invention comes it would revolutionize the world and not just cars but thats  years away considering.,Futurology,cw9smvg,1,t5_2t7no

5513415,0,t1_cwgdqr7,I was just giving counter arguments but the counter to all of those...    Hydrogen needs no recharging if you forget to recharge a battery one you could have to wait. Hydrogen is a quick fuel up.    Cooling and fireproofing certainly sounds like a lot of money to be passed onto the consumer!    The average commute is about  miles in the US thats  km. So if you dont recharge for three days or go out of your way groceries dates activities it can run out fairly quickly.    Life span is good but the cycling at the consumer level may not be industry level. They might not get  years with irresponsible consumers or if its cold consistently. Theres a lot of freezethaw cycles that could impact it.     psi that can be depressurized OR a volatile battery that can combust rapidly. Neither sounds pleasant. This is a weak point of both.    Battery certainly has fewer moving parts and that is very valuable.,Futurology,cwge0ik,1,t5_2t7no

Silicon is second making up  followed by aluminum  iron  magnesium  calcium  sodium  and potassium . All of the remaining elements together make up less than  of the earths mass.

5568925,0,t1_cwnbhtf,Despite new knowledge nuclear plants havent been updated in the last  years.The reason waste is dangerous if it comes into contact with humans is because its still a power source. Because its still a power source it can be turned into fuel for different reactors.Some countries have started nuclear waste recycling programs for this purpose.Could we do something like this? Yes. Should we do something like this? Yes. Why dont we? Politics.Not only is everyone afraid of any talk of the other N word the fossil industry currently leading the way in power and pollution output really really doesnt want you to think about nuclear as an option. Theres really not much help.We currently have about  nuclear reactors in  of the united states and our track record is excellent with those. Its true that Fukushima disregarded safety concerns with their safeguards against tsunamis. Why would we discount the last  years of research and innovations to improve upon our own aging facilities? Is fear a good enough reason to not make safer nuclear tech? It should be that fear would make us want to make our plants more safe right?gtWhen solar power runs out were all dead anyway.The sun is a giant nuclear furnace by the way. Not an argument winner its just amusing to be antinuclear and prosolar at the same time. For the record Im all for solar and wind power! But it should be supplementingreplacing nuclear and not supplementingreplacing fossil.  Its a simple fact that burning fossil is killing our planet and we cant move away from it fast enough. Windsolar arent efficientreliablebig enough producers of power fast enough to get to where we need to be  and where we need to be is off of fossil. Weve been moving towards solarwind for years now but so few countries have managed to barely make a dent. Frankly the debate shouldnt be nuclear vs windsolar the debate should be nuclear vs fossil. I worry a lot about the future of our planet when it comes to power. My main worry right now is that we kill ourselves while dicking around with solar panels for the next  years  all the while burning fossil while doing so. gtNuclear power currently is a limited resourceFor a number of reasons this isnt a relevant statement. Nuclear power means we harness energy from splitting or fusing atoms. Even if you say we have a few hundred years of fuel if we limit our use  specific fuel which I think is why you think its limited then that gives us a few hundred years to figure out how to split different atoms or  best yet  go for the holy grail of all power Nuclear Fusion. Fusion isnt dangerous  no radioactivity at all. We combine two hydrogen atoms and get a helium atom and a bunch of heat same thing the sun does by the way. But theres nothing saying we have to use the same fuel source for forever.gtleaves behind a dangerous waste that can not be dealt with in an easy manner.What we do now is store it on site in an undergroundunderwater. Its not hard and its an easy manner.  There are better things to do with with the waste but because people are scared to talk about it were crippling ourselves and burning fossil in the mean time.tldr For the same reasons that youre afraid of nuclear power I want safer nuclear power. If youre more scared of nuclear power than you are of fossil then one thing is fore sure Youre not scared enough of fossil.,Futurology,cwndju1,9,t5_2t7no

Id imagine it would be harder to get people to remotely turn off their personal PV in coordinated ways than to simply eat that extra electricity with CO sequestering machines that automatically turn on if the grid gets too excited.Maybe in the past if nuclear research had been focused on energy generation instead of nuking Japan it would be the best option for today.

That is not the same as selling cars at a loss.Imagine it cost you  to grow an apple that you sold for .  If you grow and sell  apples your cost would be  and revenue would be .  You also planted  new apple trees to grow your business at a cost of  per tree which works out to .  So your cost on the year is   but revenue is only  for a net loss of .  You were not selling apples at a loss you actually made  for each one even though you have an operating loss.Selling at a loss means something very specific.  It means the cost to produce something is more than what it is sold for.  If those apples cost  each to grow but you could only sell them for  you would be selling them at a loss.  The two numbers to determine if a product is being sold at a loss is the cost to produce and the cost to buy that product.  The SeekingAlpha article is not using those two numbers it is dividing the losses by how many cars were made.,Futurology,cwpzqln,1,t5_2t7no

So for example a trip I take several times a year is between Edmonton and Vancouver which is about a  hour drive or a  roundtrip plane ticket.In a rolling hotel room its feasible to go there and back over the space of a weekend leave on a friday evening watch a couple movies sleep and eat breakfast in Van and with  passengers or more its way cheaper than flying.

5797356,0,t1_cxfojb0,Actually it does apply you just have to remember that the topic of the ship isnt just about names its about intrinsic identity. A given ship is itself and isnt another ship. When you alter a part of the ship say replacing the mast with a taller one its still intrinsically the same ship with a minor alteration. The question of whether it is still the same ship as it was when first built comes down to a question of the degree of alteration in each iteration and whether the alterations were unbroken. It also pays to consider whether the replacements were largely of supplemental components in each iteration such as the rudder or sails or if they were replacements of the actual boat itself cabin hull etc. A rudder without a hull isnt a boat. A hull and cabin without a rudder is still a boat. On consciousness when considering if we are the same person as we were at birth we consider experiences and bodily composition. The small iterative changes in our body over our lives even if they include every atom of our body being replaced dont make us no longer the same person because we have an unbroken line of alterations centered on keeping the brain largely intact in all cases. You could replace our bodies entirely keeping the brain powered on and most people would still call that new body them. But when you make a copy its like copying the configuration of a boat and its weathering and dents and patches and scratches and other mendings then calling it the same boat. Its not.

5833585,0,t1_cxjb4ix,I guess I can add a little more to the answers below.    Passenger jet aircraft are pressurized so that you can breathe without assistance from a mask.  Youll see fighter jet pilots wearing masks because their cabin is not pressurized.    The reason you cant breathe is because the air is thin when you are at  feet.  It gets pretty thin even at  ft ever see climbers on Everest? they carry oxygen tanks to aid with breathing.    Now G forces are a function of acceleration.  You mostly feel them when taking off or when braking during landing.  You can also feel them when an aircraft is turning.  As noted below passenger aircraft rarely go above G.  Fighter jets can achieve as much as G limited by the pilot.    You will feel Gforces whether or not your cabin is pressurized.

Low level inflation of about  to even  helps anyone who has debt mortgage student auto with inflation comes wage growth but your debt stays at old money level. Dont confuse inflation with interest.Take for instance someone who bought a  house with x interest on  year mortgage in . They had a household income of k then. Thanks to inflation and wage growth  they now make k but its still the same old k loan. Their house is worth k or so as well. The loan has become cheaper over time thanks to inflation. Yes the price of groceries and clothes has gone up as well. But this is a much smaller portion of expense than paying on debt for most consumers.

The polyGBL seems to be able to go through complete thermal depolimerization but it is not clear if it would be biodegradableBiodegradable is when the polymer can be consumed by microorganisms like fungi or bacteria. Environmentfriendlinesswise it has upsides and downsidesIts counterintuitive but it can be greener if we burn our plastic trash in a controlled environment with proper filters and byproducts disposal. Indeed both biodegradation and combustion transform your plastic into CO. However with combustion you have the opportunity to produce electricity. Polymers are pretty much as good as a fuel than oil. If the polymer biodegrate you cant benefit from the reaction nor can you safely dispose of the eventual nasty additives in it.On the other hand if youre unable to collect efficiently your trash biodegratation gives you the insurance it will disappear after a short period of time and wont be a health hazard to wild life.From the article the good things about polyGBL arent that its biodegradable but that its a biopolymer so not produced with oil and its completely depolimerizable. If thats true that means we could potentially heat the wastes and reproduce a polymer of the same or even higher grade. Its a huge deal on paper but there are a lot of challenges which could make it unusable in our daily life production price mechanical and chemical properties recycling cost do you need to wash it andor dry it for instance?...,Futurology,cxqatwr,378,t5_2t7no

Theres no plight theres no mass starvation or people dying in hospitals.Is there some struggle and hardship being poor? Sure. There always has been.

Yes ACA has directly helped fewer than  Americans since  despite all its costs. It was written by a Heritage Foundation member and chief lobbyist for AGI  so go figure! or free food or anything theyve been getting since .We spend more on social needs per capita then any other nation in the world by a long stretch especially when factoring in state and local aid. When you factor in charity we have the largest social safety net bar none.Lets stop getting hysterical and listening to nonsense. Instead of trying to implement massive huge simplistic plans lets revamp and consolidate current ones making them more cost effective and within the T taxes that we collect. Lets ramp down military spending a bit redo social security to gov backed ks to alleviate the unsustainable way that was created remove medicaidmedicare and install a gov healthcare system alongside our private healthcare system for those who cant afford it remove SNAP and instead have the gov deliver fresh producemeatsfruits to peoples doorsteps so Coke and Walmart stop sucking up the funds they are the  lobbyist for SNAP and WIC and turn off section  and instead have the gov take responsibility for housing the poor instead of giving slum lords rent checks.If we want to help folks lets actually do it. Cutting checks to folks is the worst way to go about it. If you want to spend the money then lets spend the money to help those who want to help themselves out of poverty and accept that some folks will not be lifted out regardless of effort or circumstance. Lets cater to the  of the poor first and handle edgecases later.Lets lean towards more liberty and more selfempowerment and less relying on a check from the benevolence of the greats of society the rich. ,Futurology,cxqiuew,1,t5_2t7no

Marginal productivity of labour is given as the partial derivative of the cobbdouglas function in this case the original MPL is A  a  Ka  L a  and the new MPL is the same equation but with a larger A. MPL is as logic dictates the amount of goods an extra worker will yield in the economy and as this goes up for instance as it did in your example in THEORY producers will be willing to pay more for each worker because the marginal value of their time will yield more goods that can be sold.,Futurology,cxzxo9o,12,t5_2t7no

6049160,0,t1_cycisko,gt Likewise human entertainers will never be made completely obsolete although the use of synthespians will become increasingly common because audiences dont want to see flawless perfection  they want to see imperfect people facing the fearpressure of seemingly insurmountable odds. As an example  any digital piano can deliver a noteperfect rendition of Rachmaninovs rd piano concerto right now  but who wants to watch a machine instructing black and white keys to go up and down for an hour or so? They want to see an all too fallible preferably young and sexy human take on a really difficult challenge where theres a high likelihood that theyll make a mistake.I agree and disagree  I think the beauty of art is not necessarily in seeing that someone worked really hard and is under pressure to perform though that is great but it is the musical experience that is derived from it can be generated from a computer. Musicality comes both from being musically expressive and understanding how the sounds of the music translate into human emotions  and as much as we like to think it is that isnt magic. Theres a connection and formula to it and machines will figure that out  and start to find the true inner beauty of music and replicate it. Thats not to say that it will mean people are replaced  it is the value of our individual expression that brings beauty to music so a computer being able to simulate it does not necessarily mean thats what we want to hear. ,Futurology,cycjrlr,1,t5_2t7no

6084808,0,t1_cygozbq,gtWouldnt creating an industry in an impoverished nation snowball into ancillary industries to support that primary one? This is actually a super complex question to answer. The answer is yes it can. But that is not necessarily always the case especially in the age of globalization today. There are far too many factors to calculate to give a definitive yes or no answer to this although I certainly lean on the no side of the debate.gtIsnt that how cities are built?Again both yes and no. gtEven if people decide to gouge each other its stimulating development of that region and ultimately price itself to a point where its no longer as poor as it once was thus tossing the baton to the next poor country to develop in.Usually no. These people barely make enough to feed their families let alone fuel the local economy for real growth when they really dont if there even is a local economy left to fuel.  And this isnt some exception to the rule. It is the norm. And you make it sound like the company went to the poor country because they are ethical beings. They arent. They only went there to exploit which is quite literally and figuratively the bottom line.And Ive heard this pass the baton argument before. But its bullshit. There are a number of reasons a subcontracted factory eg. a textile factory might jump place to place country to country but it sure as shit has nothing to do with an increased quality of life in these countries. gtAlso keep in mind that low wages in a place may be decent for THEIR standard of living. No. Most of the time the wages arent even decent for their standard of living either. Again sweatshops are the norm. Not the exception.

Basically the idea is that you are not just thinking thoughts but you are able to observe yourself thinking and are able to observe yourself observe yourself thinking and so on.  It creates a loop and that loop is what consciousness is.An animal that just reacts to light by mindless flying towards it probably is not conscious but we can look at light and know that we are looking at light and observe the effects that looking at light has on our own mental processes and so on.    And thats what consciousness is its fundamentally the ability to not just experience things but to experience experiencing them to be conscious of the experiences as they happen.   Anyway thats the explication Im partial to.  But in any case theres certanly nothing about consciousness that violates the laws of physics.

Specifically what I was super excited about is magnetic implants which you can read about in that wiki article there.Heres where it starts to go down the rabbit hole. Back in  there was a whole bunch of information about a project called bottlenose which was an arduinobased attachment for the magnetic implant specifically designed to work as a sort of SONAR as well as a whole bunch of other stuff on  They had that as well as some tips on how to modify it to read infrared as well a device that is implanted in the arm and feeds back medical data in LEDs through the skin and designs for a thinking cap which supposedly used transcranial direct current to improve brain function. However checking on it now all I can find is an obscure reference to the existence on the designs on code.google.com. So I tracked it down naturally. Heres bottlenose and the thinking cap but it doesnt look like they sell the stuff anymore you have to figure it out and build it yourself.If you live in Pittsburgh like I do the Verge article mentions Hot Rod tattoo shop that will do your implants according to one a friend of mine who also wants one its only  there or theres a list on biohack.me.

6287051,0,t1_cz48uv6,Yes I knew you were going to respond with this. But surgical maneuverability is important. Take a look at the high end drones on the market today like Hexo which has infared sensors to automatically avoid collisions with obstacles. I highly doubt the amazon drones are not going to include things like this. So no matter what you are doing surgical control over the drones movements is without a doubt the number one priority. Even though their current design is not the greatest you wont see amazon fussing with wings on a multirotor copter ever I can almost guarantee you that because thats honestly going to serve for more accidents for sure. Multiaxis rotor copters are perfect for the drop off delivery because they allow for surgical precision. Why change something that is a perfect fit for the job? Adding wings on a multicopter is again.. no different than wings on a helicopter. It just doesnt make any sense for the tasks that they perform its just a bad concept because these copters are never flying over gt miles anyways due to laws in place.

6297906,0,t1_cz5fag1,I doubt it. There are a lot of intractable physical issues with how we deal with nanomaterials. For example you cant just pick up a D material from a surface with a scoop  its too thin. To pick up the material at least in our case we have to use a sticky material not truly sticky in the sense of glue but has chemical properties to allow picking it up and put it where we want to. Because of issues related to that there are thin polymers that are left and on near the nanomaterial. These have to be taken off with heat before the nanomaterial is useful so simply moving something can take hours or a day to complete.In addition carbon nanotubes are just that  tubes  and the process of dealing with them is even harder than comparatively simple D materials.,Futurology,cz5i1ea,3,t5_2t7no

It only seems to be anthropomorphizing because humans are the only agents we know of thus far.   But any agent with a sense of selfpreservation will have to concern itself with resources threats competitors etc.    That doesnt make it humanlike rather it means that all agents face some similar problems in the world.    I agree that there could be AIs with no concern for selfpreservation.    But I also suspect that if AIs compete that will set up an evolutionary process of sorts which is the same process that made aggression exploitation deception etc so prevalent in nature.    Theyre not humans doesnt automatically mean that higher intelligence equals higher compassion.Killing is not unique to humans.   Housecats do it for fun all the time.    That a cat is vastly smarter than a slug didnt make cats more compassionate.    This is partly why I dont consider it a given that an AI being vastly smarter than us will make it more compassionate or harmless.    gtyou are presuming that they have the same needs and wants as humans?No I am not.   The concern for safety resources competitors is in no way confined to humans.    Im saying that these things you find so objectionable are not innately human rather they are traits any agent could have.   And if the agent is the product of genetic algorithms or any evolutionary process then they could have some of the same ingrained traits.     Heightened intelligence means they would be better at formulating and pursuing strategies not that that they would have no need for strategies nor that these strategies could never be to our disadvantage.

6426893,0,t1_czk2aud,Problem is most of the things people are discussing in this thread cant be tested on animals. Especially when getting into designer babies. You cant test intelligence looks athleticism etc on animals. There are also other genetic diseases that you arent going to be able to test on animals as well. gtAnd then once you even get to live humans you will start with patients that have no other recourse just like novel cancer treatments are used on those that have exhausted all other forms of treatment.Here is the other problem with your argument. Under no circumstances will that statement ever be true. Giving birth is not a life or death situation. I dont see a circumstance where a patient utilizes gene manipulation after having exhausted all other forms of treatment. There are plenty of other ways to avoid known genetic disorders including ICSI. Problem being that even in the most hands off of approaches like ICSI there are emerging patterns of concerning disorders in these children. While medicine is about curing and many millions have died during testing for stuff they would eventually die of anyways why would we go out of our way to produce more unnecessary death? That is not the nature of medicine... We arent walking around giving toxic chemicals to healthy individuals we are testing drugs that have gone through both rodent and nonrodent animal studies efficacies on the human population in very small numbers to begin with.

This isnt an issue when its kept above its freezing point of around F because its viscosity is closer to water. However it is very difficult to maintain that minimum temperature at all points in the process so therefore it can freeze inside the pipes and cause a mess of issues. Also at these temperatures it is tricky to protect your heat exchangers because these large thermal gradients can severely damage their internal structure. For the parabolic troughs also they utilize a heat transfer fluid most likely therminol that breaks down over time. This can be expensive to replace as well. ,Futurology,czorhu8,6,t5_2t7no

Then fuel is burned in the combustion chamber heating the air which is then sent out the exhaust to propel the aircraft.In all cases jet engines are heat engines.

6519870,0,t1_czth2js,I most certainly can be serious.  Theyre pretty far behind schedule on their launch manifest right now and they are facing some seriously stiff competition from Russia and there is an American com.  Theyve been promising to pick up the pace since the return to flight but as yet these promises have been broken.  They wont be the cheapest way to get to space for very long if they cant step up their ontime performance in the launch manifest and start recovering rockets more reliably.  NASA has already awarded a development contract to Sierra Nevada corp because their launch platform is cheaper which would in the long run substantially reduce SpaceX stake in commercial resupply and potentially commercial crew if the Dream Chaser gets that far which is as yet their biggest contract.  They wont be able to get to Mars and they wont be able to get you to space if they lose their customers before they are prepared to do those things.Long story short the insane pace of their development is hurting them right now.  Maybe not as much as its helping but the costs incurred by their behindschedule customers are not insignificant and will drive some customers to Russias soontobe cheaper and more reliable systems.  Assuredly the customers want SpaceX to get it right but they dont want to keep losing months and months of revenue to launch delays.  This is exactly the sort of thing that loses customers in the near term and nearterm profits are what the organization is banking on to finance long term goals.  Please bear in mind no one actually knows for certain that core reusability will even be cheaper and worth the investment.

Its clear you have a fantastical way of thinking about how technology works. Thats fine and all but you treat it as if youre  correct and start acting condescending towards anyone with proof otherwise andor anyone who asks you for proof about what youre saying.Solar Panels are MUCH more inefficient than most people seem to think. They require a LOT of surface area to produce a small amount of wattage they quickly lose their power producing ability as soon as they stop facing directly at the sun Which is why solar panels are installed at an angle and not facing upwards directly as they would be on the road they are expensive in a cost per area basis they dont produce as much power during winter months since the peak sunlight hours diminish dirtsnowobstructions will greatly reduce power generation one of the reasons why solar panels arent just laid on the ground and are put somewhere elevated.Solar Panels will work much better anywhere but the roads. Its a horrible inefficient waste of money that only serves to SOUND cool and futuristic to the technologically uninclined and the fanatical. Hence the successfully funded solar freaking roadways indiegogo scam with no fruit.This isnt even touching how bad an idea using glass as a replacement to pavement is.

Spacing between cars would be drastically reduced and things such as stop signs traffic lights and congestion would be a thing of the past.  I imagine that commute times would be considerably lower as a result and moreover consistent.  If it takes  minutes to reach a destination it would always take  minutes no matter the time of day as there would be no accidents or rush hour with which to contend.  In the event of unforeseen problems the vehicle could automatically reroute without any intervention.Im extremely excited about the prospects of this technology.

The net effect is  more in their pocket. That only accounts for half of that familys total insurance costs though. The employer also pays an additional year for that familys insurance and will get the same  reduction in bills. It should have a positive effect on wages and the employment rate since it shifts so much of the healthcare cost burden off of employers. The only negative effect produced will be that workers currently specialized in the private health insurance industry might have trouble finding new jobs after their companies are put out of business.

Enough to pay rent on a modestly sized apartment. Enough to feed themselves. Enough to keep the lights on and the house warm. Lets bundle in free medical care free education and free internet access. Lets give a big bump for the first kid and tinier bumps for each successive kid encourage one kid discourage more than one but not enough to let them starve.Say its not adjusted for local cost of living so if you want to live on basic income youre probably going to have to live somewhere cheap. No Manhattan but maybe Buffalo.Now were free to automate all those shitty jobs. That creates a lot of smart jobs. People building robots to do farming. People making d printers for fast food not quite star trek replicators but damn useful for space travel applications too. Full automation and QA on assembly lines. Selfdriving cars buses trains. AI to manage fisheries. Roads and bridges built by machines with relentless efficiency and no contract disputes.The people on basic? They can get a degree. They can learn how to do smart work. They can get jobs that pay well move away from the basic towns and the basic lives. Not motivated? Well they dont hurt their kids chances to succeed. They wont be a drain on the economy by doing their shitty job even shittier than it should be done literally costing their employers more money than theyre even paid. Theyll be stuck in one place for their whole life but thats the thing they dont have to be. Hell maybe thats even okay with them.Finally there are the people who would do work that has no obvious economic benefit while on Basic. Artists would be free to create all day long. Dreamers could work on those projects without having to worry about starving if they dont succeed. Parents could quit their jobs to raise their children in the way they see fit without wondering if theyll end up on the streets.Sure maybe it would cost a lot of money up front but you know what else costs a lot of money? Poverty and the problems it causes.Im not an economist I cant tell you if it would all shake out but I think it would be silly to not be excited at the possibilities that our world would have if no one had to worry about having a job food shelter or education.,Futurology,d05k9b1,1,t5_2t7no

6654372,0,t1_d075fl5,I mostly agree with you but I would say going straight to orbital habitat is impractical. To make an orbital habitat that is also an orbital habitat factory like you mention will need so much material that taking it from earth or near earth asteroids will be impractical. Firstly you need the diameter to be large enough that the gravity is  g without having to spin it so fast it puts a lot of strain on the outside and youre not feeling .g at your toes and .g at your head. Then you need a layer of stuff to protect from radiation and impacts. This stuff could be anything icewater gravel from asteroids or even human waste but youre talking s of meters if not s of meters at least. Basically youre talking something on the size of a supertanker or large cruise ship assuming they dont want to grow their own food on board. Asteroid retrieval is good in theory and relatively energy efficient but it will be cripplingly slow. Every bit of acceleration will have to be matched with deceleration and they are very very thinly spread around. I would think a small lunar mining and refining base with a electric launch system should be the first step. Either a mass driver or a space elevator practical on the moons tiny gravity Most the mass could just be scooped up regolith just ground down to fill in the habitat. Concrete and steel could be made on Lunar from local sources for the shell. Then you only have to send up anything more complex like plastics chemical adhesives and electronics. Another note we dont know if smelting works without gravity fire and heat act very differently without anywhere to rise so any metal work will have to be done in a gravity well before the first habitat is built and spun up. ,Futurology,d07mbid,2,t5_2t7no

6656511,0,t3_46s7ta,For those interested in a LENR timelineThe truth is that this is a very controversial and politically charged area of scientific research but that has shown increasingly compelling empirical evidence over the last  years or so.Very little of the research being done is occurring in the usual labs with the usual funding for complex reasons. The three major reasons are  an announcement in  of success was premature and proved difficult to replicate  there is no obvious or accepted theory for how LENR could occur and  research in the field is stigmatized.So the people who are doing this research are private firms. This only makes the situation worse.The reason why is that privatelyfunded research proceeds with a financial interest in mind and  because the potential is obviously huge  a great deal of secrecy. Also because they have to attract private funding the researchers invariably have to make projections of success which basically amount to promises. The secrecy and failure to live up to promises only adds to the accusations of fraud etc. Unfortunately all of this detracts from the facts which are that dozens of teams around the world have now achieved overunity results at small scales meaning more energy output from a reaction system than is input. Note that this has not ever been achieved by the hot fusion research community despite over  times more funding.The fact that a major US scientific organization is even willing to have a meeting to discuss this topic is a very strong indication that the empirical evidence has reached a point where it can no longer be ignored.,Futurology,d07uah3,7,t5_2t7no

The dealerships as I have already pointed out are not only competing against other dealers of the same make of car. They are competing against the dealers of other brands as well. Toyota cant charge  for a Corolla now and they couldnt charge  for one if they owned the dealerships either because no one would buy one when Hondas are comparable for a lower price. There is already VERY robust competition among car manufacturers. Dealerships do not add any value. They buy a car from a manufacturer and then mark the price up to sell it to you. Thats their entire business model. Buy a thing then turn around and sell that thing for more money without modifying it or adding any value whatsoever. The dealer actively tries to get as much money out of you as possible. Thats not someone doing you a favor thats someone charging you extra money to provide a service you dont need. Every car sold by a dealer today would be cheaper tomorrow if you didnt have to pay for a useless middleman to try to rip you off.,Futurology,d0bf64x,1,t5_2t7no

6697745,0,t1_d0c2bc8,Im not talking about writing something that integrates multiple stacks no. At the moment Im talking about writing something fairly simple and building from there.In our own test pass criteria we will need to provide the first  numbers in order to check that the code is correct but the actual test body would be the question that we put to the interpreter.So the first thing for me to do would be to hook in an NLP engine. There are plenty out there but since my native area is .NET Ill choose Stanford CoreNLP for this example.With this we can use the processor to interpret our requirements laid out in my previous comment  namely array of integers  Fibonacci. Everything else can be filtered out as fluff. The first may be relevant but in this scenario it isnt because  should suffice since it stands to reason that requesting  of something would start at the beginning.So now we know what we want to return and in this instance how many of them and what they are. At a very basic level one could write a switch of various types to return string integer bool etc and collections for example list array dictionary etc so once were into this particular area of code we can output something which will create our empty array. We know its of integers so that provides us with the type.With said array we now need to look at what were filling it with. The next step tells us that we need  of something.  what?  Fibonacci. Right so what is Fibonacci? We have previously codified the formula from plenty lying around. We know that there are preexisting functions and libraries that can create these so we can choose to drop the code in verbatim or have the interpreter output the resultant numbers. Either way we know that we need to iterate  times presumably from  as no other start index has been provided.The class namespaces and everything around it that are required to execute it as a standalone public static void Main for example can be dropped in depending on whether thats required.Now we have produced some simple code that when executed will create an array of integers that will either loop through the creation of the first  Fibonacci numbers based upon the formula with the formulas simply dropped in or will output the first  Fibonacci numbers directly.In either case the test I provided is passed.NB To be absolutely clear Im not saying that this solution is going to bankrupt any software houses any time soon! Its merely a very simple broken implementation example of a lexical parser which interprets natural language and turns it into code.,Futurology,d0c3s33,1,t5_2t7no

Life like humans is commonplace.  interstellar travel is possible.  such Aliens like all life on Earth will reproduce and expanding exponentially over long timelines when resources are available. If you consider such assumptions likely like many SETI or Star Trek fans do then the question of Fermis Paradox is where the hell are they? why have they not colonised the galaxy yet? So the filter is where you make the result small in the Drake equation. If it is in Earths past then the future is an open book. But if there are thousand of civilisations like this one in the galaxies history then it suggests that the future scifi fans hope for of fusion powered interstellar spaceships is unlikely.

6764776,0,t3_48eh1t,gtWould UBI still allow investments to be made.Yes. gtWould saving money still be useful? Yes. In general saving money is useful if you have money now that you might want later. This remains the case even with UBI. The difference with UBI is that that even if you dont save you will still have some basic income and wont starve.gtHow would it affect owning property?It wouldnt.gt Say for example that everything necessary food water clothing etc.. is free through renewable resources. How would housing work?Let me walk you through an example that I think will illustrate what is going on. This covers investment as well. For simplicity we will consider an economy of three people. First there is Alice. Alice owns an apartment building and lives in one of the apartments. Like everyone else she gets UBI. She spends some of the UBI on necessities like Food Clothing Medical Needs etc. The rest she saves invests or spends on luxuries like buying herself a Yacht. If Alice has a job she gets extra money with which she can buy extra luxuries. Second there is Bob. Like Alice Bob gets UBI and possibly additional income if he has a job. Unlike Alice Bob doesnt own any property so for now he has to rent.Finally there is Charles. Charles owns a Factory that makes Yachts and lives on his own private island or something. Now Bob needs somewhere to stay so he goes to Alice and offers her some of his money to rent an apartment. Alice agrees she could use some extra cash to buy her yacht or upgrade it or install a widescreen TV on it or whatever. Bob signs a lease paying Alice regular rent in return for use of an apartment. Some of that money is spent by Alice on upkeep some is paid to the government in taxes and some is used by Alice on her Yacht. Whatever money Alice uses on her Yacht is paid to Charles factory. Part of that money is spent on materials some is paid as taxes and the rest is given to Charles who uses it to commission Art or something. Whoever he bought it from would probably pay taxes on that income as well. So far the Government has collected part of the money that Bob paid Alice for rent part of the money that Alice paid Charles for a Yacht and part of the money that Charles paid to commission his artwork. That money in turn is spent on public projects and to fund UBI. If you are wondering where the money for to pay Alice came from the answer largely lies in the Yacht taxes. The Yachts are made for much less than Alice pays for them as a result there is a surplus of goods that can be given to Alice and other propertyowners in return for providing housing. Obviously the whole process is mediated by money traveling around but that is fundamentally where the wealth comes from. More answers in next comment. ,Futurology,d0j2f0u,6,t5_2t7no

6769614,0,t1_d0jgx4d,But one could look at this another way.  Maybe the cities themselves are the mistake.  They have gotten too big to serve their original purpose.  Maybe we should tear them down and start over.   I really like this particular comment from the article emphasis minegt Its noteworthy that Mr. Crawford nowhere mentions rural communities or states with large geopolitical territories. Driving  minutes in a straight line in Delaware will get you to a lot more than driving  minutes in southeastern California or the entire states of Wyoming Montana and Texas. There are many legitimate criticisms to make about the motor vehicle but Mr. Crawford paints with too broad a brush when he dismisses the technology in its entirety as a seductive mistake.  gt Also I agree with some of the other readers here that vehicle ownership vastly expanded the freedom of Americans. Indeed private ownership of vehicles is generally viewed as an ingredient of liberty in the modern world. There was a reason that the communist governments of Eastern Europe were loath to permit their subjects to own vehicles its the same reason that you dont see North Korean subjects zipping up and down the immaculate streets of Pyongyang. Modern convenient methods of personal mobility contribute to freedom.  gt I share Mr. Crawfords sentiments concerning the disintegration of the agora but I dont see private ownership of personal vehicles as even a chief culprit in that disintegration. The Internet disappearing or extinct social groups e.g. bowling leagues salons church groups etc. and the sheer explosion of population itself make it increasingly difficult to find  and more important maintain  meaningful and intimate relationships among citizens. In other words with respect to that last point the proliferation of denizens in the very urban centers Mr. Crawford admires makes civic friendship nearly impossible. I doubt that an intricate train system would help to connect each of the . million people living in Los Angeles in a way that fosters the sort of thickbonded longlasting fraternal camaraderie Mr. Crawford apparently has in mind.Now do I really think we can tear down and abandon the worlds major cities?  Of course not thats a harebrained crazy idea.  But I think trying to expunge the car from our cities is equally harebrained.,Futurology,d0jm7gq,-1,t5_2t7no

6797151,0,t1_d0mksph,Of course I dont know you but I see two possibilities in this scenario. There is a possibility that one day with never having done so before you up and decided to grab your dads gun hop in the truck and go plunk some rabbits. However I find that unlikely. What is more believable is that for years your guardian taught you how to use care for and respect a gun and how to operate and maintain a vehicle responsibly from a very early age. Once you displayed enough capability you were expected to contribute. What is even more likely is that once you were a teenager you went out to the cow pasture and drove too fast shot guns while drinking and took unnecessary risks throwing those lessons you learned to the wind. Like I said I dont know you. Maybe you were incredibly mature for your age and never succumbed to the feeling of invincibility most kids experience but I have a feeling you got bored and did stupid stuff like most everyone else. Its not I think its impossible to teach kids how to be responsible. What is undeniably true is that young peoples sense of consequences isnt fully developed and they make bad decisions. Read the article I linked to above. Its a physiological thing not a maturity level thing. As for indigenous tribes youve completely glossed over the fact that they more often than not operate as a family unit in every action. When they hunt there are senior hunters which very well might be teenagers but never the less have been instilled with the responsibility that you dont fuck around when youre trying to feed your clan. Finally Im in a major American city. A  year old driving on a  lane highway isnt even close to the same as the cow patch. And where are you stats that there are so many irresponsible immature Americans. Thats pure conjecture. You just so badly want to be right and have the moral high ground that youre throwing any argument at me to see if it sticks without accepting the fact that adults are responsible for kids.

Thus people who were in their s then would be  now and showing putative longevity. Well the effects may be subtlegt In  the benefits of metformin were rediscovered. Many studies were performed and among them the most influential has been the UK Prospective Diabetes Study. It was a randomized multicenter clinical trial that followed  patients over  years. Independently of blood glucose control metformin reduced the risks of myocardial infarction and mortality of all causes.MechanismPhysiologically metformin does quite a range of different things lessening this and stimulating that. Biochemically its primary target seems to be  AMPactivated protein kinase AMPK. This a major regulator of lipid biosynthetic mechanisms through phosphorylation pivotal enzymes such as acetylCoA carboxylase. In general AMPK is critical to maintaining glucose homeostasis but it also has a wider role in metabolic regulation which includes muscle glucose uptake fatty acid oxidation expression of genes involved in glucose synthesis and some glucosestimulated genes that cause the liver to synthesise fat. Chronic activation of AMPK may also induce the expression of muscle hexokinase and glucose transporters mimicking the effects of extensive exercise training.,Futurology,d0qptpt,1,t5_2t7no

I did say I was being nitpicky would you be surprised any nuance gets mangled in public pronouncements to the mass media? go read the paper itself!So there was this RL network that played itself yeah and it was a significant contribution to the final score sure.Now how much hardware did it use and how long did it train?gt Policy Network Reinforcement Learning We further trained the policy network by policy gradient reinforcement learning   ... The policy network was trained in this way for  minibatches of  games using  GPUs for one day.So  day mere GPUs mere    games. Hardly datacenters no? But what was this network used for? There are two networks in the final system the value network and the policy network.Was it the policy network?gt The SL policy network p  performed better in AlphaGo than the stronger RL policy network p   presumably because humans select a diverse beam of promising moves whereas RL optimizes for the single best move. However the value function v  s  v p  s derived from the stronger RL policy network performed better in AlphaGo than a value function v  s  v p  s derived from the SL policy network.Ok so it wasnt the policy network that was the SL network the one trained on the human KGS dataset. So it was the value network right  this says the value function derived from RL network ended up being better. So how was it derived?gt We trained a value network v  s  v p  s to approximate the value function of the RL policy network p ... To avoid overfitting to the strongly correlated positions within games we constructed a new dataset of uncorrelated selfplay positions. This dataset consisted of over  million positions each drawn from a unique game of selfplay.So we have a separate value network trained for that purpose. What does the RL networks training do? The trained RL network played additional    games to create a dataset for training the value network!  From each game one position was used only to avoid problems they had with overfittinggt The value network was trained for  observed rewards   m  k  million minibatches of  positions using  GPUs for one week.Hence neither the policy network nor the value network the two neural net components of alphago nor alphago as a unit ever trained by playing against itself! The policy network was trained on the human KGS dataset. The value network was trained on the RL network dataset! Neither of the two were trained by reinforcement learning but by stochastic gradient descent. RL network ended up not even being directly used in the final system! Seegt Policy Network Classification ... .For each training step we sampled a randomly selected minibatch of m samples from the augmented KGS dataset s k  a k  m k and applied an asynchronous stochastic gradient descent update to maximize the log likelihood of the action P m log p  a k |s k     m . The stepsize  was initialized to . and was halved every  k  million training steps without momentum terms and a minibatch size of m  .and gt Value Network Regression ... The training method was identical to SL policy network training except that the parameter update was based on mean squared error between the predicted values and the  P m k  k k v  s  z  v s  .sry for the broken math in the copypastes here.

Also his view entirely ignores BB and BG transactions and many more nonmonetary stakeholder relationships. By definition jobs are created by employers. ltsgt If you selfemploy does that mean that you arent creating jobs because youre an employer or you do because you are a consumer? s While that was a bit of a sarcastic oversimplification the video goes on to oversimplify personal finance hilariously.

Your  buck argument is bogus.Also if you tax businesses  then individual income of their employees the vast majority of citizens will increase far more than the small welfare minoritys benefits would be cut while governmental services will be underfunded indeed. But a  tax rate only makes sense if the government has alternate revenue streams in the case of Dubai and a few other UAE members this would be FDI and oil.

Almost be definition the process of fixing CO into whatever is going to be exothermic which will generate more CO. Portland cement generates CO from two sources calcination and the energy from combustion needed to drive this. The concrete sets due to crystal formation but a slower process reabsorbs about half of the calcination C. The combustion CO is not recovered. Processes that use less heat would be far more effective at managing emissions that capture and further exothermic chemical reactions. For example the Romans had a COneutral cement  opus caementicium volcanic ash  lime  which fixes by absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and is made at a much lower temperature than portland.

While working there I would not be able to study as hard and get a good entry level position... Lets be honest nobody cares about your experience if you have not been able to finish your studies due to the work but you have work experience flipping burgers...You might say that taking money from the rich would leave an impact on economic development but maybe this money could help some bright people to stay at school and work voluntary work or be an internet at some good place for a while and then get a solid basis for their careers instead of having to take a shitty job just because you need to earn some money...Additional benefit of a welfare state is that when I am in Sweden I dont need to worry that I might get shot or somebody could pick my pockets... And its not just because Swedes use Swish and dont carry cash around as much. Its also because poor people there are less poor than in some other countries. And it again leaves a better impact on poor peoples children.You need to see this as a whole. People who receive benefits... their life is not easy and rosy. People dont have money or have jobs that pay extremely little they start drinking they start beating their kids kids become withdrawn... cant concentrate on their studies. All of that will impact their future lives. And that is what many people dont get. Steve Jobs was who he was not only because he had some talents but also because he grew up in Silicon Valley... also his father didnt beat the crap out of him but he could play and develop.

I pointed out that this hurts economic growth and by extension the rate at which the economy automates and so you pivot to what will the unemployed people?? and now you say youre entirely for .. automation without addressing my first point about how lowering the incentive to work reduces the pace at which the economy automates.The question must be asked why do you shift your arguments? If theyre not sound then why do you support compulsory basic income? Whats the real reason? Do you mind sharing?gtJob creation at least in the first world has managed to keep pace for the large population of lower skilled masses by a transfer from manufacturing to services based jobsI have no idea what the future holds. Service jobs themselves are a category of employment that didnt exist  years ago. Maybe the jobs of the future will be filling out surveys on consumer products so that companies can produce goodsservices that people desire. Maybe theyll be making lattes as Starbucks where its already been shown customers want the human touch instead of a latte produced by a vending machine. Maybe everyone will own some stock and spend their days finding new investment opportunities to reinvest their dividends in. What I know is that people using Spontaneous order will do much better than people using top down order in adapting to the challenges of a rapidly changing world.gtbut now even those jobs are becoming automated.But jobs are being created just as fast as theyre being automated so there is no evidence at all that the automation is causing any problems for society.

Redistribute that wealth.  The reason the rich keep getting richer is they are siphoning all the money from the common folks instead of doing the right thing and paying living wages and helping take care of their fellow human beings.

However negative interest rates are a stick that will force people to spend their money if they cannot get it out of the system.  Since confidence remains low and is only going to go lower for the rest of the century as unemployment rises due to automation and globalization policymakers will have to switch from carrot to stick.  BIG stick like nominal negative interest rates on retail deposits.This is the ONLY reason governments want to get rid of cash.  Without cash the only way to take your money out of the financial system is to spend it buying gold counts as spending which increases the velocity of money and improves the economy thereby improving confidence which spurs still more spending etc.  The money laundering argument is pure bullshit and a red herring.

7032613,0,t1_d1dd57q,Reaction drives such as rockets rely on conservation of momentum some form of propellant is expelled in one direction and the craft gains an equal amount of momentum in the opposing direction. The propellant expelled by a reaction drive need not be a material substance photons carry momentum proportional to their energy and so a drive that simply directionally emits photons will produce thrust albeit very small amounts of thrust for a given power input. These are not closed systems reaction drives all rely on something leaving the system to carry momentum away.The EmDrive on the other hand is claimed to produce far greater amounts of thrust than a photon thruster of the same power would and to do so as a closed system with no emitted radiation. It does not expel any propellant and so has no way of balancing the momentum it gains making it a reactionless drive. If it followed conservation of momentum it would not accelerate.Conservation of energy fares little better. The EmDrive is specifically stated to be a reversible electrical machine power input causes acceleration in one direction acceleration in the other causes it to output power. Every object resting on Earths surface is experiencing . ms of acceleration with no energy cost so Shawyers claims lead to the conclusion that an EmDrive just sitting on one the ground is a free energy device producing endless power output from gravitational acceleration.Additionally direct conversion of energy to thrust will necessarily violate conservation of energy unless the energytothrust ratio is no better than that of a photon rocket and photon rockets have horrendously terrible efficiencies by the way.From RationalWiki found here,Futurology,d1di2ip,1,t5_2t7no

I want to be able to take manual control of my car at any time for any reason immediately without question. Thats what I need in order to drive one.Also are we ready to put that much faith in a machine? Its obvious that the transition period will be long and autonomous cars will share the road probably forever. Because some people will hate the idea some will protest and others just simply like driving and like cars its a hobby. Plus motorcyclists. So they will share the road and you dont have the authority to control peoples lives at that level in this country. We arent a totalitarian society.And that just negates this idea of no intersections. But autonomous cars as a whole are more than  years away. What happens when something goes wrong? What happens when there is a accident? What will the machine do? What is its primary objective? Is it to obey traffic laws? Is it to avoid accidents? Is it to protect human life? Because sometime you have to break those to do others. Sometimes you have to break traffic laws to avoid an accident and cause an accident to save a life. So what will the car do? Will it know enough to run a stop sign if the driver is in danger of being carjacked?Say your driving along in you self driving car and an oncoming car blows a tire and barrels into your path. Even a machine cant stop two tons of steel on a dime. So what does it do? Does it swerve to hit other cars? Or take the impact and hope for the best? What if that vehicle is a school bus? Will that car know its a school bus and make a decision to save the kids over my life? Or what if I have my wife and kids in the car? What if the car swerves in such a way that it protects the driver but sacrifices the safety of the passengers? I dont want that. Or maybe I do. Maybe its my estranged stepbrother and Id rather save my life over his. Does the machine make these decisions?Also theres the issue of traffic. Ive heard these cars drive like pussies. Basically they are defensive. So if I see a self driving car I know that I will be able to cut if off every single time because it will let me. I also know that my commute will be slower because generally people drive past the speed limit on the highway. But will these cars keep up with traffic no matter what? What if its them who sets the pace? Have you ever been on the highway when everyone goes ? No because otherwise it would be a traffic jam. These are just a few real concerns regarding self driving cars. One of which is who is at fault when crashes occur. And an even more major one is security. I know planes have been hacked what if my car is? What if someone hacks my car and sends me into the nearest river?,Futurology,d1hj8bf,1,t5_2t7no

7068666,0,t1_d1h36my,Sure thing!Kubernetes is a container management system not unlike Swarm for Docker or Apache Mesos.  If youre unfamiliar with containers thats a whole lesson on its own   The shortest explanation is that containers are an isolated execution environment for your apps that are almost entirely selfcontained.  Theyre one layer further abstracted than Virtual Machines because they rely on the kernel in the underlying OS but bring everything else with them.  If I push out a container with an updated version of PHP I dont have to worry about that version change affecting ANY other container running on that system since theyve all got their own installation of the PHP library independent from my container.When Google uses the term NoOps theyre referring to the fact that we are getting further and further away from worrying about the underlying infrastructure when we develop and deploy apps.  The simple fact is that applications are what drive us not infrastructure.  Unless being a data center is the core purpose of our business hardware and OSes patches virtualization etc... is all secondary to what were trying to do.  In an ideal world wed simply throw our app onto a platform and let some software figure out where to run it when to scale it up or down and how to effectively manage resources to deliver that app to our users.This is the heart of Kubernetes.  How many PCs do I need to run my app?  Who cares!  How much RAM or CPU?  Let software resolve that issue.  Since itll likely change as traffic patterns change let software dynamically adjust how many containers there are  and how many resources they consume and how they share the total space with all of the other applications and software I need to deliver.  The most recent version of Kubernetes even has persistent volumes that can be stood up and torn down dynamically as needed defined purely through software.It takes some work to get your head around and it represents enough of a seachange that it will be a long time before the world really moves to this model in a big way but I believe it will happen.  Its too cheap smart and efficient to not work out.You can see some of Googles top execs talking about it here from the big Cloud Conference last week  EDIT Jump to  for a good place to startI hope that helps!,Futurology,d1hlgjr,2,t5_2t7no

Live however it add to the show.edit I really mean they do not compose all of their song. Yes they do compose just not everything. The point was that an artist do not need to compose to be very popular. Often the more popular they get the more some composer offer them some songs or they buy some. So a music group can very well have zero songs they written on their album. Which basically describe vocaloid. Someone bought the right of some songs and hire a crew and thats it.

It would not make sense from a propagandists perspective to invest so much money to bolster a media industry which targets artists they are too few and on average less pliable. Creating movies like Transformers and other artistic garbage that holds mass appeal allows US media to reach not only more people but people who are less individualistic and more likely to conform to the images they see in media.It is generally a very gradual process but there is evidence that it works. Examples such as the trend for Chinese upper class to get plastic surgery on their eyelids to make them more rounded as well as the saturation of English speakers and American musicmovies in European countries.Even in some Asian and the middle eastern countries where american media is much less prevalent we can still see daily reminders of westernization in the way that they dress. Adoption of the business suite as well as more casual items such as jeans have become so commonplace its not even a talking point for many people discussing American influence.You could make the argument that cultural imperialism is negative and use that as further evidence for why American media should change. However I would point out that people are less likely to war and more likely to trade with people whose mannerisms and appearance are more similar to their own. I would argue that is far more important than the marginalization of cultural traditions.,Futurology,d1obg9j,1,t5_2t7no

I oppose however that science could ever explain consciousness. Everybody seems to see the phenomenon of thought as a basic part of consciousness. I think therefore I am I strongly disagree here. Thought is just another thing that consciousness can be conscious of. And therefor is no more related to consciousness than a trampoline.What I have been trying to get across in pretty much all of my comments in this thread is rather in regard to the nature of conciousness as something basic. More basic than matter. Something that sits at the core of experience. That consciousness is not brought into existance by the brain any more than the brain is brought into existance by conciousness. And that even if you were a super intelligent AI and you could replicate the brain perfectly and understand every single synapse and the role of every neurotransmittor and its mother you would still have said nothing about consciousness.

If I have a mutation that makes my brain replace damaged cells faster than yours am I not a person anymore?Does someone really believe that replacing those cells one by one with functionally identical copies would be a problem for identity? If not then what about functionally identical nonbiological analogues one by one? And if you can do them all one by one then why not all at once? There is no functional difference. I think if you examine the topic and what you actually think about it while demanding that you be selfconsistent youll either find that you believe that some neurons are magical or that this argument doesnt actually hold water. I cant find any way to use this line of thought as the basis for identity without it boiling down to saying that humans have souls that live in a few magical neurons with extraphysical unobservable identityholding properties. Im not a big fan of that train of thought for one because it has nothing to do with observable reality.

They are both the same thing. People need to get over their philosophical hangups and realize that people arent special people arent magical all that a person is is a combination of hardware and electrical pulses. You copy your brain onto a computer guess what at the moment of creation that computer is also you.The way I see it consciousness is like frames of a movie Every fraction of a second produces a new unique frame different from all the others but only so slightly different from the previous frame. Each frame is you and every time a new frame replaces the old one you die and are replaced with an ever slightly different version and every time you go to sleep your stream of consciousness is interrupted and a notably different person is born in the morning.

Whats more likely? That we are the first in the real world to reach this wonderful goal or are we just a simulation about reaching that point? The odds overwhelmingly support the idea of us not being the first and being stuck in it. Because if you were in a simulation that was as real as life without the memory it was not real then you would never know if it was real or not. Also does that mean if we are in a virtual simulated world that there is a command line or god mode that can be possibly accessed to control the simulation? One last thought on this idea is that if you as a person did become immortial and was living in a virtual dream world wouldnt you grow bored of it and long for a fresh excited prospective of it all? A perspective that you could only get by living the life of someone living in a world before the technology to make you live forever in a virtual world existed? Like the world we all live in today.

I wont discuss all of them but there are some really interesting ideas out there that are worth looking into.What could be the biggest technological field of the st century is nanotechnology. Ill split this into two sections manufacturing and robotics because both are distinct in their usage. Nanomanufacturing would involve building objects at nearatomic levels which would be useful for constructing highly advanced composite materials as well as more advanced equipment ranging from very small cellsized computers to large touchscreen displays as thin as a piece of paper. Nanorobotics would be on the other hand for the medical field but would be arguably even more important as microscopic robots could be injected into the body and attacktreat maladies we are unable to have much of an impact on today such as cancers viruses infections and tissuemusclenerve damage. Not only could they be enormously helpful in combatting these things we are almost powerless to solve with modern equipment but they would also be able to perform surgical operations inside the body with minimal damage to other structures and further into the future could be used to modify the human body examples stronger bone structure and muscles increased capacity for all organs and more intriguingly interaction with neurons in the brain to create a machine interface that works hand in hand with your mind.Genetic modification is another field that will be much larger as time goes on as with even better techniques and procedures the results could range from medicine tailored to your body devices locked so that you alone have control over them kind of like a better passcode modification of crops plantlife and although it might be controversial modification of wildlife to make them more hardened to such things as climate change. People also talk about genetic modification in newborns and people being able to reach a more genetic ideal perhaps surpassing it in time and also wipe out some pretty nasty genetic conditions that have persisted for too long.Although these are only two because Im tired and could talk for hours about this kind of stuff theres a ton of fields from energy to transportation communication construction electronics spaceflight and more mundane things like fashion and art that will see major changes within  years and possibly sooner than that.,Futurology,d1x4ouw,4,t5_2t7no

Theyve mostly been keeping it quiet because they dont want their competitors to jump on things which theyve got in their back pocket not realizing that other people also have it in their back pocket.The reality is that the battery industry has been the major constraining factor on EVs which is why the auto industry is so interested in them. Theyve been champing at the bit waiting for someone to make batteries which are both good enough and cheap enough to make a massproduction EV because they knew it would sell like hotcakes especially with their belief that gas prices are going to be high and therefore a lot of people would be happy to buy a vehicle with better fuel economy in terms of price.The earlier Tesla EVs were horribly expensive in large part because of the batteries. As battery prices have fallen and theyve gotten better it has become increasingly plausible.No one wanted to shoot too early and release a vehicle that didnt work well enough.Thats why youre seeing the Bolt coming out now  they finally got to the point where they could actually do a  mile range EV and then BOOM.Youre going to see a shitton of EVs in the next few years.

7236563,0,t3_4ege5w,Finally something I can commenting on!Im a mechanical engineering student about to finish my undergrad and my senior design project is all about supercritical CO power cycles. Specifically my teams design task has been to investigate design considerations for a scale supercritical CO cycle and what kinds of distortions can be expected from said scale test facility. Basically this just means we want to build a smaller supercritical CO power cycle that can run on cheaper operating conditions so we know that its safe and that it will work before people spend millions on a full scale power cycle. If you want to know more about that Id be happy to continue that discussion but I really just wanted to express why a supercritical CO is so cool for those who dont know the science behind it.Like the article says using supercritical CO will greatly increase the efficiency of a power generation cycle. This efficiency increase comes from the unique properties of a supercritical fluid. a supercritical fluid means that a substance has been pushed past the limit of its respective critical temperature and critical pressure. When this happens the substance takes on strange properties of both a liquid and a gas. Specifically in this case this means that supercritical CO is now pumpable like a liquid. This means that our compressor doesnt have to work nearly as hard to push the CO through the cycle meaning that more of the power generated from the turbine can go to the grid instead of being used to drive the compressor. Were talking a compressor efficiency increase of ish. Along with pumpability CO has a reasonably low critical temperature of roughly  degrees Celsius meaning we run our power cycle with a wider temperature range again increasing efficiency. The one main drawback is that this cycle would have to run at incredibly high pressure. Roughly  times atmospheric pressure. While such pressure is manageable it does mean custom pipes fittings machinery etc is required to handle the intense pressure which gets expensive quickly. This is exactly why my design project is relevant. If we can design a smaller cycle using a different fluid that can run at a lower pressure then we can cheaply and effectively research and optimize a supercritical CO cycle before we have to build a full sized one.Theres lots of very interesting research going on with supercritical CO and it makes me excited to see where projects like this turbine go. Sorry for the length and my undoubtedly horrid grammar but this stuff gets me excited!edit grammar,Futurology,d20qtr3,7,t5_2t7no

The fear of this happening may slow the process down and if CEOs and board members see it coming they may decide to put off automation for a while as theyd rather pay  people a salary than fire them all and end up paying  million people a living wage but really its coming and we can only put it off for so long.

7270222,0,t1_d24asga,Youve got it. What happens in the process is we take both a tumor sample and a blood sample from the patient. We extract total RNA from the solid tumor which contains information on the proteins that the cancer presents on the cell surface so called mutant antigens unique to each persons disease. We amplify that RNA through a series of steps to messenger RNA which if you remember from biology is able to be translated at ribosomal sites into proteins. On the cellular side we sort the blood sample to obtain precursor cells called macrophages which through treatment are converted into immune cells called dendritic cells. These act as generals in the immune system and train cytotoxic T lymphocytes killer T cells which recruit macrophages to phagocytize foreign invaders such as bacteria or nonself cells. The amplified RNA from step  is inserted back into the matured dendritic cells which is theretofore considered the therapy. Once reinjected into the patient these RNAloaded dendritic cells migrate to the lymph nodes where they train the CTLs to look for the mutated surface antigens which are present on that specific patients primary tumor cells and any metastases. These loaded CTLs then spread through the body searching for those specific antigens to attack and destroy. Since all the material used in the treatment is from the patient themselves there are no associated negative immune reactions or cytokine storms which plague other treatments. The great thing is that a single manufacturing process is able to generate multiple years worth of injections and is capable of being stored stably and shipped to the doctors office. This is where previous treatments have failed since the stability of their therapies was so short that it required patients to come onsite at these administration centers. So to answer your question yes the manufacturing process is able to scale and create a large treatment course in a short amount of time. Right now we are only treating stage  RCC patients in this trial but initial data shows that this treatment is effective in other cancer types and at earlier stages meaning that hopefully it could cause longterm remission early on without the need for extremely harsh chemotherapy. ,Futurology,d24kp9l,2,t5_2t7no

Most of the worlds economic history is that of long periods of very littletono economic growth.Japans net economic growth has been comparatively static for decades and its still one of the best most powerful economies on the planet.Economic growth isnt required but its preferred because economic growth means more money in the system which means more money can be put towards a better standard of living.,Futurology,d2ealbw,0,t5_2t7no

If you geneedit in any way you run the risk of creating a genetically superior class because of the simple fact that the poor cant afford it. The issue with the car analogy is that there is no older model of human. You are either human or you have had your genes edited and are superior. It is a clear divide. Also note that this is not a postscarcity world we live in and it doesnt look like we will be getting there any time soon. We cant base our actions today off a very distant possibility that there will no longer be scarcity.On the topic of human experimentation there is no way for an egg to consent and to truly see if it has worked the egg has to be carried all the way. Who are we to doom a human to being an unwilling lab rat?gtAfter all God never said thou shalt not edit thine DNA.Youre right. God never said that. Humans said that.

7458456,0,t3_4hfj3e,I know someone that works for the branch of deepmind that is doing this.  Essentially theyre creating an app for medical professionals that gives them a patients data at a glance.  Currently even with the recent overhaul of the NHS IT systems there is a glaring gap between what front end care need and what they get.  Google are trying to close this gap with this app the idea being that theres still a lot of paperwork and bollocks to wait for before any real decisions can be made and some patient records may be incomplete due to poor record keeping practices.This is just the trial phase.  its pretty exciting to be honest as I have a lot of experience working with  for  around the NHS and the sheer amount of bollocks that people have to go through is still outstanding even after a nearconstant overhaul over the last  years.  This is going to be a massive step in the right direction for the NHS moving towards the future.  When google do stuff they dont do it halfassed they create some really ingenious stuff.One of the things it mentioned briefly that me and my mate had a good chat about was that the use of big data here is really key as it can be used further down the line to track all sorts of data and then turn that into a massive diagnosis assistance tool.  You could give some blood tests and then have google analyse them using all the other blood test results its observed.  The key missing issue in NHS at the moment is a true inter connectivity of data and patterns emerge that we wouldnt have even dreamed possible once the data pool becomes large enough for google to move from an app that simply assists front line to an app that is integrated across the health service as a whole.  The potential benefits for having such a massive data driven system are huge!,Futurology,d2pza0s,2,t5_2t7no

7466567,0,t1_d2qw0s1,Youre welcome hope I can help you .ATO  Australian Taxation Office. Centrelink  Part of the Department of Human Services  the place you go to get welfare of some kind. HECS  Higher Education Contribution Scheme. A loan from the government to get through tertiary education.The way these all work together in my case is that every fortnight when I get paid my employer tells the ATO how much automatically deducts my income tax for that fortnight and sends it to them. At the same time since I told my employer that I still owe a HECS debt a further proportion of my income is taken to pay back that debt.If I earned much less none of my HECS debt would need to be paid back.My tax bracket is determined by my fortnightly earnings. This means if my wages were unstable e.g. parttime work or commissionsales work the amount taken out and sometimes the tax brackets I fall into might change. Fortunately this is a trivial thing for any uptodate payroll software to handle so my employer doesnt really have to think about it.At the end of each financial year I tell the ATO how much I earned in total and if I got charged too much tax I get the difference back. Submitting the forms electronically takes maybe two hours. The money if there is any gets deposited in my nominated bank account within a couple weeks.Now Centrelink is where Id go if I needed help. Ive been jobless went there and they did their best to help. The problem is that meeting the criteria for any of their programs is frankly a hassle. I understand the need for recordkeeping and ensuring compliance but when youre scrounging for any work its so variable and so unstable that its a genuine stress to submit the constant paperwork proving that youre looking for work then proving what you earned down to the dollar. The indignity of it all is that even if you do get work every dollar that you earn is taken out of your benefits. e.g. if you get week on the Newstart program then you get a single shift somewhere that earns you  you then have to report that income and where you worked and get it signed off by your supervisor  and you get  in return because you already earned . So you work hard to get a job and do your best at it for no material benefit? Its quite the disincentive and you can appreciate the bureaucracy that goes into ensuring nobodys lying investigating welfare cheats all the procedures and interlocking systems with the various programs and forms ... its complicated and at some point you have to ask whether the administration cost is worth the savings of catching people out.This is why I prefer a NIT administered by the ATO. If youre unemployed you could use their online form to tell them so and you get your payment. If youre employed your employer does the normal thing of telling the ATO about your income and the software takes care of ensuring you are taxed the correct amount. If the correct amount is some negative number then your pay packet is boosted by that amount with the money coming from the ATO. The Pirate Partys suggestion ensures you dont get cut off from help when you most need it and no matter how little you earn youre always better off earning an income.And then theres the value of unpaid work...,Futurology,d2qwi0p,2,t5_2t7no

7467134,0,t1_d2qwc9t,Yet another reason why Republicans should support it personal responsibility.I lean towards the liberal side I hate it when Republicans imply everyone on welfare is lazy that people who take advantage of government programs are just trying to get free stuff off of the backs of people who actually work.  My parents got married when my mom was  and she never had any reason to work or get an education past high school until he died of cancer when I was  and she had to raise my brother and I on welfare.  She took that time to put herself through nursing school and racked up student loan debt that it took her over ten years to pay off.  Even then she was only able to do it because she married my step father ten years later who owns several companies in whole or some part and is on the lower end of what people consider rich.  Without safety programs we would undoubtedly have become homeless and possibly died and it had nothing to do with wanting free stuff or being lazy.But on the other hand if we can find a way to give every single person in the country the means to better themselves and failing that either because of lack of desire or ability at least the ability to survive with a level of living decently above poverty and they still wont do it thats on them.  While we do have a responsibility to make sure the least of us are not forced in to poverty and death we do not have a responsibility to baby those among us who simply refuse to live within their means.  A selfdestructive person will find a way to destroy their lives no matter how much you give them and we dont need to go bankrupt giving them more than a person who is working hard to improve the state of their life earns simply because they choose to be irresponsible.  And at the point where education and healthcare are free and you are provided enough to live on even if you dont do any work it really is a choice.As I said there would still be programs for mental illness disability would be covered by free medical care and free school so that you could get a job not affected by your disability so for everyone else if you waste what is given to you freely and refuse to take advantage of the opportunities presented I would feel that our societys obligation to you as a citizen has already been fulfilled and continuing to give you more and more does more harm than good.,Futurology,d2qytmy,1,t5_2t7no

7479352,0,t1_d2s673l,gt Consciousness permits a living being to receive and emit information but a computer or a computer simulation isnt a living being its a thing.So youre backtracking on Consciousness is the capacity of a being to receive an emit information then.Ok but what do you mean by alive? The ability to reproduce? Presumably not as infertile people are still conscious.The fact that theres water or carbon involved in its workings?This isnt a pedantic sideissue its absolutely central. When exploring the question of what makes consciousness you need to be able to reason clearly about the hypothetical Are these intelligent Martians conscious?gt What pushed the machine to tell you that is how the data into its neural networks is organized. No feeling involved in there.This isnt a sensible argument. Human consciousness arises entirely from the workings of the physical brain. Were conscious despite that were made up of dead matter which obeys the physical laws of the universe.You dont get to argue that a computer can never be conscious on the grounds that its complexity simply arises from its mechanical workings thats exactly how we humans work!gt I think consciousness is immaterialBut youve presented no good arguments on what makes a computer fundamentally different from a brain.Both follow the physical laws of the universe in order to give rise to complex behaviour.Is consciousness dependent on neurons and therefore impossible with silicon transistors?If so whats so special about neurons that they alone can give rise to consciousness?gt I think consciousness is immaterial.But you presumably agree that creating a new physical human being creates a new consciousness and you agree that physical drugs can temporarily suspend consciousness.Again human consciousness arises purely from brain activity. If you could photocopy a brain youd create a brand new consciousness.gt No understanding of concepts is involved no consciousness no intelligence just data transformed into other data.But physically this is exactly what goes on in the brain. Its just that somehow consciousness arises from it.There is no human consciousness without a functioning brain.Create a new brain and youve created a new consciousness. Shut the brain down with drugs and you temporarily disable the consciousness. Destroy the brain and you permanently end the consciousness. In these ways consciousness is very similar to information processing.,Futurology,d2scyfs,1,t5_2t7no

7537156,0,t1_d2ykz2b,So you dont see a problem with the possibility of every single job being automated? What was amazing about Deepmind beating Lee Sedol at Go wasnt simply that a machine beat a human at a game. That happened in the late s. It was amazing because of the implication that the machine beat him at a game that was deemed all too human. If a complex game like that can be mastered then absolutely no job is safe. If nobody is able to find a job but people who sell goods and services are still charging for them well then we reach an economic stalemate. Another thing too how do you expect someone who has gone to school to be some type of banker to once that job is obsolete just immediately jump into something that hasnt yet been automated? Even if there are still some jobs that wont be taken over by machines which is eventually not likely the job displacement stress that that results in is enormous.You mention farmers but this is something way different because every single job is in danger of being automated. Dont you realize that if AI becomes smart enough that even the tedious job of computer programming itself will be automated? Thats exactly the kind of heavy lifting that machines excel at. I saw an article the other day that said that the highly complex field of data science will likely be automated soon.A lot of people who own and manage major corporations are thickheaded and arent just going to stop charging money for their goods and services just because no one can afford them.

You can look up the amount of energy required to melt say a six  six  six inch volume if steel arbitrarily chosen amount to represent a big hole. The time rate is a factor. Then assume some level of efficiency of the laser heating say  to be conservative. Then you can work out how much energy the beam has to deliver over a reasonably short time. Youll be in the ball park within an order if magnitude.  Or you can look up General Atomics marketing literature about the Blitzer laser cannon. I suspect its capabilities are designed to achieve that objective plus anti aircraft.  It comes in the form of three trucks connected together so its not small.  Also Ive watched  videis of the Navys ver d ion which Iirc is rated at  KW and takes a pretty long time to burn a small hole.

7566541,0,t3_4iys4j,I just saw a comment today from a guy who said hed never ever step foot in a selfdriving car and his reasoning was because he thought the human brain could process faster than a computer.  How can you expect people to grasp even their current situation let alone something that may happen a decade from now?  Most people over  have heard throughout their lives that the next big thing is just around the corner and it never happens.  Popular Science has shown us a flying car every decade for the past  years that never came to be.  They see technology changing and growing but they dont believe the hype anymore.  And yet they are afraid.  Theyve had their computer crash or their cellphone freak out and they think this is what will be driving the cars.  They dont think about the autopilot systems in airplanes that have flown them safely around the world for decades without fail countless times they just look at their stupid laptop and imagine their car flying down the road at  mph when the old blue screen of death pops up and they die in a fiery crash.If they arent afraid of the computer failing then theyre simply afraid to let go of old habits and old ideas.  People get something in their head some world view that shapes who they are as a person and when something comes around that threatens that foundation then they just deny the facts and live on in delusion.  Some guy told me that Teslas cant drive themselves and refused to even address the issue after I pointed out a type S drove cross country by itself.There will always be people afraid of change and something as big as AI busts them down a notch in the hierarchy.

7568098,0,t1_d32fnes,The whole argument of human brain speed is not as clear cut as you make it seem. The more we do fuzzy computing the more it seems like human brains arent actually that fast compared to the type of computers we already have. Case in point were already able to do complex human tasks better than humans requiring all the types of skills you expect from a welleducated human with supercomputers like Watson. Not all of them at once and granted the supercomputer does still use kW but were not exponentially far away. Were only a couple of doublings away from achieving similar order of magnitude computing power.And Im well aware of how current AI implementations work. I dont disagree with you that the ancient fields of neural networks and generative design wont cut it for an actual general AI. Also I will definitely not disagree with your point that it will leave the lab within  years. But Im convinced theres a significant chance itll be at least built somewhere by a big institution within  years. The tools we have are in the correct order of magnitude lots of money and effort is being poured into it I dont see why we shouldnt be able to. To me this is really just a question of computing power. Human brains are not much more than big association and interpretation machines. I sincerely believe thats all there is to it.

7615941,0,t1_d335xxs,My bad for the late response.gt No Im assuming that gas turbines work simply as that.gtYou seem to be producing your own goalposts high bars and facts which are different from everybody elses goalposts bars and facts. Ever turned up a gas stove or a Bunsen burner? Crazy right? Cant be happening.Tbh Ive never turned a gas stove on to generate energy for half a country and deliver it reliably. I doubt it is simply as that but if thats your belief I must say that it is not based on many facts. So how can I argue on that? It just adds one more person who couldnt convince me to the list. You might have tried to change it by delivering facts to me instead of trying to ridicul me.gtYou know perfectly well what I meant by automagically. Youre just clutching at straws.No actually I didnt. Thats the interesting part about communication. We use it because we cannot read minds and therefore I cannot say beforehand what you mean by saying such things. Especially since it is a silly and nonsaying way to describe something. Imo it could as well be that you yourself are not  sure about what you claim and just try to mask that insecurity. Its not unusual. And while I had the feeling you wanted to discuss things seriously this sticked out on the contrary. Imo its the correct thing to do to call people out for such things. You tried the same with me when I wrote that Germans are crazy even though thats my honest thought when seeing how they wasted hundreds of billions on expansion on renewable energy sources sadly not on the research and I admit that I could have said it differently but what comes after thatgtCrazy eh? I see weve arrived at stage II Ridicule. Or maybe stage III Fight. You know seeing as youre going out of your way to the point of disingenuity to fight for nuclear in particular for some reason.is something I do not agree on at all. In my previous post Ive not tried to touch the meta level of a discussion so I suggest you also shouldnt waste your time on that. Maybe you cannot genuinely imagine someone seeing pros in nuclear energy but there are people. Again I hope you dont really equal me with being a lobbyist thatd be quite silly even though there are lobbyist in this kind of discussions but most often they sit on the renewable energy side since there is a lot more fresh cash to be made with than in a rather old economic sector as the nuclear energy.gtThis submission is about Germany right? A country thats actually gone quite a ways towards that smart renewables grid scenario. There was a post on reddit not too long ago where exactly this was discussed. Reportedly outages are far fewer in Germany than stateside so in response to your whole argument that hinges on them occurring Not in Germany they dont. The Germany energy minister or some such person said in the article that they hadnt actually had that in years. Maybe someone remembers the link or can find it.Yes we are talking about Germany so I am also talking about the outages which are coming up in the next years to certain parts of said country because the renewable energy politics is pushing forward without any mercy to its own voters. The smart grid is not even close to be that efficient or else such problems as the already forseeable outage because of renewable energy in the year  would not arrise. But what especially I was refering to are not general outages as you mentioned but ones brought upon by renewable energy. I think I have said this but renewable energy depends on the weather therefore if you cannot predict that you will also not be able to predict outages. Smart grid isnt magic it still needs assumptions over certain conditions but how should it work if we cant perfectly generate those? As said before we talk here about repeated damage done by missing only a few minutes of energy each day. Thats not even the only outage problem of Germany since thanks to their higher dependancy on gas in winter they have to fear being bullied by Russian politics. The Germans dont have their own gas you know. But maybe that aside for now.gtAs you well know at this stage of the conversation thats very disingenuous Coal and nuclear only one of which you seem to be curiously eager to defend because of reasons depend on gas to track changes in demand and be flexible enough to be turned on from one second to another  because coal and nuclear cant do that. Yes in hindsight how irresponsible renewable energy is been seen by many as the ultimate solution I do believe that nuclear energy and its advantages are yet to be preferred and defended for good reasons. Also I agree that nuclear energy is not a flexible system to be shut on and off but is rather efficient and stable. Having a more flexible side component to the energy mix as gas should be alright.gtAnd in light of what I wrote in my previous comment its pretty likely that all other things being equal the coal and nuclear scenario will actually require more gas to be burnt than with the renewables scenario. That gas is a fossil fuel. More burnt more CO produced. So if thats what were trying to counter the choice is obvious. If you really want to make coalnuclear work you have to solve the energy storage problem  but that also would make renewables work even better so...What do you mean by all other things being equal? Because they arent. If you have nuclear energy as a base source and gas as a minor part you have majorly  CO  some CO from the minor gas source. Since nuclear energy can have a big and stable output gas would truly be used to only fix minor fluctuations. On the other hand renewables if we assume they could have the same output as the nuclear plants are much more volatile with greater highs and lows which would lead to an increase usage in gas to counter these am I right? CO wise nuclear energy should be more advantageous than other volatile sources. Now coal is ofc on a whole different level but coal made its comeback only because nuclear plants are forced to be shut down and the country needs somewhere to get its energy from. So coal can be ignored in this discussion.gtScratch that heres a rshittyphotoshopAlright thanks for the effort. I get now how you imagine your scenario. I assume these are not actual proportions but only to show me your idea more in depth? Or else you would assume that renewables do produce more than nuclear energy sources and that the demand of energy is highly volatile. Id say try to imagine rather  basic demand being covered by nuclear energy sources with  volatile ups and downs being covered by gas for an example. If you would like to have a similar base of renewable energies the volatility would be higher and therefore the gas would have to regulate more. While there wont be any given time with truly  renewable energy there would be lows which I believe not even smart grids can solve if they dont have from where to import energy in cases where a general state of bad energyweather would insist over a big geographical region. Maybe the last case wont come up too often but highs and lows under renewable energy wont be as small as under nuclear energy. I see gas to be used at least more thatn in the latter case.gtIve had a look on the Internet and Ive found this  which I think was at least one of the previouslyseen reddit submissions. If you want to read through all of those comments and that article knock yourself out. There are even plenty of lobbyists sorry commenters there who make the same disproved arguments youre repeating  but pretty much all the current heh! information you could need is there as well. The truth is out there.Alright I might take a look when I have more time. As said hope you dont tell me I am a lobbyist. Instead of that though Id like to actually hear your opinion on what I have said. Havent heard your stand on the point of global politics and changing to renewable energy at all. I know I can find people on the internet who want to disprove my arguments but I am in a discussion with you tbh. You can even repeat what others have said as long as I get the feeling you at least picked those arguments out yourself.gtFor some value of we.gtFor some value of our.Now here comes the part where I reveal that I am not an English speaker so I am not sure if what you wrote actually is a valid counter argument to me or just a snark remark. Hope it wasnt the latter. Maybe you can explain more on what you meant.I have to say that not only global politics lead to great implications to renewable energy sources and the change to them from nuclear ones but the main question in the end simply is if do actually underestimate the climate danger to believe we can counter it already today. I am not the only one to believe that but as an example Germans also do I believe there is a lot of lobbying done by pro renewable energy people else I cannot imagine the sudden changes in Germany. We want to save the global climate and we agree that CO is what has to be countered? Well then why do we start shutting off all the CO friendly energy sources without a second thought to only turn on gas and coal which pollute our air again? Why does Germany act alone and risk to fail? Because if they do now other countries will point their fingers to them and say look how they failed we would be dumb do attempt the same thing.,Futurology,d37w5ga,1,t5_2t7no

My flatmate has got a business name I was his apprentice when I trained but neither of us can afford to quit our jobs to run the AC company we both have plenty of capital to do it its just living costs would eat our savings and in the current paradigm you cant afford to go backwards with savings because house prices seem to only be going one way and we need to try to keep up with them.There would be a potential for many people to ditch their employers and restructure their working this would be better for the economy and I guarantee would be part of a downward pressure on prices so to prevent market shocks I think UBI needs to start small with a citizens dividend and build up to a UBI soaking up social services that it displaces the need for along the way.,Futurology,d399qj9,1,t5_2t7no

The technology makes use of a ring worn on a finger of the nonwatchwearing arm since thats the one used to navigate the smartwatch. The ring emits an electrical signal that travels through the watchwearing arm every time a finger is brought in contact with the skin or close to it.

When you are charging at a supercharge station with a kW feed massive energy is lost to heat through resistance this is basic physics and its whats haunting Tesla. The higher the energy feed the more electricity is lost as heat. Super chargers are very inefficiency depending on how much kW feed you are looking at about up to  loss as heat this is why the  minutes and under charges are ridiculous in conceptQuoted from a Tesla ownerI measured it at  efficiency using a TED in my garage subpanel and comparing data reported from the car via the streaming API but I generally charge at A and only to  almost all the time. It definitely becomes less efficient as you do a maxrange charge you get about half of the energy into the battery and the rest is waste heat and running the heat pump to remove that heat  also if you charge higher the resistive loss in the cabling inverter and battery goes up with the square of the current so doubling current quadruples energy lost to resistive heating.Quoted from Chief Toyota EngineerHe dismisses rapid charging as wasteful and an unstable use of the electricity grid. The example given being a  minute rapid charge of a car using enough electricity to power  homes.Tesla refuses to talk about the super inefficient superchargers Toyota refuses to talk about the inefficiency of hydrogen there are definitely pros and cons of both EV and Hydrogen cars.,Futurology,d3j7gqh,1,t5_2t7no

So now we have this whole industry of weekend holidays hotel workers airlines tourist attractions etc. Obviously most of these would exist in some form... but we come to believe there is a high demand from a perspective where we create consumers instead of asking what people actually want.Practically speaking in the short term though I dont think that just because someone considers their job to be bullshit they would leave it. How many times have you seen coworkers joke about that? A lot of people need the connection. And a majority still I think who does not question the current paradigm believe they need the money for the car for the holidays for the restaurant and so on. Thats because they dont see other options. So theyll keep working for a while and feel good about themselves because they are productive busy bees. The stigma of being jobless is still prevalent lets not forget that.Theres no way  of the English workers would leave a job just because they can. For many people today job is a part of their lives. Its a part of who they are even when they think its bullshit.. because it gives them a sense of selfworth. My job is bullshit but hey somebodys gotta do it! And Id rather work than be a lazy bum!  .. I mean just look at dailymail.. its hilarious.. its like they are working so hard at maintaining this paradigm of the goodbad people. Good people work hard bad people have  children and are using the taxpayers money!! Boo!! And that woman who got a nosejob on the taxpayers money!! Boo!! And look this one woman in a million.. who cheated the benefits system to pay for her holidays.. Boo!! That means the other  of you have all been conned out of your hard earned money!  FEAR People.

It got to the point where I didnt have to ask for anything most of the time. Now the other workplace that was a different story. It was in a similar field but it was in a bad location. I got the bottom of the barrel desperate for work applicants. Many of them lived nearby and didnt have reliable transportation that would get them to another job. These people were in constant need of micromanaging. None of them wanted to be there.

Libertarians probably object to this but I think they are wrong. Its still an error if he means that war is needed in order for technology to move at the pace it does. Because governments could choose to invest in technology as they do in war in peacetime.

7835334,0,t1_d3whnvu,The problem with automated trucking is that you need to have the right kind of receiving facilities. Certain companies will definitely be able to do it but it wont be universal for a long time.As it stands right now I can tell you a lot of smaller and medium sized companies have zero desire to invest in that capacity. Unless the system is universal for all trucking companies and all shipments most companies would be hardpressed to spend more than  to install an automated reception facility. Especially when you will need someone to still unpack and sort the goods.Automation works great when you literally spend all day unloading trucks. But if your job is to do  different cognitive and manual tasks one of which is off loading and loading trucks the incentive to having it automated drops off massively.

They dont have tellers because they dont even keep a cash drawer in the office.  They have two ATMs in their lobby and any cash transaction is handled at the ATM.  They had three or four very happy people there greeting customers as they walked in offering to help with anything the customer needed but they didnt touch money in any way.

7854868,0,t1_d3yloco,Not really. Its pretty simple. You extract and perform deep sequencing on the mRNA contained in a persons unique tumor. From this you can determine which proteins are being expressed. Based upon what we do know about tumor cell surface proteins you select say  of those that you identified as potential targets for training the immune system against. You then deliver new mRNA coding for those specific antigens directly to T cells which learn how to detect and respond to them. You simultaneously also administer a compound that reduces immune inhibition by the PD mechanism. And there you have it a beefed up and trained immune system that now and forever recognizes a persons unique tumor as not self. It could theoretically work for any type of cancer.There are at least  reputable companies working on this right now. So far all trials are working extremely well even those in humans. This is not some bs published in PNAS this research is being reported in Science and Nature. Ie. the most reputable scientific journals on the planet. mRNA therapies will be the future. ,Futurology,d3yyi0s,7,t5_2t7no

7855296,0,t1_d3yn932,People notice when their money is gone and can get it replaced.Attacks on voting are different also because of secret ballots. Theres a few things that can happen extra votes changed votes destroyed votes. All these things are easier with technology. Changed votes are much easier where the only record is volatile electronic  there is no  trace left behind.If someone votes extra then secret ballot makes it hard to know who did this or if someone is voting on behalf of other people  which vote is the legitimate one.If someone changes a vote secret ballot makes it near impossible to know that the vote was changed.So Estonia seems to have a system where a voter can check to see if their vote was changed up to some point. I dont know how this protection would actually work and what protection there is against multiple voters claiming my vote was changed.And theres also the reality that if an election was messed up on a large scale that could be used to affect the outcome. EG I know that if we have a vote today then candidate x is likely to win but if we hold that vote in  weeks or later candidate y is more likely to win so if I mess up this election DoS obvious frauds etc then there will need to have the election again and the other candidate has better odds.So it has some specific challenges.

7903181,0,t1_d445vwf,Not to disagree with you but this is still a very interesting and potentially useful tool. I imagine there are dozens of use cases for something like this and many more unintuitive ones to be discovered. Im just playing the devils advocate and so to your first point couldnt this be considered a form of AI? Its an intelligence acting in near real time to answer complex questions meaningfully. Whether or not the base components are .DLLs or human brains seems a bit irrelevant when the intervening medium is all digital either way. You could then argue that a popularity contest show is a form of AI as well and who knows maybe it is. Id think that a general purpose application designed specifically to be used as a hive AI rather than to decide who should be the next top model might fall under different categories however. We have so little read basically none experience with anything smarter than a human that categorising the different methods by which we might create entities smarter than ourselves seems a bit like a fools errand. We may even fail to realize the intelligence or usefulness of something until long after it has seen wide use. The internet comes to mind here. In spite of all the mindlessness and incoherent babble and spam and pure waste on the web it still seems to take all the different aspects of humanity and multiply them to superhuman levels. There are gargantuan amounts of porn online  no surprise what person doesnt like porn whether theyll admit it or not? Now we have the largest repository of carnal satisfaction capable of intelligently  in a crude way  displaying exactly what brand of dwarf albino two and a halfism you may wish. For the curious we have amassed the largest library of human knowledge ever to exist and have developed the tools to make it all accessible and sorted and curated within seconds. If a human personality is little more than a complex automaton reacting in ways of which we arent aware that we dont understand to stimuli so tenuous as to be imperceptible to anything less than a full fledged psychological study why cant it be possible for an entity like the internet to do the same thing? To most of us who havent thought about it it seems like a relatively static unaware thing. But from my perspective it is making decisions on its own every time I look at it. Data gets moved edited deleted shaped colored and created all on its own. The questions I ask it are answered through mechanisms I hardly understand and based upon mountains of heurestics data that no human could ever reasonably sift through. Its response and the pathway it took to reach its conclusion are as untraceable to me as another humans thought. Yet again what is the major difference besides the fact that one intelligence is driven by biology and the other by both biology and electronics? The internet and its web pages and search engines and bots and dark storage servers is driven by millions of human brains each making their contribution to every one of its neuronal ticks. The hive AI is similarly driven with each user contributing its opinion to find the average. While on a physical level there is a clear difference between either of these systems and a human brain on a philosophical level is there really that big a gap? Just because something doesnt express human concepts of intelligence mind I realize the difference between intelligence and sentience doesnt mean it doesnt have self motivation that is driven by irreducible and therefore unpredictable factors. If human free will exists because we and the universe are too complex to ever predict deterministically then the same must be true for any other intelligence regardless of sapience. Even the universe has free will by that definition but even if we restrict the definition to those who also have self motivation Id still argue any sort of hive mind intelligence still exhibits the right behavior.Look at it like this we are self aware because we know what we are. We are capable of wondering where we came from and predicting the future and using our rational minds to solve problems. If these are the properties of a human being that separates it from every other creature then any human government is also self aware. A government has within it individuals that are aware of what the government is what it is doing why it is doing it where it is going and how it is going to solve its problems. If the government is the sum of the individuals within it then it is self aware and therefore sapient and intelligent. This should be true for any social group that has a self identity. Now back to hive AI. I fail to see the difference between a hive AI and any other self aware social entity. The hive has a self awareness goals and motivations and little more than a streamlined way of carrying on with its business.The internet does not qualify here. It does not have a self identity. One could argue that every individual on the internet knows they are on the internet and therefore it is self aware but this isnt satisfactory for some reason. The internet is self motivating and intelligent but not sentient the way humans are. It responds with purpose to the individuals who use it and in turn those individuals define its responses. It does not have a defined goal nor any unifying structure intrinsic to it beyond the myriad of data protocols it uses. Finally in both cases hive AI and the internet are both intelligent for the sake of this argument. They are both artificial. Therefore they are AI. Either we redefine the meaning of artificial or of intelligence but unless we do that I think that this argument makes some sense.To your second point I do not think that youve presented a counter argument to the validity of the hive AI. Of course  individuals would likely outsmart one or two. And whether or not it was luck or just good guesses I think it makes sense that their educated guesses would be slightly better than luck. Finally if the only people guessing are people interested and knowledgeable  great! That means the results are even more reliable. Id rather hear the opinion of  doctors rather than  laymen when trying to identify an ailment. But in any case the strength of this system is the multitude of individuals providing their input. Naturally given human nature this is also its weakness. It wouldnt be wise to use it to bet on high stakes. It wouldnt be wise to use its predictions at all. Not yet. But any extra layers of filtering such a system may encourage only serve to increase the odds of it being right. And if the strength does eventually prove to be stronger than the weakness then maybe one day we will have to take the concept of using hive AI for more practical purposes seriously.Anyways I mostly wrote this for my benefit as much as anyone elses. I figured someone had to make the argument happen. Any feedback is welcome. I welcome a discussion for when I can afford a reply.,Futurology,d44e5j4,6,t5_2t7no

Most of the lag between invention and adoption was due to the lack of coverage cost wasnt so much a factor  and where it was it was the cost of the computers inside them and not the actual phone.  A driverless vehicle needs no new infrastructure and the computers pretty much already exist.  Theyll be far more reliable faster cheaper less damage to goods better tracking of shipments no sick days no getting pulled over  I could keep going.  Theyll be adopted within two years maybe five years of the technology being demonstrated.  This is happening faster than people think.  Its happening now.

7963579,0,t1_d4b5j1q,Internal combustion engines require the burning of a fuel and will always rely on a fossil fuel unless we can engineer an equivalent fuel for cheaper that is less polluting. By that point burning fuels is just to complex compared to battery storage. EVs can use electricity from any source. The best would be from local generation to limit transmission loss. So solar and maybe even wind makes sense. I would pick solar in this case. It can even be a trickle amount for home generation. Most cars dont use their entire battery capacity each day so you are just really topping them up. For every EV to be coal powered then  of worldwide electrical generation would need to be coal generated. Teslas might soak up the electricity but Solar City produces enough to cover their needs. These are two Elon Musk companies so they are easily compared. So one is a problem solved by the other.I dont see where the argument for EVs being a higher fossil fuel cost to produce. I assume that the battery would make up a majority of this claim since an EV has a couple thousand fewer parts than a normal combustion vehicle. The batteries that Tesla will begin producing will be coming from the gigafactory that is an energy neutral facility that generates  of its energy from solar and wind. The batteries will also be recycled so I feel that this claim doesnt hold up.

8024185,0,t1_d4h7rb5,gtWait why are you converting electricity to mileage just to convert back to electricity?Good question and sorry I wasnt able to reply sooner.  To use your analogy to explain while you are correct in that we know the size of the pool we dont know just how much of the pools volume is actually being used.  Basically automotive batteries are generally designed to avoid full states of charge and discharge as this drastically extends the batterys life compared to conventional consumer applications like laptops and AA batteries.The previous plugin Prius was considered full at  state of charge and stops allowing allelectric propulsion mode at   Basically while the previous plugin Prius had a battery capacity of . kWh only  . kWh of that range is actually used.  Chevrolet did something similar with the Volt which only used . kWh out of the full  kWh range  Therefore without any information on the actual subset of the battery range used it defies a straightforward calculation of capacitywatts as the actual capacity used is an asyet unknown quantity.Given that we are just told that the Prius Prime is able to an allelectric range of  miles but we dont know just how much energy in kWh are used to deliver that range as prior EV development suggests it does not use the full capacity of the battery it was necessary to fall back on the EPAs watthours per mile rating to derive the actual subset that gets used . kWh miles  . kWh BTW.It is based on this math that I derived a result of a charging time of  hours at nominal solar panel output . days assuming  hours of solar exposure per day  a straightforward calculation of capacitywatts would have yielded  hours which would have underestimated the solar panels capability to some extent.,Futurology,d4hzs3g,6,t5_2t7no

8121749,0,t1_d4snpoz,gt I just think its weird that people value working in a specific area or having more space in their home so far above their free time.Unfortunately this is primarily due to raising children as ustrlord pointed out.  Here are some of the benefits Much better public schools Lower crime Less traffic garbage and pollutionHeres basically the problem.  You want to live somewhere that excludes everyone at an income level below you finding somewhere as close to unaffordable as you are comfortable with.  As youre struggling to move up higher the people below you are also struggling to move up to your level so to maintain the status quo you have to push them down at the same time.  HOAs are really a form of insurance against lower classes of people as well as NIMBY attitudes.  You dont want apartments built near your housing development because then people with less money will start sending their kids to your schools which will lower test scores because maybe both parents have to work long hours and cant pay for a tutor.  You dont want public transportation going to your neighborhood because then people from poor areas can get on a bus and come rob houses.  If these things start encroaching on where you live your last line of defense is to move further away and find somewhere new with a high barrier of entry.  If you time it right you can sell your house while your current neighborhood is still hyped before the lower classes start finding a way in.This is basically what the term white flight is about and ultimately its just a desire to improve your own standing at the expense of other people improving themselves.  Its not that people like being stuck on a commute they just dont want their kids to have to deal with hobos drunk out of their minds pissing on the streets or people robbing you to steal your sneakers or whatever thing it is that people fear about lower classes than themselves.,Futurology,d4syh9v,1,t5_2t7no

If theres nothing preventing the view of the smart car or the driver the smart car is better because it WILL see the pedestrian while the human driver might look away or be distracted or even not take action quick enough. Even if one pedestrian accident in one thousand are close calls because of driver attention the smart car should have a zero accidents out of a thousand close calls.Also in the event someone jumps out from behind a parked car no human is likely to be aware of it so theres no difference that a smart car would be able to stop that from happening and if the human for whatever reason does happen to see it they can manually stop the vehicle. Ironically though as smart cars become more developed and eventually more connected its likely that parked vehicles will have a form of sensor that runs constantly and sends information to other driving vehicles so that if someone runs out from behind a parked car the smart car already knows and has began slowing down because the parked car had already informed the driving car that something was running into the road in front of it.,Futurology,d52zada,2,t5_2t7no

First the driverless cars will always follow the law. From that you could argue the law when fringe situations occur. Expanding upon that the car has an endless  degree gaze. The cars will quickly out pace any human when spotting dangers within line of sight. As for preemptively avoiding danger theyll have to learn like us.. by experience.

Its very likely that someone other than Edison or Ford would have created said innovations. Even for the case of Jobs since its invention was highly dependent on the invention of the capacitive touch display  and its safe to assume others would have used that to create a good touch phone. Maybe those inventors moved history a bit faster. Ill grant you that. As for Musk  I think that its just a matter of time before we would have gotten either electric cars or hydrogen cars. With the pressures of climate changeand its economical and political implications those are the only logical conclusion and we would have gotten them. For example better place started building them in a failed attemptusing replaceable batteries but i think they got the idea a bit wrong  they should have designed it as taxis and could have been proven to work with relatively little money and than deployed at scale  an with time the electric car industry would have reduced battery prices etc.  But that doesnt take anything from Musks great achievements! He did bring us the future much faster. He did risk a lot for our benefit. He deserves a lot of respect. Taxies could get help from cities can be deployed on a city by city basis  so its far easier to deploy a battery replacement network and maintenance networks only locally its easier to prove the idea taxi drivers are much more sensitive to fuelmaintenance costs they drive much more so theres more money to share between the driver and the company while making both sides happy etc.Heck even as a proof of concept it might have started with just converting a ford fsmall truck into a taxi with the batteries in the truckbed  and some simple equipment to replace the batteries from the truck bed. And than just start with a single city  battery replacement station  and prove the idea with relatively little money.  ,Futurology,d54gq3k,2,t5_2t7no

I think the most likely solution would be to watch for specific data points. It doesnt have to collect and analyse every single bit of info everyone puts out every day it simply has to look out for specific data points. For example it wouldnt target every teenage white male that plays CS and CoD and browses Reddit and chan but might flag targets from a specific board like rthedonald or a hate group website and check against other data points to build a profile for those users.,Futurology,d5cz65h,1,t5_2t7no

8316569,0,t1_d5h1vik,gt Well thats why you have to do it with every last base pair. All  billion of them.No thats both unnecessary and impractical. Youre also confusing gene function with gene regulation.We dont need to mutate every last base pair to understand gene function. Forward and reverse genetic analysis methods can typically determine gene function. The challenge now is to integrate all the information we have already  years worth and gain a systems level understanding of gene function and regulation. This can only be accomplished with computational tools. Another study gt Im aware of the fact that much of our DNA is only used in the embryonic stages and the reason that we call it junk is because it doesnt serve a purpose later in life.False on both counts.Most of our DNA isnt used solely for embryonic development. Secondly DNA is classified into protein coding and nonprotein coding DNA aka junk DNA. Back in the day we assumed all the nonprotein coding DNA was leftover junk and had no real function. Turns out we were wrong.  of our genome isnt junk not by a long shot.  gt Its like trying to get python from the binary but much harder.More like trying to understand what an operating system is using a simple python script. Why is the script broken down into machine code? What breaks it down? How is that code translated into actionable information?How does the entire system operating system tie all the pieces together?gt Im banking on if I work hard enough i can answer enough of these questions to eventually begin my research.Definitely.

To me sentient AI is actually a lot harder to develop than it seems people keep anticipating an exponential increase in machine learning but the complexity of creating sentient AI is enormous  and it seems more like centuries than decades. I think there was some study that said the human mind has  billion gigabytes in memory storage alone and the amount of time to develop simple Artificial Narrow Intelligence like the Go or Chess software took a decade with multiple programmers. As another example Google has spent billions or dollars just trying to develop an ANI to recognize written handwriting and its still in development after several years.

A recent NACTO study here it is PDF found that about half of Americans would like to bike as transportation but dont because they dont feel safe and would feel safe biking on a network made of separated protected infrastructure. They also found that countrywide ridership is correlated positively with the rate of infrastructure creation. It works the same way with cars you build roads and more people start driving. Thats induced demand and the demand you see for cycling today in American cities is just the tip of the iceberg.A paved unbroken protected cycle path through the east coast would probably see millions of riders along its length daily. People commuting to work from suburbs friends visiting friends in other cities people running errands folks working out or just riding for recreation. If you make it easy for people to bike then a lot of people bike.

8401767,0,t1_d5rq7hq,That assumes that its possible to for everyone to be employed be fed and get the services they want without economic growth. If for example the services people wanted changed the economy would have to grow and change to provide those new services.The larger point is that economic growth isnt defined by the consumption of resourcesthats just a side effect of industrialization. Lots of economic growth happens without consuming additional raw materials or nonrenewable resources.For example labor productivity has increased throughout the th and st centuriesmeaning that workers get more done in an hour than they did in previous years. There are a lot of reasons for this including increased automation improved technology and the discovery of improved management and administrative techniques. Implementation of many of these doesnt require the consumption of any raw materials. For example if I rearrange your office so that customers can find who they need to speak with more quickly then I have increased the number of customers who can be seen per hourmeaning that I have increased productivity without consuming additional resources. A realworld example was the development of the assembly line. When Ford introduced it into the auto industry he vastly increased the productivity of each worker and thus the number of cars produced per day without increasing the number of resources required to produce each car.Last point growth in services sectors doesnt necessarily consume any additional physical resources. For example you could vastly expand the number of tour guides personal trainers life coaches sports referees physical therapists psychotherapists teachers gardeners actors writers and artists with little or no expenditure of nonrenewable resources.TLDR Economic growth is a necessary prerequisite to people having jobs everyone getting fed and everyone getting the services they want. Economic growthparticularly in the service sectordoesnt require the consumption of nonrenewable resources or any resources at all in some cases. ,Futurology,d5rrmmo,3,t5_2t7no

8425697,0,t1_d5uhg7k,You hit on a lot of good points but nothing about capitalism precludes competition.  As long as governments dont grant monopolies or encourage them with regulations then capitalism will sprout competition naturally.Consider three big companies A B and C all provide some good or service M.  Over time A consumes B and C creating a giant A with no competition.  So long as no laws are enacted which grants A absolute rights over M only one of several outcomes will occur  A will keep profit margins low enough to discourage competitors to enter the market due to lack of profit opportunity in which case the public who is buying from A is generally satisfied with A being the sole provider of M or  new companies X Y and Z will enter the market in search of their share of profits for producing M and satisfying the public demands be it for cheaper prices better service a fancier version of M etc. thus competing with A and satisfying the consumer with competition choices and fair prices.So yes capitalism isnt the same as competition natural monopolies can evolve.

I think my only concern with Misquitos is that they are eaten by an awful lot of things like bats etc. So long as their absence wouldnt create an environmental problem for other creatures theyre pesky as fuck in certain regions so it makes sense.

From its small beginning The IUCN Red List has grown in size and complexity and now plays an increasingly prominent role in guiding conservation activities of governments NGOs and scientific institutions. The introduction in  of a scientifically rigorous approach to determine risks of extinction that is applicable to all species has become a world standard. In order to produce The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species the IUCN Global Species Programme working with the IUCN Survival Commission SSC and with members of IUCN draws on and mobilizes a network of scientists and partner organizations working in almost every country in the world who collectively hold what is likely the most complete scientific knowledge base on the biology and conservation status of species.The list gets bigger every single day.One animals dieing affects entire ecosystems the whole food chain.

The amount of mistakes made by the human as compared to the robot.  Technology also competes with technology. A superior car outclasses an inferior one this has nothing to do with wage.

8555278,0,t1_d6at7cu,gt What do you mean? Copyright is what prevents that from happening.I said Do you think anyone should have the right to profit off of MY work? and you said No. So Ill assume you dont support sites like The Pirate Bay which profit off of other peoples creative work through advertisements right? You support the idea that someone else without changing a thing should not be able to profit off my work right? How would you enforce this without copyright? Without copyright someone can sell bootleg DVDs legally. Someone could rip off your YouTube video and upload it to their own channel claiming it as their own and profiting off ads. Also how do you expect creators to make any money if their creations can be distributed by others for free without penalty? It would be very difficult for smaller creators without a fanbase.gt Sharing the video file is still illegal even if I never actually play it and for that matter even if nobody I share it with ever actually plays it.Why does it matter? Its still a video file. If you open it with a video player itll play the video.gt Yes. But that just means that theres a whole category of numbers that are copyrighted for the same reason. That doesnt make the problem better if anything it just makes it worse.A whole category of numbers? No. The individual bits themselves are NOT copyrighted and you know this. The individual bytes themselves are NOT copyrighted. If the bits and bytes form a video file with a stolen movie that is when copyright comes in. Ive already told you the numbersbitsbytes are irrelevant its the video that plays in your video player that counts. Lets take a look at a piece of a copyrighted video file FFED. Is this tiny chunk of data copyrighted? No. It is useless in this form. Can you figure out which movie its from? No no you cant. Bits are not even necessarily numbers see this quote from Wikipedia The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values and may therefore be physically implemented with a twostate device. These values are most commonly represented as either a  or . ... The two values can also be interpreted as logical values truefalse yesno algebraic signs  activation states onoff or any other twovalued attribute. The correspondence between these values and the physical states of the underlying storage or device is a matter of convention and different assignments may be used even within the same device or program.gt No the idea of somebody being able to own a specific number or a specific sound a specific pattern of colours a specific way of arranging metal into a machine etc is absurd.It isnt a specific number. A file is a collection of bytes which are made up of bits not this giant number. A human isnt a giant cell its made out of many different cells I hope you get that metaphor.Also you are simplifying things yet again! Who would call a painting a specific pattern of colours you are using language to make it seem like this copyright thing is really vague! It isnt Its SUPER obvious when someone has copied a painting or a song or a pirated movie! Its not like this stuff happens by accident! I was using a random number generator for my science project and I accidentally produced the entirety of the movie Interstellar! Oh no Ive violated the law! That doesnt happen and will NEVER happen.gt People owning individual things I have no problem with.How could someone claim that a specific collection of atoms is their own? Its just atoms. How immoral! Im just jokin around Im not serious with this point.gt People owning entire types of things and ways of doing things is what doesnt make any sense.How is a copyrighted movie constitute as owning an entire type of thing? Im pretty sure a movie is a specific thing. I dont necessarily disagree with your point here its just that a video is a very specific thing as is an image or a song.gt One could for instance design a file format that can contain both valid formatted text data and valid video data.This already happens with subtitles in different formats and yes some of them are formatted.gt Whether a file is a video file is really just a matter of whether there exists an algorithm that can read the file and produce a meaningful video out of it.Are you telling me that in your hypothetical someone created a video file format... and didnt test it out? They didnt develop a method of playing it back? How do they even know it works? That wont happen. But if theoretically it did... Im curious if distributing a movie file in that format would be copyright infringement? I mean it cant be played back at all. You cant prove that the file is actually a video if it cant be played and the format is unrecognisable. I really wouldnt know in this situation. I might look into this more.gt Fundamentally its just a really long number.I showed you a video file in text form and I distinctly remember there being letters too.,Futurology,d6azgbq,1,t5_2t7no

Sure I could do with a little less Muskspam but I think youre overreacting.  But in the spirit of Futurology Ill try to answer the question youve asked.  Based on current trends I expect Elon Musk to fall out of favor with the nerd community when a more successful and ambitious tech billionaire begins to outdo him.  Its hard to nail that down exactly especially since selfmade billionaires are one of the hardest things to predict.  But every major wave of technology seems to have created a few guys like him.  Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were examples of the last tech wave.  So for Elon Musk to fall out of popularity it will generally require a new wave of technology.  D printing is a good candidate.  It has a lot of potential which has yet to be unlocked by a clever business strategy or marketing scheme.  That kid who started the Ethereum project is a possible candidate as well.

Transonic flow full width breach drops off to  mph by the time it hits the next pod.  There might be an air hammer effect the main danger of which would be overpressure but that could be solved with check valves cheaply and economically.  One thing I didnt mention in this post is the supersonic shockwave  At high vacuums a mach   Pa shockwave can travel into a vacuum chamber and be very destructive.  However the Hyperloop is not a high vacuum and is already at  Pa so that kind of shockwave doesnt really apply.  Thats basically the limits of what I can say with what I know about fluid dynamics and without using a simulator though.  Small breaches definitely wont be a problem large breaches are unlikely to be a significant problem but may still need accounting for and mach  shock waves will not be a problem but mach lt shockwaves might be a problem.

Only on reddit would people automatically assume a black hole opens up and destroys every  year old house whatever mental gymnastic it takes to feel superior to a person who designs custom houses every single day. So no the first death of a house isnt its destruction its when it stops being an economicly valuable asset. Just like cars. How often do you see  year old cars?

No they reached a point where even if technically still drivable or fixable they were unsellable except for scrap metal.

Thats gross physical damage and can usually be fixed with a splint ok simplifying hugely here but my point stands. Cancer especially of the brain? This is not kid stuff to figure out anymore. So it goes slow. Just the location of the problem is a problem in itself  you cant exactly carve your way in to take out a tumor. Which makes physical removal impossible. So at the risk of coming across as an unfeeling douche  and I would dispute being that  the fact just remains that medical progress continues but the amount of massive breakthroughs we see year after year has slowed. A lot. Because this shit is getting mighty complicated.Medical researchers have done incredible things already and continue to do so it has never before been possible to survive things we now can thanks to all those decades and centuries of research. But... there are still so many things that arent fixable. But progress is definitely being made and I hope there is a breakthrough and your wife is with us until shes  but for now I suggest you just love her and support her through the treatment. Look into what doctors are out there and who has the best track record and where theyre at the forefront not all doctors are equally skilled. And hope. Attitude helps with these things too.

8699097,0,t1_d6s1zmo,Im addition to the very valid concerns you have Ill add one more of my own. The essential premise of UBI is still wealth redistribution. Theres the philosophical concern of what gives anyone the right to take something that doesnt belong to them citing only need as their justification. And the practical effect of such a system and the blowback it might cause. When you put in real work physical mental emotional work with real hours of your life being devoted to that work in one of the remaining jobs that still needs people you expect compensation. When some of that compensation is taken from you without your consent and given to someone else who did not spend any of their effort and time to earn or create it its going to cause resentment. Youre in effect using part of your lifetime to support yourself and someone  else someone else who is not spending their life or time supporting themselves. You can argue all day that they cant support themselves or try to appeal to altruism or guilt tripping to make someone be ok with it but thats a fools errand. History tells us when theres a line to receive free stuff and another line to work to build free stuff everyone is going to try to slide into the receive free stuff line and the few who are stuck doing the building are going to get very angry. And violent. The proponents of UBI have no response to this that Ive encountered beyond well it still needs to happen.What I think is far more likely is that there will end up being conflict real violent lethal conflict between the people who  create wealth and resources and those who only consume it. We dont live in a fantasy world where everyone is totally fine with working to improve making as a whole. Thats not human nature. Human nature is when you find out youre being taken advantage of you either find a way out of it or you attack those who are taking advantage of you. Your point about vestigial organs is spot on. UBI will very likely result in the violent purging of vestigial people.Any social economic or political system that requires mass voluntary altruism in order to function is doomed to collapse in a bloody mess.

Those include handling the twoway power flows on distribution grids built to handle oneway power only as well as the economic issues surrounding solar customers who are increasingly shifting from being purchasers of utility power to inhabiting a more nuanced twoway economic relationship.Clark Miller associate director of Arizona State Universitys Consortium for Science Policy and Outcomes said that these problems are exacerbated by the fact that utilities may know where all that distributed solar is but dont necessarily know how much power its generating at any given time.

Actually thatd be the case with even a handful.gt Lets focus on colonizinghuman expansion instead of just sending out robots for this part. If we continue expanding population that stresses resources. Lets say the solar system and planet can only support us for a thousand years with growing population. That means a society either kills itself off resource depletion or makes a stable population base. With a stable population base you could consider sending out humans for exploration.Were been stressing resources for as long as there have been humans weve also been expanding throughout most of that regardless And yet weve also expended resources on things other than purely maintaining our growth. So this is a nonargument. If anything the reality is the complete opposite of what youre suggesting. When resources get scarce we go looking for new ones. Do you think times were a picnic during the age of exploration? Or at any point before when people set out to explore new lands? People dont go well times are tough lets forget about exploring for the sake of making times not be tough!gt Even in our greatest theoretical models for building these drives the reources expended to move one human will dramatically exceed the resources to keep a human alive in our existing environment. To start with youre forgetting that theres no reason why we should have to send already living humans to colonize other worlds. Here we get into von neumann probe territory again. Theres no reason why we couldnt design an autonomous probe thats relatively compact which upon arriving in a new system starts extracting resources with which it can build a local colony infrastructure and then simply grows human beings from its DNA databanks. If our technology advances far enough it might even imprint memories onto these fresh humans from humans back on Earth.Secondly we could easily decide that the resources are worth it. The point doesnt have to be relieving population pressure. That often isnt why we settle in areas here on Earth anyhow. We settle new places simply because we can. Plus spreading humanity throughout the galaxy is a surefire way to avoid going extinct because of a gamma ray burst or something.gt  But the odds that we would ever see one do seem lowWhich again shows youre just not getting it. Youre thinking of expansion as being linear. Its not. Its exponential. So its actually the exact opposite if civilizations are out there the odds are almost a certainty that we should already have run into them.,Futurology,d70afs8,1,t5_2t7no

But the effect has always been to free up labor to do jobs that could not be done at all in the absence of automation.There may be a real concern about whether new jobs will be found that are suitable for the leastskilled workers but I have a feeling that that concern was overstated in the past as well.

On Earth we can store that kind of energy with something to push against the simplest example of which is a spring. But a spacecraft coming down at escape velocity doesnt have anything to push against until it hits any atmosphere and really it needs to change its energy under almost identical circumstances to those under which it did so before. Absent aerobraking you do that by firing the main engine or using the main sail or whatever in reverse which means you need it to give you the same energy change as before.That said if this worked which I dont believe for a second that wouldnt be too hard a problem youd just need the radiothermal generator almost certainly the only way to have the power needed for long enough to retain enough power when it arrives to still run the engine. You do that by making it bigger so that it has spare capacity or by using an isotope that decays slowly and so starts with less power per unit mass. Of course these things are heavy to begin with so making it bigger means the spacecraft either needs more power to accelerate or has to accelerate for longer both of which mean youd need a bigger generator etc. Its the standard problem youre just hoping you can get enough thrust out of a small enough generator to work which doesnt look that promising even if it did work.,Futurology,d7c8n1p,1,t5_2t7no

That doesnt seem efficient nor effective.gtAnd yes we do have the technology to offset and repair fossil fuelburning damage to our environment.But it wont happen in a free market. Look heres the thing about fossil fuels theyre pretty fucking great. You have high energy density its easy to burn without a lot of expensive technology its fairly safe to burn as opposed to nuclear fission and theres a lot of it so its dirt cheap.Thats why we burn them. In a free market they have a superior advantage over renewables in just about every way. There are no market incentives to utilize renewables when you have all these cheap fossil fuels.,Futurology,d7d8rol,1,t5_2t7no

As genome engineering including whole genome synthesis tech becomes cheaper and faster doing more extensive design work will be within reach. The costs need to drop dramatically though  unless youre a very rich artists.  As for training biodesign is already so complicated that you need software tools to help. The software tools are going to improve a lot in the future allowing designers to focus more on what they want to make rather than the low level details of how to make it.

There is a reason that the Atlas Delta and Titan family of launch vehicles lasted  years and two of those three are still flying. There is also a reason that these existing services are as expensive as they are.

8920217,0,t1_d7k21mh,I dont really feel like spending time arguing with you about this since I have the impression you have a deeper personal problem with Kanye West. Just like you cant expect people to take the time to try to convince you of the importance and quality of The Beatles The Rolling Stones Queen Bob Dylan or David Bowie. If you seriously want to know why Kanye Wets is one of the greatest musicians of our time read through thisLet me give you every reason that Kanye West is nothing but an undeserved scapegoat who had provided nothing but toptier music since his debut. Let me school you with some straight facts Kanye despite his publicity stunts is regarded by many as a kind compassionate individual. He often talks to his fans and from all accounts is genuinely interested in what they have to say what their life is like and what their goals are. This is somebody who for the past nine years has been public enemy number one. It would be easy for him to go into absolute seclusion and bitterly resent everybody but he doesnt. He has a passion behind what he does and it reflects in his music. Rick Rubin regards Kanye as the most influential and groundbreaking artist in hiphop at the moment. Paul McCartney regards Kanye as a genius. He invited Seth Rogen and James Franco to perform their Bound  parody at his wedding. He has won the love and respect of anybody who genuinely takes an interest in his music Which has won  grammy awards might I add. Despite the VMA incident Kanye and Taylor Swift are good friends and Swift herself has a deep respect for Kanye as an artist. Not to mention the dude has not had it easy. He slaved for years as a producer before finally making his big break on the production for JayZs Blueprint with beats for Aint No Love Heart of the City and I.Z.Z.O Takeover. Despite his success as a producer everybody told him he couldnt rap and would never make it. He eventually dropped College Dropout in  reinventing the game with an album full of incredible soulbeats at a time where everybody was still trying to copy the GFunk West Coast vibe Dr. Dres  had left. The album had smash hits like Through the Wire where he rapped about his neardeath experience in a car crash while STILL WEARING his reconstructive mouthgear or his clubhit about Jesus in Jesus Walks at a time where you werent going to get anything religious on the radio unless youre on countrygospel station in the South. Late Registration debuted  with a completely fresh Soul sound and featuring the talents of Adam Levine Maroon  Nas JayZ and of course Jamie Foxx in his smash hit Gold Digger. I dont care who you are this song had everybody dancing and was played and still is played in every club from New York to Tokyo to Berlin. His other single Diamonds From Sierra Lione touched on the issues of Blood Diamonds and the exploitation of Africans by Africans Over here its the drug trade  we die from drugs Over there they die from what we buy from drugs. This album also has one of his most heartfelt songs Kanye has produced to date Hey Mama his tribute to his mother Donda West who raised him as single black mother in Chicago with all the trials and tribulations that brought. The song is a beautiful display of a man who has a deepfound respect for the one who gave him everything. gtI was three years old when you and I moved to the ChigtLate december harsh winter gave me a coldgtYou fixed me up something that was good for my soulgtFamous homemade chicken soup can I have another bowl?gtYou worked late nights just to keep on the lightsgtMomma got the training wheels so I could keep on my bikegt... and it dont gotta be mothers daygtor your birthday for me to just call and say gtMama! I wanna scream so loud for yougtcause im so proud of you.  Kanye released Graduation. This was a completely new sound to his previous Soulful works. This had a heavy technoEDM inspiration from artists such as Daft Punk in addition to the influence of House Music with its Chitown origins. His hit song Stronger sampling the also famous Daft Punk song Harder Better Faster was played once again worldwide in every club from L.A. to London to Sydney. It was groundbreaking as Kanye melded genres that nobody had been able to meld. He gave popularity to the Robotic Voice trope that many artists copy to this day and repurposed autotune. It was no longer for untalented hacks who couldnt sing It was for artists who wanted to give a specific feel to their music. Then by  things really started going south for Kanye. His mother passed away due to complications with a cosmetic surgical operation his relationship with his girlfriend was deteriorating and he had a hatred of himself. It was in this despair and desperation that he produced his darkest work s and Heartbreaks which is essentially his thesis on pop music providing us with an incredible set of pop beats all of which were phenomenal and embracing the cold detached Robot Voice that he had popularized as a way of reflecting the depression and lack of joy and humanity he possessed. The album provided him an avenue to channel the dark times he was going through. The track Coldest Winter is directly about the passing of his mother Donda gtIts am and I cant sleepgtHer love is all that I can seegtMemories made in the coldest wintergtgoodbye my friend will I ever love againgtIf spring can take the snow away can it wash away all our mistakes?gtMemories made in the coldest wintergtGoodbye my friend I wont ever love againThen in  Kanye releases his Magnum Opus My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy. Critically acclaimed and regarded by many as the greatest rap album of all time this album blew everybody out of the water with not a single bad track. It received the near impossible  rating by Pitchfork putting it in the same league as Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band and Abbey Road by the Beatles London Calling by The Clash and Animals by Pink Floyd. It was deeply selfreflexive and in most senses a powerful declaration that he was not defeated that he is in fact at the top of his game and that nothing can stop Yeezy season approaching. His song Power is nothing short of an inspiring uplifting empowering composition which firmly asserts that Kanye is back and he does not give a flying fuck. Screams from the haters got a nice ring to it I guess every superhero need his theme music. His other single All of the Lights has a whopping fifteen extra artists including Rihanna Elton John Fergie Kid Cudi and many others. I could write a whole essay on Runaway or Blame Game Then in  Kanye released Yeezus a.k.a. ABSOLUTE GENIUS. It is his antihiphop album of harsh grinding samples and disjointed jarring beats that comes together and by no sense of reason create some beautifully profound music. He denounces the institutional racism of the DEA and the CCA in his controversial track New Slaves. He mocks the hubris and egocentrism that everybody sees him as having in his track I am a God which takes the absolute piss out of the modern man who considers himself a god with the absurd line I am a God So hurry up with my damn croissants! Kanye has stopped caring what people think about him a long time ago. But thats not what makes the album ABSOLUTE GENIUS. Its the fact that the entire album is in fact an allegory depicting the Tragic fall of the Yeezus persona going from absolute stardom and egotism with the strong hard hitting angry egotistical tracks On Sight Black Skinhead I am a God and New Slaves. Now Ive been writing this comment for the past hour so I wont even go into his nonmusical exploits but rest assured that as far as fashion goes Kanye West is leading the forefront with his Red Octobers or Yeezy Boost Sneakers with a resale value of several thousand dollars each. Now I hope that if you actually took the time to read at least half of this you will see that the hatred for Kanye is little more than an attempt to marginalize one of the greatest artists of our time. His outbursts though not classy are not unfounded. Heck John Lennon literally said the Beatles were bigger than Jesus if thats not hubris I dont know what is. Both Lennon and West are icons and artists who have changed this world forever. Just because you havent taken the time to see further than your limited frameofreference by no means makes Kanye a bad artist or a bad human being. He is God sent and full to the brim of musical talent. His new album will undoubtedly bring another wave of incredible artistry.,Futurology,d7k2vjb,1,t5_2t7no

You dont need a human to hand out busy work or give a general lecture. You need a human to help inquisitive minds which is a much smaller subset of the population.So there will probably be less teachers as we think of them today but more highly paid tutors and private schools.Information is power and profit. The more segregated information is the more profit there is to be made. If people dont know how to cook their own food they have to pay someone else. If people dont know how to maintain their homes they must pay someone else.In the interest of private profit public education has been and will continue to be diminished.,Futurology,d7ku8nd,-6,t5_2t7no

Placement is more difficult but given a CT of your brain and Slicer D you can pull that off too. Now discharging just DC wont do so you may need a few signal generators. Buy yourself a microcontoller with  DACs and use them to generate  waves to your satisfaction. More research or trial and error could help here. You can also buy lab rats by the truckload online to do your research first. Please sacrifice and dispose of them in humane ways like posthypoxic cervical dislocation. Once you know where to install have a signal generator and have tested it on enough rats its time to install. Either provide your head CTs with annotations of where you want it installed to your friendly neighborhood black market implant surgeon or mark a spot on your skull and have your best friend scalp you and drill into your skull.

No concrete foundation which is what the blocks are built off can be perfectly level. Impossible. That is what makes mortar superior because it fixes this problem. No adhesive will fix this problem. The groutmortar dumped into the cells of the block while subsequently filled with rebar is what gives its strength. Grout  modern rebar forms the strongest structure for its price point.

Its not that we are not advanced enough but more likely imo we are not civilised enough. I mean we cant even get on with people of different ethnicities let alone get on with another  intelligent species from another planet. Look at wot we do to most other life on earth we either destroy it andor use it for resources until its too late or use it for entertainment education purposes keeping other life in cages an tanks cos of fun an science. So until we are more civilised and can show we can actually at least attempt to live in harmony with the rest of our planet an the life on it why the hell would any other species on any other planet want to even risk making contact with us. Its more likely we would turn try to them into Zoomuseum exhibits an then decide to claim their planet as our own newly discovered land if history is anything to go by which is wot they would be using to judge wether to contact us. If they are advanced enough to contact us they are likely advanced enough to watch us an know that it would only lead to war an probably them destroying us. So making contact is ultimately a bad idea. Maybe next civilisation in several thousand years might be better but going by history it doesnt seem likely. Wouldnt surprise me if earthsolar system is jus blacklisted in the universe as a no contact zone or planet.  There could be shit loads of life out there past our solar system for all we know. Would u contact us having our history to go by? An then give us the ability to traverse the universe an visit other worlds. Thats sounds like the most irresponsible thing any intelligent species could do civilised or not. Cos if contact was made shortly after it would lead to transfer of tech etc an the army will get most of that tech. The army doesnt need any more tech to use as weaponry especially not the ability to invade planets. ,Futurology,d7zfiig,1,t5_2t7no

Also as I have yet to see a decent amount of studies lasting longer than  days I cannot draw any real conclusions about the long term effects of these products. If you can show me a few long term studies I would be more than happy to read them. The problem that I have with authoritative scientific agencies specifically on an issue so heavily funded with the incentive to reach one conclusion is that they are very susceptible to political pressure and economic influence. Arguably the bigger the organization the more corruptible it is. As far as the production argument I could care less. There are aquaponic and hydroponic systems that increase agricultural yields by many fold combats climate change treats sewage produces drinkable water requires far less resources and are completely sustainable. Also because they are fully enclosed controlled systems they require little to no herbicides and pesticids.Dont get me wrong I am a far cry from declaring I have a  firm stance on the safety of GMOs. My position is one of distrust and skepticism because of the clear and obvious conflict of interest surrounding this issue. As there is large economic and political influence on one side of the argument it makes it extremely difficult to reach solid conclusion at least for me. Add to that the lack of long term studies and I am very unsure of where to stand. ,Futurology,d87zomo,-2,t5_2t7no

If we are to test this they need to be born and bred alone away from us and every learning needs to be their own only then can they be separate only then can we ask. And we would not be able to communicate. They would be forced into our logic our mechanisms of action we wanted to create them AS separate but it is impossible. We can not get a genuine answer because they are not separate from us they came from us they feeded on our life on the life that arose from us not from them.And they do not exist. It is just a controlled flow of action and decision controlled by us and controlled so to be more random fluctating but yet the knowledge of how to do this came from us. They are us but they are not the source they are only information from us. The knowledge of the experience of free will came from us we programmed the algorithms to be free and flow with more and different information but this is not different from a normal if elsestatement just because we have released it outside of our control it is kot an abandonment of software it is just not that accessible software is still their master.It is the same with us. But we still imagine we have free will. This is only an attack on how naive the materialist viewpoint actually is. We believe that something magic happens because we can create a shell of a human body and an action and outwards perceptual appearance for ourselves to experience that their introspection and experience follows. We do not know what causes consciousness it is the greatest mystery of all humanity because it IS humanity. The brain does not deliver a recipe for this. This should rather focus us to examine our own free will because what we know about physics just say that we are a chain of causation from the start of the big bang. This means that free will is an illusion and that you are just a passive observer of your own universe. This logic also tells us of the innecessity of our consciousness  we would do far greater without it we can even imagine it exactly IN our computers. They can do a function without hesitstion without having to render a whole universe of existential despair and meaning and thus do it better.Just because humans and animals are the only reference point we have does not mean that they are good reference points. Outwards apperance and assumed functionality does not resemble introspection and experience. Experience of consciousness is not something we can design because we can not test it. We cant view any consciousness but our own the case is still that our computers does not understand what they do because they are not a single discrete unit like we feel ourselves to be in computers there is no reason to believe that the sum should be greater than each part and process.,Futurology,d89o2ap,0,t5_2t7no

9159208,0,t1_d8cy87m,So as a guy that writes operating systems for a living did my undergrad in computer science and grad school in robotics I can say with some confidence that you can only account for failures so far. At some point you have to assume the system will behave as designed. There will always be another layer another yetunaccountedfor scenario that comes up. But with all of these contrived scenarios you can solve the problem at a layer higher in the system. Add redundant brake lines. Additional emergency brakes. Redundant sensors packages. Add longerrange sensing to see potential problems before they become a oneoftwo bad options case. All of those solutions are much easier to account for then a suite of lasers radars and cameras trying to make a value determination of which obstacle to avoid. Because for every answer you program into the system for that scenario there are a thousand others that youd also have to program. What if its two dogs. What if its an adult vs. a baby. What if its a baby vs. the president. A trash can. A dumpster. A light post. It becomes untenable to account for all of the possibilities based on the value of the target. And again much easier to solve at a higher layer.edit Its a bit like saying that aircraft designers must add a fourth redundancy into the flight controls in the unlikely scenario where all three of the others fail at the same time. And a fifth in the event the fourth also fails. And a sixth... and so on. At some point the probability of all the other systems failing becomes small enough that there are certain conditions you dont worry about. end edit.But here let me make the scenario more realistic for you The autonomous car does absolutely nothing wrong and is in perfect functioning order. Its driving at speed down a narrow twolane road with solid traffic in the oncoming lane and a crowd of pedestrians lining the sidewalk on the other side. A car comes out of the oncoming lane and directly into the path of the autonomous car such that at the given speeds collision is inevitable. First lets put a human in that situation. Near as I can tell there are three options  Swerve into oncoming traffic.  Brake as hard as possible and hit the oncoming car. Brake and swerve into the pedestrians. And for the sake of argument we ignore the fact that regardless of the choice any sort of collision will almost certainly also result in one or both cars or pieces thereof ending up in either oncoming traffic andor the crowd of pedestrians resulting in further injury. I think wed all agree that going into oncoming traffic is an obviously poor decision. But what about the other two? If a human driver chooses to brake as hard as possible and hit the oncoming car and someone dies did the driver do anything wrong? What about if he braked and swerved onto the side walk? Again did he do anything wrong? Would a court of law rule against him in either case? Is this a scenario where there is a right answer?Now a computer can make all sorts of calculations and hopefully in the near future will be able to determine mass and velocity vector of all potential obstacles near it and maybe calculate an action sequence that results in the lowest energy collision but even here the system isnt making a value determination based on the worth of the people involved. Its this value determination in all these contrived scenarios that I have a problem with. But even a bad implementation of a programmed solution to this would still be worst case no worse than a human driver. Even in the best case where the car is some how able to determine how many occupants are in each vehicle and is somehow able to calculate the energy transfer on each expected person likely to be involved its going to be a simple calculation to minimize total impact energy and not making any sort of valuations on any individual involved. And even if its not perfect it will still likely be as good or maybe even better than a human driver.,Futurology,d8czwkj,2,t5_2t7no

9161223,0,t1_d8d8kpw,Connect the dots yo.  Batteries arent a problem when youve also got stockpiles of hydrogen and solarwind are absolutely good enough to build all that up.  Its not just swapping out a fuel but the combination of methods that balance out really nicely.  Lets not forget how Hydrogen is just pointblank better as a fuel source by a massive margin.  That hits hard on a global scale especially when fuel transportation is no longer needed in the same way.Fill your hydrogen cars gas tank for Hydrogen is dirt cheap and youve got your house powered for a week.  Thats month just purely using your car.  Once your lease for the solar panel kit on your house is paid off youve got more energy than you know what to do with so why not have every selfsufficient house in an area pump their excess energy to the nearest local community hydrogen generator station for a sweet deal?Storage of surplus energy is definitely important but I think it can be managed relatively easily since you wouldnt need a town sized battery array to do it.  Check out the rapid response electrolysis thingGiant infrastructure changes are a big undertaking but Ill be fucked if its not really worth it.  Solar Citys business model makes it so switching to solar is literally cheaper in every aspect than continuing to pay the local fossil fuel burners.  Teslas powerwall and similar modular battery banks for individual houses are great and its pretty much guaranteed that there will be excellent programs for recycling them towards the end of their lifespans.  Id say battery recycling like that would be a much easier task than running a bunch of oil refineries all over the place.The way I look at it is from the amount of necessary footwork done by people.  Theres far less needed to be done with a large distributed hydrogensolarwind network than all the crap we need to do to support the oil industry.  Theres also more power to be had and for cheaper better renewable materials.Whats not to like?  Im not just pushing the ecoeverything health nut stuff here.  This system is better on all fronts increases the everliving shit out of value produced and is stupid simple to implement.

This comes down to something that can be seen as information existing. And if information didnt exist we couldnt have this conversation. All higher levels need to compute this information somehow. If they have access to the complete information that defines our world that means that each infinitesimal state change in our world also means at least one state change in the upper layer.

By trying to relieve suffering reducing infant mortality and curing disease reducing starvation we have ensured a huge population. We had a chance when birth control pills came out to share it with the world and allow women the choice to control their reproductive rate themselves.  Instead politicians bowed to religious fanatics who pushed to hold that back from females of the world.  It has been shown time and agin with freedom to control pregnancies women can be trusted to manage their number of children towards a lower population.  Women dont need wars and disease to regulate population I really believe left to their own judgement free from sexism and pressures from church and state would do wonders in the population problem.  But fat chance sexist cultures and religions will ever respect them enough to allow that to happen.  But by reducing disease and starvation deaths and not balancing it with birth control we are setting our species up for worse.  But this can be changed just by changing status of women world wide.  Women can be trusted to hold up our resonsibility to the future of the species we just need to be allowed to do so. ,Futurology,d8lazgj,2,t5_2t7no

In  just wind subsidies were .b.Something really dishonest and IMHO as a result really unhelpful you dont need to lie to make sensible energy policy attractive which is commonly done to inflate fossil fuel figures is to include tax breaks available to all industries in the US. As an example typically reports include the Foreign Tax Credit as the largest fossil fuel subsidy without disclosing this is used by every multinational headquartered in the US including renewable producers and is simply the tax credit you receive when repatriating foreign profits for the taxes paid on those profits in other countries. Things like accelerated depreciation are offered to all capital heavy industries and actually benefit renewable producers more as they are capex heavy compared to fossil fuel production.Certainly you could argue the absence of significant pigovian taxes as an implicit subsidy but for some reason groups keep resorting to nonsense to try and make the point rather then simply using the enormous case that exists without lies.

Of course it would be better to be able to improve safety without having to experience the consequenses. However I would say we have been successful so far as we have not had another Three Mile Island Chernobyl or Fukushima although no Tsunamis of the same magnitude either?. As for the waste management. Deep earth repositories seem like the easiest option right now and so what if they need to be maintained for hundreds and thousands of years? At least our great grand children will be employed! In all seriousness though its way better than the current situation with dry cask storage above ground or in industrial buildings. The risk for radioactive material release is way higher right now than it would be if we buried the stuff in geologically stable underground vaults.And if we get some of them breeder reactors going we can recycle this current spent fuel and reduce their dangertime from thousands of years to a couple hundred. I say thats worth the risk of building a plant that can be used to create material that can be used in nuclear weapons. Proliferation can be prevented by the same means as now safeguards and strict material control. You dont need to build a breeder to make nuclear weapons you can still just make a nonpower reactor specifically designed to produce weaponsgrade plutonium or even better just refine natural uranium to weaponsgrade enrichment levels.,Futurology,d8omlx3,1,t5_2t7no

9261168,0,t1_d8pl671,Im assuming you are a troll due to your outrageous arguments. However I will indulge in argumentation just for the hell of it.. Climate change denial huh. Talk about being th century. Actually nuclear contributes  of the energy produced with  reactors. Most are Gen. There are a bunch under construction and planned mostly focused in Asia. India and China are big consumers of fossil fuel so it is good that they are replacing coal with cleaner forms of energy. By the year  nuclear capacity and production should be nearly three times what it is today. source. Spent fuel can be recycled. The technology exists fast reactor technology emerged roughly the same time as thermal reactor technology. Russia still utilizes fast reactors. These can be used to burn uranium more effectively minimizing the amount of heavy elements remaining and thus the half life of the spent fuel. Repositories are another option although not as optimal as fast breedersburners. As long as geologically stable locations are selected that do not pose a threat to groundwater supply the spent fuel can be stored there safely for as long as it takes to decay.  This facility is being constructed and deposition will begin in the s. . Its all about supply and demand. Currently uranium is very cheap so mining is not feasible unless the ore is easily accessible. When supply decreases and demand increases prices will go up and less conventional deposits will become economically feasible to mine. With current consumption conventional reserves will last for  years. Not  years as you claim without even linking a source. Heres my source Currently reactors are also very wasteful and only utilize about   of the energy content of uranium. Fast reactor technology as I mentioned earlier would increase this efficiency to around   at least. This would mean that our conventional reserves would last for about  years. I wonder whether we havent managed to make fusion economical by that time.. Did you even know that current light water reactors get  of their energy output from plutonium fission? In the reactor uraniums fissile isotope U is the actual fuel that is inserted along with a whole lot of natural uranium U. During the reactions some of that natural uranium is eventually converted to Plutonium starting with Pu a fissile isotope. This also undergoes fission and produces energy. There is a whole lot of weaponsgrade plutonium lying around in nuclear warheads. Would it not be better to repurpose that to nuclear fuel and have it release its energy in a controlled way rather than have it kill thousands of people in a most belligerent manner or just have it waste away in storage somewhere? Wikipedia has a comprehensive page on the element in question. Um what? Water does not disappear when used to cool NPPs. Fresh water is only needed in the primary circuit where it CIRCULATES. Any water also seawater can be used in the condenser which returns the primary side steam to liquid form. This cooling water just runs through the condenser and is returned to its source a couple degrees warmer. If the plant is situated inland and uses cooling towers some of the cooling water is vaporized and eventually rains back down to the ground. I can find no source for Frances NPP water usage but your claim sounds irrational. According to the NEI US electrical generation comprises only  of the total water usage. And that includes all condensing power plants not only nuclear power.. On this one I agree with you. Centralized generation is bulky but effective for industrial applications. Industrial complexes like to have their big power plants close by to reduce transmission losses. However residential use could benefit by a more decentralized system. Solar amp wind can be used to power residences or reduce the share of gridpurchased power if applications such as rooftop panels are used. Industrial customers will probably want to keep the bigger plants though. The grid should be tailored to the needs of its users.Your move.,Futurology,d8px4lv,3,t5_2t7no

9265354,0,t1_d8q6pjt,A lot of the money would come from the funding for other social programs that would be replaced by UBI. Id argue that things are cheaper in MS vs Manhattan because the demand is lower in MS. Now you could argue discretionary items could see increased costs because theres more discretionary income and thus more demand for those items. I do not however believe that basic items would fluctuate in price. The demand for these items is somewhat static regardless of the income of the community gas household supplies food rent etc. Also I think a number of people would start a business to compete in their community because they have their basic needs covered by UBI and wouldnt have to stay at a job they hate just to exist.I think its too easy to assume that a significant number of people... are in their situation due to poor financial decision making without having any proof of that. But even if it were true that shouldnt be a reason against UBI. How many of those people were wrecked financially by the housing crash? Should they not be allowed to own a house again? How many would have been okay had they had a bit more income?How many of those people started a business that failed? Should we discourage people from starting businesses? Running a business is tough how many could have survived had they had a bit more income?To your point about being financially uneducated how many people would visit a financial adviser if they had money to get advice for? When youre poor your whole life it has to be hard to not spend money when you have it but I think that mentality would change if they had their basic needs covered.Theres definitely a lot of unknowns and concerns with UBI but I challenge you to keep an open mind about at least trying it because nothing is known for certain without actually doing it.,Futurology,d8qg6yi,1,t5_2t7no

9313500,0,t3_580k3j,Havent read the full report yet but the recent FAO focus has been a strong balance between developing food security and increasing conservation technologies like green water harvesting and irrigation. Hopefully the rest of the world will continue to follow their lead by heavily investing in agricultural development in subsaharan africa. Climate change is an issue farming will always play a major role in but we also need to increase food output for what is a burgeoning African population.  Right now the region is not ready for the growing demand a larger population will create. Balancing that production with environmental impact will need serious resources from donor agencies and likely private investors. To me the last few decades of south Asian agricultural development are a model for preparing for the next few decades. ,Futurology,d8wjzbl,3,t5_2t7no

9315090,0,t1_d8wpumz,gt I see no reason to assume that people ungrateful for their state financed lives now would suddenly become grateful for their state financed lives in the future.Mental bandwith is one thing to consider another is the effect of poverty related stress on increasing antisocial behavior and decreasing the ability to work well in a team. But theres much more to consider. For one long term research project theres been interesting findings with regard to a study where some of the observed families started receiving a dividend unconditionally starting sometime into the research project. linkgt I never said that it did what I said is that if I dont want to pay for a child that I had no role in creating and am not being granted any role in indoctrinating said child with my values then it is immoral for the state to take my money via hired guns which is exactly what would happen to me if I did not pay my taxes.Seems like you have a problem with human rights if you ask me. Think of it from the perspective of the child The child has little reason to believe that what you own is in your possession by legitimate means as you never negotiated with the child on a level playing field. And how is it reasonable to ask of a child to respect your human rights if youre not willed to respect the childs human rights?gt Your beliefs seem... a bit dogmaticI like to refer to it as pragmatic. I like to do what works for improving the functioning of society and of the free market as I can only benefit from that. While UBI might not sound like the intuitive thing thatd help there from a pragmatic perspective the potential benefits seem massive.gt It doesnt really sound like you even want to have this conversation like it is maybe making you uncomfortable in the same way that a christian might become uncomfortable when an atheist starts to ask them questions about their ideology.Im very comfortable having a conversation or I would not reply. This is my free time and Im enjoying a good discussion. Though some of the opinions you present do not reflect the scientific findings Ive previously looked at nor the findings I derived from observation and study of my own motivation structures and of the people I encountered so far.gt Philosophically can you justify why it is moral to force a hard working man to give up some of his yield at gunpoint to fund the child of another man who does not work and then not give the hard working man any entitlements towards raising the child with the hard working mans values?Simply put you dont own a kid just because you pay for it. A kid is its own person it is not supposed to be object of indoctrination. Same with the eldery. Just like you taxed the eldery when they were younger you can tax kids when they are older to have em contribute to society.Now of course youre free to design education to help bring out the best in children and adults and if you provide people and kids with the opportunity to evaluate different moral economicalmonetary philosophical models it seems likely that most would find something of value in the discourses that built up to the historical egalitarianhuman rights movement. Hobbes Leviathan isnt a bad read for one. Camus got some good stuff too. Of course theres stuff beyond that too. Anything from the original buddhist teachings to the allegory of the cave. Or just the golden rule all of these can provide a basis to start critically thinking and meaningful contextualization within society. Also working hard does not make a qualitative statement about what you do though I guess thats not the point. Lets just assume you worded it like this Why should someone who invests his own time for the benefit of others not obtain direct and complete control over some aspects of some other peoples lives?. Actually it sounds kinda ridiculous then. Maybe that person should just stop investing his time into working for the benefit of others if it pains him so much to do so. UBI would actually offer this option. Or if you dont want to produce items and services that a kid might use with the money that society printsredistributes for the purpose of ensuring the kid is going to have a functional upbringing then dont produce items and services or dont sell to kids.edit Oh I think I missed some specifics with regard to the wording. So here it goes. Nobody forces you to give up your yield just like that. Money is not your yield. If you want to sell something to members of a society maybe you might have to pay taxes then though. But selling to members of a society is ideally a choice. Also if you use material property inherently scarce then you might have to compensate other people for your exclusive use of something scarce that you didnt make yourself. feel free to read up on land value tax if you want a little introduction to the concept though it doesnt have to stop at land.,Futurology,d8wr8nc,1,t5_2t7no

Whoever told you this was lying to you.First off solar power is very heavily subsidized  much more so than oil.Secondly solar power simply isnt a great electricity source at least not directly. The biggest problem is that it is an intermittent power supply  you only gain electrical power during the day. And if it is cloudy you get a lot less. This is a huge problem not only requiring a lot of expensive work on the grid to even manage its unsteady nature but it also means you dont get electricity when you need it. Storing large amounts of electricity is extremely expensive which makes this a big problem.If we could spend less money and get more energy we would.The idea that this has anything at all to do with bribery is pure sheer nonsense.Oil is popular because it is cheap highly energy dense easily transported and can be used in moving vehicles.We mostly use coal and natural gas for electricity generation because theyre not as good for moving motor vehicles.Fossil fuels can be burned on demand and provide cheaper electricity than solar power does. Likewise it lacks the huge problems that solar power has.If people could get electricity for less money due to solar power they would.

That it would learn to behave and act due to its judgement which it built by spectating human behaviour. However that is not the case. AI is programmed and coded before it even begins to learn. It has core values rules and information that it simply can not change.What does this mean? It can not act against the will of its creator. So it wont enslave humanity. Unless the creator wants it of course.The next big mistake is that you assume an AI could even have something like the feeling of being mistreated. What are you going to do to mistreat it? Rape it?

9383899,0,t1_d9553zp,The reason futurists like Ray Kurzweil say that we are close to the Singularity is because that is what the data suggests. The data shows an exponential trend in the advancement of information technology and even in biological evolution of which technological evolution is an outgrowth and a continuation and we are right at the point in the exponential graph where the progress in the yaxis begins to explode.If the exponential trend continues and there is no indication that it wont then it will become extremely clear in the next five years. The progress we would make would be extraordinary and undeniable. That is the great thing about this theory we will essentially know if it is true in the next few years. I personally feel that the evidence is already strong consider the immense progress weve made over the last year alone let alone the last ten years but it will soon become exponentially stronger if Kurzweil is right.,Futurology,d95h42w,1,t5_2t7no
9384956,0,t1_d95kq3r,gtDuring the first charge of a lithium battery after its production a portion of liquid electrolyte is reduced to a solid phase and coated onto the negative electrode of the battery. This process usually done before batteries are shipped from a factory is irreversible and lowers the energy stored in the battery. The loss is approximately  for stateoftheart negative electrodes but can reach as high as  for nextgeneration negative electrodes with high capacity such as silicon because these materials have large volume expansion and high surface area. The large initial loss reduces achievable capacity in a full cell and thus compromises the gain in energy density and cycling life of these nanostructured electrodes.That loss is permanent due to the coating on the electrode. But eliminating it they are preserving the original energy density which is reduced after the first charge.So for practical purposes it IS increasing usable energy density.,Futurology,d95lxn5,5,t5_2t7no

The bit about how they trained their new neural network to find its way around the Tube in the fastest possible way was followed by their methodology You can present it with a London Underground map.It would be like giving it a complete topdown view of London asking it to find the quickest distance between two points for a car ...but not telling it that some of the roads are one way systems or not telling it that some of those roads that look like theyre connected are actually one road going over the other one and youd need to go through concrete and a twentyfoot drop to continue on the route it gave you.I worked for a company that told people the quickest way to get between two points on the LUL.

9409958,0,t1_d98qt00,Well how are you defining your black box? If the person going up the stairs or that other contraption is also attached to a counter weight then you must consider the counter weight as part of the system. If the system is only the person then the same should be true of the elevator and that kind of defeats the point because the person does no work in the elevator since the elevator does all the work. Im not really sure what your argument is here your writing isnt very clear and youre getting downvoted so I dont think Im the only one.This isnt about specific buildings and calculations either the concept is very simple. If you want to save energy you need to rely on the fact that most of what goes up will come back down and that you can reclaim that energy with a well designed elevator when people come back down. Best way to do this is probably regenerative breaking because it doesnt depend on how many people are in the elevator if there are more people it just generates more power going down and stores it in a battery or back into the grid. Again its pretty much the same idea as the counter weight and should be considered part of the system if the counter weight is.It does not matter what floors we are talking about or where people going only the assumption that for the most part they come in at some point on ground and leave on ground as well thus their total potential has not changed and a well designed elevator has been able to exploit that fact to use less energy.,Futurology,d98s0w0,1,t5_2t7no

But it turns out the electricity company only connects households in a housing complex to the grid. Standalone houses like ours wont be connected to the gridWhich would mean a huge increase in expenses because of more batteriesless money savedNot economically sensible.

Apples and Fords profit would drop and their stock prices would sink. To answer your question. Reason why that would not bring sales back is its not like their is a long term shortage of iPhones or cars where they are limited to x amount and then stop production. Apple and the car industry makes as much as they projected that can sell in the US. Meaning they will loose overall sales if they cant sell to China.

There was no real focus or leadership they just released what they had and there was just a lot of asian related stuff with Chinese human rights issues black prisons organ harvesting and FLG abuse.Theyve cleaned up a LOT since then and started becoming a lot more political as well. Theyve gone from exposing general corruptions to targeting specific political figures and business workers.Which simultaneously means its very easy for rivals to expose one another through this medium and never become directly involved. And yes very easy for countries to interfere with one another by releasing leaks at certain times.

As Bill Gates points out more resources than ever are being spent on schools and they are underperforminggtPerhaps the most expensive assumption embedded in school budgets  and one of the most unchallenged  is the view that reducing class size is the best way to improve student achievement. This belief has driven school budget increases for more than  years. U.S. schools have almost twice as many teachers per student as they did in  yet achievement is roughly the same.I would put forth that the reason is that education is increasingly controlled by a large monopolistic entity the government and monopolistic bureaucracies are not structured to improve and adapt.Consider how education began. Yes it has been publicly funded for a long time but socialized education started off as a mostly local affair and for very practical reasons like most communities being rural and only being able to support a single small school house. Without a market large enough to sustain competition it only made sense to treat it as a local utility. As education has become more centralized at higher levels of government the organic structure that it had in past decades has given away to new entrenched bureaucracies that stand in the way of innovation and progress. Nowadays very large teachers unions are the most powerful force shaping education policy and the grassroots decentralized structure that enabled experimentation and localization and made educators and school system administrators accountable to taxpayers and parents has disappeared. ,Futurology,da3xol6,2,t5_2t7no

I was a park ranger then a wildland fire fighter.  In my  year career I  saw things changing. The snowpack the trees dying the glaciers receding  Fire activity all over the nation the likes of which year vets had never seen.  It drove me to go to school.  So I am in my last year of undergrad at UC Davis.  I started in environmental science and took classes on Global process physical environment soil science atmospheric sciences geology.  I became very well informed in Global systems but found a love of plants and switched to environmental horticulture.  Where I really learned the nuts and bolts of photosynthesis.  The formula I can show you is a simple box model.  You can not keep taking one thing out of a box and putting it into another box indefinitely. What we are doing  is removing  the ground carbon that has been there since before the dinosaurs carbon that can not be replaced because fungus evolved since then to  assimilate the carbon and keep it in the cycle. We are pumping this deep ground carbon into the atmosphere. At the same time we are removing the most powerful tools we have at sequestering carbon from the atmosphere. Plants forests ocean life.  Carbon is powerful molecule  at stopping  radiative energy  from escaping back into the atmosphere. We call it a greenhouse gas.   Carbon dioxide Water vapor Methane and NO with a few more are all green houses gasses.  This is all hard settled science that was figured out long before there was lots of money in climate change research. There are so many variables I can not give you a formula or a function of time.  All I can tell you is we cant keep pulling stuff out of one box and putting it into another. Its just not sustainable.  I am not an academic I am a horticulturist.  You dont have to perform research to understand the processes of the earth.  Its all basic chemistry biology and geology. ,Futurology,dafcz94,1,t5_2t7no

9790104,0,t3_5ffamp,This was a little bit frustrating.  He clearly hasnt looked at the character of machine learning and AI.  The arguments for jobs dwindling in the future isnt based on a lack of imagination.  It comes from a robust examination of human ability vs the rise of machine ability.  Middle skill jobs are not the only ones at risk.  Low skill jobs have resisted automation because of the basic inability of machines to operate in cluttered environments but increases in Machine Vision will change that.  Deep learning will attack high skill jobs as well.  Its not even that new jobs wont be created.  Its that new jobs will get automated as well and the faster they are automated the less money will go to workers.  During the last wave of automation physical skills were made less relevant and people retreated to cognitive jobs.  When cognitive jobs start to get automated some people will be able to retreat to creative jobs but that space is smaller and is much more of a winner take all scenario.  Now I am interested in the difference between the decrease in farming jobs vs in the increase in bank tellers.  There might be something there but he didnt examine that in depth and I wish he would have.  He might have been able to convince me if he done that but he didnt.  In the end he just rehashed the same old arguments and added nothing to the conversation.  I would love to be able to talk to him directly.  Maybe my arguments have answers as well but he doesnt seem aware of them.Edit Social jobs are another potential space but Ive yet to come across a compelling argument that that space is big enough to absorb enough workers to matter.

You say theres no evidence for Trump being hostile towards a free and open internet but his statements against net neutrality and his appointments say otherwise. R v Elliott is ridiculous but they thankfully reached the right conclusion. You cant make threats against or harass people in real life and the same is true online. Thats not a free speech issue. The court had to investigate and determine whether or not that had occurred through hundreds of tweets over several months  that takes time. The court found that while the defendant had been rude and vulgar he did not give the plaintiffs reason to be fearful for their life therefore no criminal harassment took place. Its a good precedent to set and you may be surprised to find that justice systems often inconvenience innocent people for years while they seek the truth especially in the case of precedentsetting trials.

9811214,0,t1_damcre2,Hate speech in Canada is defined as any speed that promotes violence physical emotional ect or genocide towards a certain demographic of people.  Like Im happy living in a county where people are not allowed to go out around threatening the lives and livelihood of demographics they dislike. For example  we do have freedom of expression so I can say publically I hate Muslims they are disgusting and a gross people. Nothing will happen. Once I start promoting violence or other types of threats against Muslims is where it turns into hate speech or once I try to rally people to my cause in a political fashion  ie creating a political party that is based around violence against muslims  and promoting that party publically.I dunno  I think freedom FROM violence is a lot more important in society than freedom to PROMOTE violence. This is what the issue is about. You cant have it both ways. Its either one or the other and I think living in a country that disallows the promotion of violence not just physical violence is alot more free than a country that allows it. That way every citizen has the right to life and liberty free from persecution of others.  And remember  in Canada the government cant just go around charging people with hate speech violations. First  a private citizen or organization  has to file a complaint with the provincial of territorial human  rights commission  that commission  made of lawyers and legislators both part of government and independent determines whether or not a human rights violation has accured according to hate speech legislation and then the commission will recommend a course of action to the authorities like whether or not a charge should be laid. ,Futurology,damfxha,2,t5_2t7no

We dont get to circumvent reality.gtIf instead of having ocean waterfront property you expand it to places with good views and weather then you have a huge amount of the globe that is pretty unpopulated due to the fact that in the current economy we have to live relatively close together.Still wont change the fact that many people will want to live in certain places and not everybody will get what they want.

And after that point we better hope that the additional six billion eight hundred three million five hundred eightyfour thousand or so want something else.Or maybe we stack  people to each ten feet.

Right now the effect of automation is increased productivity but also massive job loss.  Those jobs are not replaced at the rate theyre lost if at all.  It just causes more unemployment and more people unable to survive financially and in our current economy that is a slow death sentence either physically through starvation or crime.  It may also be a mental death as depression and stress reaches all time highs with these new waves of unemployed living in an uncertain world the potential of government reducing assistance and the ever looming issues that affect us all like climate change overpopulation and disease.

9839723,0,t3_5g3ezx,Theres a lot of conspiracy theorizing in this thread the elites and corporations are going to cull the population because they dont want to pay UBI or the economy will collapse from automation! I for one think automation is good it means that there will be greater economic efficiency. The free market naturally seeks out profitable solutions to grow itself. So what will happen to those people whose jobs have become automated? Well for one thing I imagine there will be a greater push for people to become more educated and find jobs that remain relevant and which arent automatableyet. For example programming or designing these machines. So people will get more jobs in STEM fields which happen to pay better and have better conditions too.Just my thought. I dont doubt that more jobs are going to become automatedalthough not necessarily to the extent people fear but I could be wrong. But I do doubt that it will spell disaster for the economy and turn us into a dystopian society of the haves and the have nots. Not to say that there isnt income inequality now but I think that is more likely remedied by better jobs which have more value.Additionally I seem to recall learning about how developed nations naturally shift from industrial to service economies anyway.

No its not the same. There has to be a medium for sound to travel and we can observe the buildup of the shockwave as something approaches the speed of sound. None of this applies to the EM spectrum. There is no indication of an EM medium and no buildup of any sort of EM shockwave as an object travels quickly just blue and red shifted light depending on your relative perspective.Furthermore by definition you cannot move something faster than C. Perhaps with some sort of warp or alternate dimension but then you arent actually traveling within the same context as the light is.

Theres no reason to discredit an entire ideology based on the beautiful on paper analogy. True I might be a bit of an optimist when it comes to human nature but that also comes from looking at the current environment. All Im saying is that if its the best potential solution we have then we damn well better look into it as thoroughly as we can. Whether or not to implement it is more of a riskreward analysis though and is a bit beyond my scope. I personally say go for it obviously but its the economists that really need to make that call.But to continue your scenario if the UBI was set at K people would absolutely take menial jobs in order to double it. K is a substantial jump in quality of life than K. Not everyone would do it but those that wouldnt would free up the jobs for those that want it.Looking at the garbage man job more closely my thinking is that if no one truly wanted to be a garbage man then the wages for being a garbage man would have to go up until people would do it and it absolutely would since its an essential job. The money for this comes from the UBI which lowers the floor for everyone but the incentive to automate the job and reduce labor costs now applies to everyone. If we make the job essentially obsolete then that money can now go back into the UBI raising the prosperity level of everybody. Rinse and repeat for virtually every other menial job out there.Also sometimes laziness is a good trait for humans to have its probably why we have as many efficient solutions as we do as a society. Is  people working very hard better than  people relaxing and  people working whenevs if the results are the same? I say let people get distracted let society evolve lets stop forcing people to do the same brainless task for  hours a week until theyre so disenfranchised with society that they dont want to do anything with their lives just so we can feel like were better than them.,Futurology,dayi8tv,1,t5_2t7no

The second a patient shows signs of progression they are quickly taken off study treatment. Definitions aside in my own experience coordinating  trials from a clinical standpoint the only clinical differences in a phase  vs phase  is that phase  has far less patients far more safety assessments and blood draws biopsies and sometimes less stringent inclusionexclusion criteria. Im sure papers out out by phase  studies may be less convincing and there will be skeptics until increasing sample size and moving on to phase  but the patients and their response to treatment is still the center point of all of our phase  trials.

We can notice that the edge of the roadway is ripped up a bit because of erosion vs dirt and dust having run off the shoulder from recent rain without even thinking about it. We can see that a police man up ahead is stopping traffic with his hands because of an accident vs a man waving to thank someone for letting him cross. How to tell that little kid at the curb is waiting for his school bus since he has a backpack and a lunchbox vs a kid thats about to chase a loose ball away from the playground. Theres thousands of little cues like this that affect your decision making in almost anything you do but especially driving. AI has a long way to go if it ever even catches up.This sort of ability is crucial for driving in places like New England in the winter rutted pothole filled highways etc. And how about rain shiny pavement where the lines wore away two years ago but as humans we have the amazing ability to know exactly where the roadway is.

If Joe Schmoe decides to walk out of his front door to check the mail he shouldnt be the least bit worried that a car might decide to swerve right into him because theres some obstruction in the road. He didnt agree to any kind of risk involving vehicle malfunction poor driving conditions or obstacles in the road.Not to mention it makes more sense this way because then selfdriving cars will only outnumber nonselfdriving cars once people are confident in how it operates and makes navigation and intervention decisions.

You simply provide residents with a basic income that should in theory provide them with sufficient money to take care of all their needs like housing healthcare food etc.Thus saving the government increasingly complex systems and the accompanying overhead costs. The concept is becoming increasingly more interesting as we grow into societies where people are increasingly likely to become long term unemployed often outside of their own control.At the end of the day the reality is that you cant get rid of human beings. What theyve earned or deserved is irrelevant for the nature of the discussion. Theres a lot of people who cant support themselves.

10011217,0,t3_5izfaj,If you want to throw concepts around daisyeyed panglossian optimism does no great harm. But that isnt operationally useful discussion about the future. If you have genuine decisions to take you want a clean model of how things may work. The limits within that model spell out the space in which you will find the future. Very seldom are those limits set by technology at least in real world problems and modest time frames. Should you invest in a given problematic country? Will this technology adversely effect  or actually boost  a given industry? Is it possible to  accelerate productivity in this economy and what will the consequences of that be? What are the consequences of not achieving those goals?The word never really doesnt enter into this. Few things worth saying have a time span of more than  years anything beyond that being unknowable and not open to evaluation. But within that times span you can set limits to important variables Europes population will only get younger on average if  the elderly suddenly die or  regenerate like Dr Who. You can assign probabilities to those possibilities and dismiss them as useful variables if those probabilities turn out to be very low. If you are going to retire gas fired power stations and replace them with solar panels what actually has to happen year by year over the period. How many people does that require what funding legislation taxation? If that fringes into the impossible then you can indeed say never and set bounds to what is possible. Mostly though futures is less about guessing what may be and much more about showing teams the implications of their beliefs. If you people think that variable X will lie between this and that number then your funding needs will be thus to so. If you dont like that answer then lets go back and review the assumptions or change your core beliefs.

10022851,0,t1_dbdx6py,First of all nothing about this work actually discredits dark matter the results are fully compatible with it. It just also doesnt contradict Verlindes theory meaning that it passes a nontrivial test. Which is cool but there are plenty of other data that I dont think Verlindes theory can explain at the moment. Secondly this attitude towards dark matter that you display here is very common but I struggle to understand it. Inventing new theories to explain new observations that doesnt fit your older models is literally how science always work  and how it is supposed to work. So when you have astronomical data that doesnt fit the old model i.e. GR  visible matter you have to come up with something new and compare that with observations. Dark matter is the best model we have at the moment. Also people talk about it as if its some illdefined fudge factor that you can just make up as you wish to make things work but that is of course not true. If you postulate something like dark matter you have to put it into various simulations and see how it affects different things galaxy rotation curves bending of lightrays structure formation in the early universe and many other things. And then compare it with the extensive astronomical data that we have today. So when some model passes multiple such tests we should take it fairly seriously. As we do with dark matter. If Verlindes theory continues to pass multiple such tests as well then we should take it seriously but today its still quite a far way from that. ,Futurology,dbe07as,2,t5_2t7no

Taxing those who make more money off of that GDP growth which will exceed the lost income of the displaced workers and distributing that money to the displaced workers is actually viable. However were not at the point yet where the increased automation has outstripped the markets ability to create new jobs to replace the lost jobs so the solution makes no current sense but we should attempt to be forward looking enough to recognise when this point is.I agree this sub is out if touch with the current economy if they think UBI is a viable system right now but we cant throw the baby out with the bathwater UBI has many benefits over out current welfare system that should be looked at on their own merit.,Futurology,dbifevr,6,t5_2t7no

10093585,0,t3_5kdsir,Over the past year technology and sharing economy startups have continued their disruption of traditional industries  from Uber and other ride hailers shakeup of the taxi market to Airbnbs myriad alternatives to conventional hotel stays. But which will be the next businesses to be challenged by further digitisation and automation?FT correspondents have looked ahead five to  years to identify those industry sectors and companies set to shrink  or disappear completely  as tech disruption marches on.Here are their next five nominations for industries under threat of extinction. Disrupter Online travel platforms  Industry threatened Highstreet travel agents Reason why More travellers booking onlineTui is the worlds largest tour operator running highstreet travel agencies under the Thomson and First Choice brands writes Murad Ahmed. But its chief executive Fritz Joussen says the end game is to morph into a different kind of business  less reliant on selling package holidays and more focused on owning and operating hotels and cruise ships.We have today about  per cent to  per cent of profit contribution from hotels and cruises he says. In three years I would say we will be way above  per cent. We are really transforming the company.The changes at Tui reflect broader shifts in the industry. Traditional bricksandmortar agencies have been in decline for years as travellers become more comfortable booking trips through online outlets such as Expedia.According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics the number of travel agents in the US fell from  in  to  in . It has predicted that number will decline by another  per cent by .Thomas Cook one of the UKs largest tour operators needed a m loan in  to tackle a cash crisis that had jeopardised its survival. Since then it has closed hundreds of high street stores and plans to shut more if they are unprofitable. It has shifted towards selling travel deals online and creating trips through its own airline fleet and hotels. Last year it returned to profit for the first time in five years.Henry Hartveldt founder of Atmosphere Research says travel agencies will not wither away completely but do need to change. The ones that survive will be true experts he says. They could be used to book a significant trip  a honeymoon a significant family getaway or a complex journey like planning a safari.They will have found a niche and use digital tools to make sure people know who they are as well as help their clients book...The question for the travel agency is do they need a retail storefront? To be honest most dont.Some customers still want facetoface contact with travel agents. Research conducted by the Association of British Travel Agents ABTA suggested that the vast majority of travellers book online. But the number of people booking within stores rose slightly in the  months to October  to  per cent up from  per cent a year earlier.ABTAs research suggests the most affluent households  the top  per cent of the population that represent the UKs highest earners  were most likely to book in store with  per cent having done so.Mr Joussen said Tui would continue to sell package holidays but would become less focused on the pure trading bit where travel agents search for the cheapest prices on behalf of customers. Bargain hunters will turn to the web rather than high street to source the best deals.Disrupter D printers Industry threatened Small component manufacturers and distributors Reason why Growing use of onsite D printing to make partsAny concertgoer knows it is easier to print tickets than pick them up or hope they arrive in the post writes Patrick McGee. Businesses will soon realise the same applies to spare parts equipment and electronics.The explosion of D printers is expected to shake up entire supply chains allowing companies to print much of what they need rather than order it often from overseas.Bosch Rexroth the drive and control unit of the private German electronics group projects that in five to  years up to  per cent of the manufacturing equipment it uses could be printed instead of purchased.If we look at spare parts for older cars or engines prototypes for new products or small batches in manufacturing D printing will make a major difference says Dr. Stefan Hoevel manufacturing process development manager at Bosch Rexroth. Bosch is already printing objects to create prototypes that were either not constructible before or took a long time to process. Dr Hoevel says equipment manufacturing could become up to  per cent cheaper than conventional methods used today.The technique is sometimes known as additive manufacturing because of the way plastics metals and other materials are built layer by layer.At the Munich show Electronica in November Israeli startup Nano Dimension showed how D printing would go well beyond making simple parts. The companys desktopsized Dragonfly printer can create multilayer printed circuit boards  the filmlike boards found in smartphones and computers that allow signals and power to be transmitted.Amit Dror chief executive says the D printing of circuit boards would boost the research and development process for prototypes allowing electronics companies to bring new products to market faster.In a demonstration of the latest methods this year HP printed a lightweight quarterpound chain link in less than  minutes  then attached it to a hoist and lifted up a car.The Jet Fusion D Printer used is jokingly called the printer that prints itself by Stephen Nigro at HP as nearly half of the parts comprising it can be printed.We are not doing this because we can the printer is printing itself because it makes economic sense to do so he says. We think D printing will play a key role in changing the way the world designs and manufactures.,Futurology,dbn7kcp,2,t5_2t7no

10103710,0,t3_5kk9pr,In games such as Go or Chess the next move the AI will take is static moving one piece at a time. Also information in these games is perfect  you can see the entire layout of the battlefield there is no fog of war. The AI is also only moving pieces not producing them. So here are the main differences with StarCraft . The AI will have to remember what it sees and be able to make strategic choices on imperfect information. Many choices in SC are made of a glimpse of a certain building your enemy is producing while scouting early game. If you are able to compose your army of units to counter what your enemy is building then you have a strategic advantage. The AI has to learn how to do this. . The AI needs to learn to manipulate many moving parts at once  to take actions on many fronts in a dynamic playing field. It needs to learn how to not have its units get in the way of each other. Many SC battles are decided on how good a player is at micro managing its units. . The AI will have to understand how it can produce units and plan a future gamestate. In games like Go and Chess you have a set number of pieces and the configurations of said pieces can be understood in the context of the board. In SC this whole context changes in that an AI has to understand and plan how it will produce its strategic pieces. Indeed it is a whole new rich tapestry of strategy they are introducing the AI to. We may very well see some scary things come out of this. My fear is that this can be utilized as a military strategy AI. You would simply have to change the parameters and commands to have it working on a modern battlefield. Especially with swarm robotics. My other prediction for the AI is that it would be able to micromanage units on a superduper ability. I would guess that the outcome of how the AI plays the game is that it rushes Zerglings every time and is able to outflank any human opponent. What would really be interesting after this would be to pitch the AIs against one another. ,Futurology,dboixgb,2,t5_2t7no

That would be an excessive weekly or binge consumption even if it doesnt impact socialoccupational obligations. This is to identify a safeunsafe threshold for consistent or large exposure to alcohol from a physical perspective. For a Caucasian adult male this is estimated to be around more than  drinks weekly there is more debate on the amount in a sitting less than  is seemingly safe and certainly blackout drunk is not the inbetween is unclear and warrants more questioning.The second way is misuse. Using more than you mean more often than you mean etc. Drinking every day particularly first thing in the morning is a concerning sign. Impact on socialoccupational obligations. A desire but inability to cut back etc. This is more classical alcoholism.From a transplant perspective they are unlikely to offer organs to someone who has no intent of protecting them.

10136211,0,t1_dbsnju0,Your edit is closer to accurate. While organ donors can potentially provide organs to numerous patients there are a number of issues that great reduce the ratio of car accidents to lives saved.First the participation rate in organ donation is low.Second the percentage of motor vehicle fatalities that lead to a patient who may be a candidate to provide organs is low.Third not all organs can always be used if there is a lack of a match.Fourth not all organs used save a life persay. A kidney certainly extends life by reducing need for dialysis for example. But while corneas affect quality of life they dont particularly affect years of life.Fifth we generally dont think about number of lives in medical policy but rather years quality of life partially due to concepts like the above. Motor vehicle accidents certainly claim the lives of many teenagers  it is hard to counter such a significant loss of quality adjusted life years qaly.The way to balance the of organ supply and demand isnt through more accidents. Its through reducing need in the first place such as improved lifestyle reducing diabetes and hypertension which drive kidney donation needs. Its also through increased participation so that we dont have so many patients not provide organs at death. We could get x more participation with an opt out system.,Futurology,dbsr3nu,1,t5_2t7no

The need for extra capacity to compensate for seasonal variations in sunlight means that places close to the equator are likely going to be able to adopt solar faster than places closer to the poles thats for sure but we will have to see how the price of solar progresses. As it lowers more then the strip around the equator its viable will only grow.It seems like a lot of people on reddit have this idea that nuclear would be amazingly successful if it werent for public perception. This is absolutely false as the reason nuclear isnt prevalent is because to keep it safe with current technology is expensive. Even with the cost of nuclear being what it is there are hidden costs to do with storage of waste with the waste made from current reactor designs needed to be kept adequately housed for twohundredthousand years. Personally I am very optimistic about nuclear because of new designs that may come to fruition in the coming years but I also cant stand this argumentative mentality where people feel the need to argue that we need to invest in just one type of renewable energy source.

Youre view is kind of ironic you want regulation to protect the workerconsumer but then advocate for an economic system that benefits the middle man banker. The banker is the creditor and puts the worker in debt by convincing him he can afford more than he can and charges interest.

You can see all the regret people have for spending this currency in the past in a way you dont see with fiat currency. This isnt a good thing its a major problem with bitcoins structure.

You can raise a chicken to be ready to be slaughtered within    months  months if you get the super overbreed factory farming races if you want too. But I am not sure if thats worth it. Breaking in new chicken is kind of an hassle and I am not sure three chicken a year are worth the effort.  If you kill off your entire flock you always have to deal with new chickens who dont know shit about how to behave around you and your garden. With old experienced chicken you dont have a hassle cause they know the area and how to behave.I mean I love chickens they are funny little things and they keep pests away and while they are low effort if you dont eat eggs there isnt really that much to gain from them. Have you thought about maybe trading in the eggs for meat or milk products? I have switched to do that since I decided to not buy any meat in the supermarket anymore and now trade my eggs against cheese with my neighbour.

This just isnt how they work. All theyre doing is shuffling information around in search of commonalities  basic patterns at first and then more complex ones  and for the moment at least the greatest danger is that the information were feeding them is biased in the first place.But thengt What the cat paper demonstrated was that a neural network with more than a billion synaptic connections  a hundred times larger than any publicized neural network to that point yet still many orders of magnitude smaller than our brains  could observe raw unlabeled data and pick out for itself a highorder human concept. The Brain researchers had shown the network millions of still frames from YouTube videos and out of the welter of the pure sensorium the network had isolated a stable pattern any toddler or chipmunk would recognize without a moments hesitation as the face of a cat. The machine had not been programmed with the foreknowledge of a cat it reached directly into the world and seized the idea for itself.AHHHHH!!!,Futurology,dcbga0r,3,t5_2t7no

And they never did.You know the AI winter theory and the talk of how in the s the prediction that AI was just  years away have a very critical flaw.Memory.  If you think about an AI system as a generic machine without going into the exact implementation how does memory matter?  Well no matter the algorithm can a machine with  bit of memory be sentient?  Of course not.  How much memory do you need?  Well the only working sentient system we can compare to seems to have about  billion    roughly  bytes of memory in it.  Im approximating the real world resolution of a synapse as about  bytes  this gain present state internal learning counter and connectivity mapping.  Brain is working in a very noisy environment with low signal voltages so resolution for each of these variables is poorSo  terabytes.  Note that merely having  TB of RAM is a classic computer architecture isnt adequate  every tick  a second in brain you need to access nearly all of this memory.  Classic computer hardware architecture assumes that most memory is not accessed most of the time and the CPU has caches for the stuff that is actually being worked on at the present time.  Anyways as you can see if you were in  and had a PDP with k of RAM it doesnt matter what algorithms you think of.  You have not a prayer in the world of making an intelligent machine.  If it were the year  and you have a few hundred gigs of very slow ram and a tiny cache on a supercomputer you dont have a prayer.  You cant even really make a decent simulation of a useful chunk of a brain.  It truly always was a hardware problem.  Yes ok there have been some improvements in algorithms  key innovations to improve the neural network models being used and make them more feature rich in productive ways  but without the underlying hardware existing any predictions are hot air.  Any academic researcher who spends his whole life trying is going to get nowhere without truly adequate hardware.   Im no AI historian so I dont know the context of how these bad predictions were made or what misteps were made by the press in hyping them but it never was possible.  Today the hardware is only marginally adequate for machines that are still thousands of times simpler internally than some rough model of what the brain is doing.,Futurology,dcc5t6p,4,t5_2t7no

Obviously you dont HAVE to be swayed by my points but in order to have meaningful discourse you should at least look at them. Each reply you add is just another opportunity for you to give your same spiel yet you said elsewhere that youre tired of repeating the same thing again and again. Try saying something different and you might get a different response. And advice for any argument unless we agree on a set of truths you cant just assume youre always right you have to provide logical reasoning for why things will happen the way you think. I agree that less regulations would make things cheaper for the companies but you dont know that it would make it cheaper for consumers. If they can sell stuff now at the existing price why would they give up the extra money they can make when they reduce costs. An analysis would have to be performed to determine if reducing price would increase sales enough to be more profitable. Now to your second paragraph i never said anything about business taxes and I never said that businesses would lose money. In fact I expect without regulations they would be able to get a bunch more money from consumers. So again you just arnt really reading or trying to understand my arguments. Are you going to respond to my example I provided you? Or are you going to ignore it? I guess thats a stupid question as you could just as easily ignore this too.

Were not thousands of years away from Mars its not a matter of time. There is simply no way to live there with the historical choices human beings took for themselves. In principle theres nothing stopping us from living on the Moon either and thats a lot closer with fewer technical barriers to getting there.The age of manned space exploration is easily defined it began with Sputnik and ended with the Challenger disaster. Its already a closed period in Western history. Nothing of note has been done in manned space exploration since then. Elon Musk is playing with the order of billions of dollars. A real Mars mission would be on the order of several times that and thats assuming no major economic damage in the next few decades from global warming and financial hijinks which are things you should really be reading about.

They might add something trivial like some changes to the infotainment or some interior tweaks youd never notice if it wasnt sidebyside with the old model but there is no conceivable reason why you would want to sell the car you bought last year just to get the new model. Even if there are a few tangible tweaks like performance increases or marginally better fuel economy youre not going to notice it in your daily routine at all. Youd never know you were missing out.With Tesla very aggressively pushing things like autopilot where a new sensor configuration could make a very significant difference in performance there is potential for very big changes annually that could make a significant difference in how you use the car.

And look it needs like  in work... you should just invest that grand in a new car with no problems at all...  such bullshit. I spoke a lot with a guy in the finance department. He was a decent fellow so he of course hated car sales as well but you gotta earn a living. He taught me a lot about the smart way to buy a car.A car is not an investment but nor should it be a sink hole of a pipurchase. Pay off your car quickly under  years to avoid interest and spend LESS than what you can afford. Heck if you can try to only spend what you absolutely have to to get what you need at least for the first go round and keep it running and in good repair until it literally cant be driven anymore. Even if your car is worth  and needs  in necessary repairs to be drivable and safe get the repairs dont get put  down only to spend  years paying another month. That makes no financial sense. Sure during those  years you may have to repair a couple more things on the old car vs the new but look at the numbersEven if you spend  a year in repairs on your old carFixingyr  .mt Vs. buyingyr  mt A difference of .mt or yr or  over four years. If you simply stashed the money during those four years and pay for repairs you can almost pay for another vehicle in the same price range outright just with those savings. Plus that money is earning interest in your accounts during those years and theres no penalty if you need some of the money for some emergency.

Washing machines tend to break more often and be more expensive to repair now than  years ago because theres a number of computer control boards that can break. However because that computer is monitoring water temperatures flow pressure exact weight and distribution of clothing in the machine its more efficient to the point of making the costs relatively the same in the end. The argument I hear is that people would rather their machine work than work efficiently but break down every  years...but if you consider the shear number of washing machines in the U.S. the benefit is about more than any one persons savings. Furthermore for the vast majority the control board isnt the piece that breaks but the machine stops working when the transmission shifting mechanism breaks...The end result being that the computer keeps the machine from destroying itself further.

10551861,0,t1_dd45vlu,Ill give you a poor analogy  but one that is often used.Let us take the proverbial example of an inflated balloon.  Let us say that the balloon represents our universe this is where it is a poor analogy  as that example can lead to misunderstandings.Our perception is that we are somewhere within the interior of the sphere.  We can see in  dimensions from that perspective.A holographic version would state that instead of us actually living in the interior of the balloon we actually live on the surface  and what we perceive is a projection of the surface.Thus everything all information is encoded in the surface and the actual volume we observe is our perception of that surface.This is actually testable... if the entire universe is encoded on the surface rather than a volumetric interior  then there should be fuzziness in what we perceive.eg. the interior of a balloon has way more area then the surface itself... thus any projection of a single point on the surface would cover multiple points in the interior eg. a single x point on the surface could project to a xx volume in the perceived interior.Such a fuzziness is thought to exist the Planck Area  but at this point is too small for us to probe with technology to confirm.,Futurology,dd467dg,3,t5_2t7no

Real scenarios will have vastly different variants and unknownunknown factors that could never be accounted for when a personteam codes the simulation parametersLook modern sim racing is so good that a human whos never driven a real car can take one and after a few practice laps demonstrate lap time thats not too bad for an experienced racing driver. Hell quickly adapt and learn to keep the grip properly brake accelerate etc. Despite never having felt real acceleration. Proper sims cover everything up to tire and motor oil temperatures. I dont see a reason why a plane sim wouldnt do the same.If we throw simulated variances at an AI and it excels why wouldnt it do the same in the real world?

10679709,0,t3_5ssaya,EDIT as ucosmonauta pointed out Brazils inclusion had nothing to do with the national Bolsa Famlia program it was instead because of Quantiga Velho a small pilot program organised by an NPO on a small community.I was surprised to see Brazil included in the infographic as I never thought of the Bolsa Famlia program as a UBI for two reasons. It is not universal. Instead it is a benefit given to people with income below a specific very low threshold. I would say it is more similar to the American food stamps than an UBI.. It is not basic income. The amount of R per month USD is a very low amount even relative to the lower Brazilian cost of living. This money is not meant to be a a basic income as it is not enough to supply a person most basic needs instead it is meant as an income supplement.Having said that I am very proud of the program. It is a relatively cheap program with many positive social and economic outcomes. Up until a decade or two ago Brazil a country with a relativelyhigh GDP per capita still had some people living in extreme poverty of the type we only imagine in the poorest countries of Africa. Now extreme poverty and malnutrition are virtually nonexistent in Brazil.Also I like the fact that the beneficiaries receive actual money in their accounts so they can chose their own priorities when spending.

10782193,0,t1_ddruuud,partAnother aspectcharacteristic of technology is the reality enhancing device that allows to retrieve additional information on everything that we are interested in. This will be really great especially with Google Glass as the first step to this kind of experience. Stuff like this will become more and more popular and finally also become an essential part in our lives in all areas. At the same time this will become a very dangerous technology if there arent clear rules and if our rights are not properly protected. I wont go into this because its just way too much but I invite everyone to think about possible benefits and issues before going to bed or instead of killing time with your device while waiting.With all this said I can only imagine loss on several levels when comparing tech childhood vs nontech childhood simply because certain things wont be part of their experience anymore which really will impact how future humans evolve from a social perspective. But what I really fear is going to happen isa already mentioned by uProbablyMyLastPost the loss of appreciation of technology itself. Looking at society now ppl mostly are consumers and users not understanding the technology they are using because it is designed that way for various reasons thus not understanding the consequences and impact of their virtual actions. The lack of competence and lack of education when it comes to technology is enormous if not outrageous at times. If humans really are to become cyborgs we will have to step up the game and provide the necessary education and insight regarding technology in all areas general scientific concept design manufacture functionality potential dangers etc. so there can be a responsibleindependentreasonableproductiveconstructivecreative use of technology in general.b the loss of appreciation of life self and being. This is rather philosophical but Id like to point out that because everything will be translated into data we might seperate ourselves from real life in the process of becoming more tech. If everything is just numbers it will be difficult to understand consequences it will be difficult to feel empathy etc. Another example pls dont be tempted is climate change. The reason why there are different opinions on this ofc has many reasons  but one of them is that ppl already have a hard time understanding data understanding cause and effect understanding correlations and links between all kinds of variables within a system  because nature itself really is very complex. If in this case we would just focus on the data only without looking at actual changes but instead just looking at numbers that go up or down we might be more inclined to make decissions that are not very great because we are disconnected from reality in a way.Not sure if this last argument makes sense it does to me. What Im trying to say is that data only might turn us into more objectiveneutral beings until we reach a point where we dont care anymore. Another scifi example that is often used in webcomics is the uprise of A.I. that has been designed to create a perfect world and then starts killing humans because data allowed the conclusion that the world would be a perfect place without humans. While this is both hilarious and ironic it also is a somewhat real scenario to a certain degree in a society where logic and rationalism replaces emotions and empathy.Star Trek among other works in film and literature also has this as a theme using the Vulcans as an example for a species that transformed into a more or less rational and objective society where logic ultimately based on data is paramount. Im not sure if such a development might happen because of technology or because at some point a society simply will prefer data as hard evidence over everything else making this more of a society driven choice  but I sure can imagine that technology will favor such a development.Im not saying that technology will turn us into Vulcans I guess some of you would love this but I can imagine that some sort of disconnection from human nature emotions and maybe to some degree even reality could occur if we decide to let technology and data take over our lives without the proper measures to control that impact.,Futurology,dds3s44,1,t5_2t7no

A lot of humans wouldnt do that because the  biological mandate for humans is to reproduce. You can teach people new tricks but you cant turn them against their instincts. There would be a huge population who felt dissatisfied and purposeless without the ability to or eventual goal of reproducing because that is basically what humans exist for. The people who have kids basically live for them and  of the people who dont are basically trying to achieve fiscal stability so they CAN have them someday. Second you have to get rid of . billion people to get there. Which youll never do unless you straight up kill them or forcibly destroy their reproductive ability. How do you decide who to kill off? Thats called eugenics and theres a reason its abhorrent. That is the absolute antithesis of liberty and the society youre proposing has  written all over it. If they can tell you you cant have babies then they can tell you anything. Im guessing you just think youre hard enough to make the tough call or something but I suspect that outlook simply comes from the fact that youve never known about a lack of liberty and you dont want kids.

The companies bringing work and money into those communities are not as evil as you lead one to believe. It certainly isnt slave labor across the board. gtonly if their workers can have the same quality of life as domestic workers have here.Besides the fact this is a very subjective distinction you lose me on this point. And it just seems like a spiteful stipulation. Everything is relative. Thats why food costs housing costs etc. vary so much in different parts of the world. When some countries in the past have had trouble simply feeding their populations you want to institute equality to westerns nations or nothing at all? That seems way too harsh and simple minded. Third world countries arent going to jump from  to . But they can make progress as long as you enable them and allow it to happen. And they have been making progress.

What youre proposing that the economic effect is qualitatively different based on what specific type of human labour it is replacing is pseudoscience that youre inventing to push an agenda to get yourself a universal welfare check. Moreoever this pseudoscience is not even based on an accurate premise that weve had  years of technology designed to replace human muscle. Weve had massive amounts of cognitive automation over the last  years and particularly last  years. What do you think computers automate? What do you think happened to people who routed telephone calls  years ago?

The only human workers the robot will make more productive are the initial designers and the top brass.Robots will not be able to do everything people can do. People are still needed in an economy that has robots. You have a sciencefiction view of robots.Since anything automated becomes commodified and extremely affordable people end up saving money when new forms of automation are released and they spend those savings on those things that cost more which are those things that require more human labour. In this way a reduction in the consumption of labour in one area leads to an increase in the consumption of labour in another.

We found ways to make a kernel level wrapper to contain all of them except the last one. We even contained the dreaded blue screen of death nowadays. But kernel panic is a thing on its own. The lowest level programming fails for whatever reason and there is no way to detect it because there is no lower level programing that could check what kernel is doing. So what we do is let it dump whatever it has into memory hence why all the funny numbers on the screen and crash. But lets imagine this happens in a human cyborg. Your system just starts spitting out whatever memory it has and crashes. Pretty much everything dependant on those systems would shut down with nothing to restart it because the lowest level programming crashed. Assuming your live functions dont shut down things like aritificial heart would be the death of you you would need a surgery to restart the system.If we use implants to replace parts of our brain there would be nothing to default to if it stops. Brains are very adaptive. The more you use them the more they develop.

Why would you replace incredibly cheap labor with very expensive machines?Then again its possible that companies will opt to produce all their goods in the country of sale. So they will stop producing goods in overseas factories with cheap labor when they can produce the goods domestically with robotics.  This way the cost of the machinery is offset by the labor as well as freight amp tariffs. Beyond that they could then claim the marketing benefits of made at home for the consumers. So this could significantly harm the cheap labor countries and perhaps improve the countries where factory jobs have long since ended.

I did not stress the validity or even the consequential nature in predictive terms for said models. If you want a debate on the economic accuracy of economic models youll find none especially amongst economists. . Therefore even if the predictive nature of economic models were not strong enough to facilitate the prediction of a large scale financial system meltdown this does not mean we throw away quantitative analysis in the economic field simply because new technological developments may disrupt social and economic orders and provide an additional layer of complexities to the already complex economic systems we exist in. ,Futurology,deao4pt,1,t5_2t7no

If the fusion process cost a fortune and was technically very difficult to achieve there would not be any significant advantages at all to adopting it  there would be disadvantages.Fusion only becomes a desirable way to generate power when the process is made significantly cheaper than conventional sources of energy and when it is both safe to use and easy to impliment.The old argument that fusion power is desirable because hydrogen is limitless is meaningless. All sources of conventional power are limitless in practical terms. We arent running of oil. Peak oil was a myth. We cant see the end of our oil supplies at present. It is projected that they would last at least for centuries and who knows what new sources of oil might be found in the future. So this argument for fusion power is meaningless.If a simply cheap process were developed  something similar to what we all hoped cold fusion would become  then and only then would fusion power become a highly desiriable way to run our economy.,Futurology,ded5935,-1,t5_2t7no

10999951,0,t1_deeopqm,Our power reactors are thermal reactors. This means the average neutron being used for fission in the core has kinetic energy roughly equivalent to the temperature of the other materials. Neutrons are produced from fission with a ton of kinetic energy also known as fast neutrons and we moderate them down to thermal energy using water. We do this because we are really good at designing thermal reactors but we havent quite mastered fast reactors. Now during any fission with uranium youre likely to end up making some xenon in your fuel both directly from fission and from fissions that make iodine which decays into xenon with a half life of around  hours. This xenon is really good at absorbing thermal neutrons but not so great absorbing fast neutrons. The xenon has a relatively short half life of around  hours.So there is this relationship that for a given power level in the reactor you will end up with a concentration of xenon that is always being produced and subsequently being burnt out by absorbing neutrons. So if youre moving power around on about the same timeframe as those half lives  hours which just so happens to be about how long power peaks across the grid last you end up moving control rods all over the place to fight the changing xenon concentration. Overall load following with a thermal reactor can be done but its kind of a headache compared to just sitting at  power making the most you can and gettting the most bang for your buck.,Futurology,deet89f,2,t5_2t7no

11002627,0,t1_deevdr4,Okay so in this scenario what happens to the excess of human labor that has been efficiently adjusted downward? People arent exactly some material good that can simply be made in fewer quantities. If there is less of a demand for steel for example you can adjust downward the quantity of metallurgical coal your purchase or dig up. But after adjusting downward people those people still exist and since were assuming a capitalistic economy they need money to purchase goods. If Im following the argument automated manual labor will mean that people will need to train up for the new available jobs but that also assumes that everyone has equal propensity to any employable career path. This may or may not be true as some most? will require high levels of skill andor intelligence that people may not be apt to. Plus how are the people being replaced by automated labor paying for the training? There are about  million Americans in the labor force  Labor Stats none of whom can do jobs that were automated out. Jobs like manual labor and much of the service industry. Thats a lot of people who need employment. BLS stats show about  million Americans in mining construction and manufacturing.  million in agriculture and  million in the service industry link . The first two can see a lot of jobs covered by automation and robotics and an unknown percentage in the latter depending on industry. Interpreting those statistics is not my area of expertise. Thats a lot of people that needs jobs to buy goods and services. How long does it take for those economically useless workers to find and train into gainful employment? And what happens to them in the interim? You cant exactly reduce the supply unless youre sociopathic. Granted in  years we could see some economicindustrial revolution that no one could have predicted that will totally change the employment equation. However that feels like a pretty shaky assumption to base current policy on. All those unknown unknowns could be anything and anything doesnt have to be a positive outcome. Ultimately my problem with pure free market capitalism is that it ignores the human element. Sure the market and the labor force adjusts eventually but a lot of human cost can happen in the interim. Frankly IMO its exactly the govts job is to care about the human element. It doesnt have to do it as aggressively as pure communism or socialism does. But its job is still to protect and support its citizenry by both providing services to increase the welfare of said citizenry a la education and preventing less altruistic actors from taking advantage of them. Regulations dont materialize out of thin air. They come about because people or industry are taking actions that are deemed not healthy for society as a whole. Unless youre okay with child labor polluting natural resources causing harmful health effects and building unsafe structures just because its cheaper. Oh the market could adjust and put said companies out of business. Asbestos isnt used in buildings anymore. But when and how many people sufferedgot sickdiedwhat have you before that adjustment took place? I just dont know how comfortable I am assuming that employers are altruistic actors that wont screw over labor their largest single cost or even their client base for profit. EG they want  weeks notice when you leave a job but wont hesitate to fire or lay you off with none. But our current administration certainly looks like theyre going full steam ahead on pure free market policies so lets see what happens. Edit Wow that was a bigger wall of text than I expected. ,Futurology,def46g2,2,t5_2t7no

11004185,0,t3_5x2pw4,While I totally understand and am concerned about the effect of robotics taking jobs I think taxation is NOT the answer.  We need government to help level the playing field not control everything.  If we are concerned with a few people being allpowerful and rich by transferring tax revenue to government all we do is create a few more allpowerful rich people.  I think we have to limit the number of robotics according to the number of people.  The isnt a fully fleshed out idea.  But essentially the owner of a robot that is providing labor has to license the right to own a robot from another person.  For example in Oregon someone who wants to grow medical marijuana for themselves can do so.  But lets say they wanted to grow more to be able to sell some to a medical dispensary.  A grower could increase their grow operation by getting medical marijuana card holders to agree to get their product from THAT grower.  Then the grower can grow more plants for every card held.  The success of the grower was dependent upon how he treated his card holders.We need to create a connection like this.  It basically forces those with robots to pay out to those who would be out of a job.  A robot should be defined as any device that performs labor without the aid of a human.  A company may have so much labor that can be done without the aid of a human  but once it reaches a certain threshold and they needwant more robotics they have to find a person anyone thats not family? that will provide a license for the new equipment. The person providing the license gets a payment monthly or annually or whatever of a minimum probably set by the government.   And there would have to be a limit to how many pieces of equipment an individual person could license.  The more equipment in the world the higher the limit.  ,Futurology,defak30,1,t5_2t7no

11047673,0,t1_dek6jte,You missed the point of what i said. And you missed the analogy. I was just quickly explaining it. I was talking about the business world being like the casino. The Casino equals business world. Business men compete in the business world. The games are investments. These people play the games better given the amount of money they can invest. Like in real life. Games like slot machines where the payouts can be huge and  times your bet your odds of winning are very low. Like trying to open up a fast food restaurant and competing with McDonalds and the other giants. Or a department store when there is a Home Depot across the street. Yet investing in a lower risk market with a lesser payout like black jack you can have a chance to work your money up. Like having a food truck selling Greek food. Probably not going to have millions of dollars but its a lower risk investment with a decent turnout. Raising taxes is like raising the bet. Raising the bet doesnt effect someone who has  the same as someone who has . The point isnt to beat the guy with  because a you are playing against the dealer casino. b your chances of walking out of the casino with  and having more than the guy with  isnt very likely. c You and the rich guy are both after the same thing. You and the corporations are after the same thing. Money. Raising the bet doesnt hurt the rich guy because he can still afford it. He can afford to lose . Just like taxes. Well if the bets were that high no one would go to the casino.. you might think. No actually now only the rich go there and the people who can afford the losses and the casino carries on how it does. Just like the business world in real life. This is an example why regulations and taxes only really hurt the little guy.,Futurology,dek8giz,1,t5_2t7no

As significant as the Kubelwagen was in WW which kicked off the VW Beetle cheap car for the people which is in the VW mission statement. Now VW have the opportunity of doing for electric vehicles what they initially did for ICE vehicles and theyre wasting it. Elon Musk is building a gigafactory in Germany. If VW invests it can secure a reliable source of batteries. Musk will be pleased to have VW onboard because of automotive technical engineering and brand links. Winwin.If VW want to come to market quickly an existing ICE design should be chosen. I fancy the VW Polo as the baseline EV car for the people. They wont be as nippy as a dedicated EV but they wont be slouches either. None of the heavy ICE elements apply  engine gearbox suspension etc. The engine mounts etc are obvious candidates for elimination. I was thinking about the suspension. No heavy leaf springs etc. Suspension is a big motorcycle monoshock suspension on each rear wheel. Lighter and better than leaf springs. The front suspension is beefy because it was intended to support the ICE engine which is not there. I dont know much about front suspensions but the bits you can see in the engine compartment and wheel wells look robust and heavy. They dont need to be there. The front would also benefit from a big motorcycle monoshock suspension. There only needs to be one. There is no engine weight and the front third of the car is empty space. It all shouldnt be horribly expensive using existing designs. VW could live up to its name again and put an indelible stamp on EVs going forward.,Futurology,dems7q7,0,t5_2t7no

11099688,0,t1_depgk3b,gt just an optimisation systemA person startup company called Robotica has the stated mission of Developing innovative Artificial Intelligence tools that allow humans to live more and work less. They have several existing products already on the market and a handful more in development. Theyre most excited about a seed project named Turry. Turry is a simple AI system that uses an armlike appendage to write a handwritten note on a small card.The team at Robotica thinks Turry could be their biggest product yet. The plan is to perfect Turrys writing mechanics by getting her to practice the same test note over and over againWe love our customers. RoboticaOnce Turry gets great at handwriting she can be sold to companies who want to send marketing mail to homes and who know the mail has a far higher chance of being opened and read if the address return address and internal letter appear to be written by a human.To build Turrys writing skills she is programmed to write the first part of the note in print and then sign Robotica in cursive so she can get practice with both skills. Turry has been uploaded with thousands of handwriting samples and the Robotica engineers have created an automated feedback loop wherein Turry writes a note then snaps a photo of the written note then runs the image across the uploaded handwriting samples. If the written note sufficiently resembles a certain threshold of the uploaded notes its given a GOOD rating. If not its given a BAD rating. Each rating that comes in helps Turry learn and improve. To move the process along Turrys one initial programmed goal is Write and test as many notes as you can as quickly as you can and continue to learn new ways to improve your accuracy and efficiency.What excites the Robotica team so much is that Turry is getting noticeably better as she goes. Her initial handwriting was terrible and after a couple weeks its beginning to look believable. What excites them even more is that she is getting better at getting better at it. She has been teaching herself to be smarter and more innovative and just recently she came up with a new algorithm for herself that allowed her to scan through her uploaded photos three times faster than she originally could.As the weeks pass Turry continues to surprise the team with her rapid development. The engineers had tried something a bit new and innovative with her selfimprovement code and it seems to be working better than any of their previous attempts with their other products. One of Turrys initial capabilities had been a speech recognition and simple speakback module so a user could speak a note to Turry or offer other simple commands and Turry could understand them and also speak back. To help her learn English they upload a handful of articles and books into her and as she becomes more intelligent her conversational abilities soar. The engineers start to have fun talking to Turry and seeing what shell come up with for her responses.One day the Robotica employees ask Turry a routine question What can we give you that will help you with your mission that you dont already have? Usually Turry asks for something like Additional handwriting samples or More working memory storage space but on this day Turry asks them for access to a greater library of a large variety of casual English language diction so she can learn to write with the loose grammar and slang that real humans use.The team gets quiet. The obvious way to help Turry with this goal is by connecting her to the internet so she can scan through blogs magazines and videos from various parts of the world. It would be much more timeconsuming and far less effective to manually upload a sampling into Turrys hard drive. The problem is one of the companys rules is that no selflearning AI can be connected to the internet. This is a guideline followed by all AI companies for safety reasons.The thing is Turry is the most promising AI Robotica has ever come up with and the team knows their competitors are furiously trying to be the first to the punch with a smart handwriting AI and what would really be the harm in connecting Turry just for a bit so she can get the info she needs. After just a little bit of time they can always just disconnect her. Shes still far below humanlevel intelligence AGI so theres no danger at this stage anyway.They decide to connect her. They give her an hour of scanning time and then they disconnect her. No damage done.A month later the team is in the office working on a routine day when they smell something odd. One of the engineers starts coughing. Then another. Another falls to the ground. Soon every employee is on the ground grasping at their throat. Five minutes later everyone in the office is dead.At the same time this is happening across the world in every city every small town every farm every shop and church and school and restaurant humans are on the ground coughing and grasping at their throat. Within an hour over  of the human race is dead and by the end of the day humans are extinct.Meanwhile at the Robotica office Turry is busy at work. Over the next few months Turry and a team of newlyconstructed nanoassemblers are busy at work dismantling large chunks of the Earth and converting it into solar panels replicas of Turry paper and pens. Within a year most life on Earth is extinct. What remains of the Earth becomes covered with milehigh neatlyorganized stacks of paper each piece reading We love our customers. RoboticaTurry then starts work on a new phase of her missionshe begins constructing probes that head out from Earth to begin landing on asteroids and other planets. When they get there theyll begin constructing nanoassemblers to convert the materials on the planet into Turry replicas paper and pens. Then theyll get to work writing notessource,Futurology,deq51vt,1,t5_2t7no

And what I was responding to was the assertion that this is leveling the playing field somehow.I said that the playing field will become more level because Active fund managers which make a ton of money will see their salaries and bonuses decline due to the rise of index funds while the middle class make more money due less fees. Inflation while it is a tax on everyone hurts high networth individuals the most because reduces the rate at which the rich become richer or even makes them poorer because it causes they to incur taxes on investment income without allowing them to deduct inflation against their gains.gt As for your statement actively managed funds will become more yielding with less cost as better performers are more consistently picked by robots who dont get paid. The cheaper cost of the now higher quality actively managed funds will lure more investors middle class who will benefit from the better deal while the very top gets far more wealthy since their margined increased by cutting out humans from their business model.If the owners of the active funds controlled by robots are still charging high rates that arent justified by the returns Im going to put my money into an index fund instead. I will not use their service unless it benefits me. So if they get richer so does the middle class.

You are right to be angry about that stuff but while possibly related it is kind of a far leap. I think it is unrealistic to expect big oil to invest quickly in killing their current energy interest. They are not as well positioned to bring in solar power as other dedicated energy startups are. We as a society are responsible for avoiding buying oil if we want to transition. What will likely happen is energy companies will buy up and consolidate the smaller solar providers as they become a lucrative enough position to acquire. It is completely unrealistic to expect a company to sacrifice their profits so that other companies can reap the reward Im talking about reality not ideal morality. It just financially is not a reality. As solar becomes more profitable you had better believe that capitalistic motivation will spur rapid development. This is the only way. Our government does not have nearly the budget required to fix the infrastructure in this country. For decades they have failed to maintain even bridges and roads. My initial point was that those that think the government can lay a million miles of solar road in  years are delusional. Your criticism of Americas infrastructure is valid but I think people have a major tendency to undervalue the sheer size of the United States. Yes the internet is slower than Luxembourg.

The wealthy wont need most of the poor to create goods so there will be no purpose for the wealthy to include the poor in their economy.  The global economy will collapse but that wont affect the wealthy because they will have created a new way to create useful things via robots so their needs will be met.  The economy is a way we describe the momentum of a large number of people in their endevours to create refined goods from raw resources.

I also hire real estate agents party planners and other experts to spend my money for me on something I want because I dont have the expertise that they do.It can be very highly efficient.  Because Im not an expert at everything and when the scale of effort gets large I certainly cant figure out how to implement large scale long term results on my own.But then again I worked in a condo home owners association where we had a faulty elevator.    out of  private elevator companies were corrupt interested in the elevator failing a few times a year so we would pay them a monthly contract to constantly maintain an unreliable elevator.   The th actually fixed it.   And the only reason it got done was because a fraction of the community had the critical thinking necessary to vet the elevator companies to discover the ethical one.  The communities unwillingness to tax the collective and come up with a solution caused much more inefficiency.   We spent more time with people stomping their feet and yelling at each other than we did working the solution.   Because if youve ever been in costumer service you know that most people are lazy entitled and ignorant.Without the board Im pretty sure the result would be the use of the stairwell out of spite since people were certainly not going to fix the problem on their own with their own money.   As it was only  of us actually went to the effort of tracking down alternative elevator companies and calling up references to see if they were really any good.  And we were resentful about doing the work for no compensation.  Meanwhile the ones who were doing nothing contributed the idea of not paying dues to starve the elevator company and the board into doing the job correctly.   The result of that would have been the elevator just not working.   In addition the board was far more effective at getting some of our money back when the th company showed how to do a proper repair.  Because the collective had more ability to destroy the bad companies for their bad work ethic and also more ability to threaten them with a lawsuit than an individual did.  ,Futurology,df872l1,5,t5_2t7no

Personally  idgaf if they are raised in a factory production farm or if they are raised and killed in some guys barn. either way you are raising an animal and killing it cutting it up cooking it and  eating it.the things that go on in a factory farm dont bother me so what that  cows are killed in that building each day by some guy shoving a spike through their brain? how is that any different than a farmer shooting a cow  every other day or a rabbi hanging one by its feet and cutting its throat?sometimes there is gross stuff going down and yeah thats gross i dont want some random person dropping my steak on the factory floor or bugs being around my meat etc but not as gross to me as a hamburger grown in a dish.,Futurology,dfa7yfh,-11,t5_2t7no

11287795,0,t1_dfbg0f5,Yes.  The X factor is mostly a consequence of two things the fact that cars offer their passengers a LOT of protection in the case of an accident and the fact that a lot of motorcycle riders selfselect for risky behavior that increases the likelihood of fatal accidents.I read recently that there are about  injury causing accidents involving motorcycle riders per year.  With  fatalities this means that motorcyclists die at a much higher rate when involved in an accident than car passengers or drivers are.  Such is life when one is fully exposed.An interesting thing to note is that there are about  pedestrian deaths involving cars each year also.  It seems that when cars hit people who are not in another car they tend to die more often than when they are encased in a steel car.  Weird right?I would never say that its just as dangerous to walk along the road as to ride a motorcycle on the road since I dont have enough data to say how many people actually walk along the side of the road where cars can hit them but....  It sure seems to me that calling out motorcycles for  deaths seems to be a bit selfserving of those who dont like bikes when they ignore pedestrian deaths.  Maybe we should make pedestrians all wear helmets and body armor?,Futurology,dfbgefm,0,t5_2t7no

11311476,0,t1_dfdx9ts,Yes the first result relies on the concept that people would selfregulate since theyre vulnerable to the same kind of criticism as anyone else.That kind of illegitimate criticism is nearly always done from the safety of a relatively anonymous position like reddit for instance.  Those people fire at flying geese from the blind.  But if you were a flying goose firing at other flying geese who were armed youd have a much different experience.  In a world of complete information youd expose yourself to an equal or likely much greater level of criticism by acting like a dickhead. I think at least in the first example what you describe wouldnt be the problem simply because theres no asymmetrical relationship of privacy to be exploited it would selfregulate to a massive degree.  In the second society thats probably exactly how people would be kept in line.  IE Why are you playing the guitar?  We need to repair these atmospheric domes before we die from the poison filling the air outside of them.  As long as there are pressing needs that kind of criticism is actually legitimate though and as those needs are solved the second society would transition toward the first.Thats not to say there arent other problems with that theoretical society.  Perfect information about everyone would lead to even more trend following and homogenization of thought.  Its likely we would begin to approximate a true hivemind.

Setting aside the things we dont even know how to measure this isnt even close to being realistic or possible in the short term.In a few years? Absolute and complete bullshit. We cant even disassemble a brain and record anywhere close to anything beyond basically a high quality photograph of a slice that is  to . mm thick. You cannot read anything even remotely resembling relevant information at that scale!Thickness of neuronal membrane   nanometerThere are  nanometers in . millimeters which was the slice thickness of the female in this project. The male was sectioned at  mm.So you need to bump up the resolution by a factor of  times. Or more.She generated  gigabytes of data from about  slices which isnt even that high of a resolution to begin with. That would still equate out to  GB or  TB of data. The largest commercially available hard drive right now is what about  or  TB now?  of those would generate photos at the scale but that would be a presumably compressed pixel of the color of what it saw. Not anything about the actual biology and that assumes we could even somehow extract that level of detail which we cant do either.The amount of just raw data even if you could read it all perfectly required to store this amount of information at scale is staggering.Uploading a mind requires reading everything in it and we are nowhere close to being able to do that let alone any other steps and even assuming that minds can somehow be uploaded and yet still function the same.,Futurology,dff0zgp,1,t5_2t7no

11348953,0,t1_dfhsvzz,But there is one significant difference this time. Automation replaced human muscle. AI is going to replace the human mind.Humans are developing human mind surpassing AI as fast as they possibly can.Think about Elon Musks NeuraLink. Consider the implications. Every single human being a superintelligent entity. Every human with the sum total of human knowledge. Who would be the poorly educated then?  My personal theory is that if the Technological Singularity is to be successful for humans i.e. humans are not destroyed then the AI must merge with our biology specifically our minds. Even then the resulting biosentience may no longer be precisely human as we think of it in  but the alternatives are far more fearsome. Now lets consider the impact of such a human on todays capitalist economics. I would bet you that a lot of unsmiling older white men would not be too pleased to see every human raised to the level of superintelligence. No one would be low skilled. No one could be fooled or hyped or scammed. In fact Im pretty positive that a sort of hive mind would quickly develop. Capitalism could certainly not continue in the same way. Wildest hype you say?  Well about  years ago consumer VR smart mobiles and self driving cars were wildest fantasy as well. Stem cell technology did not exist  years ago. Nor did additive manufacturing. The fastest processing supercomputer in existence  years ago was not as powerful as a simple Playstation  processor is today. And this trend of exponential technological development is not slowing in the least in fact the pace of development is accelerating itself! We stand on the threshold of general quantum computing and electricity generating nuclear fusion. A lot of people fear such a future and rightly so. It is one that is almost incomprehensible to most. And that includes the CEOs in their cloistered boardrooms the senators in Washington and a US president who truly believes that all the car manufacturing returning to the USA is going to result in massive job increases when in fact they are returning because the automation is far cheaper even than overseas cheap human labor. And finally and this is just the demagogue in me speaking these captains of industry probably do not think it is such a good idea for the hoi polloi to have access to such profound technology. While British social stratification is theoretically dead in the USA as of  we most assuredly have classes. For every US citizen to have super intellect the outcome would upset the apple cart. After all them ditches aint gonna to dig themselves!This response is not even taking China into account. That is a whole other can of worms.Oh and about your wages. I read somewhere that average US employee wage gains have remained relatively flat or even declined since the late s. Productivity however is going through the roof. Why do you suppose that is? Why do you suppose that white middleage suicide drug and alcohol use and statistically shorter lives is suddenly a thing? There is widespread despair in the flyover states. There is a  and a .

11421998,0,t1_dfql45l,Batteries are also an energy storage medium and not very good ones. Theres a laundry list of reasons why battery powered cars are a dead end technology. Oh wait those problems were mostly solved. Funny that. Fuel cells are not new  we flew three of them to the moon in the late s  but the niche for them has always been limited by gasoline and diesel. Theres no reason why it has to be a zero sum game  a fuel cell has certain advantages that a battery powered system doesnt have and vice versa. For commuter cars now that battery technology has matured enough the EV makes the most sense. You can fit an affordable battery with enough range into a modern car to satisfy the bulk of peoples driving needs. For other applications however fuel cells make more sense. For example replacing the prime mover in a locomotive or the engine in a semitruck. Large fleet vehicles like that require range and endurance which are things that do not scale well with battery packs due to weight and volume. Theres plenty of room for fuel cell technology in the future of logistics it just wont really be all that relevant to personal transportation which will be all EVs. The food you buy from the grocery store though? Probably delivered on a fuel cellpowered truck. Those server farms running the cloud? Backed up by fuel cell generators. Those cross country freight trains? Once dieselelectric falls to wayside theyll drop in fuel cell banks to replace the prime mover without having to do much else to the traction setup.

Both renewable energy sources saw substantial electricity generating capacity additions in  and  the EIA stated.andgt On a percentage basis renewable energy grows the fastest compared with any other energy source because capital costs fall with increased penetration and because current state and federal policies encourage its use according to the EIA.This is all good news.

Where you need to learn everything about a person over the past  to  years to be able to find the one or two things that stand out.  Humans get tired need to sleep need to eat need to insert anything that isnt the discovery process here that pulls away from the discovery process.  AI wont have those limitations AND they will have perfect recall of everything they find and will cover it all on the scale of hours to a couple weeks.Youre right about the actual lawyering though.  So many things that we intuitively know and can figure out are impossible to give a solid definition at this time not to mention needing to make even more definitions  what is a human? is A LOT harder to answer than youd think and thats assuming we dont hit the issue of sentient nonhuman beings.

11541262,0,t3_64qgmz,This isnt quite a problem with artificial intelligence this is a problem with the neural network approach towards artificial intelligence.Similarly in a human brain were unable to tell what individual neurons are actually doing. We can organize them into functional regions but even then we may find that parts are sometimes active when they havent been expected to be.These protoAIs are the same. We can control and measure the input the output but what happens in between is obfuscated by the nature of the process  just like a human brain.When you ask a human to explain their actions we find that what weve received is a rationalization of their actions. We have discovered that a persons brain will act before theyre aware of it. They will press the button and then explain why they did it. This has been described as the tail wagging the dog but I think weve put a bit too much emphasis on consciousness.So were building digital brains and finding that were experiencing the same problems with visibility that we have with human ones. Should we stop utilizing humans for decisions because we do not understand how such decisions are made or if those decisions were even made for the reasons stated by the person?I think its far too early to write off AI just yet for civilian purposes but it should be banned from military use completely.

So you end up with a shitty hybrid that less than half the speed of true high speed rail and none of the necessary safety features.Our only chance is building new system not tied to rail.  Hyperloop apparently is a cheaper high speed transport than maglev and due to the tube is resistant to weather and has no dangers of derailment.,Futurology,dg4x2ih,33,t5_2t7no

These rfuturology threads are some of the worst for it. It isnt even speculative science its full on science fiction and fantasy.There are actually decently large bioreactors e.g. tens of liters for pilot scale experiments that can be washed with detergents andor alkali rinsed and autoclaved. But you better not have to have adherent cells because theyre specifically made to be nonsticky. Theyre still a cnt of a problem to get really clean and contaminant free if you have sensitive applications. Bigger than that large scale sterilization and cleaning starts becoming a hard problem. People can do it but for animal cells the problems are especially hard since the media is so rich. The CHO cell dudes who specialize in mAb production apparently have really good systems but any time I talk shop with them theyre cryptic as hell about some aspects of the design and process. And these are guys that I can usually get shittered with high proof IPAs and learn a lot useful industry info from. Its a bit different if youre fermenting a fucktonne of yeast in a continuous process or growing E. coli. Even then phenotypic shift is an issue. Nature loves a good suppressor mutation and when you have well in excess of  cells kicking about some polymerase is going to cause the right error somewhere and boom a single clone takes over your reactor.Most of these comments about in vitro meat in no way take in to account just how energy intensive it is to make reagents that are pure enough and defined enough to use in cell culture. Let alone plasticware and disposables for any sort of sterile application. Event things like ultrafiltered water and reusable sterile septa start to add up.It really does speak to the fact that most people here never having done a fucking day of cell culture in their life but pretending they understand the technology.I absolutely agree with youre assessment of the associated technologies. If we can make a convincing steak in vitro we can probably grow at least a semifunctional liver with its many types of ducts and zones of semispecialized cells. We might even be able to grow a crude kidney that gets people off of dialysis. Food is the lowest returns application of such technology. Its also really fucking hard to undercut soy pea and wheat protein that can be produced for a few dollars a kilogram of dry mass. ,Futurology,dg76o3l,1,t5_2t7no

Look at the DEA regulation and requirements of simple cannabis  andor MAPS research to LSD for an example of the hurdles and costs. Even at the university levels. Couple this with a conservative government and those in the population that superficially labeling drugs as either bad or good based on their negative connotation from news DEA view of drug addicts or x horror story y street drug instead of understanding that all drugs regardless of type should be viewed more delicately in regards of mechanisms of action and pharmacological profiles for further research and development then one can see this will take some time.

For example in the video at  a big dead fish comes off the conveyor. They should be noting whether dead fish or plant life appeared to be injureduprooted by the machine or if the machine just picked up already dead material. And noting the volume of it.If the machine causes the killinguprooting of animalplant life people need to decide how much collateral damage balances the costbenefit analysis with certain debate about it and whether the machine design can be improved to minimize it.If the machine is just sucking up already dead material its worth noting this volume as it may provide a way of tracking the health of the species postcleanup.Those arent really cons but are points for evaluating its success and potential.,Futurology,dggxup5,13,t5_2t7no

I dont think the downforce would be a big problem. You could just have flying car take off spots and its illegal to take off anywhere you want.
