73102,0,t3_1utdug,I used to feed live Until the accident..........jk I always set the rat at the far end of the cage because my snake had this weird thing of not eating if the rat ever touched her... Like god forbids if it ran over her she wouldnt eat it. I would keep it for weeks after and try again later but nope she wouldnt take it. Anyway I also did this for my snakes safety. Putting the mouse farther away from the snake will allow for the rat to calm down a little you dont want a panicked mouse because a panicked mouse will fight back and It gives the snake the roomability to track itstalk itambush it.. whatever the situation calls for. Just because Im me I think Im gonna say something about feeding mice instead of rats. You should switch to an appropriately sized RAT not mouse. Mice are all bone compared to fat rats and you probably want your boa to switch over to something it will be eating for most of its life. As an added bonus! if your boa is still on mice it must big or rather small enough to eat a fuzzycrawlerweaned rat which is less dangerous than an adult mouse! D,snakes,cemr2pk,2,t5_2ryfw

998913,0,t3_25jfnd,Hi OP!With regard to your question about particularly docile snakes I think ball pythons are exactly what youre looking for.  I dont have a snake of my own but Ive always been pretty fascinated by them.  I went to a local reptile expo and had the chance to hold a ball python.  Theyre the puppies of the snake world and when in doubt their choice is to roll up into a little ball hence the name.  Theyre notoriously docile slow moving and even tempered.  Theyre also much too small even at their max size to be a threat to a human. I was unsure of myself but the one I held at the expo just sat in my hands while I chatted with the vendor that was selling him.  They feel sort of like soft cool leather that warms up from the heat of your hands.  It was really something and kind of flattering that hed just chill out quietly.  If he were faster moving or moved at all really I would have been insecure about my ability to hold him but he just camped out and hung out with me.  I know its a lot to ask if you have a strong fear of snakes I am absolutely phobic of bears and I can relate to the way youve described your avoidance of snakes but if you can muster up the strength to go to a reptile expo I had a really incredible experience.  From this subreddit I thought that I would have liked corn snakes more but they moved too quickly for me to feel like I could handle them without dropping them or doing something wrong.  This picture gets passed around a lot but its true    ,snakes,chhu19g,2,t5_2ryfw

2370961,0,t3_2mh8r7,A somewhat serious answer... It depends on the personality of your snake. I have some snakes that genuinely seem to enjoy any amount of time they get to spend outside of their cage play time. I can put Norman my  yr old male Ball Python around my neck and proceed to do chores around the house and he seems quite enthralled and curious about everything I am doing  never stressed or anxious. I have other snakes that seem much happier and stress free if just left alone to observe the outside world in the confines of their safe little house.Here is Norman during the holidays last year  he was totally ok wearing his little santa hat all around the house. ,snakes,cm4rcac,2,t5_2ryfw

Not that I dont like mice Ive had them as pets before. Its just different when you know its a pet versus pet food. What I do doesnt include slamming the head. I just pop it in and it sniffs around until its grabbed in a flash. I dont think it even realizes whats happening until its too late. Asphyxiation takes less than a minute and it doesnt even result in broken bones according to this article   Yeah its not quite the sleeping process that prekilled go through but the process is so quick that I personally think its okay.

2434579,0,t3_2nboo5,Finding your rat is a question that is better answered elsewhere. Look into pest control venues for that solution. Chances are your rat has indeed found somewhere to cram himself into and you will have to set traps and hope he doesnt find a nice little nook with access to food where he doesnt feel like getting out.There is a bigger issue to approach though of course  feeding an active live prey item. Feeding FT is way easier and more manageable if your python will accept it and its worth trying a few things to make that work if it doesnt seem cooperative at first. If it absolutely needs a live prey item then your next option should be prekillingstunning before popping the rat in. If your rat was of sound enough mind and body to jump out and run away to hide I think its safe to say that it wasnt knocked out before being offered to your snake. There are plenty of resources on prekillingstunning live food.Live feeding of an activeunstunned rodent should be your last option.,snakes,cmcmbvq,0,t5_2ryfw

There is a LOT of misinformation out there regarding snake keeping especially if you get info from pet store employees we hate them they suck. ataraxia is giving very good advice. Until you can afford a larger tank check out petco for the gallon sale its a great way to buy glass tanks get another hide in there any way you can. Even if its made out of cardboard make sure it doesnt start growing mold though!. Hides dont have to be expensive.Definitely take the time to do more reading ask specific questions of the people here and elsewhere on the internet and watch videos from respected breeders.Heres a perfect video that goes over pretty much everything you need for ball python care For feeding the size of the prey item depends on the size of the snake. The guidelines ataraxia gave you is good. You can also estimate based on the largest part of the snakes body the food item should be about the same size as the biggest diameter of the snake. Itll seem huge compared to the snakes head but trust us shell eat it. One big food item every  days is good for a sub adult. An adult can move up to  days. Heres a good video explaining it theyre mostly talking about baby ball pythons but the basic concept is the same Edit also if you can please try and switch her to frozen rats! Feeding live is a big nono unless the snake wont eat frozen.,snakes,cmkb5ma,3,t5_2ryfw

You acknowledge this when you explain that you feed in a dirty box to allow the scent to get your snake in feeding mode. It may keep your tank cleaner but I disagree that it will keep you safer. I personally dont disturb my snakes when its feeding time. Taking them out of their enclosure and putting them in a box is stressful and stress if bad for the feeding response.

2721378,0,t1_cndd9wc,Im actually using a CHE ceramic heating element rather than a light. The reason for that is because both the CHE and the UTH can be monitored by a thermostat. I use a proportional thermostat that adjusts the power to both heating elements to maintain a consistent temp. I would not recommend using a heat lamp for this. They cant be be monitored by a thermostat and would probably get way too hot. In addition to that the heat lamp is not actually touching the plastic. I cut a circular hole in the lid slightly larger than the lamps diameter and covered it with heatresistant mesh from an old terrarium lid. The lamp sits right on the mesh a good half inch away from the plastic itself. The plastic mesh is also fused to the lid by melted plastic so escapes are impossible.There are some tutorials of other people doing this online.

You can section off a part of it for the snake so it does not feel scared in such a large home but trust me on going big at first because I went through  tanks in  years and it was a waste. Also buy frozen ratsrabbits online in bulk. I get a years worth at a time and have a separate garage freezer to store them in. Lastly I would have a spray bottle of whiskey ready nearby when handling a large snake. My boa bit me on the hand and started to wrap around my arm and I calmly walked over to the bottle and sprayed her in the mouth and she released me immediately. Maybe wear gloves if yours is temperamental because one bite can really do some damage when they are huge. Burmese pythons are great and I have friends who own them but I love my boa and she is estimated to max out at  feet. She grew to  feet in two years and that was surprising but her mom was larger than average.,snakes,cot8ci2,1,t5_2ryfw
3201352,0,t3_2wsvxr,Have you tried checking the Fauna Classifieds? I like Kingsnakes but many of the postings seem to get drowned out in the hugescale retailers. For example I noticed Backwater Reptiles has some CRBs for sale but they dont exactly have a good reputation so I dont recommend them.But IMO the best way to find a good breeder is to talk to breeders! For example you can probably easily find a BRB breeders website or facebook page. Even though they may not sell CRBs you can shoot them a message inquiring if they knowcan recommend one of their buddies who might be into that particular species. ,snakes,cottiki,2,t5_2ryfw

This behavior is a recent trend among showboat fools on social media and results in bites.

3549179,0,t3_30whov,Im not really sure where you are in the world but is it the beginning of spring in your area?A lot of male snakes go off of food in the spring because their bodies are telling them that food is less important than breeding.  This would coincide with your snakes increased activity level hes searching for female snakes.  Sometimes lowering your temps a couple of degrees can help settle a male down.  Otherwise youll just have to wait him out.  Usually after males figureout there are no females around they calmdown.  This can take anywhere from a couple of weeks to a couple of months.  Since disregarding the refusal due to shed your snake has only been off of food for two weeks I wouldnt worry too much.  If he seems to be rapidly loosing body weight or if his abdomen seems to be swelling more Id consider a vet.  Otherwise just continue to offer food every  days.  He should calm down and accept food once the temps evenout and he accepts there are no females around to breed with. ,snakes,cpwtv83,3,t5_2ryfw

3972474,0,t3_35nqd9,It will probably be easier in the long run to relocate the tank to the cooler floor though if its a huge hassle to move the tank the snake will be fine on the warmer floor.  Remember Corns are native as far north as New Jersey and as far south as Florida.  Between the heat and the humidity of a Florida summer  degrees can feel downright chilly.If you need to keep the snake on the warmer floor there are a few steps you can take to keep him cool.  First make sure his water bowl is large enough for him to soak in.  Soaking is one way reptiles lower their body temperature.  Second provide a moist hide on the cool side of the tank.  Partially fill a hide on the cool side of the tank with damp reptilesafe moss sphagnum moss and beaked moss marketed as forest moss are commonly sold in pet stores.  Rewet the moss every couple of days by misting it or resoaking it.  The moss will provide the snake with a cool damp escape from the heat.  If you use a substrate like cocohusk Eco Earth or cypress mulch Forrest Floor you can keep the bottom layer of the sub damp by pouring a little water into the corner of the tank every  days.  This will allow the snake to burrow into cool damp sub.,snakes,cr93fqe,1,t5_2ryfw

But I really think were in agreement here as like I said I would have moved him up when appropriate I already have another  gallon exoterra among others I just buy them whether I need them or not when I find a good price still in the box in storage I just would have to do some rearranging to make space for it and its little big for a hatchling. I really agree about the surviving vs. thriving thing. I actually work in a pet shop and Im always weary when people say Ill move them to a bigger tank when its time so Im actually usually on your end of the argument but in this case its true  I will say though that I still dont see anything wrong with the setup I was talking about for a juvenile and Im looking to maybe get tessera in the near future and wouldnt hesitate to put him in it for the time being.     I havent taken any pics yet but will try to get some up soon. He really is just a hatchling so Ill need a decent camera to get a good shot of him but hes a hypo bloodred striped motley so an absolutely beautiful snake. Similar to this but probably with striping a bit stronger than the motley and maybe more solid color as this one seems a little faded out towards the back.

This list includes things like pastels spiders pinstripes OG black back etc. Also albinos and pieds occur naturally and were imports just at much lower rates. As the hobby took off oddities began appearing as breeders worked to prove out what we call dinkers. These typically mild phenotypes sometimes had unexpected effects when matched with other genes that happened to focus around the same allele enter the BEL complex Het Red AxBlack PastCinnyHuffman etc. Sometimes genes seem to appear as just a random mutation ex. Stranger.

5253050,0,t1_cvixxns,The thing is though you will see a wild snake with the wobble. For some reason theres a stigma with these genes that its strictly the breeders faults. Thats certainly not the case. The glitch in the gene was there long before we got our hands on it. You have absolutely every right to dislike certain parts of the industry I personally hate cross breedingespecially between genus! just make sure youre knowledgable about it. Theres a lot of misconceptions out there about responsible breeding and defects in morphs. Most of the time its natural and breeding isnt responsible. But there are a few cases where of course thats not true. Comparing this situation to dogs is a bit far fetched. Remember that dogs difference by breeds and some breeds actually have deformities that cause issues with every day life. Think brachycephalic. Thats quite a significant difference between whats going on in the snake industryand this might be why some amateurs have such an issue with it. Theyre not really comparable except that its the breeders responsibility to be cautious when dealing with those specific animals. Perhaps I can ease your mind a bit we have a Jaguar Carpet Python which also display the wobble defect commonly seen in spiders. Because we got him from a reputable knowledgable breeder with a wonderful name and lineage on his animals the snake is practically wobble free. The only time youll ever notice something is off when hes over stimulated and then all he does is try to dig his face into your arm or whatever. Either way the choice is ultimately yours. Just try to be respectful and honestly listen to everyone in the industry you can. Like I said theres a lot of misconceptions out there about all this.  ,snakes,cvj6itj,1,t5_2ryfw

This is particularly true of bearded dragons.  Most just wont use a water dish even if theyre dangerously dehydrated.  Standing water in deserts is usually stagnant and foul so its actually better to not drink it.

5515968,0,t3_3qnd6m,Misting doesnt provide humidity it provides wetness.  That said if you have a bedding that can be made wet and provide humidity like EcoEarth that would work.  But misting would still be inefficient because it wont wet the bedding enough for more than few hours humidity.  I pour a few gallons of water into my  enclosures bedding mix it up and let the RHP and CHE dry out the top and the rest of the bedding slowly releases moisture for  weeks.  Im able to keep humidity at like  in this way.  You dont want it wet enough to be a swamp just a little damp so it will dry out in a reasonable amount of time so your snake doesnt get scale rot.  No water should come out if you squeeze the bedding.Restrict ventilation as much as possible this is why screen top tanks such so much they allow all of the humidity to escape out of the top.  Moss is perfectly safe to use as long as you arent using moss from your yard pet stores sell sphagnum moss which is great for humidity.  It would be more costeffective to get something like EcoEarth and just top it with moss instead of using moss only.  Sphagnum moss is sold in really small boxes for like  and you can get  blocks of EcoEarth for like  or  on Amazon.  Two sets of  blocks is enough bedding for my x enclosure so youll get a lot of bedding.  Its just tedious to expand.,snakes,cwgpr1i,1,t5_2ryfw

5949525,0,t1_cxzao2v,gt From what we have read and this is part of the problem since it is hard to gauge expertise of the writer it is better to feed in separate enclosure so as not to confuse the BP during handling with feeding response.Many people on here will tell you this is a myth and for the most part it is. However snakes with unpredictable temperaments and strong feeding responses can become conditioned to being a bit nippy especially if their main human interaction is feeding. Some species like kingsnakes and womas are more prone to it than docile species like ball pythons.There are a few simple surefire way to prevent accidental bites. The first is to practice good hygiene and wash your hands before and after handling the snake. This should be the rule ANYWAY.The second thing you should do is hook train your snake. Contrary to the name this does not actually require a snake hook. All you need is an appropriately longandslender item an unsharpened pencil a papertowel tube a ruler the handle of a spatula or wooden spoon etc. Before reaching in to handle your snake gently tap its neck behind the head never on the facehead directly and along the length of its body. This tapping will serve two purposes to make sure your snake is awake and to inform your snake that its going to be handled. After tapping the snake reach in and gently scoop it up from below do not grab from above. Perform this tapping EVERY TIME you interact with the snake outside of feeding whether it be simple cleaning or an actual handling session. DO NOT tap the snake before feeding it.Over time your snake will associate the tapping with handling and will learn to turn off its feeding response when tapped. Ive had snakes move to strike at me see temperamental snakes with strong feeding responses only to immediately recoil with a single tap behind the head from my hook.,snakes,cxzih7q,2,t5_2ryfw

6226981,0,t1_cyw31iz,I am beginning to be more wary of the pet stores advice now... yes the people I talked to were snake owners and not all of them were young teenagers but I am still getting kind of nervous about what they are advising just because I have not heard the same advice from anyone else. Regarding feeding we actually checked on him this morning and suddenly his eyes were clear and his skin looked shiny and new and bold colored! We thought he shed but we could not find the skin anywhere. We thought he may have eaten it because the pet store said they sometimes do that and that it can be bad for them. So we changed his bedding just in case the skin was still in there. We planned on starting his feeding routine tonight but we are now reading online that snakes sometimes get clear eyes and nice skin one or two days before shedding and then they actually lose their skin. Have you had that experience? We decided to hold of on feeding until we actually see skin. He should be okay since we last fed him last week Thursday right? It is my understanding that he will be okay going without eating until he sheds but please correct me if Im wrong. Once hes gotten up from sleeping in his burrow when I poke around misting moss and refilling his water dish he has been much more active and lively than he was when he had the milky eyes. Hes zooming around his cage and exploring his hideaways more energetically than before. Im assuming they get pretty lethargic during the milky eyed stage and when they are just about to shed they are more energetic?Our hideaway does look a bit like that first one you showed  it is a little larger with two wide openings. We put one of the openings against the wall of the tank and stuffed it with moist moss. Maybe I should look into getting a little box like the Lemonheads one! Although my boyfriend was afraid that he got stuck under his water dish since we never saw him leave it until we lifted the dish off him... I dont blame him since he was in a perfectly sized burrow in the woodchips for his body but still could a snake really get stuck? Burrowing is what they do! ,snakes,cyxfunk,1,t5_2ryfw

6632824,0,t1_d05dopf,Read what I said above about how I decide.  You need to do more research on your own as well.  No one is going to spoon feed you specific directions like when the snake hits . inches it is ready for the next size enclosure.  You need to use your own judgment when you get to that point.  You should have a feel for the snakes needs by then.  I really dont like to be more prescriptive about these things than I was above because they arent hard and fast rules.  Theyre just general guidelines and principles primarily based on my own experiences and extensive research.  Some people will keep a snake in a  qt tub until its way bigger than I would keep it there.  Some people think tubs are cruel.  Others will tell you its the best. All of these groups of people have had success keeping healthy animals that eat and readily breed in captivity. Ive been down the road if telling people exactly what to do with beardies in the past and it doesnt really work  people dont ever learn on their own they just do what theyre told like its a piece of Ikea furniture.So do your own research get comfortable with the basics ask questions if you really cant figure something out and make the leap when you feel like you know everything.  The fun part comes when you get the animal and realize that all of that research and effort makes you feel comfortable ... until something goes differently. I knew full well what brumation was before I got my beardie but the first time he went into brumation I was tearing my hair out.  The first time a snake refused food I was freaked out. The only way to really learn is to read everything you can get actual experience and ask questions as things come up.,snakes,d05e3k4,1,t5_2ryfw

A couple of weeks later I might feed just the females and wait a few more days to feed the males. Sometimes Ill just skip feeding for everyone for  to  weeks.

I would say even regular lamps can be placed on the floor to trick them. Dont worry about having her eat as snakes can survive long periods without food. The main concern is the cats and dogs. If possible they could stay for a while with someone else. This way she would be eliminating every chance that the snake would be eaten or killed.

It might be possible to supplement meat so that it contains this stuff but then you have the question of whether the snake wants to eat it. Snakes eat whole animals in the wild and they use the smell of the head and the brain to figure out what is food and which end to bite it on. Snakes love brain. Anyway with a mouse you have a complete meal that the snake actually wants to eat.

Boa constrictors hold a dear place in my heart they get a very decent size but grow very slowly it can take upwards of  years to get to their final size.  Their metabolisms are the slowest of all the ones you listed so an adult would be eating every  weeks preferably with a  day winter fast each winter and babies from birth to  years old can eat every  days.BRBs are very sensitive to heat you will need a way to keep them cool if it gets above F in the snake room.  Extended exposure without an escape can cause neurological damage or death.  These guys are slow growers too but dont get very big.  They average  with  being pretty much the max.Both species eat incredibly well unless husbandry is off although BRBs are a little more prone to refusing food again they are sensitive to heat and low humidity.Snakes are shipped all the time the majority of my snakes werewill be shipped.

This tutorial and this explanation give a pretty good overview of what Im talking about.

Having something that would consistently drain water into the substrate is a recipe for disaster you really dont want that. I would honestly suggest ditching the tank and going for an enclosure that minimizes airflow. Sterilite or Rubbermaid tubs work well and so do PVC enclosures such as Boaphiles and Animal Plastics. I have some of each of the PVC enclosures. It makes BP care simple. The only difference between the two is that Boaphiles are a bit more costly and come fully assembled AP cages are cheaper but require assembly which is incredibly simple.,snakes,d7o163x,4,t5_2ryfw

Its one thing putting a single long sheet of heat tape in a rack set up and another to put a bunch of separate standalone tubs on their own heat tape sections and jacking them up to a single probe or multiple CHEsRHPs.

10920160,0,t1_de5ofdy,I feed her one mouse per week in her enclosure by putting down either newspaper or toweling to prevent her from ingesting substrate. I believe that doing this greatly cuts down on the stress of moving her outside the cage when she can strike from inside her favorite hiding places. She is not cage aggressive and seems to understand that when I do not have the feeding tongs that she is not getting food and gets to come out.Also I would recommend something a little longer if at all possible... that size tank sounds too small for it to move away from the heat if need be. I have found that the mini zoo med heat pads which are probably still too big for that size cage also do not distribute heat evenly as even with a thermostat it will go from  degrees hotspot in one small area to immediately room temperature with no in betweens.You can also modify a plastic tub from say Walmart for very cheap that is what I used for my rosys first enclosure back when she was  inches. It was  by  and I do not think it was too big for her as I placed lots of places to hide climbing branches and bedding. The murkiness of the tub walls add to their security though it unfortunately does not make for the greatest display tank.  I used a screw driver in lieu of a drill to twist air holes into the tubs and keep the lid locked on with  of those big binder clips.

Like hognose snakes house snakes Kenyan sand boas etc.  I personally would never house an adult bp in a rack I feel they benefit too greatly from increased enclosure heights.  I have yet to see a rack that was  in height most are maybe  max.  I have had to house my bp in a standalone tub but I didnt like it.  He had barely enough room for two hides and a small water dish he seems to be much happier in his xx enclosure.  Hes out more eats extremely well and basks often at night.  Hes been eating even before I switched him so I cant give the viv all of the credit but I notice a lot more varied behaviors than in his tub.Hes probably out more than you think at night and adding cover can help to encourage a snake to come out more since they can move around without being seen.  Each snake will have independent activity levels too of course.PVC enclosure are pretty easy to clean you dont have to move them or lift them to clean.

Id probably go for that over the reptifogger  I feel like those are sort of overkill for a BP.For the enclosure itself Id switch from aspen to a substrate thats better for humidity like cypress or coco coir and make it quite deep in the enclosure. Aspen isnt ideal for humid enclosures because it molds quickly if kept damp. With cypress or coir you can boost humidity by soaking a few handfuls and scattering it back through the enclosure. You can also pack some damp sphagnum moss in corners behind decor etc and do the same thing. Ideally you want your humidity to sit around . If you cant keep it there consistently its a good idea to give the snake a humid hide so that it can regulate humidity itself. Take any enclosed container like a tupperware cut a hole for the entrance and line it with damp sphagnum moss and maintain that.When you upgrade to the snakes adult home Id look into other options that are better designed for maintaining temps and humidity like PVC or other frontopening enclosures. I used a tank for a few months and its just a lot easier once you make the switch!,snakes,deveubh,3,t5_2ryfw

11203170,0,t1_df1sve8,No snake should be cohabbed.  They are not social creatures and there is always a risk of cannibalization or dominance.  The less dominant snake often but not always will be smaller and lighter than the more dominant one even if theyre eating the same because of stress and lack of access to resources.Unless you have them in an enclosure several times larger than what is needed for a single KSB Id say a  gallon tank at the very least and no Im not exaggerating you need to make room for both snakes to choose areas away from each other without prioritizing dominance displays plus multiple hides multiple hot spots a good selection of moist areas etc. they should not be cohabbed.  Even then they still have physical access to each other so things can still go wrong but at least that way its being done somewhat responsibly.,snakes,df1v598,7,t5_2ryfw

11566669,0,t3_6534iz,I am going to be going to a reptile show on the nd of this month.  I plan on picking up a Pie Bald Ball Python and have done extensive research on caring for a snake.  Now the only things I still need is a place for it to stay.  I plan on purchasing everything this week and having everything all set up so when I get the snake home I can just drop himher off in the tank and let it relax.  Is there anything about this kit that off sets someone?  Am I missing anything I had a list on amazon all made out Amazon  Ignore everything not snake related.  The total cost of that wouldve been somewhere around  dollars.  And that doesnt come with a tank so I would still need to purchase one.  Any tips or pointers would be greatly appreciated.

Theyre also very wiggly so not the best choice if you want something calmer. But if thats something that works for you a well started garter snake is easy to care for and is probably the snake family with the most minimally rodent based diet that is a good starter snake. Mine are also very friendly despite their  wiggliness and usually come up to the glass when I come by so they can see if I am feeding them. Sometimes if I open the tank theyll also hang their bodies halfway out and flick their tongues against my face. ,snakes,dg7ojd4,3,t5_2ryfw
