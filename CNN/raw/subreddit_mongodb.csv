2135615,0,t1_clb9zzm,But wait your database files are still there maybe the data is marked as deleted which could means as long as you dont insert new data into the dbs the data could be still there.Try to take a look into the files with an hex editor mongo uses BSON internally for storing data.I hope you didnt tried a repair database,mongodb,clba7ry,1,t5_2rjwd

4136555,0,t1_crro8om,My current project with mongo uses python with tornado using the motor driver to make the connection asynchronous.  Ive also used mongo with the Go language and while it works pretty well I felt like the static typing of Go was sort of antithetical to mongodbs noschema approach so I recommend scripting languages for mongodb since they go together so easily.,mongodb,crrsb8l,1,t5_2rjwd
4282258,0,t3_39zmxf,WT is faster in almost every case with the exception being primarily readonly environments. WT also has compression.Heres the bottom line. MongoDB bought WiredTiger because MMAPV wasnt scaling. Its not the default in . as they iron out kinks but it will be the default in ..Skate to where the puck is going to be. go w WT. It also has compression built in.,mongodb,cs8bvep,2,t5_2rjwd

4747336,0,t3_3fwmi8,    show dbsWill give you a list of all databases on that server.    db.inventory.findTells mongo to use the current database look in collection inventory and return a cursor object with no filter.It also looks like youre having an authorization issue for that you need to initiate mongo with the proper credentials typically this is formatted like    mongo hostport authenticationDatabase admin u username pAnd then entering in your password. Note that admin may not be the actually authenticationDatabase this would depend on where the user is added at.,mongodb,ctsy3e2,1,t5_2rjwd

8288474,0,t1_d5daq0t,OK I understand. So two thoughts here. Your schema sucks  fix it. You need to do some collection scanningSo lets talk about option  firstHaving lots and lots of documents with an incoherent schema doesnt really work in Mongo. Its a perfect example of just because you can do it doesnt mean that you should.So how could you have done it better. Well this is quite easy          id  ObjectIddfedeb      name  userService      service          serviceType  user        user          password  password        url                          id  ObjectIddfedeb      name  carrierService      service          serviceType  carrier        user          password  password        url                      id  ObjectIddfedeba      name  locationService      service          serviceType  location        user          password  password        url             Note the coherent schema  all of the documents now look the same. Im also enable to create a sensible index set    db.apiConnections.createIndex  service.type   service.url    ...which will allow me to query the data in a sensible way. make allowance for the stuff I talked of in the original postSo lets talk about your current somewhat suboptimal schema. For this Id break open some code and start wading through the documents  you really have no choice because of the model youve chosen here. You can however cheat a little    db.apiConnections.find.forEachfunctionrow         for var key in row             if key.matchService                 var url  rowkey.url                if url.matchdatastub                     printkey      url                                         This is written in Javascript and will run directly in the Mongo shell. Its loops through the docs in the collection and for each loops through the keys until it finds something with Service in it and then checks if the url matches the wildcard. Simple.Obviously this sucks for anything with more than a handful of documents. There is absolutely no way to make this not suck apart from going back to the schema and starting again Hope this helps.,mongodb,d5dm9kv,2,t5_2rjwd
8293723,0,t3_4t0x7k,OK this solves your problem    db.customer.insert     id        id        id        id        id        id        id        id        id        id        id        id        id        id        id        id        id           db.customer.createIndex  id        var lastCustomerId  null    db.customer.find.sort  id   .forEachfunctioncustomer         ifcustomer.id ! lastCustomerId             db.uniqueCustomer.insertcustomer                lastCustomerId  customer.id         db.uniqueCustomer.find.sort  id    Ive assumed that your nonunique customerId field is id. If you run this against an empty DB! you should end up with a new collection containing just  documents rather than the original  with duplicate ids.Note If youre running against m docs Id use a batch operation for the insert but Ill let you read the docs for this ,mongodb,d5e9w9m,1,t5_2rjwd
