9552518,0,t3_5bpw3k,Go to the pingpong root page on xda just need to look for your exact handset version on the page for compatibility. They even how it down to carrier. I think that app might work. You said you tried others. Like kingroot? Lots of versions.  Oneclickroot? All the others i know are pc required. Xda is a good place to search out other things you might want to do with you handset as well. ,root,d9qjn2l,1,t5_2qjol

11008071,0,t1_defphny,Well even old flagship phones are going to be more than  usually. Basically I would stick with the major brandsSamsung HTC etc and then check for rooting instructions and ROMs associated with phones that you like given your parameters. You can narrow down the search results in amazon quickly. Outside of that its up to you to choose one.,root,defqfpz,2,t5_2qjol
