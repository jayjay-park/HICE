152067,0,t3_1vph1w,Currently in first year engineering and Im staying at St Mikes! A bit far from the engineering buildings  mins but the area and people are great! The social life is awesome and you get to meet many people outside of engineering although there are still plenty of engineers here too. Mostly everyone is in first year too. Buildings are quite old which I like so the rooms arent the newest but they are spacious. Food is pretty decent too! Although other good choices would definitely be UC or New College. Itd try to avoid Chestnut if you can since its so far but Ive got plenty of friends who enjoy staying there too. Honestly not matter what res you end up in youll have a good time!

Studentrun mentorship programs help students get their feet on the ground as they start university and one of the most common questions we get is How do I study for this test? Professors themselves even dish out their own advice at times. In light of the free support resources that the University has established and volunteerbased student initiatives I think you would need to present a very strong case to students for what distinguishes your tutoring service from others and why yours is worth the investment. ,UofT,cg9cwg2,9,t5_2rbaq

Almost every time my partners would invite me to eat with them and I loved it!Their food is the best hands down. Especially breakfast. I would also say that St Mikes ties with Chestnut when it comes to food quality. Didnt visit St Mikes nearly as often as I did chestnut though. New College is terrible. Especially their pizzas. Ate there about  times over  years and I dont know why I even went that many times...If I stayed at chestnut I would go for carte blanche and get the packed lunch for weekdays or if you have a long break in between classes walk back to eat!. A friend of mine actually skipped afternoon classes at times just to eat back at chestnut. Ive seen what the packed lunches are sandwich cookies fruit drink and they look no different from the edible part of New College. Of course res food does get old no matter what and chances are youll want to eat out at a proper restaurant from time to time.

2348159,0,t3_2m8jgb,Based on what Ive heardexperienced with my friends at McGill it has a much livelier social scene and perhaps even a broader international reputation McGill was widely considered the Harvard of Canada until fairly recently. Queens has less of an international reputation but has a much more tight knit community. Ive literally never heard a bad thing about Queens. Maybe that Kingston doesnt have good food selection. Thats it.From my brief experiences with friends in UC it is not a very social residence. Someone from UC may entirely correct me on this fact. St. Mikes is a party residence I believe so you may have better luck there.Youve walked around campus. How did you feel? Did you feel happy and at home? Like you could spend  years of your life there? Did you tour the other schools  how did you feel about them?Im in engineering  cant speak to the ArtSci thing specifically. But based on my brief experiences with a handful of artsy ArtSci courses yes it is that time consuming. And that difficult  the amount of extra work required to get from high s to low s was quite substantial.Edit Engineering is one of the most social programs and I still find the school incredibly antisocial.

2510578,0,t1_cmm0a1s,You raise a good point about the violence committed against men and children but the white ribbon campaign exists because of the circumstances surrounding the Ecole Polytechnique shooting in addition to violence that occurs against women every day. The existence of a  Violence Against Women day doesnt mean that all other types of violence against different groups of people should be ignored in preference to women. That is not the intent of that anniversary. For that day yes the focus is on women but that doesnt mean that women want all other types of issues ignored in preference to them. Violence Against Women Day isnt trying to shit on other issues of violence that affect other people. Its merely focusing on one aspect that affects society.Why is tomorrow for women only and not for society in general? Context. When we look at violence in such a broad scope we tend to overlook the details. There are different causescontextsetc. of violence that effect women differently than it would affect men the elderly children different races and ethnicities etc. Anyone can be affected by violence but the reasons for violence can be a result of many different things based on who you are manwoman elderlychild race sexuality etc. Thats why there are different days focused on different issues and different groups of people.It would be great if Mens Rights Activists and Childrens Rights Activists etc. could create similar eventsfundraisersetc. that are similar to the December th Ecole Polytechnique anniversary. And to be honest many of these activists already do these things. As a supposed equalrights society this should be imperative. However dont diminish the issues many women face just to bring other issues to light. Respect should be had on all sides.

2717630,0,t3_2r6o3r,Sorry to hear youve been stressed about school.  Ive never been depressed so I cant completely understand what youre going through but I think weve all hit that fragile state of mind at some point in our university years. Heres a few things I did during those times Fake it til you make it. Forcing yourself to smile faking excitement and pretending to be more into a subject than you actually are can help you in the long run. Consider dropping from fulltime status to parttime. You can always go to summer school or add a course in later semesters once you get back on your feet. Be brutal in your course selection. If you know in your gut that a course will give you too much stress drop it.  Make a friend in every class. I know it can be impossible but really make an effort to sit next to someone and start a conversation in every class. Its easier to attend that class when you look forward to seeing someone every week. Rant. Ranty rant rant. Set up a Tumblr or online journal and just write a slew of words to express yourself. Sometimes you need to just write it all out in order to move on. If youre getting professional help considering applying to Accessibility Services. You can get test accommodation which is pretty sweet  your own cubicle or private room to write in private bathrooms break room with couches and a fridge and theyll push tests to make them when youre able to write  like if you prefer to write in the mornings. Take a fun interest course! Sometimes taking all your courses from the same department can get you stuck in a rut. Choose something totally different and unusual whether it be a language or film or theatre or art. Youll meet an entirely different set of individuals than the program youre in guaranteed. Consider looking into a yoga class around campus. No one believes yoga works until they go to a class. Ive never met anyone who disliked it. Treat yourself. After every test buy a slice of cake. Go get a hot chocolate. Go to a bar. Do something fun. Do something to remind yourself that you have an identity beyond student and your academic life is only a small portion of who you are.Youll be okay. One day at a time.,UofT,cnczes0,5,t5_2rbaq
2760255,0,t3_2rocap,HelloArtsampSciences is a vast faculty with plenty of transfer students certainly transferring to upper levels is doable. Youll declare the courses youve completed during your transfer application and quite possibly many of those will be registered as completion of direct equivalent courses here. In case theres a course youve completed wanted to transfer but was not accepted itll usually still count for general credit completion towards your graduation so you might still be able to use them if youre some credits shy of graduating later. I was able to transfer about  credits out of  or so. My current specialization is asking for  credits total to give you a rough idea.A general thing to be aware of is that were all considered students of the ArtsampSciences faculty in our first year and we become students of the individual department after picking our POSt. Check how the department you want to apply to requires for their admission into the POSt. If youve already met their requirements youll likely have a smooth transition into your department.If any of this sounds alienese to you check out the admissions page.

Hippofant referred to the relevant history in another comment though without a hard source. The funding package is something that combines income in a way that involves a BUNCH of different levels of administration and our statuses as both grad students and TAs. Grad student funding packages arent something worked out in collective bargaining whereas TA pay is making this the best opportunity to get some movement on the total figure.

4350649,0,t3_3auefg,Computer science is a branch of Mathematics. If you pursue a CS degree you are going to be studying a lot of math. If you arent at least decent in math you might get overwhelmed by the difficulty. Also the math you encounter at university is a lot different from whats taught at most high schools. Most university math revolves around proving mathematical statements to true or false. If this sounds unfimiliar try searching for more info on google. My advice is to find an intro to proofs text book and work through it on you own this summer. How much you enjoy this could be an indicator of how much youll enjoy studying CS.Regarding which calculus to take ideally it should be since the course will teach you more about proofs than the others. You want to gain as much experience with proofs as possible early on since they get quite a bit more difficult in later years.,UofT,csg1tsv,1,t5_2rbaq

Its also irrelevant to my comment though I wasnt saying whether or not the OP was in the right. I was disagreeing with bscit over what professors are allowed to do.Purely out of curiosity from other comments it sounds like that he lost  over not forking a repository not over not communicating. Is there some reason not forking a repository means he couldnt have communicated with his teammate? Have I misread these comments and it was over more then not forking a repository?  Or is the not forking a repository gt no communication an assumption being made?To show where Im coming from I think I might have fallen afoul of this rule. Not because I wouldnt communicate or because I wouldnt do my work. But because my normal work flow is clone repository gt make changes gt commit changes gt fork repository gt make corresponding remote gt push to new remote so I could have not made a fork yet and I definitely dont check Piazza religiously. This is simply out of habit since I clone many repositories without making a public fork of them.,UofT,cvgk4wn,1,t5_2rbaq

Im an exTA for MATA. Heres what you should knowgt MATA will be your hardest course this semester. Natalia and Zohreh have reworked this course. It is no longer the same as last years course. You will be required if you havent seen it already to prove a lot of things  a lot more than we required students last year to prove in MATA. We have also changed the textbook for MATA. The goal is to provide a smoother introduction into MATA so it is not as much of a shock to people. The textbook as a result will be used for both courses. I hope youve had a read through already and appreciate the rigour of the book  its definitely a good one. You will delve into epsilondelta proofs quite a lot more in depth  youll prove some things from Spivaks textbook and after the midterm things will get very exciting. gt CSCAMATA Discrete Math is challenging for many students straight out of high school. What you should know is that Richard and Anna have reworked this course based on feedback from last year. You may have noticed that this course contains weekly exercises. Theyre hoping these will be good practice for the midterm. In my own opinion I believe the grading distribution for this course will be more fair this year as it is more granular. Generally students do worse on this midterm because they underestimate it. Every year its always a shock to people. If you study you will be fine.gt CSCA. Study for this. But all in all watch out for MATA. Its no longer High School Calculus Review. This course is about providing you with the foundations to succeed in MATA  from proofs to techniques in Calculus and theoretical applications.,UofT,cvrphkp,1,t5_2rbaq

So in addition to all of the class hours labs and coursework youd have to stay involved with ECs and volunteering. Not impossible but its incredibly difficult and youd have to manage your time down to the second to make it all work. gtwere they any different than other ece students? I might get blasted for saying this but honestly youd be a bit surprised at how lazy a lot of engineering students are  Many are just looking to get through school at the bare minimum and pass their courses.

Every drama student has to take DRM Drama Form and Content a theory course generally as a prerequisite but if you happen to get into the acting program you then take DRM which is the Introduction to Performing aka scene studies voice and movement courses at the same time as DRM. If you do this make sure you plan your courses really carefully in order to graduate on time. Most people do a double major in drama and english and the courses line up best if you do your first year courses in first year your second year courses in second year etc. Just so you know it is not that common for people to be accepted into the acting program on their first try. They generally like to know that you have taken DRM and sometimes even DRM  th Century Theatre before considering people for DRM.The program itself is great but its not a conservatory. Each year that you are in performing you take three practical classes  performance voice and movement. By the end of your degree they say that you will have basically the equivalent to one year of conservatory training. The academic aspects to your degree are hefty but you will get to work with some amazing and influential figures in the Canadian theatre scene. I hope this helped clear up some of your questions let me know if I can help with anything else.

Like uAnAverageWhiteGuy said look at how much things are worth and what your current marks are to determine the amount of work you put in each. Generally when I had two exams in a row with similar weights and grades going in lets say on monday and tuesday I would typically study something like this. The week before MondayThursday I would split the day and do an even amount of studying for each course. Friday I would spend the majority of the day on the Tuesday exam  then do an hour or two of the Monday exam before bedbefore my studying for the day is over. Saturday and Sunday would be dedicated to the Monday exam and Monday would be dedicated to studying for Tuesday. This probably wont work for everyone but the key is to start early and be diligent. Also make sure you divide the work reasonably. If you have like a  going into the Monday exam but a  going into the tuesday exam its pretty obvious which exam you should focus on. Best of luck!

Also keep in mind you can only transfer . credits. Credits dont transfer perfectly and the program requirements will be different so if you transfer after second year there is a large chance you wont graduate on time. Again go ask the registrar. They know more than any of us do. Good luck!,UofT,cy4ahod,1,t5_2rbaq

6000491,0,t1_cy66qoo,Or many of the students particularly in loweryear courses just dont know how to think outside the box yet. Its especially true of technical science courses like fluid mechanics electronic circuits electromagnetic physics etc. Half the class only studies textbook questions which are just plugging in formulas and not at all adequate prep for exams. They deserve their bad grades  and I say this as someone who used to be one of them and who has a few terrible grades on his transcript Im talking lt .If at least a handful of students managed to score As and Bs on the paper then the exam was simply challenging but fair. The professor has only failed the students if the exam contains topics which were never even looked at during lectures. E.g. if the prof never touched integration for calculus and the calculus exam contains an integration question then its a clearcut case of unfairness and the prof would be in deep shit. ,UofT,cy670yc,4,t5_2rbaq

And every time you fail its painful it causes sadness and especially as I saw last night it causes disappointment. Ive often said a mans character is not judged after he celebrates a victory but by what he does when his back is against the wall. So no matter how great the setback how severe the failure you never give up.You never give up you pick yourself up you brush yourself off you get up and move on and overcome and that is what I believe!So there are those who were so offended by my actions last night that they might have lost faith in me.I absolutely respect your decision to do so. But Im not talking to them Im talking to those people who still believe!Tonight I speak to those who still proudly stand in my corner!

My hometown asian country fast pace lifestyle is changing drastically due to political reasons and i can see people around me change too some to the good side some to the bad side. I got in fights with several friends due to tiny reasons of misunderstanding. I saw my brother break up with his girlfriend. I saw a lot of friends suffer due to relationships and work. My hometown is slowly turning into a messIm starting to understand that relationship between people is not as easy as it sounds. Im starting to have the idea of cutting all ties with people to avoid hurting others or getting hurt.

If not check what sort of options are available near you and compare them to what you can get nearby e.g. I think some colleges offer payperitem style food plans where the cost of your item is deducted from your plan so it may not be worth it if other options exist.Keep in mind that since it is your first year and youre still adjusting you might be exhausted during the term or it might be freezing outside and you might not want to venture out and find something or buy groceries and cook for yourself and dining hall food will suddenly become attractive purely because of convenience. ,UofT,cyvzm9d,1,t5_2rbaq

Its really important in our school. Im in math class so we have more courses in math and physics.My average is around  overall .. Math is Estonian is English Physics Biology chemistry Geography We also have high school exams in Estonian Math and Englishwhich is shit because in the national exam you could only get max B. So Im thinking about doing IELTS or CAE.I also have a ton on extracurricular activities Debating rowing programming acting. Im also doing my thesispractical research paper on Galactosemia screening pilot project in Estonia. I dont know how fancy that is though... Im also a owner of a website development company own  and we are just starting up and doing pretty good already by our standards.My question is how plausible it is to get in U of T for example Life Sciencesmedicine?Or in Rotman Commerce?business managementmarketingeconomics?I also have a problem. Money. Or actually the lack of it. Im sorry I havent totally done my homework in that regard but is there a possibility to get total tuition coverage or atleast some of it OR coverage of livingbooks stuff like that? for undergraduates?Is it possible to work during the school term?Last of all if I broke any rules please let me know!

6515548,1,t3_44v7o5,It depends on the demographics you find attractive and the demographic of the campus. I mostly prefer white girls and some asian girls. At UTSC everyone is brown yea there are asians too but you can count the number of white people you see on one hand as you walk from  side of the campus to the other so for me its extremely rare that I find someone attractive.Program also matters. Step onto the humanities side of the campus at UTSG and suddenly everyone is so much more attractive than on the science part of the campus.Also imo the science student population at UofT as whole is definitely less attractive than the general population when comparing averages. Sitting outside con hall and watching a science class leave  literally hundreds of students but so few are hot. Having said that UTSG has a shit ton of students so there are still so many ridiculously hot chicks I double take every day.Also go to the gym so many more attractive people there.

Or if its a more systemslevel job you might be asked general questions about OS faults and multithreading. If the company also emailed you a link where you can type code in a browser and stream it live to the interviewers then youll have to do a bit of coding.

Im attaching two photos one of the table showing which services are considered basic and which are considered comprehensive and another table that shows how much coverage GreenShield provides us students. As you can see wisdom teeth removal is considered a Basic Oral Surgery and therefore I must only copay  for it. Since the College Street Dental is a GreenShield partner they should be able to give me a student discount of  making my eventual copay . Hence I shouldnt have to pay ANYTHING if I opt to have my wisdom teeth removed at CSD. I will be providing these info to the front desk when I visit them since it seems like the guy who cleaned my teeth was spewing nonsense when he said the dental coverage changed and that Id have to pay out of pocket EDIT Ooh now Im confused again! I just visited the CSDs website and it shows that I really DO have to pay out of pocket if I were to get my remaining wisdom teeth removed.

7741815,0,t3_4lbgw5,If you sign a year long lease its not just forfeiting last months rent you are legally required to pay all  months. You cant just break the lease and only forfeit one months worth of rent. Make sure you understand that because you are absolutely going to get sued if you just leave. So I would expect to lose money. The thing is lots and lots of people leave at the beginning of June. You can try to sublet or otherwise mitigate the cost while you are gone but you have to keep in mind youll be in a situation where there is tons of available housing and much fewer people looking to rent. High supply and low demand means you are probably not going to be able to recoup your money in its entirety. If you look for a month to month or a shorter term youll be paying much more per month than if you had signed a year long lease. ,UofT,d3m6s93,4,t5_2rbaq

You should really not worry about the quality of students at either school youll be able to find amazing people at either place. I wouldnt say its too much harder to find jobs. Coop makes it easier in that you dont have to trawl through pages and pages of searchescareer sites but many of the jobs that are on JobMine are not exclusive to UW students. But in terms of actual employment experience is key. I followed a career progression in terms of summer jobs that most UW students follow as well first summer I did research with a prof second summer I interned with a government agency doing web dev and now this summer I had offers from a prof a startup a mid sized company a gov agency and a Big . As long as you put yourself out there and try to get as much related experience as soon as possible youll be fine in terms of employment and not to worry if your first few placements arent super glamorous not even most UW students start out in SVBig Unicorns. ,UofT,d3npwb0,1,t5_2rbaq

I am even doing a talk this summer on how a dimensional optimal sphere packing lattice works together with something called the monster group to apply to physics.Anyways the point is you can use all of that stuff if you want to do physics. The best place to learn epsdelta is probably khan academy. The jist of it is you are just bounding things in small areas around where you are trying to prove the limitcontinuity.

Full and halfyear courses move at the same pace roughly speaking but I have found that full year courses are harder in that you have to remember more information for final exams or final essays in your case and its easy to divert your attention to halfcourses and lose marks from petty things e.g. tutorial quizzes. Theres a greater emphasis on participation in full year courses.  That being said I do think that full year courses go into greater depth.

Pen writing has a nice clearer tone to it unlike generic HB pencils which smudge left handed and look washed out unless youre pressing hard.    Get notebooks fuck loose leaf paper fuck binders.

8770062,0,t3_5070qd,gt Do you think its fair that students going into eternal debt RIP deserve lesser treatment than students who have parentssavingsRSPsetcHow are you getting lesser treatment?? Youve made an assumption  and stereotyped   that those not on OSAP arent putting themselves into debt or struggling to pay for their education. Those students that cannot qualify for OSAP yes some go to their parents. And those parents put themselves into debt to help finance an education. A debt that students payback after graduating usually at a higher interest rate than OSAP.  I am also a mature student PT a student who doesnt qualify for OSAP because I work and make too much money. My income leaves very little for anything after the necessities so tuition is paid for by scrapping together  and like this fall paying the minimum on my credit card. Id rather owe OSAP than RBC Visa ! For books If need be I use the course reserves at the library. But you dont see me making up false discriminatory scenarios. Hell I think nonOSAP students are discriminated against because I am not getting interest free loans because I make enough income to keep a roof over my head. I am being treated as if I am wealthy. This post makes you sound like a person with a giant sense of entitlement. Horrors that this person at OSAP just wouldnt hit accept on her computer to get you your money.

9236994,0,t1_d8mn0mp,gt I do have a problem with problem sets in general because I dont think they are a whole great use of time that leads to issues i.e some questions being too long and time consuming or not really considered as testable material or people cheating.The use of problem sets is a long and interesting discussion in and of itself. If theyre too long then thats a failure in their design not an issue with problem sets in principle. That said I dont think you have a realistic or correct view of how long they should take. I think the average amount of time one of our problem sets should take is over six hours. Probably closer to ten hours from the time you start thinking about it until the time its fully complete. If our problem sets took  hours to complete or took one hour to complete for most students we would be failing to design good problem sets on a very basic level. A few of the strongest students will finish that quickly and some weaker students may take that long and thats fine. The cheating thing is the big problem with problem sets. Strictly speaking thats a problem with students and their attitude towards the course but its so pervasive that its essentially a systemic issue with problem sets in general. Its really the source of a lot of problems that you probably dont even realize. The biggest issue is that students who complete their problem sets dishonestly get answers from their friends or the internet and get good grades as a result frequently think those good grades are an accurate measurement of their understanding. Then test time comes around and they bomb perfectly fair tests and complain that the tests are too hard. Youll often find that in courses with quizzes Im talking serious quizzes not five minute affairs that are little more than attendance checks for tutorials people do poorly on the first few quizzes but then do much better on tests. Thats because tests are all honest feedback about their abilities. Bombing an early quiz lights a fire under people. Anyway back to problem sets. The great advantage of problem sets is that when theyre well constructed and let me assure you Alfonsos problem sets are very well constructed theyre really invaluable learning aids. I believe that students learn more doing our problem sets than in tutorials in lectures or studying on their own. That is of course only those students who do them honestly. Its hard to let go of using them because of how useful they are for the students that dont cheat on them. Thats not to say that were trying to find a way to let go of them in MAT. I dont think thats ever been on the table.Finally with regard to testable material this is again a fundamental misunderstanding of what is supposed to happen in a math course or at least this math course. Were trying to teach people problem solving skills logical reasoning and deduction skills etc. Testing people on the same problems we put on problem sets would not be useful in measuring the students success with that goal. A student who has memorized the full text of the solutions to every problem set but who has not understood the underlying material should spectacularly fail a test in this course. ,UofT,d8muutx,4,t5_2rbaq

The issue remains in my eyes that the UTSU remains too politically involved for me to favour any kind of funding. It seems that it still operates on the assumption that the political leanings of the UTSU are the defacto leanings that the membership has  when in reality it is not the case and you have a situation or at least the appearance of a situation where I feel like Im being charged money to pay for political activism that contravenes my own beliefs.Whether that is the case or not and I would certainly believe you if you claimed it was not I feel like it is indicative of a serious issue with the union which is that I do not think the union should be involved in student activism. Its role in my eyes is only twofold Collective bargaining power with respect to student tuition and other costs and Student services specifically of the sort like the dental insurance plan.Continue the good work though I continue to be impressed by your engagement.,UofT,d9p7wt2,5,t5_2rbaq

10003265,0,t1_dbbdxlt,I suspect that it does matter somewhat although Ive never heard anything official. The ordering is supposed to help universities understand their retention rate. Basically when a university sends out offers it would like those students to accept those offers otherwise they end up spending more time processing applications and sending out more offers. So if you have students who are considered nearly equal in admissions eyes and one has Uoft ranked st while the other student ranked Uoft th...its in the schools best interests to send the offer to the student who ranked them first. That student is extremely likely to accept the offer as soon as they get it whereas the other student is likely to reject it. Uoft engineering gets a lot of applications and the application packages themselves are very extensive and take time to go through so this is important for engineering not nearly as important for programs in artsscience where youre just admitted based on your average.I dont think ranking them  vs.  would be a big deal.

Thanks.,UofT,dbbjy19,1,t5_2rbaq

10039491,0,t1_daugjbw,Hey! I took calculus online in high school too and no what you described is not the case. You have to inform your school that youre taking calculus online and they should pass on this information to the universities you apply to though I would speak with the university admissions office and ask them if theyve been notified. Universities are concerned with whether youre taking the prerequisite courses is all. Also you have until the university threatens to rescind your offer of acceptance to complete the course which is typically near the end of August. To be safe complete the course before second semester ends notify your school that youve completed the course so that you dont have to notify the universitys admissions office yourself and they will add your calculus grade to your transcript. Good luck! ,UofT,dbg6773,1,t5_2rbaq

10746176,0,t1_ddnkqcf,U of T has a very strong educational curriculum not necessarily because of the amount of material but the depth they make you go through on the assignments  exams. This gives you a very big advantage during interviews or at the work place. I know guys from other schools who know how to program but they dont know what the fuck they are doing. For example conceptually they cannot identify why it is necessary to use a left join or why NOT to use a left join  not null check. Or when they talk about choosing set implementations they use TreeSets because a HashSet does not have an api call to get a list of ordered keys even though they cant recognize why theres two or why using that implementation is costly when you deal with big amounts of data.It is subtle things like these that do give you an advantage even though you may not have side projects... although I dont think work load is an excuse because most of people I know have at least . You can also take project courses and put lots of work into them a lot are very open    courses.By the way I believe finishing your degree in  years without internship experience not necessarily PEY and with no plans for grad school is a very foolish decision to make at least in Canada or the US considering most schools and colleges have some sort of program for this and therefore a big load of the grad population tends to have work experience before work.,UofT,ddodx2r,1,t5_2rbaq

11291786,0,t1_dfa4588,gt I dont see a reason why there needs to be a split.Ok let me reiterategt A splitting of the computer science degree into two a computer science degree and a software deveng degree. Some students can get a cs specialist by taking only real theory course namely csc I see csc more of a stepping stone for . Looking at the midterm and assignments for  there isnt a whole lot of rigor in it. Then there are other students who take more rigorous and theory based courses such as CSC and . These two types of students get the same cs degree but the skills the obtain are completely different.gt Im fine with the requirements now. Ive done only MATMATMAT and Im close to graduating with a specialist. I managed through CSC CSC CSC and CSC without taking the more proof oriented courses MAT MAT etc I dont see why we need to restrict the math courses required for the degree or POST.Just cause youre fine with it isnt an argument for it. The point of taking  isnt too help you with theory courses in cs. Its to broaden your scope. Cs is math and that is one reason why  should be required for the post. Looking back at the  calendar  and  were required. Why are we dumbing down the cs undergrads today?gt I think csc should still be a course because its a first introduction to software engineeringA very poor one at that looking at the most recent offerings of it. And it is an introduction to software engineering which raises the question if it should be required for a computer science program. Science  engineering.gt or at least a course where you work with a considerable amount of people and are expected to complete a major task that requires the efforts of all your team members.Let me walk you through the assignments in this years fall offering of the course. Assignment  solo. Assignment  solo. Assignment  partners the grades of which were solely based off of an interview. Assignment  solo it was reviewing others assignment . It doesnt really teach group work not well at the very least. Further no one needs  months to learn how to work in a group. In highschool wed have group presentations all the time but not once in my  years there were we thought how to work in a group. It was just developed naturally.gt Communication is a such a key concept that I dont think people have mastered in the higher year level courses that involve group projects.I agree communication is key. Its key in much more than computer science. Its key in much more than group projects. Its the framework on which society functions. Are you telling me that rd and th year cs students dont know how to talk to each other? Surely you can understand my scepticism on this claim.gt And also its a course on how to design softwareIn a computer science program. Its an engineering course than and as Ive said above a bad one. It should at the very least be made optional.gt I hear so many horror stories of engineers who have abysmal coding practices because they didnt know about common software practices when undergoing a project or doing their internship. Like what?gt Ive rarely seen so much of this extreme observation among cs students.But computer science  coding. Id like to go back to the idea of a split. Its the software people that should be concerned with this. It really is a soft engineering practice not a computer science practice. Back to  do we really need a course on coding practices lasting  months after already taking  and possibly ? I dont think so. It doesnt take  to  months to adopt convention.gt Even  will also let you know who not to work withIm assuming youre commenting on the possibility of a bad group. Still Im not sure what point youre trying to make here. Please clarify.gt and having colleagues who have the same drive to learn and do more is definitely something I see among students in that class.Real cs students will have a drive presumably to learn real cs material. Software engineers will have a drive presumably to learn to develop software. Csc doesnt offer any real cs knowledge and well below adequate lessons on software. Many students Ive talked to irl and myself walked out of that class not feeling like we learned anything at all.gt I rather propose that either for CSC have students take it later and instead make them take  first. gt was such a strange transition from a group project to  style course.It seems you think that  should not be a prerequisite for . I agree. But it also seems that you think that  should be a prereq for . I couldnt disagree more. There no relevance between the material of the two courses. All this does is push back a useless to be Frank course.gt A specialist to me would require a student to take all fundamental courses while also taking a bunch of CS electives where they can veer off into their specialties.Im not sure what you mean by this. If you mean that cs students should have to choose more cs courses for there electives rather than any arts and science course I disagree strongly. This closes off many courses for a cs specialist. It could make them more closedminded and possibly more ignorant to other legitimate fields of study. They wouldnt be able to explore mathematics physics philosophy English nonfeministnonsjw etc. which have a lot to offer any individual. This in short is why I agree with the breadth requirements. I do agree with the rule where a cs specialist is required to take . FCEs at the  level and I think thats a good number of th year courses as a minimum to take.,UofT,dfbwork,1,t5_2rbaq

Also I actually spent time doing the lab and would have liked to see that included into the marking instead of just the quizzes I understand that might be more work for you.The main issue for me was the vagueness of the assignmentsproject descriptions. Like for Ph my team and a lot of teams ended up doing both front and backend since we didnt know it was just the backend. Also like in A responsive design was listed as an creative feature but it was marked as if it was expected. Also the course stresses on responsive design too much. A lot of web interfaces actually most sites that offer a proper mobile web app use totally different sites for mobile and web. Responsive design should not be forced upon groups. I was a peer mentor stated above and I got a lot of questions on how to get started the instructions provided by the instructor or TA in the lab was not enough. Like for the mongodb lab the github page only told how to run the mongo shell but not how to start the server and there was panic in the lab since the TA had no idea what to do. There were similar situations in other labs too.I had a great team and they tried their best and did a great job but I felt the way we were graded I an others felt that this course is not targeted at beginners and you need some experience. Also I feel labs  Assignments  project is just overkill and you could do a midterm than the assignment since we are basically doing the same thing in the project.
