6259021,0,t3_41bjju,The Space SquidInspired from the creature that was effective against armor and was reported to fly in space using its tentacles even if that doesnt make sense.,istrolid,cz12ypd,1,t5_3656d
6635873,0,t1_d05ogo7,The effect may look a bit similar to tesla but it is not. Beam ray only affects any unit within the sweep area. In fact it attacks an area and it does not not attack a unit. This weapon can actually discourage balling since a since beam ray unit has the potential to hit all units within the area. The beam ray is similar to these kinds of weaponsNotice that these beams do not attack a unit. The beams are either targeting an area or are sweeping a location   watch at  markIn this video we see the Reaper beams behave in a fashion that appears similar to the light and heavy beams. However further on into the video we see that this is not the case Reaper beams behave in a lightsaber fashion cutting through swaths of space like a squid who wields the Force. With the Reapers beams an entire area is affected and all units within the area are hit. There is no blocking the Reapers beams and similarly there is no blocking the beam ray.THE AUTHOR MAINTAINS THAT THE VIDEOS ARE USED FOR REFERENCE ONLY. In contrast to the Reaper beams our existing beams behave like these weapons beam firing unit is the void rayTHE AUTHOR MAINTAINS THAT THE VIDEOS ARE USED FOR REFERENCE ONLY. With that said I present that the proposed beam ray will be distinct from other weapons. In regards to the apprehension that beam rays will make fighters less useful I repeat that beam rays do not attack units directly. In other words the beam ray is not instant hit. Unlike the beam ray the tesla is an instant hit weapon that hit all possible targets within the possible range of the last target affect by the bounce from the original selected target. Teslas are difficult to spoof if not impossible. The proposed beam ray on the other had can be spoofed and can be easily dodged by fast light units fighters. Since it attacks an area fighters and other light units can simply dodge the attack by leaving the area that the beam ray will sweep. In fact it is arguable that the beam ray is effective on large units that cannot dodge the sweep. This is helpful versus cruiser balls as it discourages players from grouping together powerful units. It can exist as a low alpha alternative to the plasma ring the plasma ring is effective versus lone units and the beam ray is effective versus grouped units. If anything it may rival tesla when it comes to attacking multiple units at range. Such is indeed teslas advantage. However the beam ray can be argued to have an advantage when it comes to attacking an area by brute force. If the tesla can be hexreloaded then the beam ray can be as well. A flurry of beam slashes can prove to be intimidating especially against attacking slow large targets. ,istrolid,d05pfhe,1,t5_3656d

7663323,0,t1_d3cnw5t,Im just thinking here. I know your code is aware of the ships composition when it blows up because it cuts the ship up. As well the ship layout must be stored in a d array of some sort.So theoretically if your array displayed . was the left corner of the cloak generator ... being the other  corners you could assign a health value to calculated with . Health value across the  pieces of the item could be  that left rear corner got hit hard!. if sum of all four is lt  part is dead. Your ship array becomes . same for the others.Renderer doesnt show negative parts of the ship and your interactives thruster weapon when cycled during game play ignore negative entries.All it would be at that point is simple collision to figure out which ship xy health to change. If its area of effect same thing just multiple runs at the array for each block in the area can even incorporate diminishing return from the center point!The grav wave would be interesting though. I suspect its a magic circle area of effect the trick would be to not waste CPU on each tick on those  rather every x ticks.editI just looked at your bullet collision code. I think youll benefit highly from a collision matrix and selective collision checks for performance.I can see you are only calculating every  ticks which is still  checks of everything  so I can see why the game bogs down with many missiles or ships the way it is. Always a nightmare to calculate  items against each other no matter the languageYou could also use a collision matrix to represent each itemss xy in a smaller block array ie  world    xy block. Store the ids of each fren item of concern for each xy and to check merge each FRENBullet array against each other to quickly numerical or bytes build a potential list of candidate for further collision checks.A way to save even more CPU on collision checks now is a selective collision check  use multiple circles for collision against smaller and smaller circles from the ship. Investigate the bullets that are closer more closely. If the bullet is way out of the next circle you could defer the next check of that bullet until x ticks later.Basically build a revolving array that is already fed the items to test collision for and when to check them. Feed to bottom of stack if still probable dump from array if a hit or no longer possible.So. Spawn bullet with velocity time to live direction and max reach missiles. Check against the respective collision matrix ie EN with max reach in mind to eliminate the NEVERS and allocate the remotely possible and better ie  EN targets  are possible. Add  to the collision revolving array.On each collision check tick    for each entry in matrix        reeval this entry against remaining targets with remaining max reach in mind. Eliminate as needed.  becomes  becomes ...etc            test big circle against remainder ie                 test medium circle against those who pass ie                     test small circle against those who pass ie                         test intensively for the few that pass that! ie     nextWhat happenedInstead of  bullet being tested against  targets per collision tick x other bullets x targets that bullet is tested on tick  for   and on the next tick it tests    checks see above.As more ticks pass less valid targets are available to be tested.Huge savings! Let me know what you think. Sorry it is a bit scrambled until the end.,istrolid,d3d9yc6,2,t5_3656d
7712693,0,t3_4kysv0,gt But when you realize that some people use that feature not to learn and refine but to outright steal without changing a single part it does hurt your pride. It has happened to me alot recently. Often they dont even comment on the ships they just copied or talk with you about them. No appreciation for all the time and dedication that went into creating something awesome. That cant be how that feature was meant to be used and it feels bad when it happens to you.I get this a lot too as I often end up facing my own designs from people who copy designs from MBT and Keystone.The truth is that this will always be part of the game and that your goal is to build a  slot lineup that suits your needs perfectly. You cannot expect a single design to ever be unique to yourself there are finite designs and there will be a lot of overlap buy youll rarely find someone who has  slots identical to yours.,istrolid,d3ivpws,1,t5_3656d
7720574,0,t1_d3jrqzn,Instead of protecting how about giving the player the tag Inventor or Designer of design id .So if another player by coincidence builds a ship that you have designed first they will know who the original designer was.But to be tagged an inventor the player should do more than just designing and going to battle. Because I know tons of people will just design random ships to get the title. The title should be  a little harder,istrolid,d3jrymu,1,t5_3656d

7800257,0,t1_d3sl9rg,Youre spot on. We even argued about whether we wanted focus fire the commands bar was a huge concession. We tried to pack as much into the physicality of the game as possible so that there is a huge amount to do with just the simple control scheme You can dodge projectiles like some kind of d quake you have to manage turn rates and facings and firing arcs and energy. Any onoff abilities like cloak will be automatic and smart and their limitations will be a part of their gameplay.,istrolid,d3st5uf,3,t5_3656d
7835467,0,t3_4jxc21,I have been thinking of some kind of fixed or maybe like  or  degrees turning circle as it would have a hard time hitting things with no way to finetune aiming. particle cannon and have come up with some stats that may work. I dont know though Im not a game designer. These stats arent final btw but its a start!  SIZE x Small x Large RANGE  Meters Small  Large DAMAGE  per shot  per second. Small  per shot  per second Large RELOAD Whatever fits the damage per second. COST  Small  Large as the ship is supposed to be designed around the weapon itself eliminating spamming. ENERGY  per shot Small   per shot Large WEIGHT  Small  Large HITPOINTS HP  Small  Large SPEED Instant. Look at gauss cannon for reference.The small version can have a maximum of  mods attached. The large one cant have any as it would be way too overpowered.If there is anything I missed please let me know and I will fix it. Thanks! Dphew!

7847057,0,t3_4msc21,Yes we need a timer before a match starts so players can chose to jump out Which would stop the timer or even have a short breather to design or swap their fleet.,istrolid,d3y2tqx,8,t5_3656d
7887955,0,t1_d42o068,I agree that being able to move AI seperately much like ships would be cool.I am sad to hear that clearing clears AI as well I would prefer to have it clear the ship while looking at the ship and clear the AI while looking at the AI.,istrolid,d42ogk5,2,t5_3656d

8512197,0,t3_4w7i3l,Tesla is not a main weapon thats where a lot of players fail at when trying to use it the only case where it can work as a main weapon is if your opponent is using squishy fast ships tanky ships are teslas nightmare.Its dps is good but it requires too much energy usually meaning its not energy efficient in case of a tanky opponent you run out of energy too fast with it.So the short answer on how to use tesla is  use it as a support weapon. because you cant really expect every single opponent to use only squishy ships against you,istrolid,d65kypm,2,t5_3656d

8693711,0,t3_4rdkj0,My suggestion is a rework of some elements of the AI interface Change the format of the attack command so that weve got the option of specifying a fixed value when theres more than one condition to check. Basically so I can do Attack enemy with more DPS than  and slower than  within  m. A choice of logical operators so OR NOT etc. for the commands with more than one input.  The priority system for build orders would probably be better off on a screen where I can view the whole fleet at once. Im not sure where you could put it maybe use the build tab from the AI screens?,istrolid,d6scdsi,1,t5_3656d
