6484041,0,t3_44eeyj,Theres this great New Yorker panel discussion where Wallace biographer DT Max asks the memoirist poet and professor and former Wallace love interest Mary Karr at around the  mark what she would have cut out of IJ. She says all that Quebecois shit!!Shes brilliant and i agreed with her when I first saw the video. Over time Ive softened and grown to enjoy the way Wallace injected his ideas about political systems and what it means to be a citizen. He expanded on these concepts a lot in The Pale King.The whole video is worth watching because it includes Wallaces biographer DT Max college best friend Mark Costello Mary Karr Wallaces New Yorker editor Deborah Treisman and Syracuse professor Dana Spiotta.,InfiniteWinter,czpzxmd,3,t5_3bxey
6560752,0,t1_czvwvw1,lpkitten so how is the reading going? Have you found your hookor are you still feeling the struggle? I like to think of the times when things arent connecting in the way I think about day dreaming. Something good happens in your brain when things arent totally clear. It can be a break from figuring everything out. I noticed that even when I dont know what is going on in the plot the descriptions are relaxing and when I make it back to my own lifeit somehow seems a little more clear. ,InfiniteWinter,czxxpuz,1,t5_3bxey

7345094,0,t1_d2csxdk,Yep incandescent light is closer to natural light which most people prefer. Certain sensitive people also tend to dislike fluorescent light due to the little cracks and pops and bursts. Wallace definitely associated fluorescent lights with corporate and sterile environments as you pointed out.,InfiniteWinter,d2d34e7,3,t5_3bxey
