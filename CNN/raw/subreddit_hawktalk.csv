4557566,0,t3_3d2r1g,Personally Id put Mitchell ahead of Hodge in terms of all time Hawk greats. Mitchell was having a far greater impact a lot earlier out of the two and has been able to maintain that level for the entire time. ,hawktalk,ct53muk,3,t5_2uc8o

5075110,0,t1_cuxqlmg,It was only  months ago Dermie was saying how they only have one inside clearance player the importance of thats changed but Priddis still leaves a huge gap for them Nic Nat and him are a vital combination. Priddis . clearances a game Shuey  Nat  no one else over . We have  players over  and that doesnt even include the guy who gets the most important ones Burgoyne.Masten as well is huge.,hawktalk,cuxqqhp,5,t5_2uc8o

7015887,0,t3_4bqo4s,Sicily not named on the bench looks like hes definitely playing. I think the bench will be Big Boy Howe ORourke and Brand need the height against Geelongs big team.,hawktalk,d1blkkr,2,t5_2uc8o

9245533,0,t3_570jz0,Frankly Im shocked and appalled right after he wins the BnF. Hes one of my favorite players ever to pull on a Hawthorn jumper.But Ill say this as good as Mitchell is he doesnt do anything that dozens of midfielders in the comp can and already do as far as accumulation of possessions and clearances go. Now if you were to pick any flaws with Mitchell as a player and some Hawks fan may disagree with me here he doesnt hit the scoreboard himself and I would be hard pressed to name any games that he has one us off his own boot. I can think of many times Hodge Franklin Roughead Rioli and of course Burgoyne have been huge in winning tight games.And yes its a team game and everyones contribution matters but thats just my takeIn summary Ill still be crying myself to sleep tonight.,hawktalk,d8nxsys,2,t5_2uc8o
