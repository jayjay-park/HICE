2071664,0,t3_2i1k28,I just started this fall as a transfer student from a community college here in Portland and while I am a unique case because Im  I still have gotten a feel for the student body over the six weeks. I stand to be corrected by those who might have been at Reed longer. My observations There are some of the weirdos from high school here .. more than weirdos though seems to be the kids that might have been the smartest kid in their class for most their life and have the capacity of thought to be painfully selfaware. I think the combination of those traits at the  year old age group breeds a kind of individualism that purposely eschews fitting in. So there are those types.. and if youre one of them you might find your people here. Then theres everyone else. For the most part the students at Reed are easy to approach and interesting to talk to although they mostly talk about school. Thats the characteristic we all share I think were interested and engaged in our studies. The stress of the volume of work and intensity of some classes can make people push aside social aspirations so maybe they dont seem as social and outgoing at times. Of course there are the cool kids.. I dont know exactly what I mean by that because Im  and it would take some serious steez to convince me that a  year old is anywhere near cool but theres the hipstery artsy types that arent as approachable and friendly as the greater majority of students. I dont worry about them. I was really worried about starting conversations and making friends the first week of school but in every circumstance that I took a chance I was happy I did. The students here are interesting and passionate if a bit hifalutin at times were all learning so its okay.  The worst thing about students at Reed in my opinion and by no means applies to everyone is the general callousness of taking care of public spaces littering and talking while a professor talks. Students were less wellmannered than I expected but again..that might be an age thing. Dont worry about not having parties. There are plenty of parties. I think Reed actually has a reputation for partying. Someone more in the social scene at Reed would speak to that better than me though... Good luck with your application process! ,reedcollege,cl35k1v,1,t5_2s7mb

11170678,0,t1_dey2piv,Good to know! When I look more into it Ill ask some of the advisors and figure it out! Thats very exciting! How many of you are intending on pursuing a PhD? Also Ive heard about the thesis program and that looks like an incredible opportunity! Homework parties sound really great to me and honestly a lot more appealing than drunk frat parties... maybe thats just naive of me to say now though.As someone who considers himself to be somewhat of a leftist atheist I feel like Id fit in well there! However I like the fact that there are opposing views there is certainly a plus. I like having opposing views but itll be nice to be in a place where Im not in the extreme minority mediumsized town.  Actually topology was just an example and I definitely could not know or have strong feelings about what kind of math I want to pursue. As an undergrad I would like to try out different fields and get a feel for them before grad school. Would you say that Reed is a good place for that? Also this shouldnt matter too much if Reed prepares me for a good grad program right?,reedcollege,dey6nem,1,t5_2s7mb
