Print them out rather than collecting at the office massive hassle if you turn up late. Pub on all four corners of the ground. Sorted. ,Brentford,da9fqvb,2,t5_2qxrl
9706019,0,t3_5e3o8x,Pub on all four corners of the ground is gone actually. One has closed down however as your coming over from Ireland Id recommend the New Inn proper London Irish pub before hand and the Ealing Road Terrace if you want a bit of atmosphere in the ground and dont mind standing up.Definitely book online and Id recommend collecting tickets on the door just make sure youre there  minutes before kick off collection is by the entrance to Ealing Road and Braemer Road.
