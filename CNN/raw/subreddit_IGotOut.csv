Do you have any experience with reverse culture shock? I created this blog post to share my experience in the hope others could share theirs as well. Despite your verbose bashing Id still love to hear your story. Please feel free to post it here or post a link to your blog. ,IGotOut,chquc3t,3,t5_2shss

As a word of advice make sure you reflect to make sure none of your issues in the US are of your own doing even if only fractionally bc if they are they will follow you to Canada if you dont deal with them before moving.  I learned that lesson  years ago......painfully.  Have a safe journey!,IGotOut,d272274,2,t5_2shss
