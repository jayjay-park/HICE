6635592,0,t1_d05nxra,Seju doesnt really get out of control like she used to so youll generally have to end up going a tankier route.Seju unfortunately doesnt scale that well with AP so Id skip the rod for sure.  Getting Warmogs is a much better bet the regen is crucial because often youll need to stand in front to zone and youll end up taking a hefty amount of poke in the process.Abyssal is pretty meh because you give up so much HP to get it and HP is one of your damage sources.  Get a Locket or Visage instead to give yourself much better defensive stats.  Youll get about as much DPS from the extra health and CDR anyway.Liandrys is your best bet if you want to build a damage item.  As a standalone offensive item it provides the most DPS through the burn and amplifies damage from your health scaling and base damage.  Better yet your targets are likely to be under some form of CC anyway so theyll take double burn damage.  Liandrys is a great item against an all AD team if you have  armor items already a third armor item is often redundant and can be replaced by Liandrys.  You could also try Sorcs if you really wanted a little extra damage.Just remember your biggest DPS boosters are health and CDR make sure you have  CDR and a hefty amount of HP.  You need these stats to be a tank anyway and Sejus job isnt really to deal damage.  Shes among the best in the game at peeling but isnt very good at putting down damage.  Keep your ADC alive and theyll deal all the damage you need for you.,sejuanimains,d05odxe,2,t5_37bp3

8563539,0,t1_d69mmao,Just want to mention this works on a lot of other junglers as well. Especially good for early game manaless gankers like Lee  Reksai rengar. I too started playing a lot of Sej but back in the pre nerf cinderhulk days. Ive since moved to playing Reksai but am looking to pick up Sej again. Ive tried in a custom with attack speed quints and talisman you are fairly healthy with mana for the level three gank around the min mark,sejuanimains,d6c0qsp,1,t5_37bp3

11689833,0,t3_66bgo6,im not sure if it was needed. the only thing i know is that they should stop reworking champs just cause they arent played much. i can see that seju was played only by a few AND was unhealthy with her op ult and her rather weak basic abilities. but i dont know if fiddle for example needs a rework or donger or veigar. they are unpopular but do they really need it?,sejuanimains,dgl26ry,3,t5_37bp3
