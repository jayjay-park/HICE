7128282,0,t1_d1oeddj,TDA Beth is another one of those characters who gets a huge positive edit while doing pretty bad things. In this case its her cheating on Brady with Harold who didnt even want a relationship. She also gave us the puke kiss. I did enjoy her at some points though. Definitely a surprising winner to say the least but not one of the better ones. ,TDRankdown,d1oel8a,1,t5_3ddjq
7161520,0,t1_d1s4s1n,No I loved DJ in WT! This is just becoming harder and harder.The only reason I think Jen was slightly good we because her team represented something that actually appears in that show being youtubers. Aside from that hated them.,TDRankdown,d1s728b,1,t5_3ddjq

9611283,0,t3_5cicew,Overall this episode was great I loved it. It was entertaining funny and overall refreshing with decent character development.Since Im too lazy to rank all the characters in this episode Ill just rank my  favourite characters in this episode.. Harold his epic figure skating skills came in handy this episode with a funny comeback. . Lindsay the LindsayTyler relationship was pretty funny. Loved it.. Tyler. Owen. Noah As much as I hate Noah in TDI he was pretty funny this episode. But not entertaining at all.,TDRankdown,d9xscj7,1,t5_3ddjq
