1082486,0,t1_chrbkcz,Right now Im chalking it up to a fluke in the adsense system. If it continues Ill dig deeper. I am changing how the code is structured on the deck building screens right now and itd be somewhat annoying to go back and patch things so Im just not doing that right now since it affects me and not my users. That and so far in total Ive made less than a dollar so its not like Im bleeding money by not fixing the ads right away.,gracefulstats,chrbxq8,2,t5_31f9i
