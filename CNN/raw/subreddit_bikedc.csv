855655,0,t3_23rtm4,Dont start before light turns green...Not quite accurate. After the Bicycle Safety Amendments went into effect in January bicyclists can start based on the crosswalk signal if it changes before the light.,bikedc,ch1jkcc,6,t5_2tluc

1013800,0,t3_25pm7h,Congrats on your first bike commute especially during the torrential rain!I biked in this morning and it was pretty fun. There were a few other bikers and a bunch of enthusiastic volunteers at the Park Tavern Bike to Work stop so it was nice.  Despite biking to work every day minus a week during the Polar Vortex and a few days when I sprained my ankle for over a year I have not shelled out for nice rain gear yet. My garbage bag kept me pretty dry though! ,bikedc,chjiy9u,6,t5_2tluc

1818181,0,t1_ck88fsx,DDOT We unnecessarily created a poorly designed streetcar that is redundant to existing bus lines and as slow as walking. Lets arbitrarily ban taxpaying voting road users to try and fix our idiocy!There are other good reasons to use H Street. Its well lit and G and I do not have a lot of eyes on the street at night. There arent a lot of visual navigation cues on G and I.If youre on a mountain bike or a fat tire cruiser tracks are no problem.There may be a possible technical solution in rubberfilled flangeways.  This may not have ever been done with this kind of streetcar though.Ive rode along streetcar tracks in Portland for years. Ive never crashed but Ive witnessed my fair share. Its a real problem. Youd think people who are traffic engineers by profession wouldnt be blindsided by problems that anyone who has ever ridden a bike near tracks could foresee but these are the same brainiacs who had a perfectly good model for a cycletrack on th and then decided to recreate the Double Dare obstacle course on M Street.,bikedc,ck89wlr,4,t5_2tluc
1942319,0,t1_ckmz8yz,Im quite serious.  You have issues.  I hope youre just one of those Internet warriors who puffs up in an anonymous forum and that you dont act this way toward people you know.  Best of luck.,bikedc,ckn8ymn,0,t5_2tluc

2289118,0,t1_clni7f2,Can I ask you about thermal gear then? Im looking to start commuting this winter after I did most of the summer. Do you use special cycling thermal gear? If so what brandstypes?  Im looking at Pearl Izumis gear but they have so many different types I dont know which pants or jackets to get.,bikedc,clunggz,1,t5_2tluc
2693358,0,t1_cn9ky7m,I think the potential dangers of walking are fewer than the potential dangers of riding a bike in DC.Its cool though broham. Just wait until you crack your head open. I used to not wear a helmet either. ,bikedc,cna53ea,0,t5_2tluc
3516009,0,t3_30iam2,I have already noticed a difference on a lot of streets which is nice. However riding in the rain was very tedious last night. Cant tell if a puddle is shallow or goes all the way down to China in the dark. ,bikedc,cpt1ud2,2,t5_2tluc

5108414,0,t1_cv1qp33,Cross bikes are pretty good allrounders. Many of them have rack and fender mounts and disc brakes which I swear by and are built to withstand more abuse than those carbon fiber racing bikes everybody else salivates over. And yes if you go on the GBT more often than like never withstanding abuse should be a selection factor.,bikedc,cv1r7dw,2,t5_2tluc

6411226,0,t3_43gw2o,I did the GAPCampO southbound ride in  on Clement XPLOR USH tires and they were great. Minimal tread in the middle for the paved bits up outside of Pittsburghin town for supplies and hard packed sections and the raised tread on the sides for when things got soft. The GAP trail is way smoother and less rutted than the CampO being it is surfaced with crushed cinder and is a newer trail. The CampO has ruts roots loose gravel of varying sizes and wet spots in places. It isnt like riding single track or anything but wider tires will help keep your arms and ass happy. Most of my riding buddies were on x Vittoria Randonneurs with one on x Randonneurs and while the tires did fine we only had one wet day the general consensus was that wider tires would have been nice. ,bikedc,czie4da,1,t5_2tluc
