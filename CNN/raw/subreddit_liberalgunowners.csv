2227547,0,t1_clmxd2o,I appreciate the feed back thank you.I do acknowledge that this particular flyer was extremely text heavy and that was deliberate. Im very fluent in designing these sort of things and from the onset my collaborators decided that the audience wasnt the sort of person who quickly glances at flyers to get a summary. How does one even summarize the human story of firearms in the defense of racism with graphics? My town is covered in flyers its hard to walk  feet in some neighborhoods without seeing another music flyer or other piece of garbage tacked to a wall or pole. Also above is a text dump when looking at the actual flyer its fairly readable in columns as shown here   its also printed in Legal format which is longer than standard paper. Instead this was intended to be an educational piece not a promotional piece  and these zinestyle flyers are fairly common around my town at least with some producers. So to pedantically explain the design elements from far away this looks almost akin to a racist propaganda flyer black man with a gun stands out along with Zimmermens smiling face. Ive personally watched how this draws people in because their first impression is very emotional down right visceral. Then the elements that catch you first is the famous names Rosa Parks and Dr. King line the top with purpose  the reader has to inquire further is this piece negative and racist what does Rosa Parks and Dr. King have to do with Zimmermen or guns? Through asking these questions and exploring the flyer one learns the actual motives of the creators. Essentially I was balancing two elements being deliberately offensive and confrontational that one has to pause and look but also curious enough that one might read more. In watching how this effects people in practical situations most people who walked by would stop and look at it for a moment and many of those people would read it fronttoend. Meanwhile many of my other public education pieces failed to captivate people on the street. In truth out of the dozens upon dozens of political propaganda Ive made this was one of the more successful in captivating people of all ethnic backgrounds and age groups. In the end Im done with this project and dont plan to produce any more. ,liberalgunowners,clmz3ex,1,t5_2vjre

6336342,0,t1_cz9v5g1,Fuck off why do you have to be so vitriolic? There is a difference between not respecting a law and breaking laws that you cant afford to be caught breaking. Im not saying a law isnt real or that there arent consequences to breaking one but that laws arent good or worth deferring to without complaint or protest just because the courts back them. Lots of bad laws have court backing. Anarchism doesnt mean breaking all the laws you disagree with it means working to get them revoked as well as any and all broken systems that support hierarchy andor oppression against any and all disadvantaged demographics. You cant support Food Not Bombs or other anarchist activist movements and activities if youre in prison for  years because it turns out the ATF was actually serious about their opinion letter and the courts decided to back them. Picking your battles and being strategic about things isnt weakness or indicative of lifestylism its realistic and necessary in order to maintain the amount of freedom needed in order to politically organize. I called you a bootlicker for saying ssssh the adults are talking because you were taking a really condescending response to my position that bad laws dont deserve deference. They will still get deference in many cases because people rightfully dont want to go to prison just over matters of principle if there is no meaningful gain to be had from it but those laws dont deserve deference and laws should not be respected just because of court backing they should be given respect in accordance with their moral value.

11341802,0,t3_61uf7c,Ive never had it happen at the range but that may be because my favorite range is in a pretty conservative area  hour NW of Austin they sell silencers and suppressors and have tactical and home defense classes and there are no Priuses Priusii? in the parking lot. Super helpful and friendly staff. It might be that they purposely keep politics out of the picture but seems equally likely that theyd be a little shocked that an actual liberal goes to shoot there.I have had gun store owners or staff try to get me roped into political discussion assuming that Im conservative. Ill just brush it off with something like well Im one of those liberals who likes guns and a smile and its always ended with that. The first time it happened I was caught off guard... it was in November  shortly after the election and I was in an Academy browsing and the guy behind the counter asked if he could help I told him I was interested in a semiauto handgun and he grinned and said oh! because of the election huh? Well uh... no... the guy I voted for for President won. He instantly went poker faced but continued to  help me and was very informative so no harm no foul I guess.,liberalgunowners,dfhknog,4,t5_2vjre

11371316,0,t1_dfkw5fp,gtI take the stand that preemptive bansrestrictions is unconstitutional.This is difficult as well. Its similar to saying there shouldnt be a speed limit for anyone but those whove proven theyre badunsafe drivers. Sometimes the only solution to a problem is to minimize the probability that the problem will occur. Without pulling in abstract arguments like if   socioeconomic issue didnt exist then thered be no problems which in my opinion are valid in a certain context how else do you minimize the probability that weapons for the wrong reason are distributed? Other than preemptive restrictions? These issues are so complex and nuanced I dont really envy law makers when it comes to this issue.,liberalgunowners,dfkx1gk,0,t5_2vjre

As far as colleges and universities working to indoctrinate folks to be democrats I just dont see it.  I have a hard enough time getting folks to read the syllabus before emailing me questions that I answered IN THE SYLLABUS.  Actually indoctrinating anyone is far beyond my abilities.

Granted thats only about a half dozen people but cops are supposed to be trained.  gtHell that was two trained cops.  fucking Innocents shot.Only  rounds were apparently fired in this story.  Ten of them hit the target.  Somehow the other six shots hit other people or some passed through the gunman and hit secondary targets.  Thats because of bad training and no thinking.  If two cops are shooting that many of the wrong targets they need to stop being cops.  Its that damn simple.  ,liberalgunowners,dfuhdpl,3,t5_2vjre

You got proof of these claims or are you just being an asshole?gtYoure about half correct. The New Right along with classical liberals and moderates is fighting against the far left and allowing the AltRight to exercise their First Amendment right to speak their mind regardless of how repugnant it may be.So then yes you are saying that we should allow people to advocate for ethnic cleansing.gtIm not referring to the Democratic establishemt Im referring to the rise of the far left and the social justice warriors spilling out of Tumblr into real life screaming about white privilege and toxic masculinity.So again lumping in all of the left into one group and adding Tumblr SJWs which are typically liberals just FYI you sure like to break or lump people into groups when it suits your needs.gtI have to say Im really perturbed at how willing you appear to be to keep people from using their First Amendment rights simply due to their politics. Would you be OK restricting someones Second Amendment rights for the same reason?I strongly support the constitution especially the st nd and th. But I would like to point out first that it isnt the government limiting the free speech of altright people advocating for ethnic cleansing.
