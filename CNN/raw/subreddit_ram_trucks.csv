3114670,0,t1_coktsmo,Out of curiosity What demographic do you fit into?Data shows that the number one consideration in purchasing a  ton truck is MPG not capability. If pure work was all people were looking for in a truck there would be a manual option. The buying majority want a comfortable convenient and efficient truck. Also automatic transmissions are better than theyve ever been. So much better that they have surpassed the manuals in demand which is why only one OEM still offers the option. And guess what they dont sell that great. ,ram_trucks,coku2oq,2,t5_2yejx

Considering yours is a wd spindles are definitely a little better than spacers IMO because they will keep your suspension geometry at stock angles. However they are quite a bit pricier than spacers.

Now I know what others will say youre not supposed to modify airbag circuits!!! But this was a fix under Chrysler. Ill see if my friend is willing to give me the bulletin number. Another thing would be to see if one of the techs would do said fix on the weekend off the books. Source was Chrysler tech during said bulletin. Did repair with Chrysler approval.

9923565,0,t3_5hj0ba,Solid axle shaft offers some improvement Assuming its .  didnt have CAD if its a half ton then D swap. Other than that theres not a whole lot of special things you can do. Some swap Ford knuckles onto their Ds. If youre thinking more steering wise you have a couple options. Biggest improvements will come from a good track bar and steering linkage. Personally I would suggest Dodge Off Roads kit. For the steering the inverted T is better than cross over as the drag link isnt made to be much longer than originally intended. However both are better than the Y steering and not even the T style is perfect. Thuren Fabrication also makes good parts. But they do not make a T style steering kit. Only a cross over. ,ram_trucks,db12db4,1,t5_2yejx
