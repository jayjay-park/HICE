Not to mention its entirely possible to rank all the way up to admin without having to pay or do anything special other than be awesome.  I joined the server as a guest  and a half years ago when it started and six months ago I adopted the server as my own.Plus were constantly evolving.  If enough of our family wants something we add it.  None of that were not a shops server we wont add shops.  You want shops?  OK.Basically the point was to make it more like a server that you start with personal friends and not like a server you go on where you survive against a bunch of strangers.  We try to be as friendly and open to everyone as possible.  Youre  years old and you just want to talk and build thats fine with us.  Youre ?  Well teach you how to play and help you out as much as we can and yes we do have quite a few kids younger than .  Families have kids.,StaffCraft,ci7vu2w,3,t5_323uq
