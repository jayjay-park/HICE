265985,0,t3_1x4kwz,I saw these earlier today and Im not sure how I feel about it. The car doesnt seem like its going to be a record setter but it might be a good screw around vehicle. Wont know for sure until we see what upgrades are available for it.The level looks pretty interesting though I wish we couldve seen more in the preview. I wonder if we can fall down in the gaps between the buildings and die. Im also curious how tall the buildings are going to get. Either way cant wait to play on a new level.All that being said Im somewhat disappointed. I dont want to sound greedy but I thought after almost two months that wed be getting a little more in the new update. Oh well something is better than nothing I guess.,HillClimbRacing,cf8bv48,1,t5_2voua
311242,0,t1_cfcrkyo,a lot of mine were terrible but I figured Id help contribute to filling in the leaderboard! I invite you to beat my records some are embarrassing to have my name attached to haha ,HillClimbRacing,cfd11kb,3,t5_2voua

730381,0,t1_cgn5nhm,Use the topic made by joeypikes about Countryside Tank. In the video you will find some hills like the one on Junkyard. The difference is that on Junkyard you have one shot. Hou miss a hill you lose a try.,HillClimbRacing,cgnaqtl,3,t5_2voua

946175,0,t1_chbtj2f,I figured thats what it was.  Or you passed out right after starting a run.Im in for Hovercraft.  Some of your existing Hovercraft scores are pretty decent so putting up a bunch of good numbers shouldnt be a problem.  Unless you are trying to get all the records like with the Onewheeler...,HillClimbRacing,chbu4s1,1,t5_2voua

994644,0,t1_chgaf42,I agree the proportions are pretty nuts when you compare something like the dragster to the Jeep especially.  I would like to see them add something like a rock crawler a bigger jeep with a roll cage that was slow but better at climbing.,HillClimbRacing,chhcjmg,3,t5_2voua
1350412,0,t1_cili0wm,If you know the map its pretty easy. He is far away from the fuel which means he did alot of mistakes. Still getting  is very hard.,HillClimbRacing,cilkdfe,2,t5_2voua

2257145,0,t1_clqntju,thanks soz for that amazing misc spell at tittle I guess  would be real however if theyre really fixing the map back this record is useless and juras  in the easier version will remain.. I had only  there less luck. I guess.,HillClimbRacing,clqpd2p,2,t5_2voua
2272743,0,t1_clrr4dg,Does it have to be video? My tablet is seriously old and slow HCR is straining its capabilities and I havent found video capturing apps that didnt cause it to crash.I have significantly improved my OW score to  on the new Junkyard but if one has to submit video then I cannot submit.,HillClimbRacing,clsmovm,2,t5_2voua
2558988,0,t1_cmqo2h2,Keep trying with MXB on Forest. Dont be afraid of jumping over a gas can clearing some trees and then backing up to get the gas when the trees behind you have magically disappeared. Also works well for the Jeep. Ive recently pushed the MXB to  on Rainbow dying with a full tank of gas and the crank case resting on the end of a platform. Also  on Volcano which was a great run to the gas at  and then crap.,HillClimbRacing,cmslibb,2,t5_2voua

4505616,0,t3_3cs2vd,Sadvery sad. Yes very frustrating location where bill sits. And one the most important problem is that if you want to do well on levels like highway northpole etc. You will have to upgrade the tires to max whereasto do well on beach bootcamp etc. It is only possible when tires are not upgraded. So i am talking about this problem with sami jukka  developer to add a new feature of increasing decreasing upgrades as our wish after we fully ugrade a vehicle.,HillClimbRacing,csyl0gr,3,t5_2voua

5463522,0,t1_cw9x6rw,That pool at  is too big to clear huh?  I think Im done with that combo anyway.  Some of them I just wanted to beat  then never play again.I was thinking after I made that suggestion that it might not be necessary as the reindeer can be squished without automatically killing Bill.  But Im glad it worked out for you.,HillClimbRacing,cwa0lm0,1,t5_2voua

8881233,0,t3_51vepv,What is your coin total? If it is  then congratulations youve reached the coinmaximum FFF FFFF in hexadecimal. If your total is stuck at something less than that then I dont know why or what to doIve not been playing HCR for a while so I dont know if there is perhaps a glitch after an update.Edit I noticed on your screenshot for Seasons with the superdiesel x that you do have the coinmaximum. This is not a glitch it is the maximum value allowable by the game. Im not sure why the limit is only FFF FFFF hex code. To me it would have made more sense if the limit was FFFF FFFF the maximum hexadecimal value with  digits but it is only half of that.Anyhow congratulations on the achievement. Now when you get a new device you can start coin collecting all over again.,HillClimbRacing,d7fedd3,2,t5_2voua
9206782,0,t3_56ahid,I had a thought a rare thing for me in my old age that by taking enough screenshots and sewing them together as one giant image file it would be possible to image large sections of each track. Your discovery would make this a little easier.,HillClimbRacing,d8j118d,2,t5_2voua
9919358,0,t1_db008qw,I dont even know if I am good or bad at this game.  One match I am crushed and the next one I win without a problem.,HillClimbRacing,db0in66,1,t5_2voua
9999027,0,t3_5itoxq,Still worked for me after the update. Also works on the Christmas themed chests. Usually can do  or  then I have to wait  hrs till it works again. ,HillClimbRacing,dbawh31,3,t5_2voua
10102122,0,t3_5kj655,Could be. Im hoping if they are taking this route taking old cars and maps and revamping them. Maybe theyll make a moon map as well. My favorite car from the first game has to be either the big finger or the super off road hoping they bring that. But by the looks of it you are probably right with your guess. ,HillClimbRacing,dbobi3o,3,t5_2voua

10348964,0,t3_5o4o5j,Itll get you slightly faster times and slightly further in the maps. Obviously worth it since theres no real point in getting other cars. Might as well max this first and make the most out of it.,HillClimbRacing,dch45d4,1,t5_2voua
10677715,0,t1_ddha01q,Yes HRC. I dont have HRC even installed at this time.The login is finicky sometimes requiring a few boots. Try to log in itll take a few seconds if nothing is happening in  seconds or so or it doesnt show as logged in after the logging in message disappears shut HRC down and restart it. If youre logged in fine and dandy. If not try the logging again. It took a few tries for me but it works.,HillClimbRacing,ddhbqcu,1,t5_2voua

11174361,0,t1_deyh6l0,So no matter what you upgrade it will always have that behavior? Now i see why the SD has better launches than the MT but i prefer the MT because of its impressive way of taking hard landings compared to other vehicles.
