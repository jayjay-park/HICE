94523,0,t1_cep6rc8,I get what youre saying. Its an interesting question and a case of mistaken age in a situation where nothing has taken place Id hope people take the time to double check before actually sleeping with someone doesnt seem implausible or pedophilic. Unfortunately I see a similar argument on a fairly regular basis which isnt as excusable namely when the person in question knows the age and uses her appearance to excuse their crude remarks or confessions of attraction. Very few people have control over who they find attractive but if you happen to learn that someone who triggered that reaction is underage I think its a wise thing to examine that and acknowledge that its entirely inappropriate rather than excusing it away with well she looks older than she is.  To be honest Im not entirely sure why reddit is so keen to tell everyone about what and who they find attractive. Its understandable within some contexts but its everywhere including contexts where its  entirely inappropriate such as younger people or people sharing their own image without inviting such comments. ,reactiongifs,cep6wo5,2,t5_2t5y3

Its time to wake up to the fact that maybe your God created gays and lesbians too and this is all part of his great design. If he didnt want gay people to exist he wouldnt have put them on the earth.

279512,0,t1_cf9peqf,Voting is the least you could do. Literally voting in the general election is the least you could do short of doing absolutely nothing.A few years ago the Tea Party waltzed into the Republican Party and dragged it so far to the right that if Ronald Reagan ran for office today he would get stoned to death before he could fill out his FEC form.  How did they do that? Well they started in an off election year. They stormed town hall meetings held rallies wrote to congressmen gave money to far right candidates and generally kept pressing their position until they got media attention focused on them and their issues. In  they managed to get elected enough people whose priorities matched their own that they changed the whole countrys agenda from stabilizing the economy to reducing the deficit. One of the reasons that Obama hasnt been able to do everything he wanted to do is because the Tea Partiers made it a priority to stop him at every turn.Hint  is another off election year.

For example  A  x  inch penis  inches long  inches around actually wouldnt look weird or spherical or anything... maybe a little fat but it would be pretty normal.  I myself am  around.  Which is actually pretty big.  As big as if not bigger than most girls wrists P But seriously it will be a bigger number than you think even on yourself...

898977,0,t1_ch6ffuf,I guess we dont agree.  You need a binding agent to press a pill.  That can be as innocuous as chalkcalciumbaking soda and doesnt explicitly have to be another drug.  Thats to say that you can get MDMA without other drugs in tablet form.  Conversely that doesnt imply that because Molly is in a powdered form its not cut with another adulterant.  Its a white powder what could be more of a question mark?  People who claim that because its molly its somehow bettermore pureless of a danger are deluding themselves and others into a false sense of security.  Molly is just a rebranding of the chemical.  whether in a pill or a powder MDMA can still be pure or cut with something else.  So be responsible and test your drugs.

The best way to gain confidence is to fake it. Kinda a lame saying but its true. My first roommate in college was overweight was really messy and honestly he was quite a bit weird. Any how he got engaged last week and Im proud of him. He was one that I thought would be forever alone. So Im sure youll find someone when you want to.

1097077,0,t3_26lso5,Since I played Lego Star Wars Complete Saga Ive been hooked. The Lego series are great games to get your girlfriend into gaming... no anxiety infinite deaths recent releases have split screen local multiplayer which is amazing when you realize youre at the next checkpoint and she is still in the beginning section of the level. Since I got my lady into Lego she built up the confidence to try COD MW due to combat training with easy AI. Now if youre living the bachelor life Lego games are great at easy achievements comical cutscenes replay ability and all around fun. In my opinion the most entertaining games were Batman Harry Potter and Marvel Heroes. I am super stoked for this upcoming title more than other expected releases. The developers know how to make a fun game all around. ,reactiongifs,chszq38,1,t5_2t5y3

The curriculum isnt centered on studying the rantings of dead people but on symbolic reasoning and abstract thinking. Often womens studies and some other humanities can analyze an argument only through the theories theyve studied because for the most part they are guilty of being statistical illiterates this is why you often find the statement this theory is useful because it offers a different perspective in the research papers of the softer humanities and not the evidence suggests.Phil majors on the other hand can very easily break down any subject matter into its most abstract parts and quickly identify what is important and what is superfluous noise regardless of content.

But the degree was from a reputable university and though I didnt use math in my major I retained most the math chemistry and physics I learned in high school. Dont ask me to take the AP Calculus test again but I can algebra my way out of any problem.I did education research out of college earning mids then got my masters in Geography amp Environmental Studies which included statistics GIS and energy science. Im now an energy amp water efficiency consultant. I aint rich but Im comfortable mids and Ill crack six figures by the time Im  if I pursue management positions within my field.Compared to my colleagues who studied engineering my writing is stronger and Im better suited for management. In consulting and management I think strong writing leadership and bigpicture thinking along with betterthanbasic numeracy trump specific technical knowledge. Given that there are more jobs in consulting than applied engineering humanities degrees arent necessarily useless.tldr Studies majors arent a career killer if youre good at math writing and managing projects.

1323646,0,t1_ciiii4g,Nobody knows how FIFA works.The World Cup uses a group system and then a playofflike knockout round. There are  groups of  teams each. The top  teams in each group advance and then meet each other in the knockout round. In each group all teams play each other once so they play  games. You get  points for a win  point for a draw and  points for a loss. When everyones played each other the two teams that have the most points advance to the next round. In USAs group Germany had two wins and one draw so  points. They qualified first in their group.USA had a win a draw and a loss. So they have  points.Portugal had a win a draw and a loss as well. So they had  points as well. Ghana had a draw and two losses so  point.To decide which team between Portugal and the USA qualified to the next round as group nd the first tiebreaker was used goal differential goals scored vs goals conceded. The USA had a better differential so they advanced. If the USA had lost  instead of  or Portugal had won  instead of  Portugal would have had a better differential so theyd have advanced over the USA.I hope this was helpful.

1325536,0,t1_ciipp6q,This was from  until about  for me and  for her. The salary was a generous K calculated after overtime and a holiday bonus. That dipped significantly when our roles started being outsourced. That money doesnt get you very far in New York though. After rent and bills were paid and the fridge was stocked I was left with maybe month that could be saved or splurged irresponsibly. One date   on a movie and  on mediocre dinner  and I was dry until the next check. Good thing I was liquor free at the time ... mostly because I couldnt really afford more than a couple of beers. My coworker girlfriend established herself as wife potential early on. She respected my struggle and even contributed. That meant a whole lot back then especially when disposable income and the fun it buys is more attractive to most than a casual night in with some Chinese takeout.Either way the job itself was basically data entry in a field completely unrelated to my studies. It was a farm environment where I was one of a employee team. Completely expendable role. ,reactiongifs,ciiqn3m,7,t5_2t5y3

You work in an industry that produces a commodity and the nature of commodities is fluctuating price and fluctuating demand. Oil and gas are also subject to political and other types of risk. Im also willing to bet that your job is at least somewhat hazardous. Moral of the story you should save your money and invest.

1560526,0,t1_cjbvkjy,Thanks so much for the response! Great advice.Ive been through a fulltime regular semester  credit hours and a fulltime summer semester  c.h. and it was very challenging but doable. I totally hear you on the night classes though. Ive found that either night classes or the onceaweek day classes which are  hours long have a lot of students that are actually serious about what were doing there. Some younger some older but all there to actually learn.But my major is a small group so a couple of the classes are only offered at one time and are unavoidably full of kids who couldnt care less. Ive really struggled with things like group projects that should be simple but someone doesnt come up with their part until the night before. Once it was the morning of and that assignment was  of our final grade.  I put at least  hours of work into it and this kid showed up late the day it was due and finished his portion in class while other groups were presenting.  Insanely frustrating.Im glad I left school when I did and that Im going back when I actually have my shit figured out and have a WAY better idea of who I am and what I want.  I do wish I had more of a social life though... Im just not into getting hammered every night anymore I did enough of that when I was the  year old kid. Its complicated you know? heh.Anyway Im really glad Im not the only one who gets frustrated with the maturity gap in this situation.  For a lot of people most definitely for me a whole lot happens between  and .,reactiongifs,cjbvv72,3,t5_2t5y3

It is unwise to put a person one wishes to persuade on the defensive. I was called a troll for genuine questions I had.

By giving all my energy to what I DO rather than what I DONT DO my life is richer and more authentic than it was. I am NOT powerless my life is not unmanageableI can test this statement any time by asking Did I drink today? If the answer is no the statement holds. The answer has been NO  days in a row so far you can go wherever you want and not drink unless you want to drink and in that case you maybe wouldnt be done.

1981817,0,t1_cks0a0a,Heres the thing. You said a jackdaw is a crow.Is it in the same family? Yes. No ones arguing that. As someone who is a scientist who studies crows I am telling you specifically in science no one calls jackdaws crows. If you want to be specific like you said then you shouldnt either. Theyre not the same thing.If youre saying crow family youre referring to the taxonomic grouping of Corvidae which includes things from nutcrackers to blue jays to ravens. So your reasoning for calling a jackdaw a crow is because random people call the black ones crows? Lets get grackles and blackbirds in there then too.Also calling someone a human or an ape? Its not one or the other thats not how taxonomy works. Theyre both. A jackdaw is a jackdaw and a member of the crow family. But thats not what you said. You said a jackdaw is a crow which is not true unless youre okay with calling all members of the crow family crows which means youd call blue jays ravens and other birds crows too.

2330225,0,t1_clzpn23,Season  is an incredibly emotional season and having Buffy kill a soulrestored Angel was so tragic and beautiful. That whole scene was great and even though the choreography improves quite a bit in later seasons thats still one of the coolest fight scenes we had. I agree about the mayor he was my favorite villain as well. Turning into a giant snake was definitely an odd ambition though I think the immortal part was just a temporary stage towards that goal. Im actually not a huge fan of Faith on Buffy though Faith and Angel is probably the best postshow comic series by far. I liked a lot of Season  though Id agree about the drugsmagic analogy. It works on some level but they made it too explicit and heavyhanded. Especially since the happy conclusion still involved Willow using the hell out of magic that kind of confuses the moral a little bit. My biggest problem with Season  was just how dreary it was. I know that was intentional and it made sense storywise but everybody was such a mess that season depressed Buffy junkie Willow Xander abandoning Anya Giles gone Tara...gone. It was a lot. ,reactiongifs,clzq8ta,2,t5_2t5y3

The way I look at it now is pretty fatalistic  even if my parents become fervent climatechange believers nonskeptics whatever its not going to matter. Theyre not going to do anything about it. Theyre not going to recycle theyre not going to vote based on this singular issue for a party that pays lip service to this one over another. Yours might be different but... Eh! I doubt it. Also the average global temp has gone up . degrees Fahrenheit in the last century. If your Dad thinks its impossible for that tiny difference to completely preclude more potent winters I dunno what to say. Its not like he can go outside and disprove average global temperature changes.I think part of the problem is people heard global warming and figured it meant wed be extras in the movie Dune in  years. When really the climate just has to change on average by  degrees to have stupidly serious consequences.Edit So maybe a good question for your Dad is how much are scientists saying the climate has warmed already? and hell ballpark it at  degrees or something like that.,reactiongifs,cm7otvi,2,t5_2t5y3

2493835,0,t3_2o62em,If youre talking about the post stating it was so the lightsaber wouldnt slide down and chop off the Siths hand there have been countless posts refuting that point as well. Basically lightsaber blade lore indicates that they are supposed to stick not slide thats why in the original movies you get countless scenes were the jedi and sith are locked pushing their lightsabers against one another then have to push away.  The scene in the prequels where the lightsaber slides to chop off the hand was considered a poor adaptation of how lightsabers are supposed to work.    Im not a fanboy but the way fanboys explained lightsabers makes a lot more sense in reference to the original movies and lore than those trying to explain away a crossguard as if its a medieval steel sword that slides.  So basically ignore the one very flawed scene were the lightsaber slid as they arent supposed to do that and see that the crossguard is not logical even if it looks cool which I kinda agree with. ,reactiongifs,cmk2yyd,47,t5_2t5y3

2794125,0,t1_cnlktmy,Yes. Theres actually a lot of evidence that they are doing great work. Thats why no one speeds any more and NYC is collapsing under a new petty crime wave. Why is speeding so heavily enforced when its been shown to be of minuscule cause for accidents when compared to other things? Its not for safety thats for sure.Usually they set limits artificially low too which makes it easier to ticketIn fact limits have been shown to have a minimal effect on the speeds people actually drive. What does change is the number of citations given. In a study of  states where speed limits were either raised or lowered by five   or  miles per hour researchers found that cars average velocities did change but by less than two miles per hour. Rather than the tempo of travel shifting road regulations altered the rate of compliance Violations of the speed limit increased when limits were lowered and decreased when limits went up.......How about a fun one? NY roadways arent any more dangerous after increasing speedlimits and are actually somewhat safer even though more vehicles traveled on it. An estimated . million hours saved each year. ,reactiongifs,cnlojoj,4,t5_2t5y3

2905473,0,t1_cnycav2,I dont accept your premise that more scummy ad companies equates to more money. Are you able to justify this a bit more?To the point deciding what HTML gets served you are quite right about that. No argument there. However as I mentioned previously this gives them only a very limited measure of direct control over which ads get served via those tags. The alternative possibilities are quite limited Remove the tags and switch to a subscription paywalled business model. Some people have managed this successfully others havent. Do their ad sales direct more direct control over which advertisers you accept but not manageable for smaller sites Direct ad sales though a sales house which is what eBay do in the UK. Kind of a compromise between network and direct sales.So there are options but  of sites arent really big enough to make them work. For your average web admin theyre between a rock and a hard place either you make no money or you occasionally accept bad ads on your page.,reactiongifs,cnycwmm,1,t5_2t5y3

Your hours were paid as regular hours instead of being labeled as vacation hours sometimes happens with salary positions.

3105997,0,t1_cojdi0m,Im going to go back to your earlier reply and go from there You say the world is  years old so did god leave evidence of earlier human activity as well? We have ceramics from China dated around  years old and the Venus of Doln Vstonice which is dated at more than  years old. We have even more evidence of human activity beyond that so did God add this as well? When you think about evolution from one species to another keep in mind just how many species have gone extinct over earths history. The PermianTriassic extinction event killed  of species on earth. That was  million years ago. You might ask how do we go from a fish to an amphibian to a reptile to a mammal but its important to remember that most of the changes from one to another have died out hence we can only see these changes in the fossil record. Heres a good example of the fossil record showing change.gt is that there is reason for the earthSo without god a planet of  billion humans has no reason? What happens if we discover that Ganymede has life in its oceans? I just dont accept that without god earth is meaningless and even then I dont think that is a bad thing. The earth doesnt need meaning its has literally created its own through us. The home of the only known life in the entire universe is pretty special. gtThe fact that we have a designer doesnt make the creation of earth any less scientifically grounded than other theoriesSorry but this is not what I call scientifically grounded. gt The soil was just there and he can do thatOn the topic of hell which I have given a little thought I feel as if hell would be more interesting. I feel like I would get used to hell it might after  years become interesting. What new punishment am I going to receive today? Boy I hope it isnt being burned alive again! Thats the rd time this week. Whereas heaven is just the same old same old. Whats there going to be to do after  years? Sorry that whole train of thought was a bit cheeky and off topic feel free to ignore it. Heres a better question for you. Why are the innocent punished in gods world? If god loves us why do bad things happen to people who dont deserve it?Also whats your stance on homosexuality and abortion?,reactiongifs,cojxopk,1,t5_2t5y3

3199437,0,t1_cotlz9h,gtWhat does this even mean haha...You ask this and then go on to say how you prioritize your SO. you answered your own question what it means. gtThey dont have to be best friends just respect each otherAnd what if they didnt? you realize that is not the case for most people? the answer is you would choose her. because like you said you prioritize her and everyone else HAS to respect it because its rule number one right?Sometimes people meet the right people and hopefully thats whats happened in your case. But you need to understand that the majority does not end up with compatible matches but they ALL believe they are compatible. and when these people prioritize someone that will only be in the picture for a few years compared to friends that have been around for many many years it causes an issue. So when someone has a reputation for being with a SO for  years then changing it up the continuous cycle of letting things go to be a good friend gets old. and you are the one getting the dick up the ass because you are on a constant back burner to a new person every  years or so. and youre still expected to treat their prioritizing with respect. friends dont survive through people who live their lives that way. ,reactiongifs,cotmdks,-1,t5_2t5y3

3534869,0,t3_30q7e8,I worked at Future Shop and got laid off yesterday. There also used to be a Best Buy in my city as well which closed down a year ago. This Best Buy was  kilometers from the Future Shop I worked at. They closed down lots of Best Buys and Future Shops around Canada because the was no longer a need for that many retail stores. They opened to accommodate for the increasing demand for TVs among other reasons. The population was still transitioning from analog to digital and then HD TVs. After the market began slowing down there was no longer a need to have that many retailers and decided to keep the most profitable of the two and the most strategically placed stores. In our case was my Future ShopNow fast forward to today Best Buy is once again cutting its less profitable locations in order to save money and increase efficiency. They decided to consolidate every store under one brand. Its exactly the same store just with a different logo. All of the systems or product codes are exactly the same I could do my job in the exact same way in either a Future Shop or Best BuyThe only major differences are the instore brandingcolours and the logo is different. The salesmen are also no longer on commission.Their studies show it was the best idea and even if I lost my job I agree with the decision. This is business not a charity. Plus the severance package was much more than what I expected and what was legally required of them.EDIT Im from Sherbrooke Quebec. The same city as OP coincidentally ,reactiongifs,cpv75ml,58,t5_2t5y3

3841465,0,t1_cqu1jvy,Heres the low down that not many people know The USPS has a protocol for prioritizing deliveries which works in a surprisingly efficient manner. They do this by carrying packages and letters separately as to not slow down their carriers. This means that occasionally you may have to wait a bit longer for your package to arrive but everyone else will still get their mail on time. This is especially true in urban and suburban areas where many mail carriers operate on foot. Can you imagine a postal carrier having to carry everyones packages for their entire route? Talk about inefficiency. It is also important to note that I have no idea what Im talking about and everything youve just read is entirely made up because you commented in a reaction gif thread asking for advice on the USPS.,reactiongifs,cqu5st0,17,t5_2t5y3

4113738,0,t1_cros08a,gt to promote your political biases.My political biases?  You clearly couldnt be bothered to read my comment history or you would have realized we are on the same side politically.  Im not opposed to or feel threatened by new andor more accurate descriptions of the human condition and I firmly support the continued evolution of our understanding of ourselves as a species.  What does bother me as someone in his early s is that the concept of cis was a foreign one before seeing the South Park episode late last year where Cartman wanted his own bathroom.  Prior to seven months ago for my entire life there were some people who were transgender and there was everybody else which was considered normal.  I like accept and respect gay people but I dont describe myself as not gay.  Thats what cis is to me not trans.  What really bothers me is that the word cis is often followed by scum.  Given the totality of human history and the deeply entrenched systems of bias and gendersexual oppression I try hard to swallow my tongue when someone becomes internetfamous for saying something as ignorantly offensive Bahar I cant be racist Mustafa being the latest example as anything Bill OReilly might say.  But being labeled as scum for not fully embracing an idea that didnt exist to me eight months ago trips a psychological defense mechanism in me that makes me want to reject the entire movement.  I use my reasoning to overcome this reaction but this kneejerk reaction of youre not on fully on board with us youre part of the problem! is counterproductive to achieving the goals of greater understanding of the multitude of ways humans can experience life.  It alienates potential allies and provides ammunition to those who fear change or feel threatened by increasing equality.

4153849,0,t1_crqo369,It should be noted that Ive upvoted every single person whos disagreed with me here as far as I know.That said.In th grade I took an SAT test without preparing for it at all it was spurofthemoment I knew about it about an hour ahead of time and didnt do any research or anything. I scored higher on it than the average person using it to apply for college in my area.An IQ test has shown me to be in the .th percentile for IQ. This is the highest result the test I was given reaches anything further and theyd consider it to be within the margin of error for that test.My mothers boyfriend of  years is an aerospace engineer who graduated Virginia Tech. At the age of  I understand physics better than him and I owe very little of it to him as he would rarely give me a decent explanation of anything just tell me that my ideas were wrong and become aggravated with me for not quite understanding thermodynamics. Hes not particularly successful as an engineer but Ive met lots of other engineers who arent as good as me at physics so Im guessing thats not just a result of him being bad at it.Im also pretty good at engineering. I dont have a degree and other than physics I dont have a better understanding of any aspect of engineering than any actual engineer but I have lots of ingenuity for inventing new things. For example I independently invented regenerative brakes before finding out what they were and I was only seven or eight years old when I started inventing wireless electricity solutions my first idea being to use a powerful infrared laser to transmit energy admittedly not the best plan.I have independently thought of basically every branch of philosophy Ive come across. Every question of existentialism which Ive seen discussed in SMBC or xkcd or Reddit or anywhere else the thoughts havent been new to me. Philosophy has pretty much gotten trivial for me Ive considered taking a philosophy course just to see how easy it is.Psychology I actually understand better than people with degrees. Unlike engineering theres no aspect of psychology which I dont have a very good understanding of. I can debunk many of even Sigmund Freuds theories.Im a good enough writer that Im writing a book and so far everybody whos read any of it has said it was really good and plausible to expect to have published. And thats not just like me and family members that counts strangers on the Internet. Ive heard zero negative appraisal of it so far people have critiqued it but not insulted it.I dont know if that will suffice as evidence that Im intelligent. Im done with it though because Id rather defend my maturity since its what youve spent the most time attacking. The following are some examples of my morals and ethical code.I believe firmly that everybody deserves a future. If we were to capture Hitler at the end of WWII I would be against executing him. In fact if we had any way of rehabilitating him and knowing that he wasnt just faking it Id even support the concept of letting him go free. This is essentially because I think that whoever you are in the present is a separate entity from who you were in the past and who you are in the future and while your present self should take responsibility for your past selfs actions it shouldnt be punished for them simply for the sake of punishment especially if the present self regrets the actions of the past self and feels genuine guilt about them.I dont believe in judgement of people based on their personal choices as long as those personal choices arent harming others. I dont have any issue with any type of sexuality whatsoever short of physically acting out necrophilia pedophilia or other acts which have a harmful affect on others  but I dont care what a persons fantasies consist of as long as they recognize the difference between reality and fiction and can separate them. I dont have any issue with anybody over what type of music they listen to or clothes they wear etc. I know thats not really an impressive moral but its unfortunately rare a great many people especially those my age are judgmental about these things.I love everyone even people I hate. I wish my worst enemies good fortune and happiness. Rick Perry is a vile piece of shit human being deserving of zero respect but I wish for him to change for the better and live the best life possible. I wish this for everyone.Im pretty much a pacifist. Ive taken a broken nose without fighting back or seeking retribution because the guy stopped punching after that. The only time Ill fight back is if  the person attacking me shows no signs of stopping and  if I dont attack Ill come out worse than the other person will if I do. In other words if fighting someone is going to end up being more harmful to them than just letting them go will be to me I dont fight back. Ive therefore never had a reason to fight back against anyone in anything serious because my ability to take pain has so far made it so that Im never in a situation where Ill be worse off after a fight. If Im not going to get any hospitalizing injuries I really dont care.The only exception is if someone is going after my life. Even then Ill do the minimum amount of harm to them that I possibly can in protecting myself. If someone points a gun at me and I can get out of it without harming them Id prefer to do that over killing them.I consider myself a feminist. I dont believe in enforced or uniform gender roles they may happen naturally but they should never be coerced into happening unnaturally. As in the societal pressure for gender roles should really go even if itll turn out that the majority of relationships continue operating the same way of their own accord. I treat women with the same outlook I treat men and never participate in the old Reddit women are crazy circlejerk because there are multiple women out there and each have different personalities just like there are multiple men out there and each with different personalities. I dont think you do much of anything except scare off the awesome women out there by going on and on about the ones who arent awesome.That doesnt mean I look for places to victimize women I just dont believe its fair to make generalizations such as the one about women acting like everythings OK when its really not and thats a particularly harsh example because all humans do that.Im kind of tired of citing these examples and Im guessing youre getting tired of reading them if youve even made it this far. In closing the people who know me in real life all respect me as do a great many people in the Reddit brony community where I spend most of my time and where Im pretty known for being helpful around the community. A lot of people in my segment of the community are depressed or going through hard times and I spend a lot of time giving advice and support to people there. Yesterday someone quoted a case of me doing this in a post asking everyone what their favorite motivationalinspirational quote was and that comment was second to the top so I guess other people agreed though granted it was a pretty lowtraffic post only about a dozen competing comments.And uh Im a pretty good moderator.All that and I think your behavior in this thread was totally assholish. So what do you think now that you at least slightly know me?,reactiongifs,crtr35b,28,t5_2t5y3
4157180,0,t1_cru2nwy,Yes thats very true. Netflix also doesnt have the luxury of having millions of titles and it certainly wouldnt get away with uploading titles without permission.But I can do an easy search thatll bring up results in a sensible and easy to browse way and therell be ways to filter out the categories by length date rating etc etc. Itll suggest words when youre using search itll suggest performers and related or similar searches. Looking at one genre is really easy.  And while I dont use them Im sure Netflix would benefit from some basic community functions provided it doesnt turn into Youtube comments.And thats without going into all the bizarre decisions that exist on Netflixs homepage. What the fuck is with those goddamn onespeed horizontal bars with the movies? Why cant I easily look at one genre? Why do you only list a certain list of genres that I have no say in and cant be expanded? Why is search only accessible by scrolling all the way to the top again?

4162384,0,t1_crun7ku,Testimony is a statement either written or verbal by a witness describing an event. Because it is based on the perceptions of a witness it is subject to the witnesses conscious state and therefor can only describe the witnesss perception of an event not an objective account of the event itself.Your argument is based on your colloquial definition of proof a definition I might add that wouldnt even be a high enough standard in the legal field to justify a search but less imply guilt not on any formal definition of proof. You also claim that the formal definition of proof has no bearing outside of mathematics yet other formal definitions of proof exist for other fields beyond mathematics. When I showed them to you you disregarded them as sourceless.Allegations do not equate to proof. In even the least rigorous standard that legal cases can be tried civil the standard of proof is preponderance of the evidence not the some credible evidence standard that would be met assuming that all allegations are shown credible This statement is not meant to imply specifically that any allegations against Mr. Cosby are false but is meant to apply to the credibility of allegations by testimony in general.,reactiongifs,crupzch,1,t5_2t5y3

4453157,0,t1_csrzil6,I tend to say its easier to vote No.People are often afraid of change  prefer stability. You see that a lot when people say Why change? Im comfortable with what we have now. If people are uninformed about the change they are being offered they wont take the risk of changing. It means putting people out of their comfort zone.I believe that theyre good argument on both sides of the position but unfortunately well informed and politicized people only consist in a fraction of the vote. Lets say  vote No  vote Yes and the other  is undecided. The  of well informed and politicized voters dont matter they cancel each other out. What matters are the one who have no idea what they are voting for and just wait to be told for what to vote.That leads to media  corporations  the elders who dont get this new world they live in basically decides the outcome of the vote. Ill vote No I heard on the news voting Yes is going to be bad for the economy. My old man who have seen this country prosper for so many years... He said he was going to vote No he knows his shit more than I do.tldr  People have a tendency to prefer stability over change.,reactiongifs,css0633,-8,t5_2t5y3

This isnt a zero sum game where freest speech wins  thats living in fantasy. Join the rest of us here in reality. Everyone forgets the ugly stepcousin of free speech called propaganda. And how it can create a system where truth is obscured because fiction is too easy to believe or sounds like what I want to hear. And those with power and money can create and use propanda to great effect to spread lies and falsehoods and tell their side of the story  it happened in the rise of Hilter its happening right now in the US  turn on Fox News. A news organization that runs on propanda. And no matter how many people say thats not true! look at how it doesnt even matter people believe it. Is that a good and just system? Why hasnt the truth emerged and Fox News been taken down? Because fantasy theories dont always work so well in reality. Children stick by concepts do or die despite any mistakes or problems adults make careful solutions to fix the leaks they find when the rubber meets the road.

5199045,0,t1_cvcnnmm,gtI dont.Let me rephrase thatIf someone believed that killing sentient animals is morally unjust why would he or she let their child contribute to that?gtYep though youre reaching pretty far.I dont think so. Vegans generally view killing nonhuman animals unnecessarily as morally unjust. Nonvegans generally view killing humans unnecessarily as morally unjust.So if your child one day said hey momdad I want to try human meat would you pay someone to kill another human so that your kid could have the experience?gtThe difference here is that the human has something to contribute to society I dont think a cow is gonna contribute much of importance.Many humans dont contribute to society or contribute in lesser ways. Do you feel that the punishment for killing someone who hasnt contributed much to society should be less severe than the punishment for killing someone who has contributed? Do you think someone would be justified in murdering children with developmental disabilities?gtNeither do I think the family of a cow really cares much about where their family members have gone.I dont think youve given this much thought. Cows are mammals like humans and as such have certain instincts and feelings that help them care for their young. This is a result of evolution. If the mother didnt have feelings toward her child there would be less of a chance it would survive long enough to reproduce. Evolution favored mammals that had the genes that caused them to care about their young.gtIn your logic killing anything sentient is bad.Not necessarily. Unnecessarily harming and killing a being that can experience suffering is bad.gtnot changing my life to delay the execution of a few farm animals.Vegans arent concerned about the animals currently on the farms there is little we can do for them. We are concerned about doing whatever we can to reduce the demand to breed more animals to be slaughtered.gtBut just as with SJWs too much of a good thing can turn in a very bad thing.What does this even mean?,reactiongifs,cvcof80,2,t5_2t5y3

We respond by ignoring them dismissing their problems and complaints and forgetting them. It only becomes news when someone decides not to go quietly into that good night.You can blame guns you can blame the media you can blame poor mental health services but the fact remains that you have created a society that makes vast masses of people so miserable that they would rather be dead. Until you address that problem the mass shooting will continue.His name was Chris Harper Mercer.,reactiongifs,cvm7r0w,8,t5_2t5y3

Take to the extreme its why you dont wear a tuxedo to an interview. Its the wrong outfit for the situation.Wearing a suit does not mean anything. All it means is youre wearing a suit. And if a suit is not what they wear at the company then you would have been better off wearing something closer to what they do wear.By defaulting to a suit instead of doing some research or asking questions its more of a costume.gt Look at me. Im in a suit. Im a businessman. Business business business.Its  and depending on your industry and your location they are becoming a thing of the past. Much how ties are no longer default. It used to be that even if you didnt wear a suit you would need to have a tie on. Not any more.Look Im not saying suits are bad. By all means its something to consider when going on an interview.

5599277,0,t1_cwr3t52,Is NYC on the edge of its time zone? Sunrise and sunset should be roughly equally far from noon outside of a shifted time plan. Or is it a consequence of being a coastal city where the land is higher on one side than the ocean is on the other? Maybe its both?Of course I know that there are fewer total hours of sunlight during winter regardless of how you move the hands on the clock. My point was just that the dramatic shift between DST and Standard Time in Autumn could be resolved better by eliminating the confusing costly timeshift twice a year and simply getting up earlier and starting work earlier when more sunlight later in the day was desired.

5740988,0,t1_cx8nxg6,You just need a witness doesnt have to be the boss it could be a manager. The point is that you have a respectful conversation before you quit explain why you need to move on thank them for the opportunity. Presenting the notification in writing with the conversation and keeping your own copy of the written note are just more professional ways of leaving a job than just having a conversation about it. This is a way of not finding yourself on the schedule the day or week after your employment with a company was supposed to be over. Twoweeks is a bare minumum courtesy. When I leave a job I try to give at least one months notice so that if necessary I can help train a new employee to do what I was doing even if I didnt like the job or thought the boss was a dick. A spiteful employer who has to scramble to hire someone and train them in two weeks is going to be pissed off. If you have a remotely positive relationship with your boss then dont put them in that type of position. The point is to be able to walk out the door for the last time knowing that you have a reference down the road that you can put down on other applications. My advice is no different than looking your best when you go for the interview. First impressions are important and the Exit Interview or whatever you want to call it is almost as important because its your reputation as a worker that is at stake. ,reactiongifs,cx8q4ge,2,t5_2t5y3

The only thing that WoW did was reduce the variety of games I played which is the reason why I quit it. Especially since Im not rich I just cannot fight the urge to squeeze every penny of value out of the subscription which lead to the mentality that if I was going to be spending leisure time I might as well do it with WoW because I already paid for it.

6415398,0,t1_cziucmk,The final season gets rid of the flashbacks and flash forwards and instead does a flash sideways. It shows what would have happened had the plane never crashed. But throughout the season they all get drawn to each other and most of them slowly start figuring out something that has drawn them together. Its implied they are somehow remembering their time on the island and all tie up their loose ends. Jack still has no idea whats going on and doesnt remember the island until he goes to his dads funeral. He looks into the casket and its empty. His dad walks out and Jack realizes that they are all dead and that this is not a flash sideways so much as it is purgatory. Everything that happened on the island actually happened and they all died eventually and met up in the afterlife so they could move on. Most of them end up dying on the island I think Sawyer Kate and Claire get off the island with the pilot Frank. Hurley and Ben stay behind to care for the island. The show ends with Jack laying on the island and closing his eye to directly mirror the opening scene of the first episode If you got eight minutes to kill heres the ending of the last episode that shows Jacks realization and their goodbye.

6416356,0,t1_cziypqh,I dont think the reaction is immature at all. Reaction videos in whatever format arent some invention of ingenuity and making copyright claims against some twat with  views on their videos because theyre trying to supposedly rip you off is vulturistic. There is no precise definition of what their format actually is and what it extends to. Is it merely sitting at a certain angle watching videos on a screen? If so that almost encompasses all reaction videos. Is it discussing the video after watching? Again all reaction videos. Theres basically one way to do those type of videos and theyre being disingenuous by suggesting theyve got some special version people shouldnt copy. They can go fuck themselves for all I care and I hope someone litigates against their bullshit copyright ,reactiongifs,cziz3pv,37,t5_2t5y3

Honestly I think the majority of them are either neck beards who wont ever have the chance to reproduce or shitty fathers who were too irresponsible to wear a rubber and are mad that they actually have to be responsible for another human beings life now while they grow up. Its seriously sad. Children drive me nuts but you dont hear me complaining about raising my  year old stepdaughterwho is an asshole Lmao or my  month old daughter.

Native Americans are human beings with human faults desires ambitions they are human beings.

You would find Caesars and Lenins and Washingtons and Maos and Pattons and Gideons and Ghandis and Rommels. It would be glorious to know that history.

6698533,1,t1_d0c4xz4,Trump is good at the Trump persona. Hes not spectacular with money hes constantly lying about how much he has and its expected to be significantly lower than anything he has said. Hes good at convincing people hes good. Self aware and conniving not dumb but not particularly intelligent either. He fell into his dads money and built his career on his attention seeking personality.He also has no political history. At most hes been the person throwing money at politicians until he gets what he wants. Doing this and running a business where he bullies people to get what he wants does not qualify him to be President. He already has bad foreign relations with most everyone and his foreign policy is childish. Nationalism has been tried and showed to fail. Going into the st century we need to be aware of the fact that the world is increasingly a global community and that trending towards isolationism is a step back.If he doesnt want foreigners to take American jobs then the way to do that is not by building a wall but by not exporting all of his industrial production to China. Were losing more jobs to China and India by the big corporations shipping them out there than we are having to illegal immigrants picking cherries. Trump is a big corporation that does this. Illegal immigration is illegal but the barriers to citizenship are unreasonable. If we made it easier to become a legal immigrant then wed have less illegal ones.And the xenophobia and Islamophobia he promotes is not good for us or for the war on organizations like ISIS. The behavior that Trump is displaying is exactly what ISIS says Americans are like in order to get people to join them. The presumption of innocence holds for all people not just citizens. Restricting movement based on religion or race goes against this especially if it is based on the fear that they might be terrorists. If we want to defeat ISIS then we need to be a safe haven for those Muslim people that are fleeing ISIS and not a catalyst for ISIS recruitment. Ive found that all basic moral guidelines can be boiled down to just one Dont be a dick. Discriminating people by their race or religion is a dick move. Building a wall to keep people from escaping cartelrun Mexico is a dick move. Shipping jobs to China to save a pretty penny is a dick move. Lying your financial state when it is one of your main running qualifications is a dick move. Donald Trump is a dick. We need someone who is smart competent experienced and not a dick to be president.Edit Smoking pot is illegal but the solution isnt to restrict it more or crack down on it the solution is to reevaluate and update the laws.,reactiongifs,d0c6ppb,-1,t5_2t5y3

The man who inherited millions went bankrupt multiple times is a corrupt businessman host of the Celebrity Apprentice changes his position to suit his goals represents the  like no one else can...is the President of the United States.What would happen over the next  years? I can only imagine us becoming the laughingstock of the world. I mean even more than we already are. In  people in a civilized firstworld country elected a man whos policies would look outofdate in . Thats insane. The world would hate us. Britain and Israel have already talked about banning the man from visiting their country. And now we could see firsthand how destructive the mans policies really are. He would instantly go down as the worst president in history much worse than Bush.I dont see a way around it. There are two possible outcomes. . The conservatives finally see the error of their ways and we can finally join the rest of the developed world in areas we should have decades ago. We will look back on this as the most tragic election ever held in the United States and an embarrassment to our country. The civilized countries remain wary of us but slowly come to see us as allies again.. The conservatives become so entrenched in their beliefs it creates a rift through society on the scale of a fullout civil war. The conservatives feel so cornered they break off from America and Civil War . begins. They will inevitably lose. The civilized countries rely on America for trade and commerce so they will be willing to help us.

7137326,0,t1_d1pejll,Im not sure if you are being facetious or not but Ill answer in seriousness.  She did.  State Department had undergone years of deficient FOIA compliance. The sum up that report State Department Inspector General Steve Linick points to a series of failures in the procedures the office of the secretary used to respond to public records requests including a lack of written policies and training as well as inconsistent oversight by senior personnel. The report also faulted the secretarys office for a practice of not searching for emails responsive to FOIA requests unless the request specifically asked for emails or demanded all records on a topic. It took a specific FOIA by VICE news to highlight that she had retained records offsite outside of searchable materials and an Inspector General investigation to showcase that the Dept had been failing in FOIA compliance as a regular practice. This is in the broader context of exerted pressure from the Obama administration to prevent FOIA reform and open government records access.Ultimately her release of documents came after repeated attempts to access them through legal means continual deflection by avoiding FOIA compliance by the Agency. Even then the offsite server has purged of all documents she did not want seen under those circumstances that is obstruction of justice and deletion of government records regardless of whether she had accurately determined their personal nature.TLDR  She hid behind poor FOIA compliance to avoid disclosure of her server and records for years only turning over those she personally deemed worthwhile after being caught in adverse FOIA determinations.,reactiongifs,d1pfppq,4,t5_2t5y3

Your source is obviously extremely biased. This is another reason why I dont think youll ever change your mind as a result of some random internet argument.. There are several factors as to why rape rates are much higher in Sweden    The definition of rape differs between countries. Swedens definition of rape is comparatively broad so incidents that would not be called rape in other places falls under rape here.    Willingness to report differs between countries. In a country where a report of rape is likely to go ignored or even get the victim in trouble the proportion of reported rapes will be lower. Even in Sweden there are great numbers of rapes that arent reported  imagine what its like where being a rape victim is a huge social stigma.    Willingness to discuss the issue differs between countries. In a country where the police or politicians want to downplay the issue more cases will be noted as something other than rape.    In other words using official statistics to compare the number of actual rapes is futile. Source,reactiongifs,d2231xn,-1,t5_2t5y3

I guess they should be able to read road maps too so they can find their way home if they get lost.gtPilots should be brave so they wont get scared if its foggy and they cant see or if a wing or motor falls off they should stay calm so theyll know what to do. pilots have to have good eyes to see through clouds and they cant be afraid of lightning or thunder because they are much closer to them than we are.gtThe salary pilots make is another thing I like. They make more money than they know what to do with. This is because most people thing that plane flying is dangerous except pilots dont because they know how easy it is.

9151194,0,t1_d8bxd6b,Not just that but the image of a modern developed country was formed by Western Europe where societies have been demilitarised nationalism is frowned upon and jingoism is a sin as a result from the World Wars.     This never happened in the US whatsoever and the government has been actively encouraging nationalism patriotism and jingoism the Russian and Chinese governments have kept their old ways despite their huge losses in the th century Russia did transform postUSSR but under Putin it has gone back to Soviet levels of nationalism and jingoism and Japan is a bit complicated when it comes to nationalism.    Europeans often comment on the military operations of other powers as being backwards and unheard of. Even operations of European forces are very unpopular and dismissed by many as a waste of money and lives as inappropriate and as nothing more than some boys playing war. Now as a European myself I do have to admit that its a bit ironic that were taking the moral high ground in modern times but the th century made that happen.,reactiongifs,d8bzar9,30,t5_2t5y3

Bush senior simply stated that the military is needed to protect from threat of the technological sophistication of Third World powers.

9388796,0,t3_5952js,Worst decision I ever made was moving in with my gf and her parents.... She and I had a daughter together and she wouldnt move in with my parents so I chose to move in with hers so we could raise her together. Seemed like the good thing to do.Let me say this for anyone who doesnt realise in a relationship fighting is inevitable and it is important. If you cant express yourself when you knock heads with your significant other if you cant argue or work on a resolution....youre going to have troubles.She and I would get upset with each other all the time but we would never fight. Why ? Because I knew that if we did it would be  against  in a house that wasnt mine. It wouldnt be worth it. I was miserable so much of the time because I couldnt be myself around them they never liked me much and didnt hide it well. I was miserable all the time and even though I wasnt the best father I couldve been....I tried to do right by my daughter and gf and stick it out....even though it helped cause us so many problems. Well eventually we moved into our own place years later and finally could be adults about our problems right ? Wrong !! We were so used to keeping quiet and letting shit bother us that we kept doing it. Wed say something made us mad not talk about it and eventually get over it. Or we just wouldnt talk about it at all. Now shes gone because she wasnt happy. Our biggest problem we agree was our lack of communication....I dont just blame her parents house I blame us but if we started on our own I think we would have been better off.

Clinton lost despite being the superior choice in terms of being qualified for the job in part because of decades of Republican rumormongering and smear tactics finally bearing fruit.Socialism has much of the same historical baggage in the United States just look at the reaction to the ACA in Obamas first term! and Im just hesitant to discount that factor based on experience.In the end with enough propaganda and misinformation it doesnt matter what the facts are.,reactiongifs,d9wnrhu,1,t5_2t5y3

I really dont see anything wrong with that.It really is a very arguable issue. You might as well ask why dont we have direct democracy instead of elected representatives. Cause in the current system the Congress could get thru a law that would get rejected in a popular vote based on party affiliation.

No state has more power than the other because no states have any power.gt So are you going to have mandatory turnout to get an accurate vote? Half the people in the majority of these states are already not voting.  million people is more than a representative sample. You could get a representative sample of how people will vote from about  people as long as theyre properly samples. Its basic statistics.Barring systemic disenfranchisement from the laws and people around youIf youre not voting on election day youre voluntarily removing yourself from the election process in which literally who represents you doesnt matter because you didnt bother to vote for a person to represent you.,reactiongifs,d9wynw2,1,t5_2t5y3

Except from the attacks on Sanders supporters for how the SC appointment was too important to get what we wanted. Congressional obstructionism obviously was a barrier but a historically unprecedented neglect of Constitutional duties should have been screamed at the national level every day. Hell Obama could have just made a public statement that he was making the appointment over the Republicans dead bodies since their refusal to consider a nomination for nearly a year was acceptable as a tacit waiver of their Constitutional power to vet the appointment.

10020940,0,t3_5j6eoj,Serious question is this a thing that some guys just do? Cause I have a friend who just dropped all his friends including his roommate though they still live together he just... doesnt interact with the guy anymore the moment he got a new GF. This shits been going on for like  months now and its pissing us off big time. EDIT WOW I was not expecting that many replies in my inbox jesus christ lol Not enough to be RIP inbox worthy but ... a lot more than my antisocial self was planning on getting lolTo clarify some things and maybe put some of my points into perspective I understand the whole essence of having that shiny new toy when youre in a new relationship. I dont really relate to it as much anymore because Ive been in a relationship for  years so I enjoy seeing my boyfriend and I miss him when hes not around but we definitely dont need to be tied around each others waists all the time to survive. This is just something that seems to happen quite regularly for this guy PLUS there are friends who he used to have tight friendships with one person he was friends with who they had nicknames with they had their own way of talking to each other as friendships go and now he suddenly treats them like strangers in an almost passive aggressive manner yknow? Hes also one of those types who goes ALL IN to a relationship I mean all in  talking about marriage within the first week all in. Im definitely not as close to him as I used to be but I like to consider him enough of a friend from my end that I hate seeing him throwing away all his friendships like this and burning his bridges over a relationship that he could be potentially ruining by doing so. I guess. I dunno. Ive talked to a lot of his other friends about it including ones that I became friends with THROUGH HIM and trust me its not just a me problem p Anyway Im not here to argue with anyone or anything I appreciate everyones input! Well see how it goes lol,reactiongifs,dbdr8ku,1071,t5_2t5y3

10035099,0,t1_dbfg90y,True Jyns not a great analogy because she doesnt do any force stuff and thats at the crux of the complaints.I can see how Rey doing badass stuff is indeed the showing part that hints at her being a daughter of the force and having prior training it just feels a bit of a stretch that I have to leap to a conclusion that would narratively be a plot twist in order to make her abilities seem consistent with the rest of the franchise. In this sense I think a lot of the mary sue accusations are misdirected at the character when really it it should be a complaint about storytelling structure. Or in the case that she doesnt happen to be Lukes secret Jedi daughter or whatever then I think the problem is simply that TFA misunderstands how force abilities work  take the scene when Rey learns the mind trick on the spot  it actually makes sense if shes unlocking some mindwiped prior training I just wish that were explained but it seems silly if shes just some random forcesensitive who figures it out in two tries. It kind of demystifies the whole thing but thats just my personal reaction to that scene. Either way its not really a problem with Reys character so much as the plot around her. Thanks for being so respectful and polite in this conversation by the way its very refreshing.  ,reactiongifs,dbfllwk,1,t5_2t5y3

The full quote isgt I think that people in the US and Europe are starting to realize that Islam is fundamentally incompatible with Western values. There are many people who happen to be Muslim who adjust to Western values and assimilate into our societies and thats awesome. But there are many who dont.Do you know that many Christians are promarriage equality for gays?  So despite Christianity generally being very antihomosexual these individuals decide for themselves that that facet of Christianity doesnt fit with their view.  Just the same way many Muslims decide that certain facets of Islam do not fit with their worldview and adjust accordingly.So please stop it.  Ive already given you several examples of me saying that there are plenty of Muslims who integrate into the West well.

Trump thinks climate change is a myth. Hes actively dismantling our governments environment protection programs. Thats going to be a catastrophic problem if global warming crosses the point of no return. This ban against Muslims as Trump promised during his campaign is grossly unconstitutional. We are a nation built by immigrants and he has no respect for that. He just repealed the ACA without any replacement.Believe it or not people are freaking out because bad things are happening.

If its obvious what the video is about then take away the goddamn black bars and emojis and description. Chances are its a video I saw on reddit  years ago and suddenly it resurfaces on facebook with captions saying This guy is funny Watch this video  emojis  and people think its some new original hilarious content. What really gets me annoyed is when I see major marketing doing it. Like say an ad for Hondas for example. I dont give a fuck if Honda knows the dankest memes or not but they certainly dont need to demonstrate it by making their commercials look like a post on tumblr. And it doesnt have to be Honda. It could be any company the bigger the more cringey. Dell. Walgreens Coke. A McDonalds commercial with letterbox captions that say When bae says lets go to McDonalds. That shit is SO annoying. Thats not a complete sentence. Its obnoxious it sounds uneducated Which dont ask me or AXE me rather why the fuck ebonics is considered fashionable. Kids are unlearning the proper english their parents paid to have taught to them. Ugh.

They show a public fairly unfamiliar with him and entirely unfamiliar with his weak points gaffes and skeletons in his closet.The waste stuff is on him it would have been used and Bill is irrelevant in this case.gtBernie there has never been a late Uturn akin to HillaryI understand why you think this he certainly has sold himself that way but he only voted against DOMA due to states rights and he said gay marriage was not a priority in . A gay activist said of him Obtaining Congressman Bernie Sanders position on the gay marriage issue was like pulling teeth  from a rhinoceros From  he has supported gay marriage. Obama and Hillary also changed their stances when they felt their was a political sea change. But Bernie is supposed to be the one whos not like other politicians.gtSocial studies show that the ghost of communism isnt as effective today as it was decades ago and the reality is that Sanders is actually not a communist. I have already supplied my stats on this and tbh he may as well be one. He has PLENTY of pro communist quotes and the GOP would hardly have been bothered by the nuance of whatever he was actually supposed to mean by them were he to run.I understand you have a hate boner for Debbie Wasserman but can you tell me what exactly she did that was so appalling? Be specific. Bitchy internal emails may look bad but what did she actually do that broke any rules?gtNeither nominating for  which didnt ever happen nor was ever planned to happen He wanted a progressive to primary the President in . He has multiple quotes on the topic. It is true and an incredible illustration of how clueless he is.

11159721,0,t1_dewx43b,This is  bullshit. By vague and anonymous sources  do you mean various intelligence agencies of the United States reporting that the Russian government tried to help Trump win multiple reports that there were aides in contact with Russia during the campaign the National Security Adviser being forced to resign after not disclosing his talks with Russia and the Attorney General of the United States being forced to recuse himself after it was discovered he had met with the Russian ambassador?The evidence is there. And it is mounting. You are ignoring it. Additionally media sources are not saying wiretapping definitely did not happen. They are asking for evidence of which the WH has provided none. IN ADDITION a president does not have the authority to order a wiretap. If the DOJ did that means a FISA court judge approved it after seeing significant evidence that somebody in the Trump campaign was in contact with Russia. So no its not a bit fucking strange. ,reactiongifs,dewxxnq,25,t5_2t5y3
