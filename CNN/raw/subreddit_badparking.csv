6801106,0,t3_48wt4s,This car was actually a good small talk opener when I was queuing for coffee inside.  The guy parked across  disabled spaces and the driving lane despite three normal spaces directly opposite all being empty.  I didnt see if he had a disabled badge in his window but when he walked up and drove off a few seconds after I took the photo he seemed fine.  I almost wanted to ask him if there was a story behind his parking because it seemed way beyond poor spacial awareness.,badparking,d0n75ef,3,t5_2rey4

But I only use the handicap spots when I am having a bad day because I feel like other people probably need it more. But one of my biggest pet peeve is when people give me dirty looks for parking there. I am pretty sure it is because I am young  and relatively healthy looking.
