2701208,0,t1_cnb0ih3,Thats why it takes someone with  years of experience  or so months to pass the Lab. Now not everyone is like that but thats about the rule of thumb.,ccie,cnb47zg,2,t5_2qjhm
3626063,0,t1_cq2xeuz,Which INE package did you get?  The All Access Pass and what level? or just the CCIE RampS bundle and which one?Theres a lot of options when it comes to the IE exams.  I dont so much need rack credits we have a bit of equipment I can use in a lab rack here but I am looking for something that will help for mostly the lab but probably the written as well.Im looking to take my first attempt at the written at CL in June.  I havent done much more than read through the CCIE RampS v books and labbed up what I could in GNS.  But if I pass Im looking for something that would help me prepare for the CCIE Lab Exam preferably around the  month mark should I pass.  If I fail Im looking for something that will help me pass the second attempt at the written which Id like to do by the beginning of Feb  since thats when my NP expires and Id prefer to not have my cert expire even though its not needed for IE.Apologies to all who might see this question multiple times Im looking at the IE options from INE hoping to get work to pay for one but trying to figure out which option I should go withtry to get my boss to pay for ... and Im askingcopypastaing everyone whos indicated theyve gotten the INE for IE stuff,ccie,cq5lk0w,1,t5_2qjhm

4150913,0,t3_389o8r,Honestly excellent attitude. Some people come out of that exam feeling cheated but I believe the CCIE is by far one of the most justfair certifications on the market. Its a true test of your knowledge abilities time management and effort.If you dont mind me asking what CCIE track did you sit for? I have a feeling its the RampS.The RampS is next on my list IF I pass the CCIE Data Center Lab exam... ,ccie,crtf27u,6,t5_2qjhm

6785261,0,t3_45pcjb,You can pass anything with enough effort. A CCIE track tracks a lot of study and lab time.,ccie,d0le9ei,1,t5_2qjhm
6831507,0,t3_4990di,I havent used both but I felt like the real lab was harder than INE in a sense. The technical issues werent as complicated but the size of the network is huge and getting your bearings is a challenge with the clock ticking. ,ccie,d0qnh6e,1,t5_2qjhm

I also found that Im slower at my config than I would like but I guess that just means I need to keep doing more of them to get faster.,ccie,devbv95,1,t5_2qjhm
