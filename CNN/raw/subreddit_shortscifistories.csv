3132569,0,t1_col52mv,Very interesting. I wonder how OKULOUS would fare with diamonds raining at them through the various gas layers. Wed probably need an upgrade on the outer armor shell.

7099312,0,t1_d1l2apa,I wanted to explore the idea that the dog is some sort of misunderstood protector.I wanted the reader to be more curious about the noises under the floor but i wanted the narrators obliviousness to also be believable. So i tried to hint at things to the reader through the narrators observations without actually putting thoughts into the narrators head.I will have to read Needle i am not familiar with it.And now im getting downvoted for having a fucking conversation.Reddit makes me want to blow my fucking brains out   I hate this planet.  I hate humans. fuck.,shortscifistories,d1l2tmf,2,t5_2yswc
