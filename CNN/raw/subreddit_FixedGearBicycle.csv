I dont spend much time in the drops but the flat part really is nice for when theres a killer headwind.

15528,0,t1_ceg3wvs,A good chainring is something you really should invest in.        The cheap ones are punched out with a die so they tend to be slightly distorted and have a garbage tooth profile. They also are made from cheap grade metals which are not as strong. You will almost certainly need to replace the cheap chainring in a couple years.       A high quality chainring is milled and will be as close to perfect as possible and designed and tested for maximum performance. The best ones are made from T aluminum alloy which can withstand  psi cheap rings will flex under pressure. A high quality chainring can last a lifetime.,FixedGearBicycle,ceg7a7n,3,t5_2qo7a
21636,0,t3_1ud6br,Its a flashy looking bike thats clean with aero tubing to probably play on the higher end fixed gears people fawn over like the Bianchis Cinellis and Lows that get a lot of attention here.But it stops about there in terms of what youre getting. The components are generics that arent going to hold up too long. If youre looking to just cruise around the neighbourhood for errands or occasional sunny day rides itll probably suffice.If youre going to ride it hard or if youre going to ditch your carbus pass Id aim a bit higher because youll be constantly repairing components that crap out.Also if youre going to go fast change the pedals out for some sort of foot retention. Itll make up for the loss of a rear brake but if anything itll keep your feet in and you wont slip off and cut your shins up when the cranks come back around.If you want a well priced workhorse Im going to take the party line here and recommend a Kilo TT.,FixedGearBicycle,cegwa7w,5,t5_2qo7a

679458,0,t3_21ws3q,Top tube angle doesnt really mean anything in regards to fit.  Its all for appearance.  Traditionally bikes were made with level top tubes and the top of the seattube was about level with the top of the headtube.  Seatpost would come up a few inches with a saddle on top and so would the stem.  Pursuit geometry started putting the top of the headtube lower than the top of the seattube resulting in a downward sloping top tube as you move forward on the bike.  This just let the rider get bars even lower.  Not all downward sloping top tubes will get you this stance as a lot of bikes nowadays have taller seattubes for fashion minimal exposed seatpost and will give the visual appearance of lower bars.  Compact geometry has come around a lot in recent years where the headtube will be taller than the seattube and the top tube essentially rises to meet the headtube.  Advantages are that the frame has more standover clearance and more exposed seatpost means you can run larger saddle bags taillights etc.  In general get yourself fit to see what kind of reach horizontal distance from bottom bracket to top of headtube and stack vertical distance from bottom bracket to top of headtube you will need.  Reach and stack are all there is to fitting a bike and if you know a reachstack that works well for you its easy to dial in the rest of your bike fit.  Reach and stack measurements completely ignore the traditional effective top tube measurement since ETT is so dependent on frame angles whereas reachstack is static based around the bottom bracket location.  You really have three contact points on a bike  pedalsbottom bracket location handlebar position relative to the headtube adjusted with spacers and stem riselength and saddle adjusted for height and setback.  All other frame specs are for appearances only.,FixedGearBicycle,cghi6rz,3,t5_2qo7a

One of the delivery guys where I work rides one all over the city and its fine. I ride a ku  miles a week in NYC theres plenty of potholes unpaved streets curbsother bullshit and my cheap hiten bike is still solid. I didnt realize that biking would become such an integral part of my life so I wish I had saved up more and gotten something nicer but I love riding it and it gets me all around the city reliably. The thing with Purefix is that at  youre at a price point where if you just save a bit more to break  you can get a nicer chromoly bike like a Kilo TT. Theres  companies making basically the same hiten steel bike in bright colors with deep v wheelsets and if you want to go that route I would recommend ku simply because of the price.

From the pageMy neighbor had researched bike knee injuries and found that they were never noted until the safety bike emerged. The safety bike was the first bike that coasted and that had both the front and rear wheels the same size. The ordinary bikes of the time PennyFarthngs large front tire small back tire had a direct drive like a tricycle. You used your legs to stop the pedals from turning. It can be done. It is HARD at first. His theory was that this built up the opposite muscles around the knee and that it was muscles that help hold the knee patella in proper alignment.

2215754,0,t1_clkpb36,Theres literally no difference in power from one crank length to the next its just another fit component.  Youd see a greater variance in power output from one manufacturer to another than between different length cranks on the same rider assuming the rest of the fit was shifted for the crank length being used.  Taller people tend to be more comfortable on longer cranks shorter people on shorter cranks.  Most fixed riders just live with shorter cranks to get more ground clearance for cornering.  Longer cranks do give you more torque to push higher gears but shorter cranks feel better to spin at higher rpms.You can take my mm cranks over my dead body.  I cant ride anything less just feels like tiptoeing versus taking full strides.  Im also  so everything on my bike is a good bit larger than standard.If you want to nerd out check out the difference in bike setups during each stage of the TdF.

2919297,0,t3_2tk5ok,SimpleThe driveside cup is the one with two flat sections on the outer face that an adjustable wrench might grasp onto. The nondriveside cup is the one with many small holes in its outer face that a pin spanner might latch into. It is also marginally longer than the other cup.The bearings should face with the race the thing holding all the bearings together pointed towards the outside of the bike. This is against common practice for other piece cranks but in order to see for yourself simply spin the BB assembly with the races facing the spindle cone and see how poorly it rotates.Complex Start by greasing the shit out of the BB shell. The more the merrier get it nice and goopy in there. Install the first bearing race into the DS cup. Heavily grease the inside of the DS cup and then install the race such that the race is against the cup not away from it. Then apply more grease on top of the bearings. Install the DS cup using even more grease on its threads. Using an adjustable spanner or if youre lucky enough to have one the proper BB tool tighten the cup down until it is flush with the BB shell. Insert the plastic protector into the BB shell so that it nestles up against the DS cup inside the shell. Insert the spindle so that it goes through the DS cup and its cone comes to rest against the DS bearings. Do not use force. Install the second bearing race into the NDS cup. Grease the cup then insert the race so that the naked bearings will be touching the spindle cone then grease the bearings on top. Install the NDS cup using a pin spanner or Suginos special tool if you have access to it. This is a painful and delicate process because your goal is to have the NDS cup tight enough that there is no play in the spindle but loose enough that the bearings arent crushed. This will take trial and error but youll know pretty immediately when youre too loose. Too tight is a matter of carefully spinning the spindle and looking for tightness friction or scraping. Once you have the NDS cup exactly where you want it install the lockring. This is another painful process as you will need to hold the NDS cup exactly in place while you tighten the lockring first with your hand and then with a lockring wrench. Go slowly and make damn sure you dont move that cup! Once the lockring is on firmly apply significant torque to it to lock it into place. Test the BB. It should spin smoothly accounting for the goop inside that is with no play in the spindle and no friction against the cups. Once you are confident the BB has been installed correctly attach the crank arms and once more go over the test for play or friction both of which will be more apparent once the crank assembly is on.,FixedGearBicycle,cnzxl8r,4,t5_2qo7a

Your hands tend to slide forward while in the drops and my way of wrapping still does the shingling effect in the drops. The rest of the time doesnt matter because youre on the hoods and not the tape anyway. Plus it looks better all around.Edit Also I dont think youre a dumbass and Im confused why you would say I am youre probably a nice ladyguy but dont quite understand the benefits of the method I described. I get that its more comfortable to stick with what youve heard others say. Just maybe give this other way a try once and youll see what I mean. Cheers.,FixedGearBicycle,co6w847,-4,t5_2qo7a

4205216,0,t1_crz64k0,Its not a bad bike definitely a bump up from the ku and significantly lighter wither nicer components although not quite as pretty. Their Streetfighter is the same exact bike with straight riser bars if that suits your preferences a bit better.It comes equipped as a singlespeed meaning it only has a freewheel. Youd have to buy a cog and lockring to put on the other side of the rear wheel to ride fixed. As for sizing based on your height alone a  would probably fit you best.If you like the looks of the ku better than just go with it I rode one for a year and put it through hell without any problems. I sold it to my coworker and he still commutes on it daily. It also comes with both a freewheel and a fixed cog so you just have to flip the rear wheel around to change between the two.

The lower half of both dropouts had been bent downwards very slightly so that the steel protector inserts were loose. All I had to do was tap them into place with a hammer so that the inserts fit tight. Alu dropouts so I was kind of scared but everything seems in order now. Makes me wonder if the previous owner tried riding it without the inserts or something screwy like that he wasnt very knowledgeable.

The following refers to new because the used market is infinite and fickle  For a frameset take a look at the Crew District or the State Black Label.  Both are  aluminum frames with carbon forks and generally regarded as the best buys for an entry level aluminum track frame.  For a wheelset Velomine is where many go to find wheels.  H Plus Son TBs or Archetypes laced to Formula hubs are well regarded and affordable.  The problem with an  budget partly involves all the small parts that are often overlooked but essentialimportant.  Rim tape tubes headset spacers lockring pedals etc.   here and there adds up and before you know it your budgets toast.  Let us know if you have specific questions regarding specific parts and good luck!  Oh and as for used post WTB comments in the for sale thread here rbikeshop and the Pedalroom marketplace forum.

The crankset on the bianchi is not super high end but its much better than the one on the retrospec and overall the bianchi is a much better bike. But do note that the bianchi has true track geomotry which means the bottom bracket is a bit taller as well as the top tube so if you want standover clearance you may want to get a size smaller than you normally would  my cm top top hight from the floor is the same as one of my cm bikes  if you cant swing the  id recommend not buying the retrospec and just holding your money for a little bit. also serach the facebook groups austin bikelist and bicycle sale and trade austin tx lots of FGSS pop up there for reasonable prices  hey im in austin too!  just snagged a bianchi pista for dirt cheap on CL the other day. nice FGSS bikes come up often and are dirt cheap here and ive seen really good deals pop up skip the retrospec and just wait for something good to pop up.

It should actually be fairly slack  you should be able to lift the top section midway between chainring and sprocket around half and inch.You shouldnt need. Great deal of torque to hold the rear axle in place. Grease the axles and keep the contact surfaces as clean as you can. Use track nuts with an attached free spinning washer if you can. If not you could try flat faced nuts with a cammed Nordloc washer instead. As others have suggested fit chain tensioners.,FixedGearBicycle,d2yp32g,2,t5_2qo7a

7859374,0,t1_d3z6vy5,Looking at your bike Im not surprised you dont understand edit foot retention be it clips straps or clipless gives you the ability to PULL on your pedal in addition to PUSHING. This allows one to create more power while cycling thus making foot retention popular in many cycling disciplines. But! As you may already know fixed gear bicycles have a fixed rear cog which makes it possible to slow your speed down and also pedal backwards. This unique feature of fixed gear bikes makes it adamantly beyond doubt necessary to be able to PULL on your pedal. Being able to completely control your bikes movement with your legs only is what many would argue the very essence of fixed gear bikes. Once you are familiar enough with your bike you enter almost a meditative state where the whole world drifts away leaving only objects moving in space and an infusion of human and bicycle navigating that space in total harmony.or i dunno,FixedGearBicycle,d3zgqfy,2,t5_2qo7a

To me it sounds like you just want to buy the best pets we tell you but dont know what the difference would be between them and what you have. You just want to say you have this to rub it in the face of your co worker. Cycling in competition relies more on the cyclist to a degree.

8689151,0,t3_4z0ae2,Its probably a good idea to grab a front brake. If you like the one brake look go with the front as it has much more stopping power than the back something like twice the power.Edit just saw youre in Melbourne traffic drives on the left hand side of the road. If you only run one brake keep the control on your left lever. That way you can slow down and indicate right with your right hand at the same time. Super handy on roundabouts. You can sort of just slink around left hand turns braking as you go. ,FixedGearBicycle,d6rrsbq,10,t5_2qo7a

Im not trying to be a massive dick or anything but at this point its pretty much proven that brakes are safer. If you are a boss hog without brakes though do it bro. I have a brakeless bike myself...I just dont ride it much because people around here drive like morons and I dont feel like winding up under tires.I just worry that some rookie will take that shit seriously and pull off his front brake and end up rolling out in front of a moving car when they cant get their bike to stop. Its better that they break their face flipping over the bars and learning a lesson about brake control then to end up getting fucking smashed. Some people will do exactly what you tell them...mindless zombies looking to follow the crowd in an attempt to be cool. FUCK chaffing lol. Makes you more aggressive because you have to stand up! I commute every day in hot TX weather sweating my dick off pretty literally and then go run around at work all day....so Id be miserable as all fuck. Chamois shorts and DZNuts chamois cream are the only way Ill ride more than a couple a miles. Im also on aero bars most of my ride leaning forward with my seat high as possibly comfortable so my taint ends up rubbing more than someone with an upright position.

Got a job at a LBS in a sales position and worked my way up to a mechanic. Hours of working on bikes that werent your own plus the  degree Summers really turned me off of the bike and when I got my license back I sold all  bikes except for one.I went on a ride yesterday for the first time in about  years on the last bike I have left and was immediately taken back and want to get back into commuting again. I found a pretty good deal on a frame and components here locally so all Im looking for is a wheelset at this point. Most of my commute will be along unprotected bike lanes and I tend to ride relatively hard so Im looking for something more likely to hold up to rough roads but like that aero deep rim look.Any suggestions on a wheelset thats not going to break the bank?

I had power straps for a year when I switched to fixed and though they were fine but I just got some better fixation straps and its like night and day. Its amazing how much faster you can stop when you can put full force into pulling up and not worry about coming off the petal. IMHO power straps are not for fixed gear bikes. ,FixedGearBicycle,dbh71rm,4,t5_2qo7a

No one was moving anywhere for miles except for me. I must have passed up a couple hundred cars. I felt like a hot knife through butter cutting through all that traffic.Another story I just remembered still in Honolulu is when I was coming back from Walmart and I made a wrong turn I was still new to the area and ended up in the middle of some Christmas parade. I shit you not there were floats and everything! Once I realized my mistake I was far past the point of return and was barricaded in on both sides of the street. So my only choice was to pedal as fast as I could through the parade until I found an exit.
