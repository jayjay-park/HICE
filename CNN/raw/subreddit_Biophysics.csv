3323368,0,t3_2xvqr0,Contact specific professors whose work youre interested in and find out if they will be taking students. Rank the labs youd like to work in that are taking students in order or preference. Think about what you want to do after your PhD and figure out what labs  programs have the best track record of putting people there. Doing this for every professor you may want to work with at each school is exhausting but making the wrong graduate school choice is significantly worse. ,Biophysics,cp73bkw,2,t5_2sgzp
