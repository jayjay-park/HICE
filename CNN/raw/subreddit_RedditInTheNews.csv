237148,0,t1_cf4powq,Dear Mr OhanianI must admit that I was very surprised to evoke your personal response.On checking back it was the reported reaction of Reddits Communications staff rather than anything you said directly which led to my initial comment. I apologise for this error.Nevertheless I am certainly very concerned to learn of Reddits involvement in the Gun Trade.Reddit has a worldwide following. You wont be surprised to know that people overseas  find Americans obsession with the Right To Bear Arms very puzzling and saddening.You assert the ineffectiveness of Gun Legislation in Australia and the UK.I happen to have spent a long time in both of these two countries and let me assure you that Gun Control is virtually a nonissue in both. Gun Death Rates there are tiny compared to the US. If anyone were to advocate liberalisation the immediate response would be We dont want to end up like America.It is time that Americans admitted that their Founding Fathers made a disastrous error by enshrining the Right to Bear Arms in the Constitution.This freedom erodes other freedoms. How can one have Life Liberty and Pursue Happiness when you are so fearful of your fellow citizens that you feel compelled to carry a weapon to protect yourself from them?How can you truly exercise Free Speech when you have to worry about whether your interlocutor might lose it and shoot you?This a dilemma Europeans recognised in the Middle Ages and dealt with albeit over centuries.The debate over Gun Laws seems to be stalled.What is needed is cultural change for those opposed to gun culture to campaign in innovative ways.To say publicly I am a civilised person. Guns arent Cool. I dont have a gun. I dont want to have people who do as friends colleagues or customers.Surely Reddit could do its bit  by standing up and saying If you want to trade in guns go and do it somewhere else.Would this solve the Gun Problem? Of course not but  The Longest Journey... and all that.The influence of those with a high public profile such as yourself would be significant.I urge you to publicly oppose Reddits involvement in the the Gun Trade.,RedditInTheNews,cf5bwet,2,t5_2v5ux
2035725,0,t1_ckykxsa,Thank you  for the link but ultimately that is not what I am after. Yishan clears up some of the facts of the matter but doesnt discuss the motivation of the decision other than to say it wasnt related to the new funding.   That being said Im still quite curious purely from a business standpoint why they would want to do something like this. My ony guess is that the reasoning is so specific to reddit itself and also there are probably a host of different reasons that Yishan could never accurately explain the decision. ,RedditInTheNews,ckyl393,3,t5_2v5ux
4360783,0,t3_3axc0c,I find it interesting they think the direction of reddit was more clear under Yishan given that was the time of things like the reddit gifts marketplace redditmade and reddit notes.Its also disingenuous at best to say that screenshot was of the front page rall gets a significant amount of traffic but nothing compared to the actual front page.,RedditInTheNews,csh6zqp,2,t5_2v5ux
