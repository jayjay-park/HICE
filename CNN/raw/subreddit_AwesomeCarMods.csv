It wont do mph.  He cant figure out where to fit the forced injection system. He hasnt got enough room for turbos or underbonnet superchargers. Got the whole engine and some giant turbo and a home made dyno set up on a trailer so he can figure out how much boost he needs to get it up to mph.

1634514,0,t1_cjl6nim,....Meh. I turned wrenches for several years. Keep in mind I was underneath these things.  times out of  not a single scratch or dent or any indication whatsoever that it had ever been offroad. The meaty MTs had no rock rash at all. And greasy shiny shit was smeared all over the interior and the tires... The second picture I posted... Literally my old FJ. It was my daily driver. I was competing in a time trial with  other trucks at the offroad course inside Miller Motorsports Park when that pic was taken got nd place too. The first time it went to a detail shop was also its last when I came to pick it up and found greasy shiny shit covering my dashboard. The picture posted was its clean state most of the time.

9183696,0,t1_d8g0s13,An air dam is different from a front wing or a front lipsplitter. I have seen websites that fail to differentiate between the names. A real air dam like in NASCAR or on a Corvette is much simpler in that it only prevents air front going under the car. It does not increase downforce stability or radiator airflow less engine heat allows you to make more power without overheating. Less air under the car means less lift better stability and less drag higher top speed. You could just lower the car but then you risk hitting the ground if you driver over a tiny rock. Air dams are usually flexible and simulate a car thats closer to the ground without being dangerously close to the ground. ,AwesomeCarMods,d8g3n9m,2,t5_2x2xm
