168596,0,t1_cew1nov,They tend to talk a lot and its natural dog behavior.  Mine doesnt really bark a ton its mostly chirping low growling and a little bit of whining.  She will when she really wants attention or is playing but I havent really had to deal with her barking into the night by herself or at anyone that passes the house.  She did get into a bad habbit of barking at us when we were in bed but it wasnt that much different from any other larger dog.  I got this to help train her with the barking and it worked really really well at curbing what we felt was excessive barking.  tldr... they can bark loud but theyre very trainable to curb excessive barking.,samoyeds,cexmx05,1,t5_2s7fw
889435,0,t1_ch4sp0a,Go no more than  hours between stops to let him potty. Make sure to bring lots of towels. Bring toys to chew on. If youre going to be crate training him be sure to bring it with you so that you can continue the training when you stop.,samoyeds,ch5drzw,2,t5_2s7fw

7548163,0,t3_4iqbgh,I would ask for the phone number of the vet who has been overseeing these puppies and give them a call to find out about this particular issue and their overall health and well being. I also think that asking the breeder to cover the vet bills for this issue is more than reasonable if you take this puppy. Who is the breeder if you dont mind me asking? Can PM me if you dont want to say it publicly. ,samoyeds,d306u9w,5,t5_2s7fw
8177678,0,t3_4p2ccy,Hi I just saw this  I usually am on this sub daily but Ive been dealing with a move so I just saw your post!I dont have an ArticCross sammy as of yet but Ive picked her as the breeder Im going with.  She came with glowing recommendations and she is super knowledgeable.  I wouldve gotten a puppy from her sometime this summer or fall but unfortunately for my dog situation I took a job crosscountry.  She wished me well and even invited me to come to the Samoyed Nationals this October which I will probably end up doing since Im about a days drive away!  We will restart the process with her as soon as my little fam boyfriend and dog are settled here.  We really like her how she breeds her dogs and the fact that they are pretty versatile.  We plan on doing the Working Samoyed program through the SCA and want to have a dog that is up for that.I was living in Boston and was really jazzed to trip across the country for a puppy and I still feel really strongly that she is a fantastic breeder and will go through her when the time comes! Cant wait to meet her dogs in person this fall.,samoyeds,d4zrclo,1,t5_2s7fw

8777745,0,t1_d6yyszk,Most of them are not really swimmers it took us a couple of summers to get Orion to swim  he loves it now though! What worked for us was my husband going into the water with him and just sorta being there for emotional support PElune on the other hand was a born swimmer first time we took her to the lake at  weeks old she went swimming no problem  But she has no sense of selfpreservation whatsoever so she always does things without thinking... ,samoyeds,d72vxoz,1,t5_2s7fw
8795812,0,t1_d74imuv,Havent heard of that brand but looks like great quality. Founda  few onnline retailers that can ship to meIn CHina. About  bucks for a big bag. Im weary of the Chinese dog food Ive been buying. Thanks for the brand suggestion,samoyeds,d754y74,1,t5_2s7fw

9028085,0,t3_53t9kz,Yes!! Join our Strut Your Mutt Team and come hang out in Jacksonville with me and upumpkinskittle if youre close by! D Hopefully a few more jaxorange park samoyeds will be joining us as well.My girl is two now and we dont crate her anymore but I hear her sometimes get up during the night to chew on a bone or get a drink. If hes making lots of noise or otherwise bothering you when he wakes up then you can try moving his crate to another room. I know it seems kinda mean but we had to put Pixels crate on the other end of the house because every time we would roll over or otherwise make a sound she would be like Okay youre awake its time to get up now and let me out!!! lol. After moving the crate we could still hear her bark to go pee but our general rolling overnight time noises didnt bother each other any more.,samoyeds,d7x186n,2,t5_2s7fw
