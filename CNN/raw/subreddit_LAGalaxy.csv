3346486,0,t1_cp9n63x,gtI dont know about moving to a . Its a great way to get killed by counter attacks. The  is susceptible to counters and I think a  would be even moreso.That may be true particularly of the classic  but when run correctly what you get in exchange for sacrificing the width of your back line should be far more valuable to a possessionoriented team anyway. Look at Barca Bayern and most recently wait for it... Liverpool. None of them play what you may consider a nominal .gtAnd Ive said this before Im not sold on Gerrard moving back to CAM. His long passing is sublime and Im not sure hed have the legs to go from a full BPL season already somewhat marred by injury to another  months in MLS playing a position with such a high work rate. The CAM in a diamond formation is going to cover more ground than anyone else on the pitch and thats a lot to ask of a  yearold Steven Gerrard.  Ah see thats the thing. In the modern  the position with the highest work rate isnt the CAM but the CB and to a lesser extent the wings. Often times the CB functions almost exactly like a second central DM cleaning up for mistakes and breakdowns in the midfield defensively. Thats where Juninho is already being employed thats exactly how hes been used in the past and in theory thats what should make a transition nearly seemless. If necessary he has the space to play more of a holding role but is also capable of sweeping across goal flanked by the two FBs. In return youd also free up the two wingbacks ideally Rogers and Omar to contribute more in buildup through overlapping runs or by tucking inside. Its completely adaptable to whatever the opposing defense gives you.The real question that needs to be asked of the  is whether or not our team is actually proficient enough to run it. In a league where bleeding edge tactics are already considered a generation or two behind everyone else do we actually have the players capable of making it work? Im not so convinced and thats why it remains a fun thought experiment and not a serious proposal. ,LAGalaxy,cp9q3s7,1,t5_2rza6
