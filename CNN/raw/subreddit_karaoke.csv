What kind of fucked up logic is that? And another thing what has  arms and ruined s music? Def Leppard. I dont want to listen to that on the radio let alone in a bar. TLDR Take whatever knowledge that you may have garnished from this trash and smash it with a large brick. ,karaoke,cho68k3,2,t5_2qq7y

1721427,0,t3_2e4auk,Where I live it largely depends on the host. Some hosts will allow favored singers to be on stage singing solo duets or group songs but place them in the rotation under a different name depending on who is actually up on stage. Some hosts are more rigid on what one person can participate in. The show Im at right now will only allow one singer to participate in one song per rotation. In the end its ultimately up to you and what you feel comfortable in doing.Im perfectly fine with only being able to sing once per rotation singers who are greedy and try to hog the microphone tend to irritate the nonsinging patrons anyways. Where I live the crowd loves variety.,karaoke,cjw5e9y,2,t5_2qq7y
