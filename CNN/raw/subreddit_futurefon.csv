Noticed a lot of comments asking for just a mini update a photo of a part the power supply maybe more footage of the old prototype anything! They will either delay again or just post more meaningless blurb maybe will make add on a new and exciting feature! to placate the backers.,futurefon,d11kuf0,3,t5_3cgp9
7000708,0,t3_4bednb,Jonathan hours agoNice looking prototype! Looking forward to writing Android apps for the DF   I really hope IF can hit their goal of shipping in August but I wont hold them to it. Hoping well at least get it before . no words can explain this stupidity,futurefon,d19vhk9,3,t5_3cgp9
7262057,0,t1_d23lby9,Exactly what I am thinking with regards to them getting a one of d printed prototype case made at whatever that facility is and then filming there.By the way if you are ever feeling sad and need a good laugh just watch this video and see how badly the screen is edited in. Its all bad but particularly at around  seconds when she rotates the screen. You can see why they decided to keep the device perfectly still in the more recent prototype videoWith regards to Benchmark I thought it was unusual that they specified a manufacturer at all. They do seem to keep everything deliberately vague so as not to get caught out by saying any lies that are easy to debunk. But there is just little pieces of evidence scattered all through the campaign which all adds up to show they have been lying and deceptive from the very start.Literally everything they have ever said should be taken with a pinch of salt!

Her quote about how humbling the experience was really spoke to megtThe comforts of home are nice Bridget said. But the experience really puts things into perspectiveespecially being from Los Gatos. You can see people live a different way than we do and theyre happy. You dont need a new iPhone or BMW to be happy. Theyre happy with their cows.But then apparently she changed her mind and decided she does need the nice things in life so is helping run a  scam.,futurefon,d3dx6su,5,t5_3cgp9
