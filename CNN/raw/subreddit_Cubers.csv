IE if you use x amount of energy on average to turn a layer and that lines up with the amount of energy need for exactly  degrees of movement on the cube.In essence a cube is not accurate. However people are generally more accurate with slower cubes that cut corners less as they slow down and make sure each turn is exact to avoid lock ups again its about the user choosing to be accurate. As for cubes that match that I would say the shengshou aurora or an overlubed guhong v. They will have similar speeds the shengshou doesnt cut as easily a guhong v will pop if you corner cut to much and also makes an audible snap when you cut.,Cubers,cfa2f2x,1,t5_2r6a3

The only thing going in favour of redux is the fast centres but I think that building the cross edges while preserving the centres isnt worth it. If you use redux its probably better just doing edge pairs as quickly as possible without going for specific pieces.Also I hated the last  centres on Yau too and did the method differently accidentally switching to Hoya. You should try it it flows better in my opinion and the centres feel quicker to me.,Cubers,cgyg6l7,1,t5_2r6a3

935011,0,t3_24togj,Yes its possible solve this way. Its usually done by completing a xx block so that only the last layer remains. The edges on the last layer will have the same colour on top this is because edges cannot change orientation using only  sides. You can then solve corner orientation. The simplest way of doing so is using sune R U R U R U R which twists three corners. The corners should be completely solved once theyre all oriented correctly this is because corners cannot change permutation using only two sides. You can then solve edge permutation. The simplest way of doing this is with Uperm R U R U R U R U R U R which cycles three edges.,Cubers,chakdn0,2,t5_2r6a3

I walked by a street vendor that sold odds and ends including counterfeit very poorly built cubes. I remember having one as a kid and never knowing how to solve one. I always wanted to learn so I bought one and started twisting while I was walking home. When I got home I was so frustrated I nearly threw it away. But a quick search on the Internet and I got it. A couple dozen solves after I had the beginners method down. Then I went ahead and got faster cubes x x etc. Never went too deep into learning different methods but I did get into speedcubing.I went to a couple of competitions and got a  sec official PB using keyhole FL and beginners OLL amp PLL.

The pillowed cube on left has a very tight inner radius so there just isnt room to fit parts from the others.

Id describe it as buttery and very satisfying. Very controllable cube but I dont get all that great times on it. The blackwhite ZXhanchi feels clunky and heavy complete opposite of the ShuangRen. Controllable but not my type of cube. Has a more cubey shape unlike the ShuangRen. which has kind of rounded edges.

3335273,0,t3_2ydbyr,Did you place your order on a windows PC by any chance? Seeing as daylight savings time is right around the corner that may be the cause of the issue.You see dos operates off of a CMOS quartz that ticks away as time passes. However as we come closer to switching the clocks for daylight savings time this quartz begins to malfunction until the switch has occurred. Generally the quartz will tick a lot slower than it usually does which means that time passes at a slower rate for your computer.TheCubicle.us also just happens to be hosted on windows boxes as well so its the same issue. When you connect your windows machine to their windows servers you establish a MYSQL datalink that actually intensifies the time delay by a factor of e call the Banardi constant.

3711287,0,t1_cqe7rpg,Hey Im pretty close to your average well somewhat and I clearly remember how I got better at sub roughly. Lets break it down...The CrossThe Cross is important at sub it should be done in  seconds or less as youre not too into speedsolving learn CN colour neutral it will vastly improve your solves. Dont try and learn CN at one point. Try and ease into it. Solve the cross on the bottom if you havent already. You can also try and get an XCross first fl pair already in but I just kept track of one pair whilst doing my cross. You can do this as you shouldve planned your cross out during inspection time.FLOne of the biggest annoyances at a time like yours. Intuitive FL starts to get a bit trickier. A major thing at ish is Look Ahead. This means slowing down the FL so whilst doing moves you can look at other pieces and immediately execute the pair. Speed up as you get better with FL look ahead and it should get pretty easy. I still practise my FL look ahead but it is getting better. Just read this bit off topic but it doesnt matter if it takes you a long time to apply a computer generated scramble. Just practise the algs you need to know that should be memory. Back to FL. Sometimes dont go for solves just experiment with some different FL cases think of the most efficient pairing possible. Just solve the cross and just inspect the cube think of what you can do. Thats basically it ,Cubers,cqfb8x7,1,t5_2r6a3

And for last layer stuff also check out petrus s site.  The last layer stuff and the last block stuff is relevant as well as subsets of the general block building stuff.

It helps sand down literally I guess! the rougher surfaces inside.I used that cube as my main until I was around  seconds and could definitely have gotten faster than that with it but I just chose to get a speedcube at that point my first speedcube was a Taiyan II. Man does that bring back memories.The sand mod is detailed pretty well by Thrawst in this video Anyway yeah if Rubiks brand cubes havent changed in mechanism since then Id say this is a safe mod to do to your cube Ive done it to multiple Rubiks brands and theyve all come out well.

4944736,0,t3_3il6zo,For years my brother had been bugging me to learn how to solve a Rubiks cube.  He insisted it was easy but I didnt believe him.  For years.  Then about a month and a half ago I saw Steven Brundages Penn and Teller video right here on reddit which I found highly entertaining.  That night I just happened to be walking around BooksaMillion with my girlfriend and stepkids when I saw a little display with Rubiks cubes on it.  I figured what the hell and I bought one.The Rubiks website had a tutorial that started out with layer by layer for the first two layers but finishe with a sort of fourlook last layer.  Get the yellow cross sune it til you make it Aperm the corners into place then Uperm the edges until theyre correct.  My plan was to learn one step at a day starting with the first layer.  This didnt work out as I learned the entire rest of the cube the second day.  While cementing these techniques into my head I started experimenting with doing the taught algorithms with my left hand.  That way I could do each of my premutations only once.After about a week of that I decided that was going to turn into a hobby for me instead of just a curiousity.  So I ordered up a MoYu cube bundle from thecubicle.  It came with a LingPo an AoLong V and an AoSu.  It was the AoSu that I was most looking forward to as I remember the x being my brothers favorite puzzle to do.  Well I got impatient waiting the few days for these cubes to arrive so I went to Barnes and Noble and bought a VCube .  Boy did I love this cube.  It was worlds smoother than my Rubiks x and the fact that it was a x impressed the hell out of my coworkers.Anyway I was determined to solve the x without using a tutorial.  My time before giving up was about four and a half hours.  Thats two hours or so of actually solving and another two and half hours of trying to resolve the OLL parity I had.  I ultimately gave up and went to bed proud of my time.  The next day I learned about parities and the ridiculous algorithms that solve them.  Nowadays I find a solve that doesnt have some sort of parity to work out to be a boring solve.Meanwhile my MoYu bundle came in.  It was like night and day comparing those cubes to what I had.  The AoLong V was ridiculously faster smoother and easier to turn than the Rubiks brand and the AoSu beat the pants off of the VCube which I already thought was impressive.  I was now officially hooked on cubing.I spend some time solving the cubes I had.  At first I layerbylayered the x did F sexy F until I I could sune the second layer then Upermed the cube into submission.  I was happy with that at the time.  However most of my focus was on the x.  I greatly enjoyed the actual puzzlesolving parts of working out the centers and the edges.  I started looking for ways to become more efficient at it.  I asked myself if I could make two edges at the same time.  I could.  Could I make three edges at the same time?  I could.  Could I make four edges at the same time?  I couldnt.  Then I asked myself if after moving those three assembled edges out of the way it was possible to set it up so I could get three more edge pieces while returning the cube to its solved state.  It was!  And thats where I am with the x.  Im now know there are more advanced techniques but I dont want to learn them.  All my focus is currently on the x and getting quicker at that.My enjoyment of figuring out the x really made me curious about bigger cubes so I went back to Barned and Noble to get a VCube .  They didnt have any in stock but they did have the VCube .  Once again I figured what the hell and I bought it.  It took me literally all freaking night to solve the cube.  But I did it.  All by myself and I was proud.At first I would get mad if someone scrambled my x on me because it took me soo long to solve.  Were talking halfhour times.  Now its not such a big deal and I dont mind if it gets scrambled.At this point I was still focused on getting a x so I ordered up a HuaChuang.  It has since become my favorite puzzle to do.  And It didnt take too long at all to figure out!Somewhere along the line I asked my girlfriend to run out to ToysRUs and to buy the Void cube we saw.  It looked cool and I wanted to give that a try.  Although I spent most of the day that I got it grinding down the edges so that it would turn smoothly.  After doing that and making the thing turn quite pleasantly I started to solve this whenlo and beholdparity raised its stinkin head again.  I dont remember what I did to solve it but I eventually did.  Great.At this time I started to get curious about cubeprojects.  So I took an ancient rubiks cube that weve had laying about the house forever that had had most of its stickers removed rearranged by my youngest stepson and turned that into a picture cube.  It has flying pigs checkers pink giraffe print colorful zigzags cupcakes and purple zebra print.  This is when I discovered picture cubes and their little quirks.  Still I have fun solving this one and the stepdaughters like its patterns.Ive also turned my head to putting cubes in jars so I ordered up some more cubes a GuangLong and a Cyclone Boys x for bottling and a Gans  for fun.  Ive gotten most of the way though putting the GuangLong into its bottle.  I had the first two layers done and the third would have been a relative breezeBUTI was thinking ahead and I left a piece of tape on the bottom the cube that I couldnt remove with the tools I had available.  So I disassembled the cube and will rebuild it again this weekend.  I can tell you this though I am not looking forward to putting the x into its bottle.I also have a couple of ghost cubes coming in the mail which Im expecting to arrive today.  Then last night I dropped my HuaChuang off the edge of my night stand while I was getting ready for bed.  A corner piece literally shattered.  So back to thecubicle I went.  I ordered the corner piece.  And then to qualify for free shipping I ordered some more cubes.  A x mirror cube and a MoYu Pyraminx.And this is where I am now.  I dont know wher eIm heading next but I will definitely be getting the cubic Moyu x.  Then those cuboids look interesting.  I dont know.,Cubers,cuhtnzx,1,t5_2r6a3

Its the number one thing that can improve anyones times  even the top guys like Feliks and Collin.  Last but certainly not least  you seem to be inserting every fl pair in the FR slot.  That wastes a lot of time for rotations  so work on some better fl moves.  And while on the topic of fl there are some way more efficient moves that are easy to understand that could save you some time.  Check out some example solves  as well as algdb  to see how you can improve that. ,Cubers,cx8cs79,4,t5_2r6a3

5781512,0,t1_cxdn2dw,Welcome to the family!The cube Im using is a Moyu Aolong VTo learn finger tricks I would watch videos of solves to see how to finger trick certain moves and then I would practice them until thats what I would naturally do.For OLLPLL I use LL except for about  or  cases of PLL that I know. Basically to learn the algorithms for PLL you can just repeat it over and over because the alg to set up the case is the same as the alg to solve it. As for OLL I only know COLL and to learn that I would solve up to OLL and would look at the alg for whatever case I got. Overall for finger tricks its all about practice and not picking up bad habits. One way to learn algs would be to just perform the alg over and over for about  minutes until you can do it by muscle memory.Hope this helps!!! Good luck!,Cubers,cxdr26u,1,t5_2r6a3

6010887,0,t3_3xsjb3,The cubing related part Finally got my Cubicle order! My solve speed is currently horrendous because Im still relearning a lot that I had completely forgotten I basically have the muscle memory for Sune...and something else that I dont know what is but its fun and Ive got a lot of free time over break. It feels slow but I guess I should learn fewer algs per day. I found that today I was forgetting what I had learned earlier. Mostly I need like the first two moves or some quirk to jog my memory and then I get going. I think Im really confident now with PLL H Z Uab and Y. Y because my other goal for winter break is one complete and legit BLD and OP corners is basically a Yperm without the F setup move. Feels dumb that I havent completely memorized AE yet but oh well. Tomorrows goals. And I only got half of the crosscases for OLL down. Alas.The not really cubing related part As I said I got my late Cubicle order and...my free gift was a cheap plastic cube stand. And my order had the cubes from the bundle I ordered but it wasnt as advertised All of the cubes are prelubricated right out of the box. It also contains cc of siliconebased lubricant... I took that to mean that the Cubicle would be lubing them but they feel pretty dry and the spring noise is driving me nuts maybe a bit from the manufacturer. But worse the package didnt actually have the cc of lube which I will definitely need once I break these in. Ugh. Guess I should wait until after Christmas for Cubicle hell to die down right? They definitely lost my business though. What sites do you all suggest? It seemed like before the Black Friday debacle everyone was talking about them and now people are saying that shipping times is why they never order there.,Cubers,cy7k2s2,2,t5_2r6a3

I would recommend learning look OLL and first look and the potentially full pll. I would recommend this vid for the oll And this website for the pllWith some exceptionsI mirror my ab perm to do the aa perm same alg but with my left handI mirror my Jb perm to do my Ja permI use mirrors of Gd and Gc for Gb and Ga respectivelyI use R U R U R U R F R U R U R F R U R U R U R for my Na perm and its mirror for the NbI use D R U R D R U R U R U R D R U R D for my VpermI use an Fperm based on the Tperm that is essentially R U F Tperm F U R but you will notice if you do exactly that you will do an F at the end of the Tperm then F right after that so you can just not do eitherNote the guy in the video is the same person who owns the website I linked for pll. He goes over oll there too and all of his website is a  good resourceTo Learn pll first learn the Tperm and the Yperm they will allow you to solve the corners of he last layer if you have headlights on any side hold them on the left and do the tperm if no headlights do the yperm from any angle then learn both Ua and Ub H and Z perms these deal with edges. If you encounter a case you dont yet know while you are still learning full pll simply apply the correct corner alg as described in the parentheses above the apply the correct edge algorithm.

6163060,0,t3_3zxi41,I learned BLD when I was around sub so you can totally do it from where you are.  I learned from Noahs OPM method as others here have noted also.To quantify based on the numbers you provided its lightyears easier than going from  to sub.  You can learn BLD meaning get your first successful solve in less than a week of meaningful effort.  Im sure some people could probably do it in a day.  Going from sub to sub would take easily  to  times as much effort.In terms of your BLD times they will be slow at first.  My first solves mostly failures but with a success here and there were in the  minute range.  With some practice Im currently around six minutes but I dont BLD solve much.Getting my first BLD success was one of the high points of my cubing experience so I would totally recommend learning it just for that regardless of your times.  ,Cubers,cyq6dez,0,t5_2r6a3

No kidding.If you are color neutral the average is . One move difference for having to practice with  blocks rather then . Seems stupid.A good in between is solving  of  blocks which is a little over  moves on average. This can be acheived with xy neutrality or xy neutrality. Either one works.,Cubers,cz7a6j7,1,t5_2r6a3

6334486,0,t3_42e59x,Gonna preface this by saying everything I say is objective and others may think differently.I use CFOP. I use this because it was the most recommended to me and was the easiest to transition to after beginners. Personally I find this method extremely fast and has deserved its place at the top of the podium Statistically speakingBUTCFOP is largely popular due to the amount of time its been around. It was popularized in  by Fridrich but has been around since as far back as  Source This is   years longer than ZZ and quite a bit longer than Roux Cant find the year it was created. Much of CFOPs success can be accredited to its age as  years is a long time to develop algorithms discover new ways to do certain steps and basically for a large amount of people to practise and popularise the method.Lets look at Roux. Roux has an average movecount lower than CFOP. The only reason it is not used as often by top cubers is the fact it hasnt been around for as long and there havent been as many people develop ways for the first blocksecond blockLSE to be more efficient.ZZ I havent really gone into.I find EOline more trouble than its worth.Petrus is more of a beginners FMC than a speedsolving method but there are those that have gotten fast at it.TLDR CFOP but only because its been around for ages.,Cubers,cz9ntpn,2,t5_2r6a3

6472364,0,t3_444y38,Take note that if youre happy with the turning you dont have to do anything. Theres no wrong way to set up a puzzle if you like it. If youre unsatisfied first change tensions and see if it helps and only then lubricate it. I would set it up like I do every cube  Dump some weight  on the inside break it in a little then some weight .

6563939,0,t1_czy7kls,I definitely would. It doesnt even have to be loose with a risk of popping for it to be good and starting out your times wont be limited by tighter tensions plus it has the added benefit of the pieces rubbing together harder and breaking in the cube faster.By the time youre pulling s solves the cube should feel awesome.If at first if feels awful I say stick with it.

6615960,0,t1_d03hb4s,Yeah Im definitely not doing things in the most efficient way during solves. I find it very hard for the xx step in particular. If I cant immediately see anything easy I pretty much have to go with the first thing I can think of. Theres little time to think about the best way to do things. I guess what this really shows is that theoretically petrus is a more efficient method as a less experienced solver like me can more or less match Felikss movecount. However actually achieving a lower movecount during speedsolves is easier said than done and takes more than just using the method. Not exactly earth shattering I know ,Cubers,d03nai6,1,t5_2r6a3

7074752,0,t3_4cfo0d,Oh my god do I have a story for you.It was my first competition. World Championships  in Las Vegas Nevada. This is where I got the worst x solve of my entire life. So what happened was I had just bought a Dayan x from speedcubeshop earlier in the day and I found it to be a huge improvement from my VCube. I actually managed to get ALRiHMi to lube and tension it just before I competed. Well I guess she likes her cubes fast and incredibly loose because when I went to compete in x it completely exploded everywhere. I had no idea how to reassemble a Dayan x but I ended up realizing it was just like my zhanchi. So after about  seconds of running around the table looking for the pieces I finally reassembled it solved it and stopped the timer while laughing hysterically at my wonderful  second x solve. I didnt make it past the first round. ,Cubers,d1iabw0,3,t5_2r6a3

7300103,0,t3_4fdmaz,because if you imagine a xx when compared to a x the two extended faces are really already like the circles on the opposite faces in fact they are literally just extensions of the pieces that are in theside the circles on the super faces.Thats why they are the way they are on calvins xx series puzzles. This means all the pieces use similar moulds.If you look at the pieces of a CU xx there is essentially a circle within a circle on the faces that are split into   which is what you would need for the puzzle you are asking for. the mechanism already basically takes up the entire piece and the pieces are very thin there is no room for another cut on the side which would be needed to add the super circle on the side of the pieces too.,Cubers,d27z065,2,t5_2r6a3

Thats something I dont really have time or motivation to do. I loved it while it was good though.I have a really rough turning style so Ill probably stick with getting a  v. the  standard version has good enough corner cutting for my liking so the v  modified center caps would probably make it more than enough. the catches on the standard version wasnt much of a turn off for me either.

Void parity happens when the nonexistent centers of the void cube would be the wrong colors on a regular x so obviously since you cant tell that the colors are wrong on the centers it just looks like a parity. The algorithm to fix it is called the void parity alg and it pretty much just swaps the centers around.  Heres the algorithm M U M U M U M U M U  If you continue to do the algorithm several times youll see itll cycle through different parities until it eventually arrives at a solvable case.,Cubers,d33o7tk,8,t5_2r6a3

One of my corners broke had tons of popping issues and it met the broad side of a wall. With that said my fiancee has a barely solved Thunderclap so Ill compare that to the GTS.The Weilong GTS has this airy crunchiness to it. Its like one of those wafer cookies But I can abuse the GTS and not have any lock ups or whatever. With that said I dont feel comfortable enough to blind solve with because its so fast and airy. I like tight and crunchy so I know if I overshoot on blind  The GTS feels like a Gans on the buttery air side and a YueXiao crunchiness and responsive. Out of the box its the fastest cube Ive ever used but it doesnt seem to be held back by being an inaccurate solver.The Thunderclap is just what its called. Its got the sound of thunder clapping between those little pieces. Its probably the best under  possible. Her Thunderclap is VERY responsive in my hands and I can feel every pieces flow beneath my fingers with this tight crispy feeling. It feels like pop rocks and coke were dropped into a cube and its quite nice. I love picking it up and just pumping out Y Perms on it.

7732489,0,t3_4l7rqo,When you say You can get fast averages that is something that is very subjective. For some people your .xx average is extremely slow. For others its extremely fast. For me a .xx average at a competition would be fairly disappointing. For Feliks my PB .xx competition average would be a nightmare so its all about perspective.Now to get to the importance of last layer algs. Last layer algs make a minor difference that becomes more and more major as you get faster. If youre looking for the way to reduce your times at a rapid rate focusing on the first two layers or the equivalent for other methods is a better investment of your time. However if you are looking beyond to the end game of what will make you the best solver youre capable of being the earlier you learn last layer algorithms the better because your recognition and execution of those algorithms will improve over time but that improvement cant begin until you learn the algs.On top of that most people who have been solving regularly for years learn more and more alg sets because its simply something to do. It gives you a greater understanding of the cube and keeps it fresh and interesting. I started off by learning Look CMLL for Roux then Look then I learned M Algorithms for BLD then I learned COLL because most of the cases overlapped with CMLL then  Look OLLPLL then Look PLL and recently Ive shifted my focus back to BLD learning the hundreds of algorithms for cycle corners and edges. Every alg set I learn helps me with learning the next one because usually I can find some way to relate new algorithms to previously learned ones.,Cubers,d3l4nuu,9,t5_2r6a3

Write the alg down on a sheet of paper and draw sketches if it helps and write a description for what every move does. As you learn more algs you can summarize several moves into memorable groups.

Therefore by saying Roux is slower where Roux is a method the most natural or only proper? interpretation is this method takes more time than other methods Since no other factors are mentioned a natural assumption is that the method is inferior when we use time as a metric.If you mean anything beyond this you need to clarify or your intended message will not get across.It sounds like youre trying to say something along the lines of Currently people are slower with Roux than with CFOP which is very different from Roux is slower than CFOPWhile the difference may seem subtle the distinction is still a very important one.,Cubers,d42vrw6,1,t5_2r6a3

I do belive that just being able to do yellow and white already puts me at a large advantage over just doing white. Not liking the white cross I can just choose yellow if its any better. Having that option is great.However color neutrality will probably be a thing I practice when I get to an average of around   seconds. Seeing how i thimk things like efficent cross solving a solid FL OLL and PLL recognitionexecution are fundamentals of a good cuber color neutrality is up there for more advanced cubers. Just like how I think Full OLL ZBLL etc are for them also. Building blocks you can place on top of your fundamentals to go the extra mile. But since I dont even have full PLL under my belt or a good flcross for that matter Ill work on my fundamentals before I get onto something like color neutrality .But I will agree that having that extra option under your belt will slightly decrease your time by being able to do a quicker cross on averageI dont think its too important for me right now.,Cubers,d4h98rw,1,t5_2r6a3

You were downvoted for saying this sub is a negative space because people complain about bad service from The Cubicle many of whom such as myself have had nothing BUT bad service over many orders and even explicitly said avoid the hive mind garbage basically insulting them on top of it. In other words you did exactly what you claimed was happening to you trying to silence and invalidate people for honestly sharing their experiences while at the same time trying to paint yourself as some sort of victim.

8149359,0,t1_d4w7psp,Yes its called VLS and its rather impractical since it requires you to memorise  algorithm and even then only guarantees a skip if the corner and the edge are already paired the two other basic insertions arent covered.

So what Im going to do for this post is to write down the things that I think I need to improve on right now.

I believe that COL can ultimately get similar times to cross on bottom but in a sense that has yet to be proven.The main benefit is that FL can be done ltR U lgt but D moves will be used occasionally  you eliminate y rotations entirely. I find this to be a nicer moveset and think its more comfortable for me to do.The main drawbacks are that there are fewer resources that exist for it and that visibility for lookahead especially to the DB slot is worse.Feel free to ask me if there are any questions.,Cubers,d5neq2y,4,t5_2r6a3

Almost any speed cube is an upgrade from rubiks but the cube wont magically make you better. Hardware isnt what makes us slow its the lack of experience and lack of knowledge as of yet I mean Im still only a couple of seconds slower on my rubiks brand cube the difference lies in the ergonomics I never to longer sessions with it while I can with a speed cube.Just learn the most used PLLcases first Ua Ub H Z Y and J can solve all cases look the other such as Gabcd V T and so are just better ways of solving cases look.

Go even slower than you are now wo the timer and just focus on not pausing during FLcross. Dont worry too much about seeing your first pair during cross planning until youre averaging  but if theres already a pair matched up check it out and see if you can do anything with it. With an average of  every day and maybe  untimed FL focus solves I would expect to see you become sub  maybe even sub  if you push it! in  months max.

9305503,0,t1_d8vi0a1,All steps are continued from your solutions not mine. So the SB is after doing your FB not mineRouxFB Green white block is much better imo. But the one you did can still be decent. Your solution was really inefficient and shouldnt really need any rotations. I would have done something like R e F U F U Rw B. Im sure there are better ways but my first block is my weak point by far.Generally what you want to do is build the xx while influencing the pair. Or  lines which at least for me is a much rarer caseSB Its actually decently efficient. But for a speedsolve its probably way too unergonomic. Dont rotate and try not to use F moves. I dont see anything too great. Something quick I came up with is like R U R U Rw U Rw U R U R U Rw R U Rw. Only  move less but probably much faster to executeLSE EO is fine. But you could have ended the solve with U M U M U M U. Or if you really want to you can use EOLR M U M U M U M U M UM E M E,Cubers,d8vjg22,7,t5_2r6a3

9412155,0,t3_58rsq5,oh wew whew do i start.Sometime in  young  year old Jaggent decided to solve his dollar store AWFULLY turning x. He did and then he proceeded to memorize the Layer By Layer method and impress everyone at school.later on a friend gifted me his Rubiks brand x. Turned pretty ok but alot better than my previous one. Then i solved a bit on and off and then i got my little bundle of cubes on ebay. The stickerless DaYan really popular at the time a white shengshou x. Idk what pyraminx and a magic cube before rubix made its own version. Good times with the parity XDSo ive been solving on and off getting like  second timers on x and casually solving the rest. And then i got my dayan x with a mirror cube. The x took some of my time and i had good times with it I even started learning Ortega. I also got my WeiLong v I wanted a AoLong v but by accident ordered a WeiLong. got like sub  aaaand i had a long pause. I think last time i solved it was summer this year and now  weeks earlier i took my weilong and started again. I did learn  look CFOP with FL when i got my Dayan and i repeated it now. I got like sub  sub all the time. Fast forward . weeks and i started learning OLL. I now know about  OLL algs in  days D and got sub  with my new Cubicle Gans Air. That is the best cube I have ever had. I also got a MoYu AoSu and am waiting for some Lubicle lube to arrive ttomorrow probably.

9709359,0,t1_da9rd6p,I can name all of the OLLs without memorizing these code names. Like there are  Z shape cases. One of them is a normal Z that you see in the English alphabet and the other one is mirrored Z.  The  L shape f R U R U f ones. First has a x line and x line. The next has a x line and no x line i.e. only a single edge. The last one has x line and edges so no x line. Each of them have  cases each i.e.  cases total.  Its quite easy to be honest to remember these shapes but they are not universally translated. Although lots of time when I say mirrored Z or inverse Z people can understand that but they are not universal. For a more universal system yours is nice but remembering code names is difficult than remembering shapes. When I think of Z case a Z pops to my head. When I think of L shape the  L cases pop to my head their mirrors. When I saw your code name nothing pops to my head. I will have to memorize by brute force for that. I mainly teach this shapeimagining thing as a reason.  EDIT Giving further thought we can incorporate your system with our informal system. I like your system better than the  system so I can see myself using your system for that. Thanks ,Cubers,da9vy6b,3,t5_2r6a3

He said as he commented on it.gtSmall talk as youve said doesnt exists exists more around you than meets the eye. Ah the good old nuhuh refutation.gtWhile you are writing an email to you boss you start by breaking the ice and then going to the point.No I dont. I already know my boss and he like most people doesnt want his time wasted. Intrawork emails are always right on the nose.gt In books author has introduction acknowledgement and some blank pages before the book actually starts. You can self justify it again by saying the author is just protecting his ego by saying its for the reader but just like you cannot go from  to  in a second similarly you have to do things step by step and reach your goalend result.Reading a book and solving a rubiks cube are fundamentally different experiences a point Ive already covered and youve ignored highlighting a portion of the greater statement out of context to fit your desired retort A story is created in the tabula rasa mind of the reader and as a result necessitates that context be gradually developed to a complete whole so as not to overwhelm the reader.Speed cubing by contrast is a neuromuscular skill akin to an activity as playing an instrument. The only context we need is the instrument  in our case the cube which also happens to contain the sheet music The scramble. We as participants of the community and to whom your videos are clearly geared are already familiar with the context which is why I believe that anything framing that which weve already context for to be superficial and superfluous.gtLastly I havent generalized you into any style woah.Oh?gtHumans generally like it when you have a little small talk before going to the point.My mistake.gtI am just saying that its your perspective that you are getting irritated and not everyone is going to share your opinion. I just said that things have a flow and you should maintain it instead of getting irritated or annoyed over it. I may not like it but is it the other persons problem or my problem? Think about that.gtEveryone has their own style. Some we like and some we dont. As an example in my childhood kids my age didnt like reading Agatha Christie I liked it immensely. When I asked others why dont you like her style of writing they always said she uses tough words and grammar. I dont understand that. Think now is that my problem or Agatha Christies problem? Definitely mine. Its not her problem that she knows more than me and can write better than me. Think about that...Again your pat dismissal of criticism as irritation and annoyance only supports the idea that youre letting ego drive your discussion of the topic consider  youve said think about that twice in the reply implying you believe your thinking to have been greater than others I suspect youd be one to take that as a personal comment too  it is a well documented psychological affect that people are bad at admitting faults of themselves but readily identify those same faults in others.Even your provided examples are selfaggrandizing. Worse yet the original comment didnt even have anything to do with you and was a commentary of the greater proclivities of the more trafficked Youcube channels and yet youve taken it personally. Perhaps what youre unwilling to see is that your videos are less about helping other people learn and more about building monuments to yourself and how good you are at cubing. And while there may be a measure of merit to the Im awesome at this and you can be too approach I dont find it particularly helpful.

For example if I see a really easy x Ill build it and make a x to extend the block so I have two lines left.

Try to find something in common. Also you said you arent in the same classes and she has no idea youre smart. Maybe after school or on the bus or someplace where she may walk by and see you take out your math book and just have it sit there cover showing and be checking over your math homework. The book cover will probably say something like Math  or something and shell see that and be like Oh wow youre in that class? Wow youre smart! What are you doing in that class currently? Or something like that. She may not say that but its worth a shot I guess.For her not being in your class thats just bad luck. That used to happen to me and my friends. It was terrible.

10479478,0,t3_5q1i4d,First of all learn good cubeshape techniques. Id recommend Brandon Lins Advanced Cubeshape video. Also jaapsch has a cubeshape diagram that helps a lot. You can observe which shapes you create while solving others. This allows you to create a more intuitive process of cubeshape solving. Then make sure you know good algs for edge orientation and corner permutation I think look will be good for you at the moment but theres not that many algs for these steps and if you want you can learn all of them. Corner orientation should be intuitive but there are some algs if you want too.Finally learn how to do edge permutation fast but without much algs. I became sub  with just the adjadj that means adjacent swap on top and bottom oppopp opposite swaps in both layers and adj parity adjacent swap on top algs. That means you dont need to learn much EP algs for now. You can get faster at EP by knowing how those algs will influence the case you have. If you want more algs theres Brandon Lins EPs every Square should know video with some easy algs that will help you. ,Cubers,dcvygtb,2,t5_2r6a3

10968248,0,t3_5wmjsl,Im guessing you do cross on bottom if not do it. Then is just a thing of going slow and looking ahead.  Plan your full cross on inspection. Tip Practice by memorizing the cross without time limits no pressure. Then Blindfold yourself and solve the cross blindfolded. After you do the same for about  or  times try to solve the cross blindfolded while looking for FL pairs. Do untimed slow solves. Fluid movement not huge stops little by little.  Dont look for algorithms just for the sake of it. See which pairs are the hardest to solve intuitively check the algorithm youd be surprised at the amount of intuitiveness some of the algorithms might have. Some of the algorithms I know sub x CFOP solver edge flip R U R U R F R F R F R F R U R U R U R U R U RMight add more if you wish. Avoid rotations but dont make up crazy ways to solve pairs to avoid a quick roations. A lot of rotations are bad but no rotations could be worse if not done properly.,Cubers,debaplv,9,t5_2r6a3

11114595,0,t3_5ynpbk,I recommend roux. CFOP is nice. I love it. its my main and fastest method. But I think roux has more potential and I wish I had tried it out more when I started cubing. The big  methods are roux cfop zz and petrus. CFOP is the only one that doesnt use blockbuilding. after using CFOP trying out other methods I had and have a problem with blockbuilding I try to use CFOP Fl for all the other methods. This isnt the best approach. I think itd be easier to learn blockbuilding and then learn Fl instead of vice versa. But based on your question. Id say CFOP. because its easier. ZZ isnt a great place to start. However I would like to recommend Petrus. Petrus uses block building and Fl. and will teach you about edge orientation.which is crucial in ZZ. so petrus is kind of a good middle ground between the  and could help you pick between the . ,Cubers,dertw67,2,t5_2r6a3

For you obviously it is OLL instead of PLL that you should consider to learn.  Also for FL check each and every case and try to do it better. If you think you solve a case inefficient and you cant find a better way on your own check for algs. You could also watch some example solves there are tons on youtube.  If you want to determine on what you should work the most make some split solves e.g. with cstimer. Splits should be Cross  FL excluding cross  OLL . PLL ..,Cubers,dg95ts2,1,t5_2r6a3

From there look at what case you have for a and do the corresponding mini alg. Then see what you get next. Rinse Repeat. I mainly aim to get the arrow case and then M U M to fix bad edges. Once you get the whole a cycling thing down you can do U amd M moves to get your UL and UR edges in the UB and FD positions and then do M U M to get them both in the bottom later. Then Move the U layer so the opposite color of the FD edge is facing you in the UF layer. Then M to put them in place. Move your U layer so your left and right faces are solved and then the last step is sort of intuitive. Do U and M moves to get your last four edges in place.I also used CriticalCubings LSE video tutorial to finally understand it.,Cubers,dgqteil,2,t5_2r6a3

11753935,0,t1_dgsbo05,Ive never actually used Maru lube so I cant really speak to its comparison. However... this stuff is fast. Like fast enough to where I had to wipe it out after a few solves because I couldnt control my cube. It adds a bit of smoothness to the puzzle but its overpowered by the speed.,Cubers,dgsc6ga,1,t5_2r6a3
11758639,0,t1_dgspmxz,Theyre less stable. Instead of holding a cube shape theyll squish and deform so you cant rotate the layers as easily. Magnets let you use looser tensions while maintaining shape.,Cubers,dgsvdvv,1,t5_2r6a3

11761309,0,t3_67tl4m,Im very new just recently bought my first x! and I recently saw a comment on a youtube video along the lines of its surprising to see someone using the same cube for  years which made me come up with a few questions about the longevity of speedcubes Do speedcubes really wear out after  years? or am I interpreting this incorrectly? What changes about the cube over time that makes it not usable or less fast? How can I keep my cube lasting longer? What do you do with a speedcube after its worn out? It seems like most people just keep them in their collection but what are other common courses of action?,Cubers,dgt69ta,1,t5_2r6a3
11761403,0,t1_dgt69ta,cubes usually dont wear out but better cubes come out. Or maybe you just get sick of using the same cube for years. Or you tried another cube at a competiotion and reall liked it. But as ling as you start with a good cube and you lube it properly the cube will serve you for as long as you desire. to be fair though i dont even have a cube thats over  years old,Cubers,dgt6nlc,1,t5_2r6a3
11780701,0,t3_6813mt,So it was brought to my attention yesterday that I need to work on centers for x. I did a split this am and got around  for centers  for edges and  for x stage. It was around a  solve which is my average. I do both x and x bars and Im somewhat color neutral although if  I dont see an easy face I will resort to white then yellow and then the last  faces. I think my goal at this point is  minutes so with that said does anyone have any tips or videos that can help? I did a quick YT search and just found normal walkthrough solves and edge tips. For now Im gonna browse through Kebin Hays stuff to see if I can pick up on anything. ,Cubers,dgvdp6s,2,t5_2r6a3

11807139,0,t3_68g2gv,Update To prevent this from happening I recommend getting a light colored towel and some hot water. Wet the towel and rub at the inside of the bag until you see that they dye transferred has stopped. ,Cubers,dgydowc,5,t5_2r6a3
