1359500,0,t1_cimia7s,I think theyre being underestimated a bit.Most of the big drum towers have two levels of battlements with the lower battlements having not only crenelations but arrow loops providing excellent cover. The circular battlements have nearomnidirectional coverage. For extra defense of forward assaults against the main gate youve got that balcony and youve got extra battlements on the keep for second line of defense.That courtyard in the front means that enemies attacking the gate or the forward walls are greatly exposed on their approach. Those stairs will slow down the assailants speed as well adding to the defensive advantage. For climbing those staggered cornices mean youd better have the right height siege ladders.Id say you need x men for assault as defense at least assuming we dont resort to say bazookas.,TheoreticalBattles,cimpby3,1,t5_32dlv
