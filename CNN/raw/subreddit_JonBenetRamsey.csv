9515898,0,t1_d9ljygi,I do believe Ramseys were aware but no idea how they were alerted.  I have always been interested in whether that issue had anything to do with the reason they removed the spare key from under the statue.   ,JonBenetRamsey,d9m1cnq,2,t5_2s3pg
9574818,0,t3_5b05fb,From Mark McClish gtI advise you to be rested also show a feminine touch.Quotes from Dirty Harry from a male character gtIf I even think youre being followed the girl dies.gtIf you talk to anyone I dont care if its a Pekinese pissing against a lamppostthe girl dies.gt... thats the end of the game. The girl dies.gtNow listen to me carefully.gtNow listen. Listen very carefully.gtIt sounds like you had a good rest. Youll need it.Hmmmmm....I liked the McClish article for a lot of reasons. But he had already made up his mind who it was Patsy which means I hear his opinion over any professional analysis. That is a pity because I like the piece. Especially where he shows taking out unnecessary words can help understand the sentence meaning. But I also see him glossing over facts that get in the way of who he thinks is the author. ,JonBenetRamsey,d9taiqa,1,t5_2s3pg
9719271,0,t1_daayogj,When I read the RN carefully I came away with the opinion it was well written well constructed and very much showed the writers personality  or what the writer wanted to show. It was theatrical like a movie script writer would do for a film and with some dramatic flourishes in it. The cynical encouragement aimed at  JR at the end to me came across like the Dennis Hopper character in Speed. I read the usual collection of ransom notes and it sure looks like he read them too.Well crafted and fake. edit Except the bit where he says We are a group of individuals that represent a small foreign faction. We respect your bussiness sic but not the country that it serves.. That bit is dreadful and probably a leftover from a flight of imagination but he still left it in. If ever caught they may find be some D grade movie scripts lying about in his house.,JonBenetRamsey,dab40no,2,t5_2s3pg
9950593,0,t3_5hyulr,gtAnd in police reports I saw there were no references to fruit cocktail. There are still people who talk about the pineapple being in her stomach and partially it was. But there was also grapes grape skins and cherries. Thats pretty misleading.,JonBenetRamsey,db4l6j7,1,t5_2s3pg
9997264,0,t1_dbanghw,Also the charges make more sense now. They couldnt conclusively prove or know which Ramsey killed JonBent or the circumstances surrounding her death but it was clear that one or all of the people in the house were involved. Thats how I interpreted it anyway.,JonBenetRamsey,dbao7e9,5,t5_2s3pg

10007664,0,t1_dbbve5n,Alex Hunter gave testimony and later signed an affidavit that Burke was not a suspect the gj can only consider the evidence they are provided for review and consideration.  He could not execute that document or give sworn testimony if it was not true and there is zero evidence to indicate it was not.   Burke Ramsey  years old and evaluated thoroughly by a child psychologist was simply never a suspect by either BPD or the DA.   ,JonBenetRamsey,dbc0zk4,3,t5_2s3pg
10029372,0,t1_dbebf5g,I have an answer to this  I believe the answer is no. Radar online yeah I know just posted a neverbeforeseen video taken by police inside the house the morning of the th. The video was taken while it was still dark out and the bowl of pineapple and tea are on the kitchen table. Highly recommend you check out the video. ,JonBenetRamsey,dbeusd2,5,t5_2s3pg
10032555,0,t1_dbeyitn,Have you read Steve Thomas book?  Hes definitely got an axe to grind.  Its not absurd.  People build up bias based on perspective and point of view.  And I wouldnt exclude the higher ups from that biasjealousy most of whom probably had no where near the amount of money that the Ramseys had.,JonBenetRamsey,dbf9og2,1,t5_2s3pg

10100228,0,t1_dbnvo8e,Oh but I thought guys like Gary Oliva Fleet White etc were eliminated in part because of the DNA results and prior to the  testing.,JonBenetRamsey,dbo2ne2,1,t5_2s3pg
10118192,0,t1_dbqe9j3,The  sample isnt touch DNA. It came from JBs Wednesday panties mixed with her blood the perps saliva. Its real. I believe it is the state of the case that nothing will progress until it is explained. Otherwise it needs to come out of CODIS or the crime labs in Colorado are at risk of being sanctioned.,JonBenetRamsey,dbqep7k,2,t5_2s3pg

10179465,0,t1_dbv82d2,Sounds like a reasonable possibility but I kind of think they didnt hang around a long time in the kitchen I think just long enough for the perpetrator to add  mls of liquid drug to a large spoonful of the fruit cocktail from the bowl and get JonBenet to eat the lot before heading off to the basement for the big promised surprise ,JonBenetRamsey,dbxwcwb,1,t5_2s3pg
10204208,0,t1_dc0dkmx,Thats what I was saying but according to the new information that was on channel  news  The DNA profile referred to as Unknown Male   first identified during testing on the panties  may not be the DNA of a single person at all but rather a composite of genetic material from multiple individuals. As a result it may be worthless as evidence. ,JonBenetRamsey,dc0pczo,1,t5_2s3pg

They are separated and they make it up as they go along. The boy is interviewed by police without their knowledge on that day.I would imagine they were charged within  hours in that scenario. Would have been a ton of convictable evidence.,JonBenetRamsey,dc8k3ca,1,t5_2s3pg
