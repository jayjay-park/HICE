219901,0,t1_cf3exdw,Your post history is suspicious.Ive now been waiting  days on a BTC withdrawal from Mt. Gox. My account was debited but nothing has appeared on the blockchain. The bitcoins just disappeared.,MtGox,cf3hqlh,1,t5_2sjqd
266613,0,t3_1x5k06,Sure it was .BTC? The hash is showing up on the failed transactions now but it is for .BTC...  Youre one of us now.,MtGox,cf8e7cd,1,t5_2sjqd
291932,0,t3_1xdn7t,a CoinSearcher travels to Japan from Australia to get answers from Karpeles directly Status Unconfirmeda IdentitiesROverrated outlines a bug within MtGox which could reasonably explain the problem   Status Unconfirmeda Roger Ver reads a statement and he is a bit odd but seems to support MtGox statement that they are not insolvent or missing deposited coins  Status unconfirmed,MtGox,cfb0umm,3,t5_2sjqd

414069,0,t1_cfngab4,gt all at once giving them lots of time to transfer funds from cold storage to a hot wallet where they could be lost. I suspect that MtGox lacked or lacks even simple accounting mechanisms that would let them know that they had less BTC remaining in their accounts than they shouldve.This assumes that they dont do any sort of internal audit of account balances. Highly unlikely even for MtGox.,MtGox,cfnomo9,3,t5_2sjqd
521894,0,t3_201ith,Thanks for doing this. Its such a relief to see that balance again. I doubt Ill see the bitcoins ever but it makes me feel like Im sane and I didnt dream it all.,MtGox,cfzlet5,2,t5_2sjqd

2838622,0,t3_2s96f0,Look at the data  most heists are very small. However there are three heists that are very large. It is kind of like a puzzle and fortunately for us the pieces are SO BIG and there are SO FEW that it seems to be fairly easy to start to put the pieces together.     Total MtGox loss according to rumors Ive never seen this as an official number.     Total MtGox loss according to Leaked Emergency Plan.     Amount lost on Bitcoin Savings and Trust.     Amount Seized from Silk Road by DHS.     Amount of MtGox Suddenly Found.  Sum of the three amounts above.    Amount of MtGox customers coins that are temporarily unavailable.All three of these events Bitcoin Savings and Trust Silk Road and MtGox are tied together.All of the people closest to both sides are not saying a thingNegotiations are happening behind the scenes. DHS FBI CIA NSA or some other government agency from the US started seizing hardware and coins but a handful of people at MtGox managed to protect a good portion of the coins by accidentally losing them. MtGox depositors got impatient and Karpeles was forced to declare insolvency to protect himself from government officials that might have been a little over zealous. There may have been some illegal activities happening to protect the remaining Bitcoin but it was viewed as justified because the prior seizures themselves are arguably illegal. Irrational people on both sides did a lot of name calling and over time both sides realized how bad this looks for both sides. So again negotiations are happening. Seized and sold bitcoins are being recovered through drop and shop techniques on the market pushing exchange rates down and grabbing BTC when possible. Eventually Kraken will announce that it is returning the the Bitcoin to early adopter Bitcoin users that never did a damn thing to deserve this from any of the parties involved.Okay so this last line is hopeful conjecture but if it doesnt go down like this it will be a major stain on all parties involved. If it does end like this some of those moon travelers out there might get to put their suits on early.Edit if someone would like to footnote and provide sources for my numbers above that would be nice for the community. I was going to but am a bit tired. Maybe another day.,MtGox,cnqqxeh,2,t5_2sjqd
