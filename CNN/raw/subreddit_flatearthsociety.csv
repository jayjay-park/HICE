The moon near the center of the map the north pole is seen right side up while the moon at the periphery of the map the south pole is seen upside down.

Do I need to explain to you the difference between an orbit and a revolution? In case you didnt know the difference the Earths orbit does indeed speed up during certain times of the year because we have an elliptical orbit.

7585026,0,t1_d346406,I talked to a guy that I think sincerely believed the earth was flat. At first he deemed my intelligence not worthy of a discussion with him about the flat earth model. But after I started agreeing with him about how the education system could use improvements we could both agree that simply memorizing facts is not enough for a full education he started to open up a bit and at least told me he had done a lot of research. When I asked him what profound discoveries his research had unearthed he linked me to this youtube video ... i was hoping maybe hed have gone out and at least collected his own data since hes against the whole idea of just regurgitating information but hey maybe his brain is a flat disc and its only natural for him to assume the earth is a disc too.Well if the flat disc you described isnt moving upwards with . mss acceleration then theres no hope for that model. And even if it was we would have long surpassed the speed of light according to what science tells us the age of the earth is... I dont know how that would fit with the idea that we are orbiting a supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy.The infinite plane one is interesting its been a while since ive done elecrtromagnetics so its hard to imagine what the gravity would be like on an infinite plane... i assume all the horizontal vectors would cancel out and youd be left with only down force... but Im not sure if the gravitational down force would be infinite or if it would converge on a finite value and if its finite you could work out how thickdense the earth would need to be to give . mss and then maybe drill through the earth and see if it is in fact deep enough.I have trouble picturing the gravity inside plate inside the spinning dome ball model you are describing... to me it seems like it would just be like standing on a record player and youd be flung into the antartic ice wall kind of like this amusement ride,flatearthsociety,d34dpej,2,t5_2u9eh

Do you want me to measure a pixelsecond velocity for the two points? Wait a bit...EDIT Look at the image again.Between the topmost and bottommost frame the upper green circled spot has moved from being  pixels from the bottom to being  pixels from the bottom that is  pixels moved. Meanwhile in a similar manner the lower green circled spot moved  pixels.The timeframe for both movements is the same since theyre screenshots. Lets say  seconds based on the video. That means the upper spot moved at an average of  pixelssecond while the lower spot moved at an average of . pixelssecond.At this point youre either just trolling me or I dont know...Please tell me how both points move at the same velocity if they cover different distances over a fixed time period...
