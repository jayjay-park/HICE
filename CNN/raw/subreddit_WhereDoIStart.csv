This subs purpose is to highlight what people think should be the first thing you hear from them.that being said I would also like to hear similar artists. Try Bonobo Bibio Woodkid Phaeleh James Blake for some chilled electronic music. Not necessarily that similar but I enjoy them all shuffled together.,WhereDoIStart,cfqvhwc,3,t5_2xpnz
483403,0,t3_1zl8ek,useanziewonzie already posted a great guide read it but I made some additions here.The thing about classical music is that people tend to think that its hard to listen to when its actually not. Ive talked to many people that doesnt listen to classical music because they think they dont understand it but there is nothing to understand. Its music just like all other music. That being said I emplore you to listen to some of the pieces several times until you hear them as any other piece of music.This guide is not complete but pick and choose what you like.RenaissanceMusic from the renaissance is not just incredibly beautiful but its also still relevant. Many of the minimalist composers both American but also the European minimalists are very inspired by this style of music. Renaissance style often uses canons and sounds older because much of it is modal which means that theres no real hierarchy between the different chordsJosquin Des Prez Missa Pange Lingua is a great example of renaissance compositional style.Allegris Miserere Mei  now it can be argued that this isnt technically renaissance because the piece has been altered throughout history but still its fantastic and quite well known.Claudio Monteverdis Vespers of the Blessed Virgin This piece is borderline baroque. Monteverdi was one of the first to use stereo effects in his music. When you see this piece live the musicians will move around for many of the pieces because Monteverdi wanted to sound to come from specific directions.BaroqueThe Baroque Era is known mostly for its use of polyphony roughly meaning that all the instruments have their own melodies that together create the chord progressions and for the invention of tonality which is the style that defines music from the baroque era and up until around . Tonality is a hierarchy of chords and tones meaning that you can hear that a chord can sound like home. Usually the chord that ends a piece.For me personally Bach is the biggest Baroque composer of them all. No one comes close. You most likely know his Air from the Orchestral Suite No. My favourite Bach piece is from the Passion of St. John though. Its the opening choir Herr Unser Herrscher which was the piece that got me hooked to classical musicClassicalThis is the era from where the term classical comes from. It holds composers such as Mozart Beethoven borderline romantic Haydn and others.If this Adagio from Mozarts Wind Serenade for  windinstruments doesnt make your soul weep with emotions you never thought possible you have no soul.The rd movement from Beethovens Moonlight Sonata is an amazing piece. Fast as lightning and stunningly beautiful and expressive.Romantic EraThis is where it gets tricky. I would argue against the concept of separating the romantic era in two but thats another discussion. IN the romantic era is where the composers begin to break and experiment with tonality. Its also from the romantic period the concept of the artist became popular. Now music is an art not a craft.The genre of Lider became popular in the s and its grandmaster is Schubert. Lieder are songs usually with lyrics taken from poems and then made into songs for solo male voice with piano accompanying.I prefer Schumann over Schubert and Dichterliebe is the best lieder out there if you ask me. Very romantic and very overly emotional. The cycle ends with the poet going out in the winter to be eaten by wild dogs because hes so sad and he ends with saying that when they bury him theyll need a very big coffin to contain all his sorrow. What an emo.Mussourgskys Pictures at an Exhibition is a great example of Russian romantic music and the orchestration by Ravel is sublimeTchaikovsky is most known for his orchestral works concertos and ballets. My faviourite of his is a choirwork. The Hymn of the Cherubim written for the Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom.ImpressionismAfter ish fuckloads of new movements begin to arise. Impressionism is one of them. Impressionism wath all about stillframes of moods. It wasnt about where the music was pointing towards but to portray a state of mind for instance so there is not much tonality.Erik Satie tried to write music for the future. He imagined that families would own pieces of furniture that could play music of its own this was before the phonograph and he tried to compose music that he imagined this machine music would sound like. Gnossienne noDebussy was another Frenchie who also reshaped music. His music along with Stravnisky and a few others basically defined early film music. His most well known piece today is Clair De Lune but I adore his only opera Pellas et Mellisnde or another famous piece for piano The Maid with the Flaxen HairAfter I have a huge gap here because I think there are other pieces in this thread that portray this era beautifully..Im off in a minute so ill make this quickSteve Reich Different Trains  The only piece in my opinion that is able to portray the holocaust porperly. Its about the holocaust among other things.Henryk Gorecki Symphony no .Arvo Prt Symphony no. .,WhereDoIStart,cfv7sm1,1,t5_2xpnz

2393295,0,t1_cm7iocy,ampampamp John Keatss  odes sfw gtIn  John Keats composed six odes which are among his most famous and wellregarded poems. Keats wrote the first five poems Ode on a Grecian Urn Ode on Indolence Ode on Melancholy Ode to a Nightingale and Ode to Psyche in quick succession during the spring and he composed To Autumn in September. While the exact order in which Keats composed the poems is unknown some critics contend that they form a thematic whole if arranged in sequence. As a whole the odes represent Keatss attempt to create a new type of short lyrical poem which influenced later generations.gtgtImage i  John Keats in  painted by his friend Joseph SevernInteresting Fanny Brawne | Ode on Indolence | To Autumn | Ode on a Grecian Urn Parent commenter can toggle NSFWmessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot NSFW toggleampmessageBtogglensfwcmioi oror deletemessagecompose?toautowikibotampsubjectAutoWikibot DeletionampmessageBdeletecmioi.

Oblivion is sort of in between in most of these respects.If you decide to play Morrowind know that the combat is based off of dicerolls rather than always hitting make sure to create a character that has a high agility and weapon stat and use that weapon also fatigue the green bar near health controls your chance to do pretty much everything including hit enemies so make sure thats always high.In terms of mods in any of the games Id play your first playthrough with very few to no mods.

I went down the vaporwave rabbit hole after stumbling on a simpsons wave video on YouTube never knowing about the genre other than some songs I really liked but didnt know the artists. A lot of it can be a little annoying but I came across an artist named George Clanton and his vaporwave project called Esprit. Check out his songs Summer Night from the album of the same name and Daydream along with some others on his album Girls Only. He has a solo album under his own name called  Elecronica thats really good too. Not so much vaporwave but really solid synthpop.,WhereDoIStart,d7px05o,1,t5_2xpnz
