225792,0,t3_1wmhhe,It was always my understanding that we were not directly a Christian fraternity. We are a fraternity with Christian values. Hell one of my pledge brothers is a Muslim. Not a Christian religion but he still got the same wonderful message that we all receive on that amazing initiation day.Im a mason now too. Sort of same ideals masonry is a fraternity that welcomes all religions because we do not discuss or judge others. So dont feel discouraged brother as long as you underspend the great message that is conveyed to us on being brought to this great fraternity dont stress being a Christian. In hoc. ,SigmaChi,cf45f1c,1,t5_2s3ze
2422134,0,t3_2llmbn,Ive gotten so into doing this project that I have traced out  generations of brothers ranging from newly initiated to guys intiated in the mid s. Unfortunately I have found a decent amount of alumni are at the point of not caring that they almost try to stay away from anything associated with the Fraternity. A few of them were almost angry I tried contacting them to just to ask who is their big and littles. It is nice when I find brothers who are really into it as well although they are fewer than I would hope but most are still polite and respond.Has anyone else traced out their tree by contacting alumni to get their information?,SigmaChi,cmb31ji,1,t5_2s3ze

However I was told that they wont be training anybody this year at workshop a couple weeks ago. Sorry but possibly next year.IH,SigmaChi,cryzfg5,2,t5_2s3ze
