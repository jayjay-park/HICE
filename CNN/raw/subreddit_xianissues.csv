7982259,0,t1_d4d881s,One big difference will be the aftermath after HB is gone.Gomez will be welcome back in NC. Springsteen Starr and others that bailed on concerts might find NC a lot less welcoming to them. Especially if they make it look like theyre coming back to make NC grovel to them.They might also find reluctance for future concerts if they dont go back to the venue and ticketholders they baled on before seeking to appear anywhere else in NC.,xianissues,d4da4wn,0,t5_3f3b4
8001355,0,t3_4otmoz,Im letting this stand for two reasons. uspiritmixedup has been slammed for relating his experiences and this poster validates it.  it provides an example of the kind of intolerance and hatred that led me to create the sub.But be warned there is a limit to how far I will tolerate this. And the letters in your username are one off from the letters in the username of a known problem makes me even more suspicious.,xianissues,d4fffdi,0,t5_3f3b4
8030065,0,t1_d4imppx,gt Ajerbijan doesnt recognize homosexuality Its Azerbaijan and samesex acts are legal  therefore it is legal to be gay. gtalso that is overlooking the fact that every single country that has death penalty is a Muslim country and the death penalty is proscribed for Islam under sharia law Which is in the hadiths something not universally agreed upon. gtAs for your weird Shinto Buhddist poser crapIve reported this personal attack. gt I come from a Buddist country Thedrava and homosexuality is also forbidden there and seen as the result of evil deeds in a past life  ie moral failing kinda like how Buddhism seems physical disabilities or poverty. Sooo enlightened Youre conflating a religion with countries with that religion as the majority. Thailand Cambodia or Laos I presume. gtJapanese Buddhists have also come out against homosexualityGenshin  an th century Tendai scholar  out of hundreds upon thousands of writings that affirm a gay persons rights by Buddhist Bhikku and Shinto KannushiMiko. gtso really considering your praise and kindness to these religions combined with your hatred of Christainity over the same issue that these other religions condemn the only rational conclusion is you are a servant of Satan naturally you will lie and deny it because the bible teaches that Satan is also a liarServant of Satan? Pfft. You are mistaken. I serve nobody but myself. I also dont hate Christianity but I do not agree with the stance provided by Paul in the New Testament regarding homosexuality. uclarasfh Id appreciate moderation on his posts. You can look in his history. Hes accused my religion of promoting genocide using baseless claims and endless namecallingpersonal attacks. ,xianissues,d4inku9,1,t5_3f3b4
