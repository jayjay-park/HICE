5460414,0,t3_3pu78q,Ask questions of the interviewer.Find out what kind of customer he is and then tailor the sales pitch to that type of customer.Always worked for me.The mistake that people make in this situation is to start trying to sell the phone to the customer immediately. Interviewers want to know if you can be sociable with a customer at the same time determining what kind of sale you can make with them. Asking questions puts the customer in the spotlight and pretty much makes them tell you what they want.If you dont know what they really want how will you sell them something?Example Sales Hi my name is . What kind of phone are you looking for today?Customer Not really sure I was hoping to find something while browsing.Sales Alright lets try to narrow it down. Do you have an account already? Do you do a lot of traveling for work or pleasure? International sales Are you on the phone constantly? Needs a phone with great battery life Will you need to browse the web or download large files on your phone for your work? Data planetc.Good luck in future interviews.,InterviewFauxYou,cw9mbhj,7,t5_2xyak
