2811041,0,t3_2sa0v3,Odds are it was the OB that was the dad but not certain since they are all mouthbrooders.  Ive even heard rumors that Paralabidochromis chromogynos an OB Victorian cichlid may have been involved in creating OB peacocks in the first place. Usually in the first cross youll get three phenotypes One that looks like mom one that looks like dad and one that is a pretty even mix of the two.  Then again this is a cross between two hybrids so who knows.  I have seen some awesome OB Dragonbloods. ,Cichlid,cnnluqq,2,t5_2ved3
3139625,0,t1_conbebb,I dont really know what all youre keeping or what your ratio is but typically a dominant male will mate with a female of his species first and foremost.  If you have enough females he wont bother with other species.  However if there is a low number of females he will mate with whatever he can.  Subdominant males will try and mate as wellbut the dominant male will interrupt them if he catches themhowever it still can happen.,Cichlid,conf3cj,1,t5_2ved3

4851309,0,t1_cu61eqs,You want a minimum of  juveniles per species.  You should have to remove  males of each species as they mature.Where you start is not where youll finish.As I said before your total adult fish should be  but as juveniles you can comfortably have TWICE that number .I had though you were thinking of rehoming the OB peacocks.You need to test for AMMONIA as well.,Cichlid,cu61kto,1,t5_2ved3

6126345,0,t3_3zfm0w,Your amount of fish is fine but when fully grown you will need a larger tank. A lot larger. I cant see the fish in this image really but it is possible they are already too large.They are simply not used to you yet. They will not run from you eventually in fact they will come to the glass excited to see youreally the food you give them but hey we can pretend.,Cichlid,cym02gd,2,t5_2ved3

6533964,0,t3_44vv8x,I would not use a spraybar on an overflow tank. Seems to me the whole bottom could end up a dead spot for circulation unless it is a very shallow tank.Ideal situation is to put the water back into the tank on the opposite side of the overflow and shoot it downward in the tank.Or you could add a powerhead I guess to help with circulation.,Cichlid,czv5x14,1,t5_2ved3

9499350,0,t1_d9jzl1g,I did notice that. I originally had a malawi tank and gradually converted it to tangs only. When I looked at the difference between the buffers I was so shocked at the difference that I was afraid to  even work my way up to the tang buffer. I had an old peacock who was getting egg binding every other month and the epsom salt was what helped. Then I figured it was good to keep in for the tropheus since they love to bloat.Things have worked out so well with malawi buffer  epsom salts the way it is that Ive stuck with it. I just browsed through cichlidforum and it seems that the I came to the  tbsp per  gallon for purposefully. ,Cichlid,d9jzwno,2,t5_2ved3
