7274438,0,t1_d24ougl,Oh yay! TNG was really good! I LOVE Data hes my spirit animal. I honestly really loved the original series too though if only for the ridiculous fighting scenes. Kirks got them moves haha! I think my favourite series is actually DS though. I think one of my favourite episodes is Shadowplay just because Odo said I consider Major Kira a friend and I ship them so much. Voyager was good in terms of story but I didnt like half the crew cIve definitely heard of Hyperion but I havent read it myself. I cant think of any Sci Fi books right now but I probably have some good ones on my book shelf And thats so funny I used to play League a lot! Thats actually what made me decide to go into Game Art because I loved the splash art so much! I havent played in a really long time though and my anxiety is to blame for that  It just became a really toxic community and at one point someone even raged at me in a bot game WTF?. Id totally play with you though if you dont mind that Im a little rusty haha!,socialanxietyfriends,d251znl,1,t5_37ta2
