1487124,0,t1_cj2l6fd,Im sure you remember SoE once experimented with longer cap times. People werent a fan and the featured got quickly removed.If they were to add longer spawn timers I think they need to do it gradually over time in increments of    seconds to allow the playerbase to gradually adjust.Also they will need to go further than remove the ability to redeploy past the immediate outposts. People will just keep redeploying. There needs to be some mechanism to increase redeploy times the more you do it in a short space of time.I also think the issue of base design and lanes snowballing needs addressing along with these issues. There needs to be some mechanism to provide a disincentive to cram more and more people in to a base in to win local resource area denial for starters.I think past a certain point respawns should even possibly cost resources if you are outpopping a lane that badly.

1635962,0,t1_cjldj7o,I think youre overestimating the power of the HA. In most bases its difficult for one HA to hit AVnades and rockets perfectly on a max without putting himself in danger. Remember that where theres a max theres usually a ton of other infantry to mow you down. A good max player will also not stand in one spot just waiting for you to lay an AVnadeC at his feet or throw a rocket at in his face.Also this is more of an NC max problem but the ttk of max weapons are usually really fast so you dont have a lot of time to react is a max gets up to you or camps a corner.,MillerPlanetside,cjldm7b,0,t5_2wi6w
1648211,0,t3_2d6dka,I said it some place else already... without the achievement system I would be taking a break because for me there is no fun in going out of ANY spawn and being shot at from  several angles immediately. No tactics in that.Also in the past with most fights being in the  low  range coming with your  squadoutfit online made a real difference. Now it only makes a real difference if everybody plays in MLG mode. Theres no more relaxed squad fun or as we call it in RNX casual outfit gaming opposed to tactical outfit gaming.Im not entirely sure why the battles between the bases do not kick in as in PS to be honest. Somehow the distances between the bases are skipped and it feels a lot like hopping from capture point to capture point.We need more continents fast cause as it is the constant way doesnt work especially now that TR are underpopped. I can imagine a lot of casual TR giving up cause its not fun to be warpgated on  conts all the time.Current status am CESTWorld pop VS  TR  NCAmerish and Hossin locked for NCIndar TR have  sectors are being attacked by both VS and NCEsamir TR have  sectors are being attacked by both VS and NCThe doubleteaming against TR for obvious balance reasons works fine as long as TR have  advantage on the global pop but not if they are at the same level or outpopped. Since SOE will not change the balancing cause the important devs just do not play TR themselves period and the NC and VS will not suddenly start to like fighting each other more we need more continents and PS style cont lockingmovement so that we get more v empire action going. Otherwise the player numbers especially on TR are going to drop dramatically  and soon.,MillerPlanetside,cjmx59z,3,t5_2wi6w

Its a huge difference to other servers Ive played on and I pray to goddess these matches would have a positive impact on Miller live server also so I can enjoy playing on my alts.

You shoot and kill or shoot and hide. Dont get shot. I am not talking about fighting your average player.

3101776,0,t1_cojhcph,That doesnt really fit my experience. Neither on VS nor on TR or NC.In my experience all factions defend bases that are about to fall no matter the Pops infact you can be sure that at about the  minute mark youll see a bunch of maxes storm out of the spawn. They also all attack with massive Overpop knowing full well that once the overpop is so massive most people dont redeploy to defend. And really as long as Cont. Pop is equal there is no problem because the Overpop they have at one base they are missing somewhere else. There are allways gonna be fights that arent enjoyable nothing is perfect. Screaming bloody murder and hating on DIGKOTV all the time doesnt make it better instead it just poisons the community.,MillerPlanetside,cojhxhz,0,t5_2wi6w
3103236,0,t1_cojlw4c,Based on your first paragraph alone then stats do not matter in any FPS except Counter Strike. COD you respawn. BF you get revived and respawn. Quake you respawn. Tribes you respawn. So stats do not matter in any of those games?I actually feel that stats in PS are very useful and telling of gameplay. Low KPH amp low SPH you either ghostcap spawncamp or sit in a spawn room all day. Low KPH but high SPH you probably vehicle my guess would be AP tonking or nosegunAB ESF most of the day. Etc etc. You can tell a lot my someones stats. To say they dont matter is extremely subjective and based on opinion. The intended purpose of PS can be argued until we all die. Is it team and squad play like in PS? Is it an endless TDM? Is it a mix of both? Fuck if we know. But what we have right now is pretty much and endless TDM over a dynamic map with alerts thrown in every so often. You can choose to play the current game a multitude of different ways and to say one way is wrong is ignorant. While you may not agree with how someone else plays its not wrong. While you may go around capping bases and trying to gain territory for you faction someone else just might want to log in and do nothing but shoot people and not care about base captures or defences or they want to tonk or they want to fly. None of those are wrong just each different. Stats matter to an individual or a group of individuals or they dont. But no matter if they matter or dont matter to you they do paint a good picture of how you play and how effective you are in that play style. You brought up vs. A players that has better stats that someone who doesnt is going to do better. This holds true for a collective  as well. If  players have better stats than the other  players the  with better stats will do better. So stats do matter if youre going to start comparing people. Without stats how do you compare the people?,MillerPlanetside,cojndt0,3,t5_2wi6w
3116996,0,t1_col00c0,well realistically the whole selling of SOE to become DGC to have taken some time.the sale was probably already in process in december or at least in consideration by Sony as SOEs head company thus there were no further investments going from Sony into SOE to for example quickly fix the servers etc.Now the transition is in progress which means none of the guys working for DGC know for sure if their job is secure and neither do the guys doing the coordination thus all processes like fixing servers and especially that due to the technical stuff around it like hardware config and the with that related programming will take even longer because of all the ceremonies surrounding a takeover like constant meetings and evaluations disturbing that.Just dont shit your pants as of yet be patient and lean back maybe even play another game for a week or two or three and come back to see what happened before driving yourself crazy with the current instability.,MillerPlanetside,col2r4v,1,t5_2wi6w

Its like me saying the Airgame ruins my fun and ABTF should stop being jerks and stop that...and then I would complain about it several times a week. The better solution would be to get some AA.Diskussing Playstyles is perfectly valid but people only ever begin with that  of those threads is then about how DIGKOTV are terrible people.As for DIGT instigating discussions...how is disagreeing with someone something bad?And to explain what I meant by saying you misrepresented the issue You said the counter point to those AntiZergThreads are people who think that zerging is fun which is untrue. These people diagree that DIGKOTV is the core of the problem because zerging is something all factions do to pretty much the same extent and that the only real solution is to coordinate see NC and counter them.,MillerPlanetside,cpadnpj,-2,t5_2wi6w

They seemed to be able to cope quite well when holding points for an open? outfit i mean i dont know who they used to be what they are really like they could just be another DIG. Mind you their players tend to play as good as DIG.But hey they manage to pull a better KD and get near equal kills as DIG with half the numbers. I also saw some AAT Air Assault Troops as Seb said below these must be the pilots that came over. This can only bode well for the server has a whole. I hope Flutty is crying real bad now though VS not won a Primetime alert in  days and a TR zergfit with less numbers can equal them and also LPS seem to get about now as well. Can we get any info from our resident Ruskies about these guys? uVpolne ucharoplet uuzver? Are RUSK and LPS actually  outfits from Werner or are they different outfits from NC and TR combined into one?,MillerPlanetside,cqpi82f,3,t5_2wi6w

Not because of the people that were part of it but instead because of the principle. TR desperately need some variation of Bobsquad  i.e. an amalgamation of several aboveaverage players from different outfits that enjoy playing together despite their differences in order to stay competetive.TR have some pretty powerful players and outfits but there is only ever a few on at one given time. Perhaps theyd make more of a difference and communicationcommand wouldnt be such a big issue if TR played together more. Loyalty until death right?

5530328,0,t1_cwi7bxo,I think the main problem is the net code here and the way it handles rapid movement.  I absolutely hate running into a good player who adads while hipfiring some SMG or AR because it is pretty much pot luck who wins but the same also applies with . movement speed at times too especially if one or both of you lag.  Faction diversity is nice but if theres a problem with the code that they cant fix any other way you have to sacrifice lore and diversity to balance the game the Orion was always very similar to the MSW anyway though.  They really should remove . from all weapons in the game and massively increase the accuracy penalty for hipfiring most guns while moving the lmg buff in this regard makes no sense.  Battlefield is a game that modelled this aspect of gun play quite well but in that the devs didnt have to cater for hundreds of players fighting on the one server so I guess in this game the only option is to remove movement advantages until they can come up with a better solution to the lag problem.,MillerPlanetside,cwijqqz,2,t5_2wi6w

6242410,0,t1_cyz5pav,gt so what you are saying is we have good weapons to counter long range av but we dont use them therefore the GK has to be nerfed? easy way out i get it....Dude If youre having to argue that the majority of VS players across every single server are too dumb to have realised how good the Lancer is in well over  years since it came out to support your point maybe youre wrong and maybe the Lancer is actually highly situational and teamwork reliant compared to the GK?gt the magrider survives gt longer nice source again therefore the prowler is op? is it the old VS are just better playersargument you try to pull here?Uniques means per player not per spawn did you honestly think that on infantry weapons basically every single weapon has a KD greater than one? Im honestly having trouble taking you seriously at all if you can make a mistake like that. Im using oraclestats same as you try looking at the average monthly stats instead of eyeballing it from a line graph.gt Lightning playtime is the same for all factions so you dont pull them instad of magriders.Look at the playtime for Lightning AP HEAT and HE the MBT equivalent weapons with TR global overpopulation you would expect TR to have the most all things being equal but they are the lowest. What the VS do more than Magriders is C Prowlers VS C more Prowlers than they kill with Magrider AP then Tank mines and VS kill more Prowlers with Spear Turrets than with the Saron HRB. NS weapons OP apparently.gt why does gkh make more kills? EasyIts a different playstyle weapon short and long range. Boring people sitting on top of a hill holding down MM at anything that renders are going to have a lower KPH than a weapon that plays aggressively with high risk but high reward the VulcanH which is the TR equivalent has higher VKPH than the AphelionH. If youre honestly arguing that the MjolnirH is better than the GKH I honestly dont know what to say that is the most laughable thing youve said so far.gt TR is just retared and plays a worse weapon alot more. More GK gt more Kills with GK gt people think its op because they die more often to it.Again if youre arguing that after nearly half a year of play time that the majority of players on an entire faction is an idiot to try and argue your point maybe youre wrong. gt you just throw around random bullshit and things you made up but you did not come up with one single fact you know a proven thingy why the GK should be nerfed.Ive just shown you with statistics that are easily available and calculated that far from being asymmetrically balanced in vehicle combat TR ESAV weapons are by far outkilling the VS weapons with the GK being the most recent change that upset the balance in the first place. A big part of that is that they are too easy to use hold down MM at render distance. The postnerf GK has exactly the same DPS and accuracy as prenerf but now it is harder to use that makes perfect sense.,MillerPlanetside,cyz6zs3,1,t5_2wi6w

6961908,0,t3_4b0ag5,My thoughts is that it was pretty nice for first half an hour.  fights slightly overppoped NC on VS front but we left it as soon as understood this.but then every and each base we fight was overpoped by TR. i can understand it coz TR was  on hossin but i think not all understood the idea of this joing ops.you see mostly all tactical gamplay outfits usualy whine about zergs overpops and so on. But every time they do fraction OPS on empty or even not empty continent they just have no same tactical and SpecOps enemies.this OPs should be not for fraction victory of all kind at least not the main goal but good and interesting fights. But fights witht overpop at every hex i even seen some bases by PLATOON GHOSTHACK with  enimies. PLATOON CARL! is that tactical and interesting?So what i can suggest is to make kind of SS stuff.

The first couple of shots recoil pretty much straight up I am afraid I dont have the stats at hand but iirc the fourth shot is the first that can kick sideways. This means the only thing you need to do with these carbines is to compensate for upwards recoil and microburst to be very accurate even on longer ranges. So you dont really need forward grip on these carbines.In addition forward grip increases your equip time and you trade off  hipfire bonus for not having laser sight which is a considerably disadvantage in CQC. ,MillerPlanetside,d3za8on,3,t5_2wi6w

This would preserve full access to the single market. But like Norway Britain would have to make a hefty contribution to the EU budget Norway pays about  as much as Britain per head observe all EU singlemarket regulations with no say in making them and crucially accept free movement of people from the EU. It is hard to imagine a postBrexit government accepting this. The second is a freetrade deal like the EUs with Canada. Yet this does not cover all trade does not eliminate nontariff barriers excludes most financial services and could take years to agree.gtThe other option for Britain is to revert to trading with the EU as America China and India do under normal World Trade Organisation rules. But most economists say this would make the economic damage from Brexit worse. It would bring back mutual tariffs on cars pharmaceuticals food and fish. It would reinstate many nontariff barriers.

Nonoptimal game design combined with lazy and selfish players are the combined causes for this topic.Why selfish? They only care about themselves or their group having fun giving no regard to the opposition or making them want to stick around for more later. Instead what they should do is to at least consider the enjoyment of others. The game depends on it  without players on bothall sides there is no game to play any more.

That and people playing mostly on Indar and Esamir when its open hopefully Amerish save a bit the remaining decent fights and not farm we have. Yeah we need to have people going for fights. And not stupid  vehicle bullshit. Drop with gals back cap zergs. People having fun because they face adversity even if that mean unfair fights but the adrenaline of achieving something hard and not the bullshit spawn camps or defence famers looking only at kd we have nowdays.

8796196,0,t3_50mbpg,Force multipliers are completely balanced on platoon vs platoon level just as factions are wellbalanced in terms of global war.

8796272,0,t3_50mbpg,gt I personally feel that the majority of force multipliers are balanced when taken into context of their own tree. For example I believe the armour vs armour gameplay is largely fine and only requires tweaking in certain areas.  I made a suggestion on the main reddit some time ago which wasnt well received tbh but I still think the game would be better off when it would focus more on those pure INFvsINFTANKvsTANKAIRvsAIR battles since they are kinda balanced and would be easier to balance then. Give each their own objectives instead of throwing everything into the mix for just one objective  capturepoints.  TLDR uncombine arms. give each arm their own objective zones. give each objective a purpose. without the objectives of the other arms your chances decrease to be successful to win your objective and to win the map game overall.,MillerPlanetside,d756xjt,3,t5_2wi6w

9877407,0,t3_5gsta6,gtFor single point bases if the population of the current owner of the capture terminal except defenders and for v fights is above . times the amount of the defending faction then that factor is applied to the capture timer. Roughly if there is a constant    pop on the base then its a . longer timer so around  minutes and  seconds. This factor should be capped to .This is going to be hurtful for everyone and very abusable in the meta. In my experience people not responding to attacks is as big as a problem as zerging in this game. Now a single squad pointhold can be ignored for  minutes before being wiped by x pop no thanks. I dont want to be punished for the enemy not bothering to show up. Also hard to capture bases Saerro et al. will now become completely impossible making the lattice even more stale. It will also lead to more downtime for casualnew players as will the other proposed changes. XP and directives can be fiddled with but I dont think theyve ever been enough of an incentive to radically change player behaviour and especially not leader behaviour.I really appreciate the initiative and effort but I wont be signing this letter.

I think you feel your TAG automatically gives you the right to talk down to others make absurd accusations and talk negatively to people like a complete muppet. You have admitted yourself that your a cancerous negative individual with nothing better to do than to put others down.Now I am more than happy to have a adult vocal discussion with you on our Teamspeak which you have accepted via private message.So either talk to me on the public forum or private message me like you have done before because you didnt want to get showed up further.Im waiting for ya. ,MillerPlanetside,dbdrszu,1,t5_2wi6w

The amazing  Pump action killstreaks are against clusters of low BRs on landing pads. Youll just perform better with an LMG in any fight.Shotguns are real fun to use and a welcome tool to equalize the game like you say. Even the regular player can kill the good player. Breaching rooms with a pump action can be epic if you get  shots  kills.No way in hell is ADAD LMG medkit dancing bullshit fun to me.

You whant to play solo? Its ok but deal with the fact that other guys might prefer to play as a team and they have all the right to do so.
