5885843,0,t1_cxq8dt2,a voice dim faint but audibly Pipkins rings out from the tunnel.My heart thuds faster and I wait for the delayed rush of adrenaline. Its arrival sends a slight quiver throughout the muscles surrounding my spine and I move toward the sound following the nowagitated bodies of my artificial hounds.Were getting close. Mm I should probably respond to Pipkin. Glad to see shes held up her end of the bargain honesty and fortitude. I still think her misguided but she is not without admirable qualities.PIPKIN! Im close by you I think! Do you know anything about Boones situation?,TheDesert,cxr61gz,3,t5_33p9r

10517084,0,t1_dd04klg,It sounds like a good place for now.You lead me to the branches and I rake them with my hands feeling rough knobs and jagged stumps and peeling strips of paperthin bark that crumble under my fingers. I carefully raise the new poles of our makeshift tent. But my clumsy attempts to raise them without my sight are halting and as my frustration reaches a peak the stucture topples.I growl angrily and walk away stumbling over rock and brush until I force myself accept that if I continue I am likely to hurt myself further and I may not find my way back.I stand facing a distant landscape that I cannot see. It hits me then the crushing knowledge that I will never again experience the world as I once did.I stand there just breathing as the warm breeze brushes past.,TheDesert,dd083g2,4,t5_33p9r
