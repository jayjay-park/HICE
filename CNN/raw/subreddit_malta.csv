224566,0,t3_1wog1t,Alright at least one point I can agree shes sort of on the mark here pity it took her  years since E.U accession amp a change of party in the Maltese government to voice this opinion out clearly amp concisely although cleverly aware I can safely state the wait is by all means not accidental. hint cherrypickingThis isnt a partisan problem its a mentality problem amp if only this virtue was instilled rather then repressed much before in the Maltese people by the previous governments the country would be in a much better place thankfully things have a way to eventually work anyway the famous dictum People will always elect the government they deserve speaks loudly here amp this always comes with some foreshadowing obviously since the people need already to in that state to elect that government which resonates with them.For the rest of course the people will still regress in their bad habits from time to time but itll get there eventually especially if it sees the government doing the same with its international partners rather then playing lackey the latest IIP matter for better or worse thats a subjective opinion discussed on other threads gives one much to hope for.,malta,cf40tig,1,t5_2qrbz

4596969,0,t3_3dy4e7,Hi there! Its great that youve decided to give UoM a go. I spent  years in sixth form as I had completely let myself go wild during the first two years. It was a maturing experience and now Im focusing on the subject Ive always wanted to and happily reading for my degree at university.Guys correct me if Im wrong!As far as I know to get a Matriculation certificate you need to have sat for  Alevel exams  intermediates and SOK. From what Ive read you need to sit for one more Alevel in order to be eligible to receive the certificate necessary for admittance to UoM. Youd need  points the grading and points system is explained in the prospectus as well as a minimum grade of  in your English Language Maltese and Maths Olevels. That pretty much sums up the general entry requirements. Check out your course requirements to see if you need to get certain grades for admission.Of course this is assuming that you are not applying as a mature student. If youre  or over by the time the course begins you may be eligible to apply under a maturity clause. The details are lost on me but I think applying under said clause exempts you from the MATSEC requirement.So basically you need to sit for one more Alevel in order to qualify for MATSEC certification. Once again if there is anyone out there who thinks my post is shit andor outdated correct me as Id like to keep up with whats happening in regard to admissions.,malta,cta1eon,3,t5_2qrbz
4696739,0,t1_ctmjssr,I forgot to mention that despite having a red light flashing everytime I placed the card on the machine they actually took  cents anyway so the card was fucked up and started to turn on the red light instead of the green light and not only did I use up credit without me even knowing but I also had to pay for a  ticket each time. When I went to talk to them at the booth at Valletta the guy in the booth told me that I had minus . and I have topped up  online the day before.By the time I receive the new Student card I called them yesterday and the day before the envelope filled with the tickets that I have to send them to have all that money refunded to my balance might not even have the standard envelope weight.Lets hope that Ill receive it by September.,malta,ctmkbe6,1,t5_2qrbz

6159703,0,t1_cypkf5a,Not really sure yet but I guess Melita and GO will both want to protect their own TV market or risk becoming commodity internet providers only if consumers abandon them for Overthetop streamed TV. Maybe they could introduce a data cap on Netflix traffic whereby once a certain data threshold is reached higher charges kickin thereby copying pricing models similar to Comcast.    Definitely interesting times ahead for us the consumers,malta,cypsme2,1,t5_2qrbz

6647970,0,t1_d06fpsm,Right so good nights out...There is a gay friendly club in Paceville the party central of Malta... well a gay bar actually called axm but since it is one of very few bars youll come across a very wide mix of people.  There is however rarely any trouble and everyone is friendly plus the drinks are not expensive.Then there are plenty of events too all year round like this disco party tonight.  The same two organisers often come up with something similar and its usually a bunch of fun.Then there are a few quieter things going on like walks picnics Sunday afternoon events at bars... less partying more relaxing kind of things.  You can follow this facebook page which pretty much always includes anything that is going on....oh yeah and there is also this new bar called Morpheus I have never really been and it hasnt quite caught on yet it seems but its somewhere else to go.  Hopefully it will become a bit more popular too.,malta,d06yhoo,2,t5_2qrbz

9116795,0,t3_553v9q,Contrary to the above I use BOV. Jiena Maltija however I dont live there. Want to return soon though HSBC wouldnt open an account for me despite holding a Maltese ID card with an address in Malta the reason being that I dont attend school in Malta. I was  at the time I was confused. So off to BOV i went the manager at my branch was very helpful and went above and beyond. Never asked anything about schooling just took my ID number and that was it.Only criticism is the card from BOV isnt a chipcard and some retailers have to be told a few times to swipe and not endlessly shove into the chip reader to no avail.From this interaction im wary to do business with HSBC. However i am Gozitan and they say the banking experience is different in Gozo than in MaltaGood luckEDITYes you can have two banks at the same time not a problem there. Up to you how you manage your money and distribute between the different accounts. I have  banks here in Canada plus BOV in Malta.Switching to another bank is easy they will transfer any direct deposits you have and your balance and get you sorted.Why you should go for this bank over the other  BOV gave me service HSBC didnt. Simple as that for my decision,malta,d87ow95,6,t5_2qrbz
