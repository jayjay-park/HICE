5644124,0,t1_cwwkyq2,yeah haha youre absolutely right. I was being faecetious. Even DragnThrust dont win everything! I think they lost something the other day...Minneapolis is indeed a city without an amazing team which has betterthanstandard men and women on their mixed team.   ampnbspIf you compared the UK to a region of the US like the Northwest Sockeye tends to win the region as does Riot. Furious George and Traffic have historically been hard on their heels and Schwa and Rhino are behind them.ampnbspIn the Northeast Ironside and GOAT Wild Card and Slow White mixed and Brute Squad I hadnt heard of the other northwest womens teams.ampnbspIt seems that youre right in saying theres usually one or two teams in each region that dominate and then theres a bit of a dropoff to everyone else.,UKUltimate,cwwpi5m,3,t5_2spct

It was similar at mens and mixed in Scotland with a worrying number of nonfirst teams not being aware of how to brick... Id quite like to make at least basic WFDF rules accreditation being mandatory for regionals advanced for nationals and a highlight of the rule differences between outdoors and indoors being spammed at folk in captains packs Spirit | West | East | North | Scotland||||Average | . | . | . | .St. Dev. | . | . | . | .Median |  | . | . | ,UKUltimate,dabc4jh,1,t5_2spct
10172665,0,t3_5lltq5,The new contact rule is so heavily in favour of the offence. If everyone begins to use it regularly and not just play though the bumps on the mark lots of people are going to have to relearn how to force.,UKUltimate,dbx4lud,1,t5_2spct
