1250109,0,t3_28ew51,I ended up pulling some features to get the release a bit early but Im supremely happy with it so far. A lot of theory went into this that I could not test until very recently and it is a huge relief to find the theory holds water and it all works.Its still very much beta theres a ton of work left to do but it is getting to the point where you dont have to be insane to try it out as your main system at least for a bit.Bedrock Linux works much much better than the audio does in that video my apologies. I stepped on my microphone just this morning and it was to late to go get another one or risk breaking promises about having another demo video out  stepping on a microphone does weird things to it apparently.I cut out the parts that had the worst audio and after rewatching it I realized people may walk away with a slightly wrong impression. It doesnt only do executables and man pages and menu items but in theory the majority of things youd want from a distros packages. Two other things I had in the video and cut out where I showed the contents of lxappearances icon tab then I installed tangoicontheme from Debian and humanicontheme from Arch linux then restarted lxappearance and both of the new icon themes showed up in the menu as selectable items. I showed off compiling programs using libraries from other distros. In the example I had I showed that Debians libraries do not include any csv library for C although they do for haskell and ocaml. So I installed libcsv from Archs AUR then had Debians gcc compile against it.,bedrocklinux,cia93s3,4,t5_2uoeh
