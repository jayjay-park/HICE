879995,0,t1_ch3zr5p,Thread cutting has been a basic operation of mechanical lathes for a long time.  The item being machined is held between the spindle and tailstock.  The carriage moves the cutting tool parallel to the spindle axis.  The lead screw can move the carriage under power.  By gearing the lead screw to the spindle you can move the carriage a known amount per rotation of the spindle producing a thread with a given pitch thread spacing.  By using different combinations  in the gear box you can vary the thread pitch to get what you wanted.With modern servodriven lathes the motion of the cutting tool is controlled by computer.

Can you imagine such a Baxter robot that had a company behind it that could support it and even took the time to spell out most of the ANSI RIA OSHA etc standards and compliances beforehand to make your job as simple as possible?  There is no reason such a company and product cannot exist right now.  The idea that that pops into my mind when I think of Baxter though the reallife Baxter likely does not realize this currently is that the robot and the safety system are integrated in a tight and complete package so that is is idiotproof.

I personally love making things which is why I got a job in manufacturing. However the idea of decentralized manufacturing competing with current business models is absurd. If you really believe you can compete then put your money where your mouth is and start a business. Just dont count me in as an investor.Replying to this partgt  the idea of decentralized manufacturing competing with current business models is absurd.The goal of our project isnt to compete with current business models.  Its to provide an alternate way for people to supply themselves with the basics like food shelter and utilities.  In particular the people who have been thrown out of work by automation.  Those people have plenty of available time and they only need to be efficient enough to support themselves not sell on a competitive market.As far as the economics Ill again draw from my own experience.  Two people plus a WoodMizer sawmill are about as decentralized as you can get.  The owner of the sawmill is one of the two people.  He drives around to different landowners with logs that need sawing.  I was one of them.  We did it several times but in a days worth of sawing we produced between  and  of roughcut lumber it depends what kind of wood which has varying values.  On average it came to day.  For two people working  hours thats hr.  Pretty good money.I had a farm tractor so gathering the logs wasnt too much work.  If I did this on a regular basis Id get front forks for the tractor so the finished boards could be stacked for drying efficiently.  Some robots to load and unload the sawmill and a selfdriving tractor and one person could do this job.  Maybe a big stationary sawmill and the fleet of log trucks and forest machines it takes to keep it fed would be more efficient but the small scale operation would be plenty good enough to keep a community supplied with all the lumber they need and probably a surplus to sell elsewhere.,Automate,cq5zx2z,2,t5_2udq6

Companies that benefit from peoples labor like Uber absolutely have an obligation to not treat those people fairly as employees.  I just dont see the obligation of ZipCar to make sure everyone buys their own personal car when they could be enabling a life of mostly using public transit and biking with the occasional car rental when needed. Thats a model thats better for the environment and cheaper for people who cant afford the expenses of a personallyowned car. If you are against Zipcar because it reduces the need for car ownership you should be against public transportation takes many cars off the road mixed use development why drive when you can walk to work and the store bike paths and on and on. ,Automate,cqynowt,1,t5_2udq6

5971415,0,t1_cy2ald7,There are many machine learning models out there for which we have strong theoretical guarantees regarding behavior that are commonly used. For example linear classifiers are a broad family of algorithms that work by iteratively breaking down inputs by establishing decision boundaries Is it sunny or raining? Is the temperature above or below N degrees? Did you pack an umbrella andor a jacket?. They distill the tangled mess that is reality into a clean bestfit approximation. They cant solve every problem but theyre guaranteed to converge on solutions for problems that they can solve.DNNs meanwhile are what we call Turing complete. That is they are theoretically capable of learning any computable function. They are composed of nested nonlinearities that can be dynamically arranged into fuzzy circuits that solve problems.In general as models grow in power they become more wild and untamed. Because a DNN can do anything and can move in any direction so you have to corral them carefully. A minor example of this I had a DNN that was supposed to respond to inputs with either Error or None. But as the inputs got more complex it started hedging its bets by giving me inbetween answers like Errone and Norror. But more generally our theoretical understanding of these algorithms isnt mature enough and we cant yet give good guarantees on how a DNN will behave. The task of teaching them more closely resembles psychology than mathematics at this point more empirical than theoretical.,Automate,cy2dtgq,2,t5_2udq6

7838874,0,t1_d3wxu32,gt As more and more jobs get automated there will be less people who can fund the UBI and big corporations will just move to tax havens.Yet automation provides more and funding for those those fewer people that are still employed. If you dont increase what people can afford to purchase to match the extra production possible through automation then the automated factories must produce less than what they can produce because they cant sell what they can produce.As far as Im concerned the problem is not automation which increases what people should be able to purchase with their income. The problem is pushing wages down so that people cant purchase what can be produced. Forcing factories to produce less even though they now have the capacity to produce more. Instead wages should increase so that people can afford to buy the extra production.Its the mathematical equivalent of the paradox of thrift Only instead of wages being saved rather than spent it is wages that never get paid to begin with.When you say we cant fund consumers what you are really saying is that we cant fund the demand side of the supply and demand economy. Yet without the demand side there is no funding for the supply side. So really what you are saying is that we as a whole cant fund a free market economy which means that a free market economy cannot work. Of course it can unless you bleed the demand side of the free market so dry that theres no market for the supply side to produce for to generate their profits.When you ask how are we going to pay for it? thats the same thing as asking how are we going to produce that much? That much being the same production the funds are used to purchase. If you dont fund the demand side there is no supply side meaning no free market economy. Automation is the very means of funding through increased productivity if and only you fund the demand side enough to make that increased supply profitable to actual increase. Rather than dry up demand so much the automated factories have to intentionally limit production due to the lack of demand.,Automate,d3x5o3j,2,t5_2udq6

We literally are only scratching the surface of our planet.Average solar flux at ground level accounting for night and weather is Wm. assuming  conversion efficiency a mix of PV and thermal that gets you  MJyear of usable energy.  The embodied energy in products is typically  MJkg.  Thats all the energy from raw materials to finished products.  Lets be generous and assume  MJkg.  So we can convert  kgm per year into stuff.  Since the average density of the crust is  kgm  kg equates to . cm.  Using the occupied part of the Earth we can double our resources in  years.  Using the unoccupied areas in less than a year.Bringing this down to a personal level I own  acres  m in the Atlanta metro area.  If I used  of the land for solar collectors I would have  m x  Wm x  hryear    kWhyear about  times my average electric use.  I could run an awful lot of machines with that.  Ten meters of rock from under my land is  tons of raw materials.  Again an awful lot of stuff.  That assumes I leave the trees and house I have alone and just tunnel underneath.  Solar energy supplies over  hp in daylight which should be plenty to run excavating equipment.The resources are there we just have to tap them properly.,Automate,ddry08n,2,t5_2udq6

By the time the bandaid is off we need universal income to be in place. Tax now build universal income. ,Automate,ddyhc66,1,t5_2udq6

11092792,0,t3_5y9gsg,Its sort of been done for certain contexts as various teams are using genetic algorithms to modify codebases in order to maximize a fitness function which is based on unit tests being passed.I have seen a video where the speaker claimed that their computation costs for using such systems wound up being cheaper than the cost of hiring someone to do the same task.I cant find that video right now but this one seems to be a similar result.Personally I find that software development has little to do with programming and has much more to do with human communication to determine goals and product design.  However what I find amusing about that is that most of the reason we need human communication is that humans are involved in other parts of the organization.  If we were to avoid that by defining only goals but not mechanisms then we could have the machine learning systems which are normal in production systems in ad tech for instance exploring the space of possible implementations in order to maximize value across a wide range of strategies and possible inputs.  Continuous automatic AB testing would seek better solutions to the stated problem.  That would automate the programming of most of the systems involved in achieving the goal.Like most automation situations this would result in a lower number of jobs to determine what one should optimize what inputs might be available etc.  This might require more statistical or scientific sophistication and have higher effectiveness hence potentially higher salaries but for fewer people.Weve already gone from I compute the values to I write programs to tell the machine how to compute the values.  This next step is I provide objective functions which will cause machines to be able to learn how to compute the values.  It wont make sense all the time but it will worry away at the edges of programming jobs especially the lowerskill rote ones.,Automate,depcwcc,1,t5_2udq6
