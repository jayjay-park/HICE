363379,0,t3_1y7oee,Its too bad that they arent considering one of the other store types for Sapperton. New West really doesnt need three of any one grocery store. In addition to the Uptown one whichever they keep they are putting a SaveOn in where the IGA used to be on Columbia. A Coopers or Urban Fair would actually match Thriftys niche better than yet another SaveOn. But maybe not theyve obviously done some research while Im just guessing.,NewWest,cfifhkb,2,t5_2xddj

6350009,0,t3_42ji9o,Last I heard it still existed and markers could be found in the woodsy ravine. Legally any new construction would have to jump through a lot of hoops to build on a cemetery including relocating the bodies. It likely would have made the news at least locally. When Im back at work tomorrow I can ask a colleague for more details on its exact location. ,NewWest,czbfboe,1,t5_2xddj

7506173,0,t1_d2unbp8,Agreed.Like access to E Royal Ave being closed during evening rush hour  I cant find the rational behind it maybe Im missing something. Cars cant cut through to get to the bridge faster because theyre not allowed to turn left from Memorial Dr onto McBride.

9241311,0,t3_56xj28,I live in the Anvil building above Sapperton station. My wife and I really love it. Amenities are close by at the newer shopping complex. Plus there is addition commercial density coming in at the old brewery site. My understanding is zoning permits includes room for a distillery andor brew pub.There are also a few decent restaurants up Columbia. Anything else we need it is two stops to New West Quay or two stops to Lougheed Town Center.The biggest issue for us is the trains really. As there are three crossing including one under the SkyTrain station. When they cross it is very loud. But it was our choice to buy here so we live with it. I do know the various parties involved are working to make it a no whistle crossing at Sapperton and Cumberland. But that is far off from the last update I read.I cant speak to Copperstone directly. But I did hear rumours about the wood construction having issues. This was when my wife and I were looking to buy in the area. We never approached Copperstone. If you are buying then a thorough review of the strata and building depreciation report are in order. ,NewWest,d8nej1u,5,t5_2xddj

Some houses will be suffer been the dragnet affect of how the rules are implemented but overall the value will continue to increase as a prized neighbourhood getting older and older. ,NewWest,dg0yinj,3,t5_2xddj
11520512,0,t1_dg0ygao,I totally agree. I can see prices increasing or staying flat. Ive talked to local realtors not heritage advocates! who also agree. Part of the value of Queens Park will be that youre guaranteed that all homes will adhere to a unified high standard. It adds to be prestige and provides long term certainty. Queens Park is already very unique in a young lower mainland and will become even more unique and desirable as time goes on. It isnt for everyone but theres a large enough market for what theyre offering.,NewWest,dg1uo5u,2,t5_2xddj
