10548574,0,t1_dd0877f,Why are so many of you so eager to buy a cracked version of any bot?! Save up and buy a legit copy.. at least then youll have some sort of recourse if any of your info is stolen or anything. Buying a cracked version you have very little to no recourse. Youre dealing with your real life money and info or others information if youre trying to run an ATC service. Im not saying all these guys on here are gonna steal your info and yeah they may have a lot references here n there but why risk it? It only takes  time to get your info stolen somehow let alone somebody elses. What I did was pool money together between  friends and we bought multiple bots. We pool money for servers for proxies and its been good so far. Weve landed various hyped and nonhyped items for ourselves and have had no issues. ,shoebots,dd3srsj,3,t5_2uobl

11484372,0,t1_dfxocoe,The HyperSniper cookbook even though their scraper is trash is much better than SwiftCops book. Goes way more in depth and actual provides info. What the Sneaker Bible talks about you can get from  minutes of google searching. He doesnt know the game as well as you think  hes trying to push his affiliate links.,shoebots,dfxr2nl,1,t5_2uobl
