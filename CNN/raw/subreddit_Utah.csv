I wouldnt call any of the spots in the actual park primitive camping but if you follow the side road  just before you enter the camp it loops around and there are several off shoots not exactly roads that lead to some nice little spots.

If you stay outside of the ranch itself theres lots of free camping or campground camping check restrictions they change every year. It can be more peaceful if you go midweek but if youre there for a holiday weekend th or th of July its going to be a party.As far as rodeos go unless youre into very cityfied rodeos Park City and Salt Lake wont have anything of interest.

Up until a few years ago a gas tax was the easiest and most efficient way to roughly tax by usage.gtMaybe we just raise the gas tax and live with that until we understand the landscape better and can figure out something more lasting.Isnt that exactly what they are doing? The major structure change the article talks about is just pegging the gas tax to follow inflation so the state doesnt have to wait years to change the tax. Seems like a temporary fix that continues to use the gas tax until the market determines what the predominant mode of transportation will be in the next decade.,Utah,cnhvlu1,1,t5_2qwed

3538258,0,t3_30sugq,Just moved to UT this past fall and am leaving in a month. Nothing against the state it has a rugged beauty that the east could never emulate. Thay being said slc and the valley is just an endless strip mall. There is a shallow history but most of it is steeped in religious emigration. Slc is a great place for beer surprisingly. I feel like all the hizzare and complicated liquor laws have created a pretty strong brew scene. People get around it. My GF and I love beer so its cool being in the city. Thay being said we both grew up in rural new england. The city is definately a city. Industry rules out here. Living in south salt lake has lead to some interesting encounters some robberies and all around weird people.I hate not having space to breath literally so with the inversion months. But this is not reflective of the city more so of my personal preferences. Slc is a rad place. We moved here to climb and god is it awesome. However in a city with such an outdoor geared passion and such proximity to incredible places you feel the grip of the city long after you leave it. Always people around and its hard to get away even when you are away.The mormons are rad. Having been raised in a very religious family i have no issue with them. Sure it makes things interesting and ive been scolded a fair number of times for buying beer in the grocery stores. But the majority of the friends I have made are LDS. They let me drink my coffee I let them worship some guy who saw angels in a hat. Its a fair trade.All that aside the temple is breathtaking. Blows my mind eveytime.In conclusion. If you like the city and the outdoors this is your jam. Much more than all ohio combined.As for myself. New Hampshire will always be home. Everything and more is less than  hours away and we have trees and streams and wayer a plenty.,Utah,cpvl154,7,t5_2qwed

Im a landlord and I have an allutilities petfriendly studio unit that rents for  but its in the Provo metro area Springville to be exact. SLC rents tend to run  higher depending on neighborhood and amenities.Standard is to not include utilities in apartment rent because those represent highly variable costs. The advantage to this is that you can get creative to keep your utility costs low ie lots of blankets in the winter.I would not recommend OremProvo unless youre a student. Given your work location Id suggest either North Utah County Lehi or south Salt Lake Draper Bluffdale Herriman. Lots of tech workers moving to that location. if you want to walk to the neighborhood bar youre essentially stuck with SLC or a few complexes in the burbs all of which will be outside your price range.KSL is probably the best place to look.

I work to prevent further destruction of our watershed by opportunistic businessmen.First off thanks for realizing that making a difference starts with the choices we make on a daily basis. I find that type of self reflection and awareness refreshing. I wish more people had the fortitude. But I have to take issue with the notion that placing federal public lands under a special management designation as being construed as a land grab. The PUSA is well with in hisher rights as per multiple supreme court decisions to use the Antiquities Act of  as heshe chooses. These lands were relinquish by the state of Utah with the signing of the Enabling Act on July  . In  the state of Utah was offered the opportunity to take possession of federal land within its borders but refused ownership of them due to management costs.These lands are owned by the citizens of the United States so from my perspective the only land grab occurring is the state of Utah attempting to seize control of land that is now owned by all Americans. To me that is a land grab. Utah at present doesnt own the land in question but is actively trying to take it back form the federal government whom last time I checked is the collective will of the citizens of the United States of America and owned by themus and managed by the various federal land management agencies. In defense of GSENM and Clintons choosing to do it. It stopped what would have been the largest strip mine in the state of Utah from being built on the Kaiparowits plateau. I didnt particularly like Clinton but as a former Utahan and outdoor enthusiast Im glad he did it. His choice of methods could have been better but it was the right decision. Every year I come to Utah to visit family and I go to GSENM as do millions of other people and that adds a hefty amount of money to Utahs  billion outdoor recreation based economy.,Utah,d78kitd,1,t5_2qwed

There might be other places too but when we went most everything in town was closed.

11312949,0,t3_61ei38,Depends on what you are into.  If its outdoor stuff you are after Moab area including Arches National Park is your best bet for a lot of awesome stuff close together canyonlands goblin valley and arches are the best  If its history culture and pretty mountains SLC area is great.  If you want warm weather boating four wheeling and cool national parks then go to St. GeorgeZionsBryce Canyon.  And right in the middle is pretty cool too capitol reefescalante area.  Basically anywhere but the north is good!,Utah,dfeaznz,2,t5_2qwed
