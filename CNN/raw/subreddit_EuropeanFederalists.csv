1586122,0,t3_29bzds,I believe Europe needs to become an independent major power capable of acting on an equal footing to the US and soon China. Today there is far too much dependence on and influence by the US. The only way to get there is to have a federal state with a single military and leadership capable of coherent decision making and strategy rather than a patchwork of treaties and interests fighting with each other.,EuropeanFederalists,cjf3pbh,2,t5_2zff4

What Varoufakis is doing is like turning the above into a mockery of itself. The thing Varoufakis and Syriza do we ask for money gt I see so there is no altruism and solidarity from the european creditors gt THERE see everyone it is now proved that the EU is wrong you should admit it so that it will be fixed I mean this doesnt go anywhere other than Varoufakis validating his politial beliefs and then the conservative and isolationist politicians of other countries doing the same and also gaining appeal to their voters cause thw whole thing stopped being a structural problem but a whos to blame problem. Anyway I am being too vague here but I think that Varoufakis is more concerned about proving himself right than facilitating some type of change that will make europe a stronger in many ways union. ,EuropeanFederalists,cujqtvv,2,t5_2zff4
