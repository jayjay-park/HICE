8858306,0,t3_51kngl,Currently I play two games regularly.Advanced Tactics Gold the AI is moderately strong and capable of smart tactical moves cutting off encircling breakthrough etc. but strategically theres a lot to be desired. Advanced difficulty settings just add more units for the AI.Command Ops  the smartest nonscripted AI Ive encountered. Capable of basic AND advanced tactical maneuvers and manages his whole force adequately which is not an easy task if you remember CO and its engine. The AI is able to put together a basic coherent plan and implement it. Yes the plans tend to be basic but if you compare it to other wargame AIs on the market its more than enough. ,computerwargames,d7cn5ve,6,t5_2yh2r
