Or do you want to be able to move it from one side of the shop to the other?If youre making small things then a small anvil is easy to make mobile.,blacksmithing,cell0mw,1,t5_2r7um

2544949,0,t3_2ou7ax,The best place to start would be to decide on the type of things you want to forge. That will help put limits on the size of the forge the size and type of tongs and to a certain extent the size of anvil and hammer. This will also help identify what top tools you might need tools that fit in the top of the anvil. There are a number of great companies with websites that you browse for ideas. Centaur Pieh Kayne are just a few. One of these sites offers a starter kit that you can use to get an idea of where to start. There are also specialty shops like Chili Forge that focus on one thing. Find a YouTube backsmithing video related to what you want to make and grok the setup and tools. Absolutely get off the computer go to a demo and talk to group of local smiths. ,blacksmithing,cmqrf8k,1,t5_2r7um

3763034,0,t1_cqkz6jx,Here is a description of what a leg vise actually is and how it works compared to a bench vise. A bench vise is useful but not in the same way. You cant beat on a bench vise because of how its made. The force will be transmitted through the screw which will break. Leg vises are made with a pivot bolt which is easy to replace if it shears.,blacksmithing,cql7prw,2,t5_2r7um

7643247,0,t3_4jzpxr,rail especially if used is decently hard to begin with so you shouldnt need to harden it any for you to use it. as far as mounting goes ive found that pressure treated x and x makes for a pretty stout anvil stand. thats a quick example of how i build my anvil stands. x posts and a x spacer very scalable to whatever height or length you need. that example is  long and  tall i have  of these exact stands and they are great for small to medium size anvils.  bolts and some Lchannel and your rail anvil aint going anywhere. add chain as needed to deaden ring.,blacksmithing,d3azuuk,8,t5_2r7um

10207302,0,t3_5m5ftx,I was in the Navy. You will likely have more than ample opportunities to practice forging while in. Depending on your rate and where you get stationed bases tend to be geared towards giving us areas to indulge in our interests. There will likely be other blacksmiths on your base who have setup a group workspace. you just have to ask around. ,blacksmithing,dc11z44,5,t5_2r7um
10289261,0,t3_5n8sob,All linings are consumables.  With as much heat as is used nothing will last forever   I currently use lionel olivers recipe and it holds up well!  I use it for aluminum casting as well as for my forge lining.  its a mix of sand perlite fireclay and portland cement.  Yes portland is not ideal but if you let it really dry out welland break it in properly small fire first to dry it out then let it cool then a big fire let it cool then a fire with air you should be ok and it will last many years before you have to reline it.,blacksmithing,dcacdoc,1,t5_2r7um

11442188,0,t3_637gc2,One tip about hammers since youve never smithed before start with a ltlb hammer. You may be jacked and can dead lift lbs but your arms have never swung a hammer that way before. It will take some time for your hands wrists forearms elbows upper arms shoulders and back to get used to swinging a hammer and the jarring stop on the down swing. Once youve been practicing for a few months then move to a   pounder or so though that may be unnecessary as many smiths regularly use about a lber.    Also dont rest your thumb on the hammer. This will cause big problems with your forearms and thumb pretty soon. Grip it with your hand and thumb wrapped completely around.,blacksmithing,dfsymfk,3,t5_2r7um
