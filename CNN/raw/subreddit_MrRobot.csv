4132450,0,t1_crr4rqf,I think that sysadmins and engineers will watch this show and get hung up on the nitpicky stuff like in your comment.  What everyone needs to keep in mind is that this show is phycological thriller which happens to use technology as a medium.

4169287,0,t1_crvdfct,Everyone is responsible for their own actions. Advertising and marketing do not excuse your descisions. I think you greatly exaggerate their effects.Id love to see a source on most cognitive scientists saying advertising is overpowering our decision making abilities. Im sure you can find some fringe guys saying that but I highly doubt its well accepted. Advertisements are annoying not convincing or appealing. Look at how many people block ads online take a break during them from TV etc. Ads do not have the seductive appeal you seem to imply. Terms and conditions dont matter you simply need to look at what data you give to what parties and operate under trust no one as the default. It just doesnt seem like a very well thought out or remotely realistic philosophy to me. It used to during my teen years I used to agree with it greatly but when I had to make my own decisions... Well... It was gone. Its just too easy to choose your way out of the things you dont want in my experience at least. Some casual analysis is really all it takes.,MrRobot,crvi9bl,-2,t5_37dnc

4443288,0,t1_cspkpvb,Yeah I found it to be a big let down. The pilot seemed so much smarter. The speech about the s and s Mr Robots monologue was a big forehead slapping moment for me. No selfrespecting nerd would use that analogy the value of a bit is completely arbitrary and does not have the same connotation of magnitudequantity. It wasnt even technobabble it was just babblebabble.There also seems to be a fairly boring theme emerging the whole save the girl by hacking which is sort of insulting from a feminist perspective and patronizing from a techie perspective.In the pilot I liked the unreliable narrator aspect. I liked that it explored computer security without giving into the sensationalism of most hacker showsfilms. The scenes were just really well crafted. There was this moment when they were talking while riding the ferris wheel and in the background one of the carriages started rolling forward as if it were about to collide. It was subtle but it added an uneasiness to the scene. That kind of magic seemed missing from this episode. I hope it comes back.,MrRobot,csqrg50,4,t5_37dnc

4454582,0,t1_csrsugy,Sorry I worded my response really poorly. I meant it was entirely in his mind as in he is the sole leader and it is actually entirely his own plan that he executes. Yeah F Society is real just like Project Mayhem was real in Fight Club and also just like Fight Club Mr. Robot and Elliot are actually the same person.

4458863,0,t3_3c4o8h,I think your question actually has relevance to the main theme of the show. Corporalgovt control over the mind and perspective of people.We are taught and shown in media how bad drugs are. We have this perspective that drugs esp psychedelics alter your mind and perspective significantly in a negative way. This is NOT necessarily true and I think your confusion arises from your lack of understanding ofexperience with drugs.For example smoking weed does not necessarily alter your perception in the way that you meant. It provides a broaderdeeper understanding of your reality if anything by providing a curious mindset that we had long lost since childhood. Elliot is a dissident. He is above the propaganda and sees right through them. He clearly knows the effects of drugs he is using and it is his choice to use for whatever reason that he does. Drugs have always existed with humans hell weve evolved with weed and we have cannabanoid receptors in our central nervous system. The govt still has its infamously futile war against drugs still going on feeding on money from things like the huge number of druggies they catch and put into private prisons and the  prisoners free labour etc but thats another story.Its good that this show is challenging your views on drugs Im glad.,MrRobot,csspyer,1,t5_37dnc

4581688,0,t3_3dpgkj,This seems to be a very popular theory. Pretty much everyone watching is convinced that Mr Robot isnt real Ala Tyler Durden or the writers are intentionally making it seem that way to fuck with the viewers and take us down the wrong alley. I noticed something else upon rewatching the pilot. When he is talking to his psychiatrist about society before he ever finds the fsociety stuff he goes into a diatribe inside his head. All about how warped society is... Which culminates with him saying fuck society dubbed out for language.... F Society. Seems to be his sentiment... Makes sense that he named the organization. ,MrRobot,ct84hq7,1,t5_37dnc

The wife is the dominant one of the house which is eluded to during the dinner conversation when she says her husband was the one responsible for the decorating. Then she stands up for her hubby when Tyrell puts him down. When Tyrell busts in the door she does the natural thing and covers herself then when she realizes he could care less she does the same thing by returning to a more natural and less modest position. I dont think she was flashing him in a sexual way it felt like more like a coed locker room thing. ,MrRobot,cte8rug,14,t5_37dnc

The main difference is that the deletion method risks detection as realistically we are talking huge amounts of data that need to be shredded which would take time hours once started? Days?.  Theoretically the encrypted data can look perfectly normal as long as the rootkit is always decrypting everything silently in the background. If you successfully hide the fact you have encrypted everything in the background then once you are ready you can effectively destroy all of the data instantaneously by deleting the encryption key. ,MrRobot,cua6fdd,9,t5_37dnc

He encoded the upload in Evilcorps data same as he does with other peoples files in music.  Its hidden in the data. Steganography.  So Evilcorp may not even be aware its there. Or they are and theyre monitoring him so they can grab it when he decrypts it.The whole fsociety hack is Elliot trying to destroy that copy of his minds upload.

They didnt do it because they were worried about offending people or because its better for the show.

That is always good even if this is hypocritical case there are hundreds of people killed daily without being remembered or mentioned. Just think about what we have become when murders are a normal part of our everyday lives. When you see a murder on the news it has nothing to do with you. But when that same murder cancels your favorite show youll think about it and subconsciously do something. At least youll change yourself and few close friends through talking.

5037431,0,t3_3jfyr7,My thoughtsSo here we have a scene were Tyrell is snapping on his bumbeatinggloves... and the next scene is him in the arcade with Elliot giving him a run down well the conclusion of a run down on whats happening. spoilerWhy was that cut? Perhaps it was because of information we already knew and in an effort to not be redundant or waste precious time it was writtenedited for time lapse.My theory? Elliot killed Tyrell but my guess it was self defense. Tyrell obviously knew he was behind it all and he was pissed... Lady MacBeth was NOT havin none of dat you got fired shit. He needed to win back her respect Im going to go with respect and not affection because clearly these two are ladder climbing sociopaths. spoilerSo one of two things happened after Tyrell showed up . Elliot won him over with an explanation of the bigger picture or . my guess Elliot killed him and fabricated the scene with him in the arcade much like hed been doing with Mr. Robot did the deed ??? drove Tyrells car to the lot  and blacked out. spoiler,MrRobot,cut7a6j,2,t5_37dnc

You use a password list and use your targets username to send repeated login requests with the different passwords..

6262315,0,t1_cz0x3pi,gt An exit node is a peer who accesses the Internet beyond the network on request. This happens when you use Tor to browse the net for example.Not sure what your point is of course an exit node is involved when you use tor. Thats like saying wheels get used when you drive a car. Its inherent and irrelevant.gtIf however the server is protected by the Tor network it is called a hidden serviceSure but there was no hint in the show that a hidden service was being accessed. It was left ambiguous probably because thats beyond what viewers would understand or really need to know about to understand the story.gtIn this case an exit node is not applicable because the traffic never leaves the mesh network.Sure but timing attacks work on any point in the chain whether someone is on the first exit node the intermediary node or the last one before the hidden service.

Could it be like Brooklyn or Queens? If you are asking about character it doesnt seem like he talks to her very much or has told her anything. My partner said it is like he has put himself in jail even his bedroom door slides like a cell door and the curtains make a bar pattern on the window and she seems like a guard. Even meeting Gideon felt like they were in a visitors room. He is home a couple of times a day to clean up but otherwise he stays out for most of the day so I guess eating out for every meal makes sense.

So if the person didnt want to be recorded theyd go around the area. Avoids legal issues and it makes people not get mad. People mostly get mad about being filmed because they didnt know you were going to film them. They dont want it sprung on them thats what makes people mad.

Saw that right away when everyone was around the table and sure enough there were twelve other people besides Eliot at the table. So I guess we are the Holy Spirit? Wow. Wasnt expecting much from the plot but then they sucker punch us right at the end. Unfuckingbelievable. When they played Basket Case by Green Day in that lullaby tune holy shit. Huge GD fan so that got me real happy. The song definitely fits in with Eliot too. The beginning was so cool. Loved how they teased us on who was at the door. Im convinced that Eliot is in a Mental Institute or something of that nature. Finally got to see White Rose and Cisco back. And BILL? I thought Ray was such a cool guy then saw the paper he gave eliot say TOR on it and knew something was fishy. He seemed like such a cool guy and was becoming one of my favorite characters.

I was more confused on Angela saying something along the lines of how shes the missing part in the settlement document?Its a somewhat unused motif in some stories where you hand off papers to paid people to read it for you  But they wont care about a personal issue that you would catch only if you had read it yourself.This lawyer is special in that she is the only one that returned Anglias phone calls.  Even though she does not like what Angela has done  taking a job at Evil Corp  she does a honest job with her law practice and implied is that other lawyers are not honest.Angelia took the papers home and read them her self and she discovered that the thirdparty inspections were the issue that Evil Corp wanted to win at all cost.

Ok that hes playing with himself so maybe inside his head he wants to draw but it could have been made in a more senseful way than a forced stalmate when  of the moves give you the opportunity to take the opponents piece like queen for a pawn for instance and then draw. I just didnt like it....

But if you look at it all from a creative standpoint from the point of a writerdirector theres just totally no way they would just gloss over Elliots mother. Theyre missing huge dramatic tension between the mother and Darlene. It is impossible in my mind that even a single MOMENT of them interacting whether its a glance or an offhand comment anything other than what they did. The mother wasnt in a single shot except for out of focus and silent with Darlene or mentioned the entire episode.

Then again if Whiterose and her partner were worried about surveillance from the Chinese government speaking in just a different Chinese dialect wouldnt really help... Anyways it would be really disappointing if this just ends up being a thing that Esmail just didnt care about.,MrRobot,d61742y,10,t5_37dnc

8497237,0,t3_4w3j4a,I dont remember it being explained explicitly in the show but I have a few thoughts about it which I typed out below.  Otherwise I think we have to wait for it to be explained by the show.  Gideon probably pointed the FBI in Tyrells direction.  Gideon informed Tyrell about the honeypot in his meeting with Tyrell at E Corp.  Then when it is removed and Gideon finds out he is told that he Gideon asked for it to be removed was actually Elliot via email of course and that Tyrell asked that it remain removed.   The Sharon Knowles murder plus the honeypot situation sound like retaliation against E Corp and Scott Knowles for not securing the CTO position so theres possible motive to link Tyrell to the hack. His sudden disappearance around the day of the hack in light of the two points above makes things more suspicious.  The FBI would be foolish not to consider him a person of interest at least. Given his somewhat high ranking position in E Corp it makes more sense that hed be the ringleader versus just a pawn in the hack.  Hed have more resources for example.  Of course we viewers know thats not the case here but I think thats how most people think when it comes to people in power caught in scandals. Now this is less certain but just one last thought I had.  Based on his work history we know hed have the knowledge to at least coordinate a hack.  And given the coordinated nature of the attack it makes sense for the FBI to link it to someone on the inside like someone who worked at E Corp and knows Allsafe or vice versa.  I think it makes more sense for the pressure to be on someone from Allsafe who worked on E Corps account but given everything else about Tyrell its hard to dismiss him as a potential suspect.,MrRobot,d63pf5x,8,t5_37dnc

And human brains arent all equal at all ages and in all individuals. And so far Elliots biggest actions seem motivated by things that are superintelligent aboverational love compassion concern for the  Matthew  kind of ideals.

I will throw out a wild guess though I think she has been in communication with Tyrell and he told her that Elliot must be protected and his identity must be kept secret. So for instance the parking lot attendent knew that Elliot was in Tyrells car. Well Tyrell is the most wanted man on the planet right now so if the parking lot guy told the FBI that Elliot was in that car Elliot would have the FBI after him. ,MrRobot,d64v5kp,4,t5_37dnc

8532852,0,t1_d685jji,Dude I said from the beginning that I dont Know anything. So your claim that my comments come across that way too...no duh.You could be right that it doesnt have to do with exotichypothetical physics but I made arguments about why I thought this could be different. They could be wrong. Time will tell.You say you think everything on the show is realistic I would suggest a great deal of the proceedings have been surreal and out of joint. All of it remains connected to the universe that we inhabit but we are clearly watching a different show if you think this has been mostly traditional linear storytelling.Your argument that it would be a copout and eliminate the need to bother with continuity is a straw person. When you watch a David Lynch movie there is continuity and an underlying logic and rules to how the characters experience time in different ways. You can be meticulous about how you deal with whatever reality you create.Game of Thrones for instance engaged in the creation of explicit and complex time paradox in Season  without unhinging the rest of the logic of the show as did a less meticulously logical show The Flash. You can be meticulous and careful in the creation of the inside of any universe. In fact the author I used to support the logic of counterfactuals as a possible vehicle for whiterose David Lewis based his book on a very developed theory for how best to explore counterfactual logic known as trying to create the nearest possible world to the factual one.Also while you are not involved in the production of the show I did at least Tweet back and forth with Sam Esmail about this topic. Rumor has it he is actually involved in the show  if you look on my Twitter profile you will see that the pinned tweet is from Sam Esmail.I mean Melancholia Inception Memento Mulholland Drive  Monkeys and many other television shows and movies have all retained mostly meticulous underlying logic while playing with exactly these kinds of themes. The vast majority of David Lynch movies have feet in multiple universes. I agree it would be bad if it ended up looking like Fringe so disappointing but I have a bit more faith in Esmail than that.There is also a pretty strong argument that how people with mental illness experience the world operates like living in multiple worlds. The linkage between Elliot Ray Whiterose and potentially others seems based in exactly this kind of dialectic about which Ray gave a huge soliloquy about only a few episodes ago  I think it was in Kernal Panic.At the same time I did not bring this up because of some macho confidence that I was right. I brought it up because it is fun to take the information we are given on the show and play with the ideas. I am sure I will continue to enjoy the show if it ends up being entirely linear and will also enjoy it if it becomes more adventurous. I like the idea the experiencing art always involves an element of coproduction. I like that we all experience similar things in different ways.Words have multiple meanings people interpret the exact same information differently the center cannot hold entropy is the way of things.Might as well have fun fiddling along with Phillip Price and Zhang while Rome Burns ,MrRobot,d6866hw,1,t5_37dnc

8575398,0,t1_d6czoez,Mr. Zhang is refusing to talk to Price Dom survives the attack and the FBI are battening down the hatches hinting at some serious international incident potential. The  hack has turned the public against evil Corp who doesnt seem phased by it very much unless the government bailout fails. Small businesses are failing despite adapting to both bitcoin and Ecoin whatever that is. Darlenes abusive childhood was suggested during the dream sequence. Mr Robot is concerned about self preservation and he andor Elliot are suspicious of Angela and her new job a reaction we havent seen yet from himthem. Angela is willing to work with the guy who turned her life upside down and has nudes of her for the sake of her own protection the only reason shes committing this hack at all. Ray has the connections to not only beat the shit out of his contractors but to get doctors to fix them up no questions asked as he wasnt in a real hospital at all.

8576149,0,t1_d6dldrz,Yeah I agree and that is another example of our weird dysfunctional trade relationship with China.  I think with White Rose tip toeing the line on whether he is more on the DA side seems evident but not confirmed  or Chinese Minister of what not seems more of a title for him to manipulate from the inside my guess is Chinas ideas are aligned with the DA since the DA is essentially running China. Just like you said the governments are on the outside looking in while the main hacker groupsEcorp are on the playing field. This is the illusion that the world sees but as the audience in this show we get a little peek behind the curtains and from that I deduced my theory. When I was talking more specifically about the states having power here I was more or less explaining the real life environment that this could be modeled after. Along with this if we were hypothetically in this exact situation in the real world it would be very plausible for this sort of thing to occur. But you are certainly right the substates are controlling the actual happenings while the states simply pretend to and create the illusion of control to the masses,MrRobot,d6dlo6t,7,t5_37dnc

No It would get you booked with notice to appear for court date. Not serious enough to be in prison. Although with Esmail crappy writing it is probably this.. Violation of parole. No. Elliot complete his court order anger management for destroying the servers at his last job. She even has him sign the form.. Arrested for prison hack and freeing all the criminal. Serious charges but would still need court date. Could be held with high bond that he refuses to pay. so could be in prison. But again serious charges that would mean long time and WR would have trouble freeing him.. He hacked backed into the prison database and listed himself as a low level criminal that escaped when he freed Vera.This would be the most likely IRL.,MrRobot,d6tzelx,6,t5_37dnc

8757580,0,t1_d707ycm,One thing I agree with is how difficult it is to have a discussion about something when theres no baseline level of understanding no definition of terms and no decent wiki or db to reference. rgameofthrones spoiled me.gt Its tough to advance a debate when people cant agree that lines of dialog are double entendres or that motifs are being used to illuminate future events or that letters in signage are being intentionally obscured...I agree with the part Ive put in bold but the second part weakens that very strong point by making it too specific to your situationinterpretation. I read all your posts about the signage and the letters being obscured and I get what you are saying but this isnt one of your strongest theories. The main reason I have that you maybe havent heard before is on location shoots and camera lenses. Could the production teams at Mr. Robot construct a scene with as much purpose as you theorize online? Absolutely. But is that particular scene an example of them doing so? Absolutely not. If it were the hidden message would be more meaningful it would have to be to merit the extra interdepartmental work put in by the crew to pull off the visuals in D space. And to attempt that kind of shot on a real city street with real sidewalks trees storefronts on a cable tv schedule would be almost impossible. Its like step one everyone agrees that there are letters on the signs. Step two everyone agrees what those letters are. Step three the letters and the words they make are identified. Step four the words and letters are reviewed are interpreted. Step five the interpretations are interpreted. Step six theories are born. I feel like we should be able to at least agree to steps  as a group... Thats wiki stuff. But theres no way to move past those little details meaningfully without addressing them first. Maybe we need more names of theories. And people like you who have theories to  carefully name them and  admit that a theory is just a theory until it is proven  acknowledge that we as viewers have no say in what the show actually confirms or chooses to prove.,MrRobot,d70cuar,2,t5_37dnc

The drug use the swearing the characters being a general representation of many facets of life... its real.Elliot being gay just isnt his character and it would have never worked.

And only at the end of the episode well see Elliot and Tyrell back together while DA and Philip Price will unveil their phase  plans pretty sure they are no more allies Price got pretty pissed about Whiterose this season.,MrRobot,d73wtq8,1,t5_37dnc

8802885,0,t3_50pmaw,Ive been racking my brain on this one too and coming up with nothing.I just dont buy into Tyrelliot either. Its not just like a side story with Ray. Whole scenes that are very integral to the main plot would have to be all in Elliots head. Gideon talking to Tyrell in his office about the honeypot would be absolutely ridiculous if it was all in Elliots mind because it causes the scene where Gideon goes back to E Corp and talks to Tyrells secretary. Elliot is imagining a scene where neither he nor Tyrell is present caused by an imaginary meeting with not just a personality of Elliot but someone who is literally a different person?! It just doesnt work unless either Elliot is a shape shifting alien or they are meshing together different stories making for a seriously sloppy plot that doesnt even need to fit together.    ,MrRobot,d75zjsg,3,t5_37dnc

8876379,0,t3_51ts4x,Hmm. I think that Elliot will find Tyrell but hell be hurt somehow. Or maybe it wont be Tyrell at all just someone trying to lure in Elliot why? As for Angela I think that shes going to be taken to some Dark Army dungeonprisonholding area. I seriously doubt the people who saw her at the end were FBI people since the FBI already has scaled back and restricted their antiF Society efforts. In this case Elliot will have to negotiate with the Dark Army people to free Angela. As for Darlene and Cisco I think they will corner and trap Dom since she is the only FBI character seriously working to bring down F Society. Im not really sure what will happen with the other characters. Well see.,MrRobot,d7etdf3,1,t5_37dnc

8883856,0,t3_51whmn,I say the show has been ultrarealistic and I prefer it to remain that way and IMHO am fairly confident it will not go on a scifi path.  Esmail has said as much in interviews and the attention to detail and the care to realistically put the show in a certain place and time in history all point to this being a psychological geopolitical thriller in nature with real world hacking and technology as a tool being exploited by the antagonists.A third option I had wondered Esmail may be going towards is some sort of conspiracy theory laden show.  We see some people speculating about directions on sub with very heavy illuminati  truther type flavored ideas.  And there is a type of conspiracy on the show of the  of the  of the plutocrats who have tremendous power and are secretly influencing events.  But this type of conspiracy is in my mind a very realistic kind.  For example if interested look up interlocking directorates like this article in New Scientist discusses This show is exploring some of the ideas that Thomas Piketty has put forward in his Capital in the TwentyFirst Century the thesis of which  in a nutshell is that when the rate of return of capital e.g. investment or rent seeking is greater than economic growth the result is the concentration of wealth.  We are living in a world where wealth and power has been almost unprecedentedly concentrated and the results of this may not be very healthy to live through.  I think the show is doing a masterful job of portraying some of the potential downsides of this situation.,MrRobot,d7fppgc,2,t5_37dnc

When Darlene rereads the transcript of Xuns conversations and then when Cisco does the same thing at the hospital at the end you can read this you may check  its accurateXunHe brought himWhoElliot You met himWhat did he sayHe wants to know the content of stage That doesnt make senseStage  is his planHas he asked about the othersHis friend ... the man and the womanNoTHE MAN AND THE WOMAN!!! I wonder who they are? Is he talking about the people Angela saw on the subway? Im starting to believe the theory that Mr. Robot planned this whole thing to protect Elliots friends and these guys are taking Angela to the same place where Mobley and Trenton are hidden. Maybe even Tyrell. The only thing thats bugging me about this theory is that Dark Army would probably want to kill Angela as well since she now has the info that can shut down the plant and WhiteRose clearly does not want this to happen.Or maybe theyre talking about Tyrell his friend and Mobley and Trenton the man and the woman. It sounds more plausible.,MrRobot,d7gq8br,6,t5_37dnc

8894465,0,t3_521s4v,Elliot being Tyrell is probably one of the most popular theories running around the world. However its full of holes.If Elliot is Tyrell why is Joanna asking him to find himself? lolIf Elliot is Tyrell why did he get released early after being sent to jail?Esmail is gonna have a tough time coming with that twist. I think he should mix both theories. Tyrell is both real  Obama talks about him Dom is looking for him Joanna talks about him and so on. So he exists  and a new alter  Tyrell becomes one after his death .So Tyrell was a real person  like Elliots father  and now that hes probably dead hes a new alter. It wasnt Mr Robot who killed Tyrell. It was Elliot  fully aware of his actions  who did it. Mr Robot is trying to block these facts though. He wants Elliot to think Mr Robot is in control but thats not the case.So we can have a triple twist. Tyrell appears and we all start screaming  I told you so hes real hes alive!!!  only to be surprised with the fact that hes actually dead  but hes the one narrating what happened . Then its revealed that once he got killed he turned into another alter but the new alter has been blocked by Mr Robot whos afraid of losing control.The closing scene will be Elliot Mr Robot and Tyrell together. I think that would be the best. Tyrell can be both a real character and a new alter. ,MrRobot,d7gzkn6,7,t5_37dnc

8967681,0,t1_d7pqn1n,I dont think Elliot deliberately did it as a yo thanks for the betrayal but it doesnt matter cause youre about to be scooped by the Dark Army good luck bitch but I think Angelas always been a soft spot for Elliot. Mr Robot never shows up during their interactions really despite how shes basically dropping that bomb that would undoubtedly turn suspicion towards all of them regardless of whether or not she kept their names out of it. Elliot more than anyone else knows how much of a rabbit hole this is but I think he knows trying to reason with her is futile which is why he instead settles with I never wanted to involve you. It does beg the question of how much Elliot knows about what DAs been doing yet. The problem is things that may or may not have been discussed off screen. Angela never does explicitly tell him at least in person that she went to the EPA with the plant files. While we assume but dont know for sure unless I missed something that Elliot knows about the mysterious death of Romero and disappearances of MobleyTrenton since hes met back up with Darlene. Would his reaction have been different if Angela told her about his EPA visit? Who knows. While Whiterose obviously has a lot of interest in the plant I have a hard time believing that the Elliot half of Elliot would have been as complicit with the DA in that regard since its essentially saving what killed his dad yet Mr Robot may have more insight into WRs intentions. Then again this is the same Elliot that doesnt remember stage .That got a little convoluted but in a simpler vein of thought I think it was more of a nod back to one of her earlier lines of if Im losing let me lose. Plus an overall acknowledgment that even if they both survived things would never be the same. He even acknowledged that she was right in this weeks episode. If he didnt think the DA would step in maybe he also saw Angelas FBI compliance as a protective measure sort of like when he turned himself in for hacking Kristas boyfriend. I just dont think he was worried for himself because hed seen the power Whiterose and the DA have and now know that they need him so it was more or less a good luck and goodbye to his close friend.Thats all I got haha but Im happy to theorize all day.,MrRobot,d7ps2yu,2,t5_37dnc

8976495,0,t1_d7qrljv,I will agree with you that I have faith in the writers and thing we are in good hands. And I think in the end I just want to take the ride.All that said I think even the unreliable narrator was done in a Realistic way. I am one of the folks that is nervous about this going to scifi. Cant change that feeling just by saying dont worry about it.  Part of what makes me how it stays real world is because of how much respect I have for Esmails writing. I think its MUCH harder to surprise an audience when everything is grounded in reality. I do like the unreliable narrator troupe and dont consider it scifi because ppl really do lie or have mental illness in the real world. Its a real world way of manipulating the audiences idea of what will happen... Introducing something that is scifi or at least scifi by todays technology standards is almost like a cheat. It allows you to explain things that happened in a magical way... It might be a fun idea to image if... but its not as cool from a writing perspective because you only tricked the audiences expectation by introducing something that could bypass reality as we know it... On the other hand surprising an audience with things that are totally realistic is much harder IMO. Its like the Elliots Mr. Robot vs Darlenes the sister from last season... These were reality based surprises and we all kind of knew the elliot is Mr. Robot one at the beginning since Esmail and the writers designed the narration specifically so we would suspect that... which is why I also think they were able to hid the Darlene one and surprise us. That was a very good twist and if you looked back everything matched up. But once you introduce something that cant really happen in the real world its immediately less interesting because you have an advantage over the audience that you can just make stuff up to explain things away. I think Esmail likes surprise us with reality. Im babbling... All Im saying is I think it would be much harder for Esmail to create a satisfying realworld explanation for all this that still takes in account all the little details hes showed us than it would be to just say Oh yeah and Whiterose can time travel or program human minds. To me surprising me with a real world OMG! would be much more craftful than the its science magic that we still havent really discovered yet. Its my belief in Esmail as a writer that makes me think hed might take on the harder challenge.All that said I love scifi... if it is that... Ill keep watching.,MrRobot,d7qu775,4,t5_37dnc
8976797,0,t3_537spd,Thats my favorite theory. The lucid dreaming thing was all weird and not really easy to understand I think Elliot still dreaming seems like a better direction than both thats jut really Tyrell or that its actually Mr Robotthough it could be him acting as Tyrell just in the sense of showing what Tyrell did on the  days? anyway,MrRobot,d7qvi4v,1,t5_37dnc

8980364,0,t1_d7rasmr,We dont know anything to that affect and it wouldnt be the first time that Elliot tells us something that isnt true  its called an unreliable narrator and its employed constantly throughout the series. Lucid dreams do not start lucid. It is generally accepted that an accomplished Lucid Dreamer has a normal dream and subconsciously conjures the thing that makes them realize theyre dreaming and then they become Lucid. It is entirely possible that it was just a regular not Lucid dream of Elliots because hes been asleep since the episode started. He literally comes to after the Angela sequence repeating his mantra. ,MrRobot,d7rawq2,1,t5_37dnc

8992817,0,t1_d7sryoq,Uh yeah it is relatively unknown. Heres the ratings chart for the last weekHere it as a spreadsheet filtered to show only shows on PM in that slot At  viewers Mr. Robot is only above two other shows Legends on Comedy Central and Catfish The TV Show MTV. It had fewer viewers than reruns of Full House on NickAtNite. By comparison House Hunters and House Hunters International  reality shows on the Home and Garden Network both had about  viewers.If you dont think ratings are everything which they kind of are if you are financing the show then we can look at internet votes. Mr Robot has  votes on IMDB which admittedly is more than Better Call Saul at . House of Cards which requires a Netflix subscription has  votes. To be fair Mr. Robot has more IMDB votes than the other shows in its categories except HoC. But when I say relatively unknown I mean relative to shows such as Mad Men .M viewers and Breaking Bad .M viewers nevermind the HBO shows or Walking Dead. Mr. Robots ratings are significantly lower than they were in season  in which USA renewed the show after the series premiere .M. Thats why it was not at all certain that it would get a third seasonYes I agree that its a critical darling. But my point was that its a surprise that it got an Emmy. Because being a critical darling alone doesnt always translate into awards. Or otherwise The Wire would have gotten more than zero Emmys.,MrRobot,d7ssq0n,2,t5_37dnc

8994173,0,t1_d7stfnn,There are concepts relevant to the show though. a virtual machine cannot in theory access its parent operating system. It is fully dependent on the parent and can be lied to about the hardware. it cant access the parents memory. If it is compromised or corrupted it cant influence its parent. the layer of indirection decreases the efficiency of running code in the virtual machine.In contrast I run Linux on a separate partition from my Windows install. From Linux I can accessdestroychange any information on the Windows partition. By booting into Linux I completely invalidate the Windows security of a usernamepassword assuming I havent manually set up any encryption. I can do the same thing from Windows to Linux although its a bit more annoying since you need to install some tool that understands ext. And both partitions have standard performance and direct access to hardware.So nested virtual machines are a lot like the Allegory of the Cave and the nested dream concept explored in The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie and Inception.,MrRobot,d7syksu,6,t5_37dnc

9028836,0,t1_d7x24ix,We do have to remember that Leon is dark army. Im honestly assuming either hes asking for the time because he was told to execute them at a specific time or to do a similar kidnapping type venture to cause a massive change of heart like had happened to Angela. What changed her mind though? I feel like that has a lot more to do with what will happen in Season . For it to have changed her mind from being completely guilt ridden it must have been really serious.The time thing is a cute novelty for the subreddit but were talking Dark Army and someone whos in connection with White Rose. Assuming Leon was sent to meet with them as per direct orders from White Rose the timing of whatever it is he does or says to them will be important.

One interesting point about Angela and the deterioration of the relationship with her father is a deleted scene from season  that is available on Amazon the deleted scenes are available for free.  I was puzzled in S when Angela comes back to her Dads house the night when Terry Colby is there and her Dad looks pissed.  I knew Mr. Moss would be no fan of Terry Colbys but the deleted scene showed the conversation where Angela tells her Dad that she made a deal to testify for Colby to get him to testify in the Washington Township case and her Dad was mad as hell at her.  I wish that scene had not been deleted because it gave more depth to that whole situation and it set up her Dads coldness to her in the store where he worked in S.  The whole scene at the bar where the neighborfriend of her Dad starts out talking with Angela in a familiar totally friendly manner right before he does a  completely cuts her down did make me wonder for a moment if everyone from their neighborhood had split personalities!,MrRobot,d839z74,1,t5_37dnc

9335256,0,t3_58c78e,While you cant be certain I would say that yes Elliot and Mr Robot are two people in one body. In s Elliot figured that out and in s he tries to get back in control of his own body. He follows a strict daily routine and writes a journal to archieve this but he finds out that Mr Robot still acted when he Elliot was asleep. So he tries to stay awake during his sleep. This also is referred to as lucid dreaming. You will find numerous ways to do it on google. One way is called WILD. Elliot uses this technique repeating his mantra mind awake body asleep. Normally this is used to become aware in your dreams. Here Elliot uses it as a way to maybe become aware while Mr Robot is in control.He succeeds and gets to be the silent observer while Mr Robot is in control a role that previously was Mr Robots.As to when Mr Robot speaks and when its Elliot you can normally tell by the manners. If you have a specific scene in mind I can give you my opinion on it but as I said nothing is  certain.,MrRobot,d8zb8ob,3,t5_37dnc

9401176,1,t3_59dmwm,I agree with you about Ray. I think Esmail went down a path that looked good to start with and then something happened. There must have been a strong reaction from somewhere presumably USA Network about the possible negative reactions to Midland City being used to progress the plot later on and Esmail was forced to dump the whole Ray gambit. But season  makes no sense unless the gambit is real and an integral part of the plot. It cannot just be locked in a closet like it never happened.Sure Midland City is reprehensible but Mr Robot is a story of a lot of people all doing reprehensible things specially to children so maybe it should have been allowed to follow through  and the moral quagmire left to the audience to mull over. As it stands Rays arrest by the FBI and their failure to secure the safety of Elliot the key witness makes a mockery of the whole show.  One more stupid stunt like that and I am done with Mr Robot.China did not have to give the money  it was part of whterses plan to take total control of E Corp. The loan is interest free so E Corp cannot default on the interest payments but could default on the balance sheet like if the E Corp building is destroyed. China could then take over E Corp. Remember that we only have whterses word for it that the backup tapes in the China sites were destroyed. The FBI never got to verify that. We can assume that China has intact backup data of E Corp and once China takes over E Corp all the files will be restored.Once this threat is realized by the Feds they will want Trenton to try her scheme to decrypt E Corps operational files. But whterse has already sent Leon to take Mobley and Trenton offline and out of sight of the Feds.whterse threatened to kill Price which is why Price retaliated so strongly. Price revealed that he could be feral in ways even whterse could not plan for. whtrse knows he cannot risk Price going feral so he will have Price killed in the building collapse but that is  months away so probably before that.whterses ultimate goal is to regain complete control of the WTP which he lost in . The Dark Army attacked the FBI primarily because noone was supposed to say anything about the Dark Army. Santiago was not going to say Dark Army because he knew not to say it. But he failed to tell Dom not to say it. The US has a Dark Army and so does China but both Dark Armies are top secret and any mention of them results in death. This implies that Santiago is CIA. The big question is why has Dom not been killed twice over ? Dom has to be part of the experiment or she would be dead by now. This explains her feelings of emptiness. This also explains why the US did not retaliate. If the FBI had got to the backup sites they would have been shown a heap of trashed tapes even though the real backups are still intact. So the FBI was not attacked to prevent the inspection.Not sure what you mean by Darlenes forgiveness of Cisco.Angela has multiple personalities most likely including her mother who may have even had a thing for Edward. Because this is Elliots story we do not see Angelas alters as different people. We can assume that Elliot knows because Elliot knows Angela knows about himself. However Angela does not see her alters as separate bodies. Angela is not psychotic in the sense that Elliot is. Elliots psychotic awareness of Mr Robot is the failed part of the experiment that Elliot mentions. ,MrRobot,d97ny2c,-2,t5_37dnc

People like Soros are the real enemy. They get away with what they do because people like you and me have been mostly unaware of them. Trump wants to be as powerful as Soros so does Hillary. Putin is influencing Trump in the same way Soros and Kissinger influence Hillary. The enemy is influence from indifferent organizations and powers. Bernie fights against that even though hes a politician... Because hes not a corporate puppet... Youve bought in to a bullshit idea that politicians are destined to act the way they currently do but they act how they do because weve accepted it as normal. It is not normal.

9643704,0,t1_da1pszl,Sorry that you have not enjoyed the previous recaps I have worked pretty hard on them since well before S. In particular the post discussing Matt Zoller Seitz was very popular. We dont really see Elliot prime partially because he is the combination of all of the fragmented parts. In a sense the clearest you got to seeing him was the glitch moments which arguably happened inside lucid dreams when both Elliot and Mr. Robot were present during times when Elliot  often dissociates.But he is clearly there. We see him in the planning that has been done the organization that was created and the linkages between powerplayers that Elliot chooses to remain out of the loop on. Probably the best example that he exists is when Darlene talks about an Elliot we rarely see almost with total Awe.  The real conflict in the series may seem to be between Elliot and Mr. Robot but it is really all about accepting who HE is and what HE has done IMHO. As always I could be wrong!Thanks for the comment! ,MrRobot,da1saj2,2,t5_37dnc

Do you think harnessed nuclear power is part of the next phase that White RoseElliott had in mind? Leading to the end of the next season would be the accidental or otherwise release of the energy ultimately causing radioactive holocaust. You mentioning the circular nature of this timeline would mean the outcome is that this leads to the death of Angela  Elliotts parents.

10370793,0,t1_dcj8gc0,Yes it was a podcast of The Watch where Sam Esmail was interviewed you can find it at I had to look up the term telegraphing as it relates to TVfilm and it means to reveal something directly to the audience.  Two good examples I can think of are the movies  THE SIXTH SENSE where we are told from the beginning of the film that the young boy sees dead people to the film NO WAY OUT in which the idea of a Soviet sleeper agent high up in the govtmilitary is offered up as a diversion to take attention away from the senator who actually committed the murder for which this Soviet sleeper agent is being blamed....and then it turns out the Soviet sleeper agent story is totally true.  This is literally the only basis that I have for Tyrell as the leader of fsocietythe  hack along with him being in Elliots drug dream holding the key.  I think there is more than one identity to Tyrell because it is clear that someone at evilcorp is helping ElliotfsocietyDA yet Tyrell seems genuinely surprised when Gideon mentions the honeypot just like Elliot is surprised by the mention of his plan stage .  Yet right after Gideon tells Tyrell about the honeypot which occurs earlier in the timeline than we are initially led to believe who finds out about it?  BD Wongs character and WR who may be the same person or one of whom may be Elliot.  The CD hack that Cisco manipulates OllieAngela into comes after that as a way to keep tabs on the honeypot.,MrRobot,dcjlar4,1,t5_37dnc

10841661,0,t1_ddy3s57,Angela and Ollies season one apartment has cresent moon photo prints on the wall. The moon goes through phases of waxing full waning and new. F Societys and Tyrells plans are set in phases. Crescent Realty is an anagram for trance secretly. Elliot doesnt know all the phases of the plan because when he enters another state of consciousness he cant remember. Its secret to him so he is unenlightened and thus inthedark as opposed to Mr. Robot who is the enlightened yet nonexistant father figure as per the shows Christian imagery The four stars are a blatant reference to Andy Warhols film Four Stars which uses imagery that is dense wearying and beautiful but ultimately hard to decipher for Warhol directed that two reels be screened simultaneously on top of each other on a single screen rather than sidebyside. wikipedia which tells us that we are right to look for two meanings to everything in the show. Elliot used steganography to hide the data of his hack on Michael Hansen on the CD he labelled Pink Floyd Wish You Were Here. Mr. Robot the image of his father that he misses promised him Im here to listen. Always will be Pink Floyds most famous album is Dark Side Of The Moon.  The Cresent Reality logo is an oval or rather an elliptical shape the shape of a comets path around a celestial body. When space debris contacts the earths atmosphere it burns up. Elliot overheats when he and Mr. Robot try to exist at the same time. Comet is a  film about space debris falling over a major city and parallel realities and its directed by... Sam Esmail.

11089344,0,t3_5ybsoz,Thanks for posting on this as its something Ive been chewing over for some time yet havent found the proper forum on which to elucidate my meanderings shitpost... until now.Personally I hope Darlene doesnt flip and I think it highly unlikely that she would however that may just be the wishful thinking on my part.  For Darlene to flip over to Team FBI it would require her to thoroughly abandon her idealism and sense of justice and it would require that she knowingly become a narc a sellout a whore essentially become no better than any other part of the machineEvil Corp or otherwise.  Not only would she place Elliot in immediate danger which I dont see happening she would also run the risk of potentially exposing herself to murder charges for Susan Madame Executioner Jacobs.  Keep in mind that besides Darlene were the only ones who know how Susan Jacobs diedDarlene flatout murdered the bitch.  Additionally it was solely Darlenes instigation that got Evil Corp and Scott Knowles to publicly burn the .M as Elliot was in lockup so shes no follower this shits in her blood her DNA.  Regardless of the huge shift in Darlenes values that would be required to do this it would be a monstrous disruption to the story line I feel.  No too much of Darlenes identity is tied up in her idealism rebelliousness and desire for justice for her to flip.From Darlenes perspective as she views the FBIs board she sees Tyrell Wellick as the center of fsociety whereas she knows little to nothing of Tyrell and any involvement he may have.  I have to remind myself to try to view the FBI board through Darlenes eyesnot my eyesbecause we all see things from very different perspectives based on us having different information.  And at the same time I need to also view the board through Dominiques eyes knowing that we know different things too.  After all theres nowhere on the FBI board where WhiteRose is mentioned so the FBI at this stage is completely out of the loop in that regard. Lastly this whole dynamic between Darlene and Dominique is quite interesting and I think open for some intense exploration between the two characters.  After all theyre both Jersey Girls right?  And as Dominique told her By the end of this day you and I are gonna be best friends.  Everyones focused on whether or not Darlene will flip because thats what happens with law enforcement whereas personally Im very curious to see if DarleneWhiteRoseAngelaElliotTyrellMr. Robot will flip Dominique to fsocietythats where I think this is going.  There is plenty of meat to this argument.  Dominique if anything has much more in common with disgruntled hacker culture than she does with the FBI and its rigid square whiteman cop culture.  Shes an insomniac shes unconventional shes masturbating to IRC hookups shes asking Alexa when the end of the world is and theres a consistent thread of dissatisfaction throughout her life which seemingly is left quite unfulfilled by the FBI which is the only thing in her life.  As she said ... the only reason I think Ive gotten this far in the  case is because I have no life.  Remember how she walked out on her fianc when he proposed to her at a restaurant?  Plus shes a woman in a very very male dominated bureaucracy.  Add all this up and shes not so solid as she appears IMHO.  Additionally Dominique is motivated by justice too.  As she told Minister Zhang I am disgusted by the selfish brutality of the world but at the same time Im utterly fascinated by it.  If somebody presents fsocietys case to her in a way that she can idealistically grok and embrace I dont see it as a hard sale to flip Dominique to fsociety at all.  Just imagine fsociety with an FBI agent on board...But hey its late and that could all just be the gold spray paint talkin...,MrRobot,deoyu8s,23,t5_37dnc

11347929,0,t1_dfi1o3a,Yes this is confirmed. Theres a couple possible reasons for the delay. One this delay means the show wont start airing till October in the Fall which was announced along with the April shoot start date. This might be because USA Network felt that Mr. Robot was worthy of being moved to being on the Fall tv show schedule. Fall shows generally are taken more seriously and are watched more than shows that air in the Summer. Another reason for the delay might be that Sam Esmail wanted more time for preproduction like writing the scripts and making sure it was just right. Another reason might be that Rami Malek or some of the other cast had other movies or tv shows that they werent done filming yet and needed a little extra time for all the actors to be available for Mr. Robot. Rami Malek is playing Freddie Mercury in the Queen movie and that has been filming for the last couple months. The latter reason is the most likely one because that movie started shooting early  and is probably just now wrapping up or already wrapped earlier this month. Which explains why Mr. Robot didnt already start shooting back in like February or early March like they did for season  and .,MrRobot,dfi9mmr,4,t5_37dnc

11465219,0,t1_dfvel2g,Im not sure there is a fulfilling answer to this. It could be that the data recordings are skewedcorrupted and the book is a more accurate version of what was really written. It could be that the computer running our simulation is corrupted and spit out two different versions.It could be that Esmail chose pacing over continuity when writing the book. This explanation is a little cheap and not very believable imo since the book is so disjointed that you could insert anything at any time. It could be that the creator of our iteration using Esmail as a conduitvesselprophet that facilitates our mass enlightenment wanted two different versions. Literally for God knows what reason. Cheap I know. Maybe Gods reason was for people to notice and ask questions and have this conversation lol. It could be that the book and the DVDs derive from slightly different previous iterationswhich Id argue all have slightly different creators for the creator is dethroned and improved and upgraded each revolution just like reality is improved and upgraded each revolution. So wed get DVDs from reality v. the book from reality v. and both got thrown into our world v.. All versions could still serve the same purpose despite their idiosyncrasies which is enlightening people as to the nature of reality. And of course it could be that Esmail didnt realize there were differences which is tough to reconcile. ,MrRobot,dfvkqlk,2,t5_37dnc

11721341,0,t3_675huf,When Elliot and Angela are at the dinner party hosted by Gideon the news story of Colbys leaked emails states that employees died of similar types of leukemia. Now its certainly possible that Elliots perceiving another disease say lung cancer as leukemia during this scene but Im not sure if thats the most plausible explanation for whats going on.,MrRobot,dgon74y,2,t5_37dnc

11765682,0,t1_dgtnz8d,To better explain were watching Elliots perception of what is going on and he hears the news that Gideon was shot in a bar... Was he really shot or were we just watching Elliot tell his story? In the coma sequence where the show becomes an s sitcom Gideon is alive dressed as a police officer. This sequence was Elliots subconscience. Some fictional charcter Alf came out of no where and ran Gideon over kindof like some random guy at the bar walking up to him and shooting him.Leslie Romeros death was apparently a stray bullet from a neighbors gun but we didnt see any of that. He was just dead in his back yard with the FBI investigating and Dom being present with him. I would not be surprised if Romero was killed by the Dark Army and Gideon is alive. Gideon also being the reason behind Dom having so much information.,MrRobot,dgto4z5,0,t5_37dnc
