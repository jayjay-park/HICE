4640143,0,t3_3eisv7,gtBoth amazing and reputable schools but it would suck to stay at the same school for whatever many years since I love experiencing new things all the time and just being a number.It is unlikely you would be accepted to stay at UCD or UCB for graduate school if you go there for undergrad. They do not like to keep students like that you have to be quite exceptional to stay or have a professor that wants you. At least that is what I have seen. Any of the UCs of course will look good on applications for grad school but those two in particular will make it easier to get into the less prestigious UCs. UCM however has a fairly high rate of undergrads transitioning to graduate students. Probably because making that studentprofessor connection is a bit easier.You say you like experiencing new things and I will tell you that living in Merced is not like living anywhere else in CA. You are pretty much  hours from anything worth doing.  hours from Yosemite  hours from Sac  hours from San Fran  hours from LA. Im not sure where you are coming from but if it is elsewhere in CA you might be in for a bit of culture shock. Most of the population is very poor. It makes housing more affordable but it is hard to see all the stray animals and people with more children than they can feed. There is very obviously a good vs bad side of town but the people here are good if uneducated. The UC is doing a lot to help them. If you havent already compare UCM to other schools for first generation college students. Most of them come from in the valley.gtTo add to that from last year UCM only had around near to  graduate students that is not a lot to be honest comparing other schools. It just does not seem like UCM focuses on graduate school compared to the other UCs.You have to remember how brand spanking new UCM is! It is  years old this year and very much the baby of the UC family. Of course it wont have a lot of grad students because there simply isnt the room or support for more yet. The campus is pretty much always under construction because of this. But I also have no doubt that UCM will continue to improve and become one of the better UCs. Their facilities and technology are new and the research is good. They are getting results and publishing papers.As for faculty attention that really changes so much based on departments and the individuals in them. Most graduate students the ones who will mostly be teaching your classes and this is true for every UC are there because they dont have a grant or other funding to focus solely on research and they need something to pay the bills. The class sizes are smaller though so office hours are going to be less crowded if any students bother to show up.Im not sure if any of that really answered your questions. If you can come and see the campus and drive around the area. It is beautiful and the wildlife in the area is great. I actually saw a live bobcat on campus one time! Though it can be a bit brown and desolate looking this time of year.,ucmerced,ctfgh1i,3,t5_2seck

7078689,0,t1_d1iop9a,No problem!  So I just looked it up and it seems like you pay for the whole year unfortunately. It says  you can cancel your contract if you get married midsemester or withdraw which Im guessing you dont plan on doing haha I forgot to mention that theres also an off campus parking lot at Merced college where my roommates parked their cars freshman year! I think you need a permit from the UC to park there but its only a five minute buscar ride over and you can bring it on campus over the weekends. Its a bit more effort for random midweek trips but its something to look into if you only really need it to drive home on weekends. Honestly I think itll really be worth it to live on campus even if youre a little restricted!But yeah let me know if I can help with anything else!  Good luck! ,ucmerced,d1iqg2m,3,t5_2seck

The average incoming freshman scored a  on it. That being said you miss  of the shots you dont take just make a strong effort at the personal statement. Best of luck.,ucmerced,d4t6wx7,1,t5_2seck
