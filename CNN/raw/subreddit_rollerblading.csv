81605,0,t1_cen99bh,Many thanks!Theres one paragraph that majorly stood out for megt One thing I picked up from your post is that you have your feet in a V shape and you are having trouble getting moving. I would suggest trying more of an L shape  that way the wheels on your pushing skate are perpendicular to your rolling skate so that your pushing skate grips the surface more.Regarding the L shape is it the skate on its side that does the pushing? Perhaps my main issue of a lack of movement was the misconception that I could just set off rolling by moving my foot back rather than giving a good push with my foot. Im not sure.,rollerblading,cenpwyv,1,t5_2r7my

210037,0,t1_cf27db4,Hi PrivateStock!You are welcome! Im glad to be doing it!The point you raise about blading having a high cognitive load is an excellent one! And I think its also very VERY true. But I honestly wouldnt change it even if I could! Languages and dialects emerge organically as a result of the needs of their users and so I would disagree with you slightly that certain trick sequences getting a separate name is a bad thing. Theres two reasons for this.. Theres a great theory called Relevance theory by Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson who suggest that economy plays a major role in communication. The idea there is that people answer questions say with information they think their hearer will need to know to understand something. So for instance if my wife asks whether I went skating last Saturday I might simply answer It rained. I wouldnt have to say no because shell be able to assemble that on her own and as a bonus shell have gotten my reason and a likely sense that I was upset by the whole thing. People tend to give answers like that according to Sperber and Wilson because its economical to do so.So in blading I think trick names are going to get shorter no matter what because you know somebody well enough to talk to them about rollerblading chances are they already have most of the information they need to understand you before you ever start talking. So saying  misfit instead of alley oop topside mistrial just saves everybody a lot of time and thoughtwhich is really want you want to do if youre trying to cover a lot of ground. As an aside I think it IS very worthwhile to preserve the long form names for situations that are confusing. God knows weve all done the dance of explaining a trick to somebody when they dont quite get itOkay so Im here... and the rail is here.. and Im a rightly topsoul... and I go up and turn like this.... etc. So really while the cognitive load would be higher for somebody who doesnt know Bladespeak its actually lower for those of us who already know the code.The second reason I want to mention is this tricks that have names for whole sequences are probably though Im not  sure the ones that get done more often. Kind grinds for instance get done a lot more frequently than alley oop mizous and so we may name certain tricks that way because of how common they are. If you had to say the long form name for tricks that are really complicate and happen very frequently wed lose a whole lot of our time just to talking!Great question man! Thanks for bringing that up!,rollerblading,cf2d8et,1,t5_2r7my
216446,0,t1_cf3396y,Yeah this is a new thing. Looking around the edges you can probably see a number of indents or notches in the bearing. IDK why they do this but its likely you will not open them up. Do not dip them in speed cream. Do the plan B option but instead of dipping them put it as close to those notches as you can and put them under a light to make the cream get a little more fluid and seep into the bearing. Then dry and test spin. No promises ive never had luck with the pressed bearings but it might work. If not Aggressivemall sells Abec s for .,rollerblading,cf33iyi,3,t5_2r7my

When I grew up skating there was ONLY street skating and no skateparks available. Grinding has always been comfortable for me but taking to the air is so appealing. Landing in transition is pretty sweet too. I also want to entertain the skating style of the mushroom blading dudes and incorporate it somehow in to my repertoire while still remaining relative. HA!

350613,0,t1_cfh357j,Understood I just think that anyone who could balance the way these require could just as easily rollerblade. The advantage seems to be not having to carry your shoes to be able to take them off and walk afterwards. The speed is nothing special and you still have to find somewhere to put them when you get to your destination so the differences are limited in terms of convenience. Rollerblading would be better for you exercise wise and more versatile in terms of skatehardware choice. I am just not seeing this going too far.,rollerblading,cfh3xa1,1,t5_2r7my

Id never want to get someone fired for doing what was asked of them. I usually ask for one more trick and if they turn it down its all go. I knew it was borrowed time anyways.

671712,0,t3_21srhg,Id advise against getting the Il Capo... Its an overpriced hybrid skate... Not quite aggressive but close enough to trick some people into buying them. Regarding Xsjado theyre fine for beginners and advanced skaters alike... But if lasting beyond two years is your measure of quality Im sorry to break it to you but thats just not how aggressive and powerblading rollerblading works.If your skate lasts over two years then youre probably not skating enough. You should expect with moderate use to replace framessoul plates every year more so as you become a more skilled skater. personally I burn through soul plates every few months because I skate a lot of ledges. The entire nature of aggressive skating is essentially strapping on a pair of skates going out and damaging them by grinding railsledges and jumping around like a lunatic. ,rollerblading,cggmfv5,3,t5_2r7my

3758346,0,t3_33e6lt,gt the moment I took off my blades pain disappeared.   This and the position of the pain make it sound like its pressure points rather than soreness from riding. If so there are a number of things you can try.    Try to figure out exactly what part of the skateboot that is hurting your foot. Then see if there is something you can do to reduce the pressure.   Sometimes it can be enough to change how the skates are lacedbuckled for example I had pressure points on my Sebas and the pain disappeared completely when I simply stopped lacing through the fourth hole they are since the most comfy skates I have.   In some cases you can change the boot by heating the plastic and pushing it out at the pressure point. If the liner is the problem you may be able to modify it or even change to a different liner. Another thing you might try is to use an insole in the skate. Just raising or lowering the foot in the skate can be enough to fix it. Thickerthinner socks is also worth a try. Maybe someone else has more ideas. ,rollerblading,cqkog7e,3,t5_2r7my

I actually bought and used three different pairs of skates over  yrs online before finally finding a good fit w that third pair and even now I still question if theres something more comfortable out there for me. If youre looking to buy online I would suggest trying on different brands sizes models instore to get an idea of what you like. If possible maybe test those skates on carpeting first bc hitting the pavement would likely scruff the skates making return impossible if you find they dont fit well. If I were you Id search stuff like urban skates city skating commuting recreationalfitness skates freeskates. Im not very familiar with hockey skates at all so I cant really comment there. And Id add Powerslide to the brands to look atI dont think this site ships to Canada sorry! but you can check it out anyway. Its more on the pricier side though ,rollerblading,cqyw4zi,2,t5_2r7my

4211357,0,t3_39258f,For a while I was skating  miles tofrom work and wearing the skates all day at work.  I upgraded from some older K skates to the K V  Boa skates that youre considering and I love them.  The boot is light and comfortable and that ventilation system really works.   And oh god is the boa systems awesome!    The mm wheels took a little getting used to at first especially in speed straightaways.. I had a pretty bad fall where I let myself get ahead of my comfort zone early on and then got wobbly trying to correct for something.  Stay low especially at speed!!  But after that I didnt have any problem.   IMHO people overstate the theyre less maneuverable aspect.  Yes they have a bit more resistance to pivoting but I can do tight turns and simple outsidespins on them.  I havent perfected Bill Stoppards dragtopowerslide stop on them yet but I might start tackling that eventually if I get brave.      I bought them because I often wear skates all day long.  Everyones different though so Id suggest buying from a place that will let you swap them for something else after a week if you dont like the fit or something.

6664287,0,t1_d06dp1u,yeah i think when the kelsos first featured the triangle rail design everyones jaw dropped. Like an oh shit moment. Both from the skating and what was at the time a super rare Prail. Super easy to make the sloping sides make it safer than a normal rail middle supports are either super easy to hide or not necessary at all.another bladespecific obstacle is the banked wedge with the wall rail smacked in the middle of it. all the best parts of a handrail ledge and wallride spot.Control in close quarters and on tricky terrain is what makes blading different from other extreme sports. I would really like to see the ultimate basement dweller park. They managed to combo a few obstacles in a tiny space. Now imagine a space a couple times that size still small for a traditional skatepark with crazy trippy boxes ramps wall rails etc filling every corner going up to the ceiling. Something that would be almost impossible to navigate on a board or a bike but a skilled bler can move through it with ease.That would make for some cool edits and sick skate sounds,rollerblading,d08n7wx,1,t5_2r7my

7355678,0,t3_4g21fq,Sounds correct.  FRs have a hard shell that wont stretch over time.  The only way you get more space in them is by breaking down the liner.  A softboot breaks in a lot more as the liner will pack down plus the boot will stretch.  I spend a lot of my Saturdays and Sundays convincing people to get the smallest skate they can get their foot to lay flat into with toes touching the end.  Do not get a skate if your foot is arched or your toes are curled.  You always want the smallest skate possible unless youre feet are still growing then you can get them big and grow into them its a more precise fit less skate to manoeuvre and less weight.  If your skate is comfortable at the start once you break it in its going to be too big.  Sleeping in your skates or wear them in your house while you watch TV or the Internet at night are easy ways to break them in.Also sounds like youve got an amazing skate now.,rollerblading,d2eagm5,1,t5_2r7my

8669217,0,t3_4yoccg,Your k boot with a mm aluminum frame will be perfectly acceptable for distances up to around  miles after that you would probably start to get a lot of foot fatigue due to the extra mass of the skate and more general fit where as with a more purpose built distance skate you will have far less material around your foot and they will be better fit to your specific foot shape due to heat molding. I wouldnt skate a marathon with the unnaturals but they would be fine Im sure for moderate distance. Plus that will help you break them in me Im hearing the new ks are crazy stiff and really need a good break in period. ,rollerblading,d6p9tfq,2,t5_2r7my

9413175,0,t1_d98nmha,Well first things first I am no skating expert but it is still fresh in my mind most of the stuff I have been doing to improve.. I started practicing skating more on outer edges for a number of reasons one was to stop my feet pronating so much when striding and to strengthen ankles and I believe this has transferred into my skating by improving balanceconfidence for crossovers longer strides think double push and allowing for example steering with the front foot during Tstops.. Yea Slow Down Carving maybe a better description is carving for speed control.. I normally skate backward with the C carves but the more zig zag and crossover style are next on my list of skills to learn. What I was referring to was the actual transition of going from forward to backward skating both jumping a  turn and kind of gliding into it with a half turn clockwise and anticlockwise..

10060015,0,t3_5ixc4m,Hey Joey I just wanted to say that it was you guyss videos that got me interested in skating again after over a decade out. So a massive thank you for all the excellent content youve been putting out for free over the years. And presumtious preemptive thanks for answering my questions.Now onto the questions.   I think it might have been on one of the Mushroomblading podcasts I heard you talking about the need for a UFS . standard to drive frame innovation. What in your opinion would be the main Pros and cons of a new mounting standard?  .  Since youre in contact with the engineers at K as one of their most recognisable product testers have you tried to broach the issue with them in terms of trying to push the industry to move towards a new mounting standard? .  Do you think any remaining bad blood from Ks past actions regarding patents etc might get in the way of them trying to push for the industry to implement a new standard?  I rewatched the first few mushroomblading videos a couple of weeks ago and I laughed out loud at the bit in one of them where Leon is on the phone and says something like You remember that stupid mushroom movie? Im skating with those guys to see what happens. Have you ever brought this up to Leon since now hes pretty much surpassed you guys in terms of being at the forefront of weird skating with the whole wizard skating thing?  Ive currently got two smaller wheeled setups mm Anti on GC Gen s and a  flat on kaltik stealth. Do you think the Kaltiks would be any good for trying a banana rockered setup with    ? .  How much does wheel profile play into rockering setups? Would there be any obvious issues pairing my flatter profile s with the rounded profile s?.  For optimum mushroomy swivellage would you say more supportive and tighter cuffs or looser more flexy cuffs are the way to go?,rollerblading,dbiueka,5,t5_2r7my
10071513,0,t1_dbi6d7m,Im interested to try it and see how it feels... But I think its kind of limiting that Theres all these UFS frames out there and you cant put them on the Aeon or the Trinity mount skates.  I understand they are pushing the technology and thats great... But I love seeing different frame designs and visions that can go on different boots and keeping it wide open.  Like imagine for snowboarding or skiing was like You can only use this board or skis on this binding and this boot...Dual. Mount. Boots.

10188287,0,t3_5lvie4,Knowing only what youve told us I would probably lean towards the Troopers as theyre more solidsupportive than the Vs but really overall the most important thing is fit whichever skate fits your foot best is usually the one that skates the best for you. The V fits fairly narrow while the Trooper is wider. The Vs will have more heel rise than the Troopers which are close to flatfooted.Past the issue of fit the Vs are definitely lighter and more flexible than the Troopers. The Troopers definitely have bigger souls and the backslide angle is more relaxed more upright vs. the Vs which have a fairly deeplow backslide angle. The Troopers have a pretty good heel pad the Vs have nothing. The Vs are definitely going to be faster on and off the memory buckle is pretty nice.

You will spend less and enjoy the skates more if you spend the extra money for a pair with decent wheels from the get go otherwise you WILL spend another  EUR within a month or two upgrading wheels.
