5327639,0,t3_3jl6qo,My question is is would a diagnosis help you? On the one hand it can help explain what you were going through which can be helpful for some people. On the other hand it feels like a negative label for others. So if there is some benefit of understanding if you have borderline personality disorder would you consider seeking out a professional who could either make this diagnosis and hopefully help you treat it?Edited to add no disrespect to your friends but this should really be diagnosed by a mental health professional.,bulimia,cvso1er,1,t5_2tmc8

9845764,0,t3_5fjoin,Hello! Thank you for sharing.If not already you seem to be down the path of anorexia nervosa. While bulimia does include the risk of death anorexia has the highest rate of fatality in any mental illness. sourceI think youd be better off asking this question again in rEatingDisordersPeople living with bulimia struggle with an addictive and dangerous cycle of overeating and throwing it back up doesnt seem to apply to you. Those with anorexia rigorously restrict their food intake. Youre not getting ANY essential and necessary nutrients to thrive as a humanbeing and your body will stop functioning the way it used to if this behavior continues. Im afraid most of us here on this subreddit lack the knowledge to give you excellent advice since we struggle mainly with bulimia. Please please go to the Eating Disorder subreddit and ask for advice there! I would also research anorexia as much as possible and try to gain an understanding of your health risks what youre in for and what you can do to help yourself. Im glad youre seeking support even if its on Reddit. Its a start. This is very good! At least youre uncomfortable with the fact that you dont like how thin you look. Those suffering from anorexia usually have distorted perception with selfimage and body. With a bit of therapy and learning coping mechanisms and highly focusing on your mental health Im sure youll be able to beat this issue. Good luck and get started!With hope love and strengthJane,bulimia,daqxcey,2,t5_2tmc8

11232870,0,t3_60cdib,I am in the same space. The anxiety was the trigger for purging and then it progressed into binging and purging. I am  days without bingingpurging. It is amazing how addicting the cycles can feel. I am with you on this journey. We are capable of saying sober from this behavior and finding new ways to cope with the anxiety. lt much love ,bulimia,df58bck,2,t5_2tmc8

Men comprise about  of BN sufferers but I suspect thats a lot lower that the actual number. You have to draw a line in the sand write down the symptoms in your quote above and show them to him. The bulimia is part of his life and it always interferes with personal relationships. Ive had at least four relationships destroyed directly or indirectly by bulimia. From mood to attention span to unjustified anxiety over minor things all these took away the attention I shouldve given to my SO and put it back on myself. To my ex this was interpreted as selfishness and rightfully so. When she found out about my ED she was upset that I wasnt upfront with her about it and wondered why I didnt trust her on that last point I tried to explain that I wasnt ready to bring it up but it fell on deaf ears.There isnt a lot you can do to support your BF unless he sincerely wants you to be actively involved in his treatment amp recovery. He is obviously refusing to follow his therapists guidance and from what you said he doesnt see it as problem and isnt motivated to take the drastic steps needed to address it. He simply may not care about the effect his bulimia has had on your relationship and you should verbalize this. ,bulimia,dgvqpzj,2,t5_2tmc8
