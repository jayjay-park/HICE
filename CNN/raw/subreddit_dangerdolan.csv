They banned it because they thought it was offensive to students who had nonexpensive shoes. No one does it anymore but if they did do it in front of a teacher you were either given detention or given a suspension. Everybody thought it was stupid even my parents thought it was stupid. ,dangerdolan,dcpdg5a,1,t5_37ue8
