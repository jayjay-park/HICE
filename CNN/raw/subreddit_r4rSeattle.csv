5878313,0,t1_cxplwog,gt Yes its not your fault your highness kingdom of girls. It is all mine having those dirty dirty disgusting desires of touching a females hand in a romantic moment like all those hundreds of movies I saw and all the scenes I see every week of happy couples living life while I am rotting alone in front of a computer screen everyday at home and at work without the slightest hope of ever experiencing what a mutual human connection is. Has it occurred to you that this might not actually be a problem with all women in the world then? Plenty of guys have dates. Plenty of guys get married. These women youre so convinced are out to get men are dating other dudes and its probably because youve got this notion that we owe it to you to date you just because youre sad.Look man. I get where youre coming from I really do. Im trans and once upon a time I was in foreveraloneville as a nerdy guy the same way you are. But what fixed that wasnt being furious at everyone it was figuring out a way to feel like I was a valuable and worthwhile person. Literally the day I did that people started being interested in me.gt I am fully familiar with this tone every time I try to be nice when talking to a girl and all I endup getting is this tone which spells discomfort of me even existing and daring to breath the same air entering her royal lungs.Jesus man. Chill. Youre radiating frustration selfloathing and anger  how could someone not be uncomfortable around that?gt Details ? You just implied in your post that most of them those dirty dirty guys who dare to express their interest in meeting the higher life form known to the common people as females are lying. You wouldnt believe a thing I say anyway.I wouldnt take everything said in a personal ad as certain truth no. But its not that hard to detect bullshitting most of the time and the more thats there the easier that is.Honestly though again I dont hate men. I really dont. I dont think men are inferior or somehow beholden to me  in fact Im currently in a kink relationship with a guy who is very much in charge when were together and I like that personally.But and this is an important but I dont especially want to date someone who doesnt have their life together outside of the relationship. Thats a breeding ground for unhealthy dependent and unsatisfying relationships. When a girl is uncomfortable with your approach its because its clear you want a girl much more than you want her because youre not okay with yourself if you dont have one.I dont say this in the sense of this is what I want and you must do it. I say it so that you can understand how you look from the outside.,r4rSeattle,cxq6g6k,1,t5_2syhy
