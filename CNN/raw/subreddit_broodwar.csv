113665,0,t1_cerdb7k,Its a bunch of things. It makes it so that if controlled pretty close to optimally all the mutas will go down to hp before any of them die to nonAoE making you  hp paper airplanes into an  hp beast. Plus in syncs their movement so they call fire and target the same thing at once basically making it one really really good unit.,broodwar,cerdg1e,3,t5_2s4tn

3912964,0,t1_cr22mh6,Mechanics QuestionsLiterature also the part with the links at the bottom minus Vers  pages maybeValid Answer Whatever fits you best as long as you work on it and use the keyboard. Really nobody has an idea what works perfectly everyone is different. When should I expand?Depends a lot on your Build Orderstrategy. Really hard to answer especially with Zerg. Read up some random Builds and try to figure it out. Download replays of good players not neccessarily pros and try to compare the build to what they did so you have an idea for the late game. Give us a clear question next time e.g. for a special build or add a replay. Its really too vague to answer. Keep in mind that in the D to C range the exact expo timings arent the main factor to lose games. Its mechanical aspects and misunderstood usage of guides.See also And Dont get caught up on APM. Everyone who says you X APM IS NEEDED has no idea. There were very good players with low APM. APM is just an idea of your speed not a measurement of accuracy. In before nor does eAPM help out much. You can be rather good with just  APM. Realize you wont ever be a pro. However making it to the top range of the foreigners is possible. Hint GoOdy was considered among the better players with  APMFiSheYe won a silver medal in WCG with barely Mondragon returning for fun games only had about  APM and slayed some of the current foreignersBakuryu had  APM and was considered as one of the better Zerg even having a good record in ZvZ against the likes of Sziky. So... anything goes as long as you have a system.,broodwar,cr2baah,1,t5_2s4tn
3935271,0,t3_35fb34,Well there are a couple of options. ICCUP is the most popular nonkorean option. It was designed around competitive v but you can play UMS and whatnot on it youll typically find at least a game or two of ums being hosted. If interested refer to the right side bar how top play or If you want to venture onto korean servers fish youll find an endless selection of games. Obviously the downside is a massive language barrier etc. Let me know if you have any other questions.,broodwar,cr4utk9,2,t5_2s4tn

4221028,0,t3_38sl7k,Just one other comment. You said perhaps we could shed light on why people take expansions on the opposite side of the map. The only protoss matchup where protoss tends to do this is PvT. Doing it in pvp is odd and risky.As I said in PvT protoss will take expansions on the opposite side of the map frequently. How do they hope to defend those expansions? Well.... they dont. Theyre designed to die. Heres the thing the terran mech army is extremely strong but extremely slow and generally has to stay together. So what happens is you let the terran mosey over and siege one of your  corners of the map. While theyre camping out there you go and counter their main or just be annoying somehow and slowly widdle down the terran mech ball. Alternatively you can engage it. You will lose probably but thats ok. You have  bases with gateways at everyone of them not just your main you rebuild your army  times quicker than the terran can kill you as once again theyre slow as fuck. So your down one base youve killed  of the terran mech army and youve fully rebuilt your own army. The second reengagement should go more your way. Obviously this is a gross simplification but hopefully you get the point.If you have any other videos Id be happy to look at them.,broodwar,cs1dmri,1,t5_2s4tn

8492548,0,t1_d6340f8,Are you getting the file from iccup.com?  If you are really concerned you could just download a battle.net gateway editor from anywhere else and add theabyss.ru and you can connect to iccup without the launcher.Alternatively you can get their reg file and add it as wellIf you are really concerned about that reg file you can open it with any text editor notepad and see that it contains nothing malicious it just adds the abyss to your server list.,broodwar,d6348lr,1,t5_2s4tn

11417426,0,t1_dfq4zm7,The best advice in the threadgtPlay all  until you find one you enjoy.But that doesnt really lead to a conversation and its fun to discuss so here is my take on it.Its really  hard to narrow down the races based on timing attacks because that concept is inherent in every race  finishes? attack. That can be done with hydras lings zealots goons marines tanks etc. A general concept like timing attack is way too broad to pin it on one race since they all do it.I think protoss fits the bill the best though and thats because they have the strength of gateway units  their going to feel strong when going allin on one base. Zerg needs to expand unless it wants to do something really cheesy and super allin.But thats the trick neither is actually stronger unless your map favors it? If you like  base strats then protoss is certainly a better fit than zerg and terran second. Actually yea I like that conclusion   base strategies are definitely more common on toss... i think?again best advice is to try them all D also food for thought check out this game of Jaedong vs FlashJaedong basically goes for a  base hydra allin and it crushes flashs terran because he didnt see it coming.,broodwar,dfq5jds,1,t5_2s4tn
11439605,0,t3_63aojo,A couple of things while siege is safe vs. most things its  passive. You have no opportunities to do basically anything. Vultures at least let you explore the map place mines to block expansions try to kill off a couple stray workers etc. Really opening up mines is safe enough in most situations that rushing to siege mode is not necessary.I said siege is safe against most things what it is not safe against are dts. You might have to get an engineering bay  turrets if you open siege tanks which are pretty much worthless. Mines can deter dts.Here is a liquipedia about fd builds to give you some more insight ,broodwar,dfso2tf,2,t5_2s4tn
