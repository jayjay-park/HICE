3951494,0,t3_35pgjb,Have lived in Issaquah for  years. No nightlife two sports bars and a few dive bars. Go to Bellevue hit up Earls Pearl Taphouse Cactus Joeys Paddy Coynes. Once you get on I which depending where you live in Issaquah can take  minutes Seattle is a  minute drive its another  minutes if you wanna go to Ballard or Fremontboth of which are really cool areas. If you are  you might like Capitol Hill maybe... Like others have said lots to do outside. Hiking climbing camping my favorite. If you get on I Eastbound you will find many areas to participate in these activities. Get a map or just Google it! Try to avoid driving in downtown Issaquah between pm and pm especially Front St. and the IssaquahHobart road oy! As far as food its ok... My personal favorites are Taqueria La Venadita and Las Margaritas for Mexican and Similan Thai Cuisine.Oh and I highly recommend you take a day or two and drive up to Vancouver Canada. I think its a  hour? drive one way. It is beautiful. One of the best cities I have ever visited.Snoqualmie Casino can also be fun its close and they have a few restaurants inside gambling drinking or just people watching. It can be interesting...My apologies if I basically repeated what anybody else has already said and for the bad grammar and formatting Im tired. Good luck and enjoy!,eastside,cr6pd11,3,t5_2sazx
4024211,0,t3_34k0z9,We moved to downtown Bellevue from California a few years ago. If you want anything less than a  min commute public transit or car stick to Bellevue Redmond or Kirkland. And parking a car in downtown Bellevue can be expensive if your company does not provide parking. Plan to add roughly  for parking a month. Check public transit schedules because in the major metro centers its pretty good but there have been budget cuts then uncuts then threatened cuts and so on to the outer areas lately so those are not so great esp late at night or on weekends. Honestly there are a lot of older neighborhoods that ring the crazy new downtown. If you are willing to hunt a bit and live in an older house you can find reasonably priced digs not too far from your job. And there are decent bus routes and transit centers in many of them. Get a good rain coat and a good pair of boots and you will be fine. ,eastside,creznjz,1,t5_2sazx

7784986,0,t1_d3qtira,Agree that there are several factors that could explain the stats not just pitbulls are inherently vicious.  Differences in owner profiles are one possibility.  But the stats do make me sympathetic to people who want to avoid pitbulls.  For whatever underlying reason it does seem to be the case that if you encounter a random pitbull you dont know you have a much higher chance of it ending in serious injury than if you  encounter say a random lab.,eastside,d3r36fw,2,t5_2sazx
