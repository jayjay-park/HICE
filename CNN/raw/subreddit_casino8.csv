5618940,0,t3_3rpfan,Hey Hey peeps Hey Hey casino fellows. Looks like a fellowship is concocting here on the outskirts of Casino Avenue...Okay enough with my nonsense lol. Kidding aside Ms. bloodyblondeamy you said like TWO whole paragraphs and you didnt even make a good suggestion haha! But oh well it seems Im about to do that as well LOL.Anyhow before I get off the train moneymachine try Lady Lucks mi amigo! They have a wonderfully stable mobile platform for casino gaming. Ms. Amy the blondy is right though that plenty of the online casinos have secondrate mobile counterparts so you have to decide carefully and wisely. Gluck!,casino8,cwtl0yz,1,t5_31aug
5821351,0,t1_cxe8q21,uhh.. guys you might have misunderstood me on that one because i did not make any deposit. okay. wait. so these bonuses are legit is that what you guys are telling me over here? so the casino does give free money for extra bets. so its all a big complicated thing huh?,casino8,cxipcxu,1,t5_31aug
6379030,0,t3_431h5z,Probably because the casino they tried to play at scammed them. Thats the first thing that comes into my head. I believe thats the only reason. Why leave if youre gaming finely over there right? Not unless you just wanna change casinos. They might even just have multiple accounts and game. Some of my Chinese friends do that to make up for losses. I dont know if it works but they sure are steady nowadays.Another possibility is that they may return to the online casino to void their bonuses just so they can get rid of unwanted bonuses wagering requirements.,casino8,czeq6l8,1,t5_31aug

Casinos are a business like any other business  and they are there to make profit not to entertain.Myself I like to play Three Card Poker I prefer doing that in a casino and not online when its online its just a click of a button and you dont really feel you are losing actual money when you are in a casino and you see your notes flying it feels more real and so I am more cautious.. In any case if you like  card poker as well there is this nice facebook page here,casino8,d2ea0ow,1,t5_31aug
