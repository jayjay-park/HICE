47115,0,t1_cejoep7,Yup.Chrome includes the core functionality of this builtin though if you close a page or Chrome crashes restoring it will restore the text.  However the page loads anew so if the text box that was there before isnt there now the text is lost this happens when for example you are replying to Reddit comments but not when posting a new comment tree.Lazarus is more fully featured... you can restore text anywhere there is a similar field not just where you last entered it and it remembers text even if posting it was successful so it is good for quickly filling out repetitive forms.I dont use it though Chromes functionality is enough for me most of the time.,chrome,cejsm2c,3,t5_2qlz9

Getting banned from the Chrome Web Store would result in no ongoing income which really is kind of pointless.The same could be said about AdSense.

378841,0,t1_cfjew0v,Probably because the number one way to infect Chrome now is through malicious extensions. Thanks to Googles efforts the traditional avenues have become impractical  browser flaws quickly lose their value because once Google becomes aware of them they can auto update  of the userbase in days the badies dont have time to sell their exploits or incorporate them into exploit kits and then distribute the code across malicious sites. It doesnt help either that Google pays for vulnerabilities the people who would usually sell them on darknets now sell them to Google instead  so the market is starting to dry up.   plugin flaws  roughly the same situation  Adobe Flash ships with Chrome and is auto updated in the same way  Google and Adobe pay for reporting vulnerabilities. The version that comes with Chrome Pepper Flash also has additional sandboxing making it that much harder to exploit.   Java which used to be a major infection vector is now clicktoplay by default and vulnerable versions are blacklisted in Chrome also its userbase has been steadily dropping for years. Same with the Quicktime plugin gt clicktoplay and old versions are blacklisted.   NPAPI plugin support will be discontinued soon to be replaced by the the more secure PPAPI plugins AFAIK theyre already accepted only on a whitelist basis  after the recent boughtextensionsthenrepackagedwithhiddencode stealing the users info and injecting ads Google changed their policies once that goes into effect expect major crackdowns. The remaining way to obtain a persistent presence in Chrome is through nonWebstore extensions so this is where the battle has moved. ,chrome,cfk16c3,3,t5_2qlz9

393499,0,t1_cfljp7k,Heres what I readGmail serves all images through Googles image proxy servers and transcodes them before delivery to protect you in the following ways senders cant use image loading to get information like your IP address or location senders cant set or read cookies in your browser......except that in this case the sender is send is going through Googles servers. I bet they have a developer who can block it from other senders but still let Google use it. Theyre smart over there.And by the way this sounds awesome! It sounds like an extra safety measure that companies could probably get people to pay for. I fucking love Google for stuff like this. As long as they stay not being evil.I dont like the part about how the person opening the email doesnt know that their location is going back to the sender I understand geofencing push messages and they are cool as hell but thats optin.

But its always best to be safe than sorry.In the end I didnt lose much. I only lost data that some extensions used. For example I use Session Buddy to save open sessions of tabs. After deleting my profile all my Session Buddy data was gone.

9139594,0,t3_55djws,This is exactly what happened with Firefox and Australis a long time ago.The thing is people were talking saying that Chrome looked dated and outofplace with the flat style of Windows . And Google isnt new to redesigning UX theyve worked pretty extensively with Material Design in Android.Personally I like the new design and I had been trying it out ever since the flag to turn it on showed up on Windows.

9232901,0,t1_d8mau2v,Yeah thats the real problem not giving memory back when FF should otherwise be done with it.  I thought at first this had to do with them using Netscape Navigator as a base but reading the WP entry just now it says that FF is only the spiritual successor to Navigator.  Well well.I also love how every tab and extension gets its own process which easily lets me examine their RAM usage and kill them if I so desire.  With FF its just one or two big bloated pigs for everything.IIRC the reason extensions like video downloader arent allowed for Chrome is because its a conflict of interest on Googles part since they also own youtube.  I simply use rd party sites for the job like KeepVid for example.,chrome,d8mc66u,7,t5_2qlz9

9429261,0,t1_d9avqpz,Its the scaling setting your operating system is set at. High resolution screens with small physical sizes make the UI smaller so to account for this you can scale the UI up.
