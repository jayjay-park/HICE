6768016,0,t1_d0jc2uq,I actually agree with you on that.  Im all for the legalization of marijuana and treating addiction for the harder stuff as a sickness rather than a crime.  The dickheads that are pushing crack and heroin should be locked up but simple possession should be seen as a symptom of a disease or condition that needs to be treated rather than evidence of a crime in progress.  But of course implementing that line of thinking would call for a major overhaul of our social programs like you know actually funding them which just isnt going to happen in such a deeply red state as ours.  Youll find the only people who are vehemently opposed to legalizing marijuana in our state are mostly those who stand to make the most money off of incarceration and incarceration is big business in Louisiana or the people who are still drinking the illfated War On Drugs koolaid.  But if you talk to the lowerrung LEOs and COs a good majority of them will tell you that marijuana should be legal.All that being said youre talking about policy change that will take its sweet time getting made in Baton Rouge if at all and wont help with the here and now problem of the gang members currently being hunted.  These are not good people and arguments could be made of whose fault that is and I hold the fairly unpopular opinion of their acts ultimately being the product of the states egregious failings in the areas of education and healthcare but they have to be held accountable for actions that they committed of their own free will.  And it has to be done as swiftly as possible before theyre able to cause more harm to the community.Id also like to make clear that what makes me angrier than anything when it comes to gangs or even nonaffiliated criminals in general is all of the wasted potential.  I spent a few years as a CO and while book smarts did not exactly dominate the prison culture I could see so many people who had the potential to become productive even outstandingly so members of society had the proper guidance been there to allow for that potential to grow.  But it has all been squandered by generations of forced ignorance intolerance fuzzy politics and the increasing nightmare of what is considered to be conservative values that dominates this states culture today.  Its pathetic and it would take more generations to turn the boat anywhere near a good direction if the state even had any interest in doing so.,Louisiana,d0jfnva,4,t5_2qr93

They subject us to the same predatory imperialism as the Mexicans Koreans or Iraqis. And they get us cheering them on too like a bunch of spineless bootlicks aching for more scraps from the masters table in our dog bowls. I dunno about yall but I think we can do and deserve better than that. Our politicians tricked us into becoming vehemently anti union and anti environmental as well as racist and sexisthomophobic to try to get development from businesspeople who see workers and the places we live as impediments not investments that is any successful businesspeople. The system rewards them for destroying lives and communities. Being prejudiced means well happily attack social programs if it means we get to hurt minorities to make ourselves feel better without actually improving our own standards of living. It works really really good. Lee Atwater was a devil and a genius. And Martin Luther King Jr was spot on in identifying a combination of moderate obstruction to direct action and crackerism as what keeps the South poor and oppressed. So we didnt even get the factories but we are left with a legacy of whites doing their best to hamstring themselves and everyone else to get pats on the head from some belligerent cryptofascists a political legacy entirely incapable of dealing substantively with the problems before us and any minorities rightfully scared shirtless of the thinly veiled Neo Klan nature of the police and courts and other aspects of a decrepit society teetering forward on the momentum of past atrocities of sharecropping systemic betrayal of Natives Half of us chase after the RNC to get rewarded for being as shortsighted and bigoted as possible and the other half chasing the DNC that has the same program of imperial dominion and bigotry but pretend to care about minorities and working people generallyits difficult and pointless to pick whos worse. Absolutely nothing in historical records demonstrates otherwise only transparent folkmyth does which doesnt stand up to honest analysis. The only reason Louisiana or the South generally is poor is because of Yankee imperialism and the crackerism that supports it secondarily the false promises and allegations of the DNC that trick people into thinking theres no alternative for progressive change.Im sick of all this.

11187945,0,t1_dezqpqo,Oh I totally get that.  We live in a conservative red state.  We like things the way they were not new unknown things.  Gov Edwards must adhere to those conservative values or he will never see a nd term.  That political shit aggravates me but I understand his situation.  So I dont fault him on that.  Its rare when you find a politician who is actually willing to propose ideas his constituency may have issue with. ,Louisiana,df052cb,1,t5_2qr93
