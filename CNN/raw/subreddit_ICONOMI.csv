9889158,0,t1_datlo5n,This is true.  However we have to keep in mind that tracking altcoin market is different from what people are accustomed to with traditional indexesEven the SampP smallcap  index is tracking  small companies with market caps of  million to . billion.If ICNX blanket included top  crypto without being selective then they would lose client money by buying into things like Paycoin which pump up into the top  market cap for a couple weeks then dump to nothing.Tracking a basket of  or  highly volatile assets with tiny market caps is a much different game than tracking  relatively stable companies in traditional index. Iconomi has to be selective on what they include in order to avoid losses.,ICONOMI,dawkwch,4,t5_3f8v4

While we have investigated the option of traditional insurance we think that it is not the best way to go.

11360886,0,t1_dfjbu87,He probably should have asked you of a comparable example. Not sure there is one though buybacks are extremely liked by investors in real world stocks and dividends are also liked. Having a nicely stated buyback program is in my opinion much better than a dividend that may or may not change however. Different strokes for different folks. But the fact that dividends are impossible should probably have been pointed out BEFORE it was put into their faq.. twice and their ico announcement and press releases.,ICONOMI,dfjqhhc,1,t5_3f8v4

11376288,0,t3_62ab99,Let me remind you all Iconomi got funded during the ICO in order for them to develop and execute the product.Product was and still is a crypto fund management platform that will distribute profits generated on the platform to all ICN holders.They dont and should not ask the share holders for the method of distribution. We are share holders of the profits not decision makers.I am sure they discussed that internally for some time and decided to change the distribution method.Why do you expect to get an update on company internal decisions?Communication and transparency should be shown for the buyburn process.,ICONOMI,dflhdva,9,t5_3f8v4
11449138,0,t1_dftkt85,Well thats just beautiful. They were smart enough to take that ownership away from people who hold ICN into that new buyburn system leaving everyone with a token with no value other than a speculative long term rising value.,ICONOMI,dftr0mo,4,t5_3f8v4
