1394001,0,t1_ciqkpfn,Oh!!! I get it now. You need to search for a Whispering Death at Bashem but cant because of the weekend event. The event is now over so you should be able to search for Whispering Deaths at Bashem again.,RiseOfBerk,cir0p33,2,t5_328qh

1960973,0,t3_2gv2kx,Yeah this event was definitely one of the tougher ones for me. Went through nearly k runes before I finally got one of these guys. Hardly seemed worth it in the end...,RiseOfBerk,ckphz7r,2,t5_328qh

3050333,0,t3_2v3eac,Seashockers are best for fish Hackatoos are busy for wood and Boneknappers are the best hybrid.Im not sure about battle or uniques.But you should be able to see by opening the Book of Dragons and tapping on the i in the top right of each dragon to see what its max stats will be.,RiseOfBerk,coe5yn5,1,t5_328qh

3500484,0,t3_30cq42,I use toothless   exotic tideglider  and three other dragons with range damage. Im on fleet . Focus on range Dragons with high attpwr,RiseOfBerk,cpra3ey,1,t5_328qh
4502445,0,t1_csxu6ym,That may work for you at your level but I can guarantee it does not work when your dragons are at level .The enemy fleets scale with the level of your dragons. Basically it starts getting a lot harder the higher level your dragons are.,RiseOfBerk,csy6pa1,1,t5_328qh
7587394,0,t1_d2zwo5g,Building on this suggestion there is a long string of quests which are interspersed between the Upgrade X dragons to level Y quests which direct you to have a specific breed of dragon to a certain level and collect a certain amount of fishwood It would be a good idea to level those dragons too. Also keep in mind that unique dragons count too Stormfly is a Deadly Nadder Hookfang is a Monstrous Nightmare etc.,RiseOfBerk,d34nech,1,t5_328qh

10474553,0,t1_dcrduxv,The defender dragons are basically free as long as you put in the time to get them. Their stats are pretty mediocre. Its dumb though. They should have much better stats for battling.Maybe dont think of them as defenders. Think of them as poor frankenstein dragons who were maimed by unethical dragon trappers. Seriously it cant be easy flying around with that much iron bolted into your skeleton.,RiseOfBerk,dcvedig,1,t5_328qh
