9748091,0,t1_daenkyh,Haha yeah it is encouraging to see the support and I do think that this sub fills a need for discussion of a topic that has been a little hard to talk about constructively.Its true that it is a sad state of the games industry that we need a place like this but hopefully we can be a force of change for the better.,GamesWatchdog,daenxno,2,t5_3hoq4

9771616,0,t1_dah2cni,gt Labelling me as a True Believer.  gt Implying low karma accounts being a untrustworthy source is a stupid argument.  gt Suggesting its supposed to dismiss criticism again star citizen.   We should listen to the  x karma account spouting out the same crap heard from any uninformed or obsessed troll.  Accusations demands to get a refund encouraging people to contact the FTC Spreading misinformation and much more criticism  Drop in the bucket really.. you should have seen the new page on rstarcitizen before the karma and voting rule was implemented.  Loved all the creepy montages of developers marketeers podcast echochambers people linking to their own bias articles and quoting d smart.  Those were the times..,GamesWatchdog,dahkgl4,13,t5_3hoq4
