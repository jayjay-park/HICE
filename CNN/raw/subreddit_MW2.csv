999861,0,t3_25jcgv,You did not and cannot get banned from simply being in a hacked game. You can be reported for breaking Xboxs TOS and if the reports are confirmed by Microsoft youll get temporarily banned. Check your XBL email and it will say why you were banned from XBL. It will not be because of MW I guarantee it.I would guess almost  of th Prestigers have their ranks modded even if unintentional. It has happened to a LOT of people so dont worry about explaining it to anyone. Chances are there are people just like you in every lobby!You could email Xbox support asking why you were banned if nothing is in your email.Source Long time Xbox  MW player who has been temp banned twice but never because of MW. I have also been in my fair share of hacked lobbies. In future just dashboard or power off your Xbox before the data saves to avoid jumping rank.Post your GT if you want to play sometime.  Good luck!,MW2,chhxx6l,6,t5_2r3qb

6183931,0,t1_cysgwqx,Why do you think he said AuraCore has a bigger playerbase?   That this guy  TheUli.  Repz only has a larger playerbase because its been leeching for so long and some how has not had a rod shoved up their ass by Activision like other clients.  Repz is surviving on cancer and luck.  ReactIW is the best client from a feature standpoint however with IWPlay shutting down AuraCore received a bunch of those members transferring over so kinda got a boost.  And I think TheUli just relaunched Reacts master server in response to AuraCores successful launch.,MW2,cysjrmd,3,t5_2r3qb

10479295,0,t3_5pxt0c,Without a doubt the best client is iwx. Ive played d react repz iwplay v. I believe it has so much more potential than the others. The only this is that it is very new still in beta and there are not loads of severs or players currently. However it seems to be growing everyday. Your best bet is to download it go into the discord and talk there. It seems to be very empty during the day time  like right as of posting  however every night for the past few days we have had around  players in a server. Its best to talk in the discord to see if anyone wants to play and them others will join.Right now I would suggest downloading iwx and maybe another client v might be next best but i dont really know. If you are finding that its too empty on iwx currently for you dont just forget about it I think it can grow and will hopefully players on other clients will see this.you should join the discord and just ask on there find out more about it,MW2,dcvxpyc,2,t5_2r3qb
