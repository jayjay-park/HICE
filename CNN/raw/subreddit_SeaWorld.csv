11609621,0,t3_65m6bd,Thank you for visiting! Maybe I saw you there. Im an educator at SeaWorld Orlando! For everyones knowledge the two manatees in the video are not related. None of our manatees are. They are all rescued. The ones in that front pool are rescued as orphans except one that is there for cold stess. The big one looks like Sarah. Shes about  and has been with us since she was rescued. Shes conditionally nonreleasable. The government agencies in charge of animal and manatee releases FWC and Manatee Rehabilitation Partnership have never said to release her or not to so she stays with us and acts as a mentorauntie for the younger orphans! The younger ones tend to attach themselves to Sarah and Oakley because they are learning! ,SeaWorld,dgbyliw,3,t5_2rtyn
