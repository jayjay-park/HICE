556315,0,t1_cg3bx21,I am copying the post I made in that thread.This is the percentage of total mined bitcoins. Its scary to consider that these coins may represent a substantial percentage of the active bitcoin market which are coins that are not stored and are readily for saleavailable to the market. Im interested in knowing what percentage of total bitcoins mined are actually in circulation and what percentage these stolen coins represent compared to that amount. Two issues come to mind  The criminals have an almost zero cost basis in these coins. This means that either option they choose will not be good for the market. They could potentially explode the market with a massive supply cut or they could implode the market with a massive supply increase.  The criminals may have stolen circulated coins which means that these criminals may be the main players Imagine if  of all bitcoins are actually circulated and these guys now own roughly  of those coins in the overall bitcoin market and thus directly manipulating the market based on their desires. If they stole only uncirculated coins the market wouldnt change much so long as they do nothing with the coins. However if they were to suddenly make those coins accessibly on the market supply of circulated coins may multiply in a relatively short timeframe thus crashing the market.This is a scary thought especially considering the total value of bitcoin is based entirely on the amount of bitcoins and the current market price. It has zero assets that can be quantified outside of bitcoins available. Basically roughly  of the entire asset value of the bitcoin economy went missing. Now lets compare this with the total value of the united states. The m money supply of the US is currently estimated to be roughly . Trillion. This counts all usd in circulation and in liquid savings note this doesnt include tbills investments in domestic and foreign vehicles of any type stocks land etc as they are not considered as liquid as cash or cash like. The m is roughly  the size of the estimated total value of US economic assets which is currently estimated at  trillion. These assets represent roughly x the US GDP which is projected to be  trillion. On top of this the US generates tax revenue of around  trillion. The big bad bailout which everyone here considers to be outright theft of the usd by corporations with the help of the fed is estimated to have cost us  Billion over the last  years of which only  Billion hasnt been repaid yet. So the bailout took roughly  of liquid available USD . of the total assets of the american economy and roughly  of the US GDP. Also note this assumes that we never get repaid or are ever made better off from this spent money. We are assuming its just gone like the bitcoins that were stolen from the people. Had the USD been subject to the same amount of stolen money wed have roughly  TRILLION completely MISSING within a few months with no idea where it went at least if we are assuming the total market value of the entire US economy. If we are just using available liquid usd related holdings its more like . Trillion. Roughly x the TARP program. In terms of relative value these stolen coins did more damage than  TARPS at the same time and all that money was  stolen with no way to get it back and no one held accountable. Sounds familiar.,Buttcoin,cg3icn4,6,t5_2sngy

If I have this many bitcoin I assume I also have a ton of contacts in the industry and let the big players know in advance that I am about to do this so they play along in the slaughter. Either I get completely filled out with around  m in quick profit or only successfully sell  of the  and achieve the same goal with a modest .m profit average fill of coin before momentum takes it to . I can afford to keep a strong sell order on the market because this is free money for me and I have a ton of inventory beat out most people. Put out rumors that some random country just banned bitcoin collude with other big time bitcoin ownersshills to keep the market in crash mode a few weeks as we figure out how to game the idiots for every penny. You know the usual.Use proceeds to buy another k coins slowly over the course of a week keeping between k and .m in cash profit as everyone tries to shill why the crash was good for bitcoin. Let the community waste their savings to reinflate the market for me.Use some of that k to spread a couple puff piece articles around the internet. Bribe the producer of a local news show to mention some bitcoin related rumor to increase the price. Many different ways to go here.So now I am probably a cash millionaire and still have k bitcoins. Btc is at around piece by the time I am done so now I have roughly .m in coins.Either I rinse and repeat the above process or use the coins to buy out successful bitcoin sites after I move to panama.

1521596,0,t1_cj6zwij,Youd probably really like the documentary I link to at the top of the post All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace. My earlier writeup about it explains why. Issues of decentralization vs. centralization are hard to talk about because we often dont have good terms defined. One example I like to give is companies like Uber and AirBnB. Theyre often hailed by advocates of decentralization has these huge decentralizing forces but I honestly dont see them that way. Whereas before we had a diffuse set of markets for various services AirBnB or Uber attempt to create a single marketplace through which all traffic has to go in order to take place in that market. So where before you had craigslist sublets people posting their houses on trusted email lists independent Bed and Breakfasts and niche hotels now AirBnB is attempting to capture that entire market on its site and disrupt that is destroy those markets that cant be. Now I dont mean to say that this kind of centralization and creative destruction are badjust that it doesnt seem to be a decentralizing force as most techies seem to believe at least not from the perspective I take. And I think it does open up the market to legibility issues as Scott lays out in Seeing Like a State. Any central control of a market will try to make that market look more like its own simplistic model of the world whether its a state or a corporation. ,Buttcoin,cj70cjc,1,t5_2sngy

Quick look at this random blog post that agrees with megt they have fast efficient systems to calculate  transactions per second.

The speed at which you switch has nothing to do with risk.  In fact the more you move away from holding and using  USD towards cryptocurrencies the more risk you will absorb gradually or not.The fact remains that Bitcoins is an insanely volatile currency I use the term very loosely here as I am not convinced it actually functions as such at this moment that will be volatile for likely its entire life unless you miraculously get instant and widespread mass adoption.The problem Bitcoin will have with adoption is a catch in order for people and businesses to actually start using it as a currency in preference to fiat the volatility must drastically stabilize but in order for the price to stabilize there must be an increase of several orders of magnitude in adoption I mean REAL adoption as a currency and not just as a speculative investment.  That level of adoption is far greater than one struggling rinkydink online retailer moving from  to  Bitcoin holdings or whatever.What overstock.com accepting and kind of holding Bitcoin suggests to me is not that Bitcoin is gaining any serious legitimacy but that overstock.com is simply ready to take more risks to hunt for alternate revenue sources.

2661783,0,t1_cn601j1,Whats funny to me is by every imagineable metric including a long list of things that would never happen actually happening buttcoiners still insist bitcoin is a failure or is bound to fail or something like that.   Buttcoiners were making the same jokes  years ago and none of youthem would have ever imagined hell I am surprised at where bitcoin already is today.. I expected where we are today to be at least a decade out yet somehow despite all evidence to the contrary bitcoin is still a failure.  its almost as if bitcoins failure is an unfalsifiable fact.  At what point were the buttcoiners wrong and the bitcoiners right?  As far as I can tell.. never.. its just like a bunch of religious folk circle jerking each other in their dogma with no reference to reality.Making fun of delusional bitcoiners k coins are just around the corner zomg! is one thing and there is definitely no shortage of them and calling them out on the cultlike tactics is another.. and having fun at other peoples expense for any particular reason are all legit pastimes but from an actual being able to predict the future or having intellectual integrity.. which at least some of you buttcoiners are claiming to dohave its a joke.  All evidence is evidence that bitcoin will fail it doesnt work its just a joke it has no value yadi yadi yadi.  Yet virtually every headline news item related to bitcoin that happened in  were a list of things that buttcoiners in  said would never happen.  Now what will never happen?Maybe bitcoin will never be  again?  Maybe it will never hit ?  Maybe amazon will never accept it?  Maybe the price will never stabalize?  Maybe it wont ever be able to do  transactionssecond?  By what does one measure bitcoins success?  Because as someone who has been watching bitcoin since the prettyearly days bitcoin is already more successful than I had hoped it would be by now by a pretty significant margin.I see buttcoiners just like i see religious fanatics despite all evidence to the contrary they hold onto their pet dogmas.. just instead of the world being  years old in this case the dogma is bitcoin is stupid and cannot ever succeed.Cryptocurrency is here forever Ive bought plane tickets and furniture and drugs and dollars with bitcoin and I could do it again tomorrow.  Are a lot of people in the bitcoin community delusional as fuck?  Absolutely and if you guys stuck to that I might be able to have more than the tiniest shred of respect. But the reality is that buttcoiners as a whole are way more delusional than bitcoiners are as a whole.I get downvoted regularly in this sub the better point or argument I make the more my comments get downvoted.  This is to be expected when people are acting on dogma rather than evidence.  Ive seen your others posts and you seem to have a shred of integrity which is why I allowed myself to write this longass rant.  broken logic and dogma being passed as evidence makes my blood boil so I cant help trolling the shit out of myself in this subreddit but from one human to another  this community would look a lot less stupid if it stuck to reasonable arguments rather than dumb shit like hurrr durr some bitcoiner thinks zynga is a big brand and actually countered the valid counterarguments people leave in here with logic and discussion rather than just burying with downvotes anything that doesnt circle jerk them. for examples look at my recent post history for any of my comments below  karma,Buttcoin,cn60tel,0,t5_2sngy

This is why I cant stand a lot of you douchebags on this subreddit. If I want to control my own money its none of your fucking business how I do it. I dont need you to protect me from myself. gt Extending on the idea of consumer protection bitcoin completely distorts the concept of trust in financial markets. Users claim it is trustless but only in the sense that the actual transmission of money is trustless. The actual transmission of goods and services require a greater deal of trust because bitcoin cannot be reversed and proof of ownership is so complicated. Right now I can reasonably do business with a vendor who I dont need to trust because I have the ability to pursue a chargeback. No third party bitcoin service could reasonably or reliably provide the same level of protection simply because of the way bitcoin is designed.Silk road worked fairly well as a reputationbased system. Maybe some dont want the overhead associated with the ability to perform a chargeback. Id like the choice instead of some douchebag who thinks they know everything dictating terms. gt Decentralization of a currency make it subject to wild swings in value hurting everyone involved with that economy. Im generally a fan of the Euro but look how difficult it was for Greece to escape recession because they were tied to the Euro. Look at how damaging it was to Germany that they couldnt control the value of their currency during the economic downturn. China was able to thrive during the last global economic downturn in large part because they had such comprehensive currency controls. I dont necessarily agree with the long term consequences of Chinas decisions but it just goes to show what kind of power currency controls have.Sorry but you have been brainwashed. gt I really dont think its smart to put any real a wealth into a currency that can be irreversibly hacked or stolen.Here you might be right but you might be very wrong since fortunes have been made.

The case can be made that this was the last legitimate price bitcoin went for and this  crash is the community slowly coming to their realization. Im not even sure the  reflects a fair market value  it too was fueled by rampant speculation and was also illiquid because of hoarding but at least is was bought and held by people that were more involved and knowledgeable in crypto and intended to stay around a while.Why are they mum? An overwhelming majority paid more than that and absolutely did not expect this to happen. I wouldnt be talking either. They also like us have NO IDEA what is happening at this exact moment. Its clear as day to us the overarching motive of selling in the past year but why this week over any other? IDK. I think its too big and abrupt to be a shift in ecosystem like mining becoming marginally unprofitable or a major buy in price being hit or some such thing BUT the rush to sell now before dumping continues is certainly an understandable motivation for any person to have. ,Buttcoin,cnogina,1,t5_2sngy

2972679,0,t1_co5s9up,gt While I hold a radical view that programmers are the modern equivalent of factory labour.You need to make a distinction here between the different terms. There are coders programmers and software developersengineers. A coder someone who can write some code to accomplish a task think some Python script to aggregate data or some Excel macros. A programmer is someone who is able to write code of professional quality. A software engineer is someone who is a programmer but who also understands things like software design project management and communication.Nevertheless I mostly agree with you. Lots of programming is simply grunt work. Its more about choosing the appropriate language the best frameworks libraries and design patterns and then putting it all together This is straight forward for probably at least  of what you are doing. Almost all of the problems you encounter have already been solved. Modern software development is mostly like building something from Legos. That is unless you work for say Google or FB and face problems like scaling your architecture to infinity and actually have to invent novel solutions for problems previously unheard of.

Those ideas never gained much traction in those forms instead gaining traction in lowcost devices but it is fairly interesting in how close such a concept was and how important the web was back then facebook machines only need a web browser after all let alone now because you can practically run an OS in the cloud these daysnever mind the fact that there were literally OSes in the cloud unfortunately most seem to have died outthat all being said JS is still a tiny bit silly choice for something like this in my opinion but I dont feel it is as completely unreasonable as everyone is making it out to be,Buttcoin,co6n30g,2,t5_2sngy

What this means is that consensus will never happen and true change in bitcoin is impossible.In other words it is completely impossible to change bitcoin at this point.

3639194,0,t1_cq6zlt4,I read the complaint. They installed transformers and infrastructure to support GAWs requirements then entered in a one year contract. GAW cancelled in January only ish months after service started. GAW only paid one bill. So theyre recovering the installation cost k plus contract fee k plus power costs k.Service was started October  and ended January . There was barely any time to even have service here.Also notable is the k doesnt include interest and attorney fees which theyre also asking for.Edit Oh and because they cancelled in January thats probably when they decided to end the scam. Gonna go back and look at statements they made around then...Edit  Apparently they had MW of infrastructure installed. Impressive. They failed to deliver some mining hardware didnt they? I dont remember. Anyway if so I know where it is...Edit  Looks like they drew something like MW over the course of those  months. Wat. I might be reading the bill wrong.

3758060,0,t1_cqkcsaz,Intel have a  nm node planned which seems to be on track. What happens after that is unclear. Last time I saw any numbers they said that quantum tunnelling would be a problem somewhere between  and  nm. Next full node after Cannonlake for Intel is  nm. Its unclear if theyll try that. ARM has gone out and said that  was the sweet spot and any smaller than that costs more than you gain. More and more advanced D structures could solve some of the problems with leakage currents and stuff like that but not all. NAND circuits have started going back to  nm class processes from  nm. They increased density by stacking NAND cells on top of each other instead. The charge was insanely small in each bit at  nm.BTW the limit for UV light is  nm so actually producing masks for the lithography is pretty darn tricky. Next step in the spectrum is Xrays and that is not very practical because the energy is so high you might end up destroying more than you create. As I said making ICs at that level is witchcraft.

3763233,0,t1_cql7erm,gtYeah I guess I should apologize the white people part is a bit of an overhasty generalization on my part. But whenever I read about saviours coming to rescue the unbanked Third Worlder I tend to get very irritated.Its understandable. African MiddleEastern and the Indian cultures have not had good relations with many of the first world nations for many many reasons.Nor is it actually a slur per say since its not uncommon to refer to idiots like this as rich white kid which is intended to invoke privilege even if he isnt technically white. These people are simply at best ignorant or most likely just young fools. gtFor a middleclass person like me we do have credit cards and the like. For the real peasants I doubt they want to use arcane Internet money and regardless of our socioeconomic status we do have ways to transfer money across countries that doesnt involve Western Union. Its not like were using catapults to deliver our cash before someone invented Bitcoin.Its...sort of a problem in US culture. You know how the US likes to meddle with other countries and pit two people against each other for its own benefits? Well thats the Federal government. Thats international policy. Your average American even myself to a degree doesnt care what happens in Pakistan. America is culturally one that looks inward. So most of Americas idea of other countries comes from their limited experience with it which tends to be TV. Not because Americans are stupid or believe everything we see on TV but simply because its prevalent and the fastest and easiest means of portraying an idea.So when we see someone talking about Africa its not an actual look at your countryits a look at the poverty stricken areas of foreign countries where halfstarved children are paraded around to guilt Americans into sending small portions of their wealth overseas.While this is meant as a charitable act it also portrays all of Africa as...and I mean no offense as well a poverty stricken shithole that any sensible person would have abandoned long ago. The US has next to no idea about Africas culture or political goals save for what we absorb through other people or portrayals. In this case Halfhanded was raised in a world that has no concept of your country its pros and cons and believes that hes some sort of enlightened philosopher traveling back six centuries to bring civilization to the barbaric masses. And hes suggesting bitcoin because he has no idea how money actually works or why its used. Nor is it a sustainable concept because human society relies upon trust. I mean the idea of a trustless currency is just incompatible with the world at large. I mean think of it. Do you trust your parents? Your friends? Your banker? The guy driving the bus you can bet that theres a good chance that halfhanded has never had to use public transportation!? Even your politicians some of them you place some trust in. The entire concept of wealth itself is based upon trust. Society is based upon trusta trust in the agreement that all humans in your society have committed to.As an aside though if the countries in your area of the world wish to give a proper portrayal to the US your countries need to start exporting your culture here. This is basically what Japan did.

Im on mobile now so I cant link it but ukarmanaut a long time reddit user and mod of many top subs called Reddit out for being full of shit. Basically it boiled down to the fact that Reddit is incredibly ambiguous about their policies and inconsistent with enforcement.Changetip is definitely a great example of this. They regularly break rules have been shadowbanned several times and violate policies on paying users to promote material. Even still reddit refuses to take action. If Facebook started a bot to integrate Facebook payments in reddit do you think it would last? What if Facebook paid users to promote Facebook payments on reddit? It wouldnt last a second. Somehow changetip doesnt have to follow the rules of everyone else. Even when we ignore the bitcoin angle for a second changetip is a prime example of how completely fucked reddit the company is. ,Buttcoin,cr11sdp,9,t5_2sngy

3930494,0,t3_35gwx2,Short answer I dont think theres any reason to believe side chains are coming anytime soon and theres little reason to believe theyre the fixall a lot of people think they will be.Long answer Designing and implementing sidechains are no easy tasks. In theory theyre a way to make bitcoin marginally less shitty than it currently is but there are a lot of roadblocks in the way. First and foremost has anyone even done a proof of concept of a functioning sidechain? If they were coming soon wed at least have some sort of early code being tested. As it stands there isnt even a clear idea about how exactly theyd be integrated beyond he most basic conceptual idea.I mean look at the whole block size debate. Thats a comparatively easy protocol change and look how that implementation has polarized the community. The block size problem has been a known thing for years and people are just now starting to seriously look at fixing it. Itll be at least another several months at the absoluteminimum before that problem is addressed. How can you expect a hard fork to integrate the tools needed for side chains if the friggin block size issue cant be quickly resolved?At this point side chains are just vaporware.,Buttcoin,cr4b8w5,10,t5_2sngy

4191658,0,t3_38strz,gt When printing was invented experts said that printed books would never have mass adoption because the learningcurve to read was much too steep for the average peasant they would forever rely on priests and scholars to do the reading.Uh which experts is he referring to? If anything one major criticism of the printed word was that it was too simple to produce and use meaning that individuals would rely more on books to store information rather than keeping it in their minds and passing it on. This was not a new argument at the time either early Christian book culture emphasized slow oral readings of texts to promote rumination on the words and solidify written knowledge which was considered too ephemeral to be left in books.Moreover this seems to suggest that people depended on priests and scholars in order to be read to. Although literacy now is much higher than it was in the middle ages European book culture was still very robust even before the invention of the printed word. By that time the art of copying manuscripts had largely shifted from monasteries to secular copying houses just to keep up with the demand for books. Even if you were illiterate in medieval Europe there were plenty of places one could access literature outside of church mystery plays public readings of poems ballads just to name a few.All this to say nobody was arguing what this guy says they were. And if they were it wouldnt have gained much currency because enough people were literate to know otherwise.Its bad enough Bitcoiners buy their own underdog story.

And Bitcons continuous transaction capacity is considerably more than enough to handle the continuous transaction volume on the network at this time. gtgtAnd then we get to things like primarilyoffchain companies e.g. Coinbase Circle and ChangeTip...gtAh yes. The old not actually using Bitcoin solution.You can do better than this. You skipped over about  of my comment and cherrypicked the end as if it were the crux of the point. The inclusion of offchaintransactions was not the focus of the comment and you know it. Its particularly disingenuous to skip the entire section about my initial analysis emphasis on transaction which are confirmed within  block and the usability of zeroconfirmation transactions to instead fly straight to the part where you can say lol PayPal! as if its a valid rebuttal. Furthermore if Bitcoin were suddenly adopted en masse enough to put a serious continual strain on the network capacity services like Coinbase and Circle et al would certainly handle a giant percentage of that volume internally. You can say well then thats not really Bitcoin and talk about how if you dont own the private keys you dont own the coins but at the end of the day its evident that a lot of people would accept counterparty risk and allow their coins to be heldmanaged offchain.

The bag holders who havent accepted their losses and moved on by now will most likely continue to plead and offer small amounts of cash to the few remaining developers left for features to add value and bring xpy back to where it belongs. In a while some wise guy will most likely try and start a sticker campaign because obviously thatll fix things. If any of these idiot people had done any research or critical thinking at all before gleefully showering money in Garzas general direction of course theyd have realised that this is really just the same as the fate of every single crypto and it was always going to be so with paycoin. There are countless other alt communities that this has happened to along with Bitcoin as the big daddy example of a giant bubble followed by a crash then stagnant growth and unworkable delusional dreams.

5291564,0,t1_cvo0o9v,Its hard to argue with your hypotheticals. You are essentially talking about a possible future and Im talking about what is currently happening. Currently the network is permissionless for all intents an purposes. Whether attack vectors exist for extremely powerful adversaries is another question. Likewise the argument that the government could control the blockchain but just chooses not to is a pretty big stretch. The smallblockers are arguing for a second PP layer Lightning for example that would create an incentives for small transactions to happen off the blockchain and be merged into larger chunks that settle on the blockchain. This second layer would have the same properties just put some of the processing load on individual nodes until they combine multiple transactions and settle. This is a strategy for increasing the capacity of the network algorithmically. Large purchases like a car for example would likely still occur directly on the blockchain. No one is arguing to prevent any transactions from happening its just a debate about the most efficient way to do more transactions and keep decentralized properties of bitcoin intact.,Buttcoin,cvo250q,1,t5_2sngy

5408968,0,t1_cw31fj3,gtWhat the rbitcoin mods are doing is not moderation. The goal of moderation is to keep the discussion civil and focused on the topic irrespective of the opinions or the implications of facts. That is exactly the point yes. And what theyre trying.gtWhat the mods are doing now is strictly censorship suppressing facts and opinions that displease a certain side of the debate and could cause other readers to change their opinions too.Not accurate. When factions are so divided that they will abandon all other topics to deviate everything into a discussion they dont intend to give any ground on the sub becomes completely uncivil and sterile.The main reason that there wont ever be an agreement in that topic is that they dont recognise the validity of each others target function.One faction believes decentralisation is crucial and is above throughput. The other wants to feel happy about putting coffees in the chain if you allow me to be facetious in the description. Given that difference the tradeoffs each want will never match. This was already acknowledged so the sub simply wants to move on and talk about other topics. The losing side wont easily give up. Things are going as expected but allowing the previous levels of pointless flaming as when XT was announced is an even worse scenario. I fully believe so and like me the majority of mods and all the users you dont see complaining most. Nodes and miners also are very indicative that sub noise doesnt equate real support. They are many I dont doubt that but they are a minority within Bitcoin proponents maybe not among Butters. Check out the forums run by Roger Ver or Cypherdoc. Or the uncensored alternative subs. They are a loud motley crew but really not more than a few dozens.EDIT to add a point.As a corollary to the fundamental rift in the target function itself objective there is no possible debate or discussion. There are no sides to a debate. The idea of an agreement is hopeless therefore theres only the attempts to subvert the discussion and the resistance to these attempts. They also dont want to move elsewhere because they are aware of their limitations. Bitcoin will continue just fine without them and they know it.,Buttcoin,cw320yc,1,t5_2sngy

Operant conditioning is about responsereinforcement and has nothing to do with any broader realizations and understanding of any larger concepts. Researchers have used operant conditioning to successfully train pigeons to distinguish between the art of Monet and Picasso  which is amazing right? But extrapolating this to them learning to understand the aesthetic beauty of art is ridiculous and thats what Andreas did here.Im always weary of people like Andreas who are comfortable in the role as an expert despite not having the necessary training and education to actually be one. I can forgive his speaking as an expert about Bitcoin since its a new field but when he willingly speaks as an expert in economics politics behaviour and so on... I cant really forgive this. Being comfortable being considered as an expert by your audience when you are not one and speaking to that audience from that level of authority is flat out unethical in my view.Heres an example from my own life and how I came to think this way about people like this. Shortly after graduation I accepted a medical position on an island that was relatively distant from the larger medical resources people on the mainland had access to. While I was there I was incredibly uncomfortable with my role as the resident expert in my field because simply put the people there deserved better than I was capable of giving at that point in my career. There were very real consequences to any ignorance I had because I had been labelled the expert and people listened to me as such. The discomfort I felt forced me to be honest with what I didnt know and to actively pursue better medical services from the mainland for the residents of the island. Anyone who could find themselves in such a position and be comfortable with it despite the potential for consequences in others lives I have an incredibly hard time trusting at all.,Buttcoin,cy2gojy,35,t5_2sngy

6266687,0,t1_cz1x9ps,You have a set of people who are running the same software and therefore agree as to which blocks and transactions are valid.  You ask your contacts to give you the top N blocks of the blockchain and get back two branches of the blockchain.  Then you use the branch that has the maximum proofofwork or you use the branch recommended by the majority of your  specific trusted nodes even if it is not the one with maximum proofofwork.Option  is what the bitcoin protocol tells you to do.  If you choose option  you are not using the bitcoin protocol but some other protocol.  If you follow the bitcoin protocol you get some weak guarantees which come from the assumption that most miners are greedy.  You are also weakly assured that you will be operating on the same branch that the other people who use that same software are operating.If you choose the second protocol you don t get the guarantees that the bitcoin protocol would give.  For example it may be that after your salary payment got  confirmations the majority of those peers starts to serve to you and your peers a different branch of the blockchain that is valid according your software that even has much more proof of work than the previous branch  but forks off from it  blocks earlier and shows that your salary coins went somewhere else so your salary transaction got rejected.  Because you see five of those  nodes that you trusted had been ignoring that branch and the one they had been serving to you was mined by a single maverick miner.,Buttcoin,cz1yb1s,2,t5_2sngy

Mel Brooks and Weird Al never had to ask permission for doing their parodies but they still do it because they want to show respect to the creators. Weird Al even voluntarily canceled an Eminem parody music video after spending lots of money and time on it because Eminem had gotten second thoughts about having a song he cared so much about parodied.That thread is getting lost in measuring how much of the PayPal video was stolen without stopping to consider that Fair Use covers commentary criticism and parody  not selling a rival product.,Buttcoin,czqie95,2,t5_2sngy

6638808,0,t1_d05v1u8,I hate fraud and scamming and deceptive advertising. I hate when people lose money to a con man rather than investing it in something worthwhile.But at the same time I believe in personal agency. The individual made a choice to put too much of their net worth into something extremely speculative and lost the gamble and the individual chose to kill themself. Somebody may or may not have actually given the individual bad advice. I didnt read down to the worst comments but from the best sort there was some solid advice for the OP.Its certainly possible that there was an asshole who sold him Bitcoin as a getrichquick scheme and he got in too deep as a result. But unless he was personal friends with Karpelessan that asshole is a different asshole from the one who robbed him. Doesnt make it any better theyre both crooks still the one albeit hypothetical here. But theyre both still short of being murderers.At most in fairness I think they could be accused of manslaughter by a moral as opposed to legal standard. But even for that I still think it must be recognized that the step to death was not necessary even from catastrophic financial loss. Hell though I guess that boils down to basically murderers itself...As someone who likes the notion of fair play and also thinks Bitcoin as money is interesting for what its worth we dont all operate like that. If Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency is going to thrive I do think trustworthy third parties are going to be necessary something which the Bitcoin community seems to like to ignore with a no third parties needed! third parties not included your loss sold separately attitude so that they cant take any blame.But there are a lot of people doing their best to get good advice and warnings out there. People get trapped by their greed like flies to honey though. Its just what people do. So for instance on a much smaller scale one of the Nekonauts lost some NYAN on Cryptsy despite prominent warnings everywhere including our site because the prices there were literally too good to be true and so NYAN sent there in its last stages and sold for BTC which got stuck on withdraw of course because Cryptsy hadnt been paying out for a few months by then.People do stupid things and unfortunately sometimes it cascades. Certainly there was external criminality involved here by GoxMagikarp if no one else but with no disrespect intended to the dead OP made some poor choices as well.Still a tragedy for sure as you said. I really feel for the guy and his family. I wish he would have chosen to live at least for their sake. ,Buttcoin,d060ddt,5,t5_2sngy
6643070,0,t1_d060ddt,As others have said it might not have been his own personal agency. I cant speak to any financial decisions but persons who are suicidal are rarely acting rationally. Suicidal persons may be unable to focus on the good and can only see the bad their thinking like tunnel vision that restricts life and makes the world seem small and hopeless. Time even slows down to a crawl. An agent is only at liberty to act on options they believe are available and if they see suicide as their only option is that really their free choice?Im not opposed to euthanasia or suicide but it is a tricky issue and not everyone is a good candidate. If this person was in that kind of depressed state he needed a psychiatrist before he needed a noose. Maybe it truly was his rational clear headed decision... but either way its a tragedy. Poor guy.

7154658,0,t1_d1qmydm,Its a cross between two phenomena.  If youre arguing that a thing is bad and that Bitcoin has that thing it doesnt and in fact has the opposite thing which is presumably good for Bitcoin whether were talking about deflation or inflation.  Lots of Bitcoiners dont really understand that inflationdeflation refer to the price level and not the absolute number of dollarsbitcoinsfunbux in the system.  If the economy is producing another  million worth of stuff and the money supply only increases by  million then thats deflation even though the money supply increased the price of stuff will necessarily decrease because theres only  million to pay for  million worth of stuff.Bitcoins problem is its completely untethered to the economy theres X amount of Bitcoins with a decreasing Y amount being added at regular intervals and thats it.  If the economy shrinks there could be massive inflation because the money supply cant be cut to match it.  If the economy continues to grow over the long term as it has all throughout human history well I hope the trickle of new BTC is enough to cover it.,Buttcoin,d1rewts,8,t5_2sngy

7502277,0,t1_d2u1z9t,When crypto demand rises like in late  and the market cap is rapidly expanding that implies a shortage of available coins.So what you get occurring is some of the liquidity flows into other coins also swelling their market cap. That increases miner profits so they invest into new hashrate. The higher the crypto price the more expensive the network becomes to run as the real value of miner revenues dramatically increase. The problem is you get an increase in marketable cryptocurrency due to altcoins also becoming monetized and supply not only catches up with demand but quickly overwhelms it.No mechanism exists to reduce crypto supply when demand levels off or plummets this leads to insane price volatility as a barrage of crypto searches for every decreasing amounts of fiat.Yes you are absolutely correct there is not an infinite supply of crypto that people value but there is no limit to the amount of crypto that maybe produced if demand is high enough. The problem lies in the fact that you cannot reduce supply. There is no way to extinguish crypto the way you can extinguish dollars via debt repayments or debt repudiation for example.,Buttcoin,d2uyx28,1,t5_2sngy

Second the fee market increases based on the number of transactions and willingness of the transactor to spend additional funds for a prompt confirmation. At times of high transaction volume fees increase. It is entirely in the right to say the fee market is tied to the throughput capability of the network. gtThe Fed is definitely politically drivenYou must not know much about the Fed. gtThis process doesnt bother me personally Ive profited quite handsomely from these distortions but the average person is deeply harmed by this and I have a problem with that.Describe this harm.gtFinally the notion that Greece is very different from the United States is a little magical thinking American exceptionalismNo it isnt.

8111085,0,t1_d4rmppu,gt Swaps are performed because both sides believe they have something to gain and so the transfer has greater individual utility to each party. They certainly do believe it but it does not mean that it is true.gt In cryptocurrencies people are betting their own intelligence against markets for future valuation.One would think that they would become more intelligent after losing their bet... but I think you are right usually after a loss they invest even more because they have to recover that loss too... Investing in cryptocurrencies is basically a zerosum game because they do not pay any dividends or interest and do not create any significant amout of new real wealth goods and services.  So any profit that one can make from trading them must come from the investments of other people.The use of bitcoin for real payments exchange for goods and services not for money or other crypto could be a source of value.   Investors could collect nonponzi revenue for that service by selling bitcoins to the payors then buying it back from the payees for a slightly higher price.  However only a small part of the existing bitcoins are being used for that purpose and those actual users hold them only for a short time so the revenue is small  and is likely to remain so.On the other hand part of the money that investors put into the system goes to the miners not to other investors and never comes back.  By my rough estimates the difference between the amount of money that people have spent buying bitcoins and amount that people have received by selling them is half a billion dollars or more.   When the price finally goes to zero even if it is  years from now the effect of the project will have been to burn a few billion dollars and move several billion dollars from some people to other people without a corresponding counterflow of real wealth.So every cryptocoin is actually a net negativesum game.,Buttcoin,d4rrc4i,6,t5_2sngy

8473470,0,t1_d60pxcc,Im not fixated on labor theory of value. Marx completely overemphasized labor because he was an atheist so he couldnt comprehend creation. Measuring value by labor alone is illogical. How we value things is definitely subjective however for those things to exist they must come from human labor. Show me one thing around you that is not a product of laborexcluding natural creation.Adam Smith said it best when he said all the wealth in the world has been bought and paid for by labor. Not by gold. The problem is he was apart of the Whig apparatus which was heavily involved in money lending and economic looting at the time so he starts off his theory with amazing incite but quickly drifts away into irrelevant banter about labor divisions etc. Idle capital IS IDLE because there is no labor applied to it. The societal problem we have is IDLE LABOR or labor being wasted. A huge portion of the labor force is either doing nothing or underemployed this leads to loss output in the economy.Capitalpreviously stored labor  present labor  future wealth. There is no other formula for wealth creation.The pastcapital makes contact with the presentlabor through the prudent use of credit to produce wealth. This is how the economy works. Spending money is another way of saying resource allocation.The prudent use of credit is what leads to sustained economic expansion and prudence is a virtue. Every other way leads to complete disaster as we have seen and are presently seeing worldwide. The economy must be regulated by morality not by absurd formulas pseudoeconomists have been coming up with over the last  years.A certain portion of the population is obsessed with seeing past capital grow without laboreffort. That is called USURY or compound interest and is at the absolute core of every economic disaster in the last  years. Greenspan raised interest rates by  essentially taxing homeowners so that bondholders received a larger income and the economy imploded. Economic sophistication does not depend on applying scientific methods to the economy but applying the moral law to it. People believe economics is like physics which it isnt. Economics has always belonged in moral philosophy until Adam Smith disconnected it.Had economics stayed in the realm of moral philosophy constraints on certain immoral activities would have completely prevented socialismcommunism from ever forming. However the opposite happened because you didnt need morality according to Smith instead the invisible hand would just take care of everything.This is precisely the situation the bitcoin community finds itself in. The attempt to replace morality with technology well look how that has fanned out. One disaster after another with increasing losses for the majority while a tiny minority makes out filthy rich.,Buttcoin,d60q41q,1,t5_2sngy

10106577,0,t1_dboch07,A very fair question. You have to bear in mind I operate in a niche market I only sell for cash I only sell whole numbers of BTC I have a minimum normal order size of  BTC and all buyers have to do full personal detail disclosure and sign an agreement about what they are doing. My market is serious investors who want an exposure to BTC in their stocksshares potfolio. As this is a niche market the demand is relatively limited so I find the number I sell is determined by demand rather than my desire to sell. Clearly any situation like the present tends to increase demand a lot but luckily my supply of BTC is quite able to keep up. Of course if demand becomes massive I could sell out sooner rather than later but at the current average annual rate of purchase my supply will outlast my biological end point. Currently selling at dollar equivalent of circa  per. You will see this is a premium to exchange prices it should be obvious why. If demand were to become astronomical and I would be quite happy to sell out at  but I expect curiosity about the future will lead me to keep one block  BTC even if the rest are all gone.  ,Buttcoin,dbowctt,1,t5_2sngy

Any other exchange miner group or investor class is wholly dependent on what Chinese bitcoiners happen to decide to do that day and the exchange rate from actual money to Bitcoin in any other currency than the Chinese Yuan is essentially random and disconnected from what is occurring in Chinese exchanges.Most purchases using Bitcoin are for illegal drugs child pornography and money laundering all of which can engage the purchaser into a long involved and expensive legal fight when they are caught.Without the Internet and people donating their computers and bandwidth Bitcoin is totally useless. Mining requires constant connectivity to ensure that only one chain of transactions is the real chain that matters and without miners no transactions between Bitcoin users are processed. Transactions between users line up in a queue until some miner accidentally gets the right number and some transactions are processed.In the current state Internetrequired coins have been nothing but pumpanddump schemes. Bitcoin has been successful due to its acceptance by drug and child porn sellers and other criminal organizations.I had a million US Dollars so I converted them all to Bitcoin and now I have  US dollars.

Pinning all our hopes on a technology that doesnt exist that has no indication of a solid timeline that we inherently cannot predict is not reasonable. AGI will not save us.

Redditers are always moving to the next reason for a price pump when one fails they completely ignore it even existed. Watch in  week the word ETF will never again be mentioned or heard of on the forum.If you look at daily exchange volume exfake it is still x higher than late . This means bitcoin is much more liquid hence the decrease in volatility.Markets move in waves they do not move based on events or else charts would look like updown and sideways lines.Bull markets are driven by persistent fear. Look at the now SP rally all time you heard bearish things that the economy dollar was going to crash too much debt blah blah. Those who ignored the noise and bought made out like bandits. Bitcoin sentiment is no where near the ultra bull levels in late . I remember late  everyone had k price targets and there was mass adoption occurring. Right now you open bitcoin reddit and its just blocksize fears ETF failure fears. So for me this is still ripe to set new all time highs. Bull markets die with optimism and positive developments.

It can be raised a trillionfold even but that would require a bit more changes to the code  namely replacing some bit integer fields and variables by bit ones  And infinitely many coins just like it can be created at practically zero cost.Bitcoins value is sustained only by the hope of naive investors.
