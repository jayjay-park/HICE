8583867,0,t1_d6ekb5f,But that would void the experiment. You want to see how many users are going to leave the service as a result of a future change. Users are willing to put up with a lot so for controversial changes you really want them to have no other choice but to accept change or leave the service. If people can just optout everyone would do so within the first day and you would not learn anything from it. Ultimately the current approach might cost a few members but the data gained from it is far more valuable to a company. ,beta,d6ekioj,2,t5_2qhxg

8641687,0,t1_d6ltgbn,When you open a reddit.com tab itll check to see if theres an open websocket same thing live threads use connection by reading the heartbeatrBeatingHeart timestamp in localstorage. If there isnt one itll open a websocket connection that just sits there waiting for a message broadcast. On the server side when a message has been sent to a user itll broadcast the new message event to that websocket. That browser tab will then get that broadcast and send a notification to the user that theres a new message and writes it to localstorage to let other reddit tabs know so they can update the inbox count. Websockets are awesome! This is still in beta but well keep an API in mind ,beta,d6ltjqw,6,t5_2qhxg
