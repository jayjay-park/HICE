6368081,0,t1_czcqynh,I believe you are talking about Tilray. I cant believe you havent figured out yet that their price by THC  and not shelf quality AA AAA Top shelf doesnt equate to potency on your end.They are pretty good until you come accross a really dry batch. Tilrays  THC diamond OG bone dry poorly cured will be weaker than their  THC Hindu Kush because its huge dank bud sticky and fresh top shelf.Dispensaries price by shelf quality doesnt equate to high THC  either. Just pretty looking sticky smelly buds.Then a high  THC indica may seem weak to you.Ive been a member of  or so LPs. THC  means nothing if the cannabis is grown dried or cured poorly or the strains genetics dont work for you.For example if you need a body buzz knockout sleepy type pain killer a pure sativa strain no matter how high the THC will not do it for you.,TODispensaries,czdhbub,0,t5_3b661

7167977,0,t3_4dlesr,I couldnt name an absolute favourite yet and I still have several places I want to check out. At the moment Im really enjoying watching as things unfold. It should be an interesting spring and summer in this year of the dispensary. Ill name some I think are worth mentioning based on a few criteria.Best Quality for Price QualimedsIve yet to find a place that can consistently match the quality of flowers and prices offered here but that doesnt mean such a place isnt out there. Strains I have enjoyed recently AAAA Rockstar Blue Lambs Bread Amnesia Haze.Best Atmosphere The Care CentreSuper friendly staff the only dispensary that allows members to medicate on the premises and they can provide you with anything you might need to do so. This would be a major relief for anyone using cannabis to treat a very painful or otherwise debilitating condition. With the changes in legislation regarding smokingvaping indoors taking effect it remains to be seen how long this will continue. Best Delivery WeLeafOk so I havent actually tried Olive Alternative Medicine and dont know any others but my experience with WeLeaf was very positive. Delivery took a while about  hours but free same day delivery of weed this good is worth the wait. The prices are reasonable and what I like most about that is that nothing not even AAAA flower is above g. So youre not paying g to try something. The WiFi White Fire OG and Pineapple Super Silver Haze were goddamn awesome. Best in Kensington Canadian Compassion Dispensary I like these guys because they have great flowers and whenever I drop by they are excited to tell me about some new strain or another. Their prices are comparable to other places g and like most other places there are some strains youll see pretty much everywhere else and some you generally wont. I really enjoyed their Watermelon and their SFV OG. Also mg THC caps are available for . Best Prices Medical ClubThe SoCos are too far away and I dont drive so I cant comment on them. Ive only been to the Danforth Medical Club location. There you will find super friendly staff and other funky patrons too. Medical Club offers the best prices Ive seen with all flower going for around g. That being said the potency of the strains Ive tried so far is lacking and the flowers are a tad on the dry side. Those things aside its very well grown pot. I especially appreciate the fact that it burns clean in a joint and leaves a nice lightgray ash. The thing that will bring me back to Medical Club is their selection of CO extracted oils which come in handy little syringes. I got a free syringe of Lemon Haze oil when I joined up and its great. I can squirt it into my vape pen onto papers onto a freshly packed bowl whatever! There are plenty of other concentrates and edibles to check out as well.There are many other places I could mention but Ive been doing this for an hour instead of something more crucial so time to wrap it up. Id be interested to hear what anyone else thinks of these places.,TODispensaries,d1sxj9k,8,t5_3b661

From everything being said by the people making decisions the dispensaries are not going to be allowed which sucks but I have to keep this in perspective  the government is legalizing marijuana for recreational use which is pretty cool. They likely feel pressure to do it as controlled as possible so the fight for dispensaries will likely continue. Maybe as the people who are still scared of pot realize that it is not a big deal theyll warm up to the idea of dispensaries but it does not appear that at first they will be part of the plan.

The RCMP could enforce the law but giving them the resouces to provide exceptional frontline enforcement in jurisdictions that lack enforcement would be chaotic and a waste of resources.

Thai Stick weed is made by taking good Landrace Thai sativa and letting dry on a stick. As it dried and the resin became gooey it kinda formed a sticky mass that you would peel off when dried.Theres a technique to it as well so the buds stick. Its really just a good way of storing your bud Imagine just peeling off a piece you need.I havent seen Thai Stick since the late s. If someone indeed knows where to get the real thing which IMHO would be IMPORTED Id like to get my sticky hands on it.,TODispensaries,db6xd3u,8,t5_3b661
