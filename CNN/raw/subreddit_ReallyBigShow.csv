No wonder Ditka hated him Chris Fedor  just a total twit who cant get enough of watching The Bachelor still orders chicken fingers at restaurants and is completely arrogant.

7744686,0,t3_4l3622,Subreddits become an echo chamber. Someone who honestly loves a lot about the show would come here once and never return. It has to be the case that the only people that stick around this subreddit on some level enjoy bitching about the showotherwise they wouldnt be here. In the same way the Browns subreddit is an echo chamber of positivity until the last three games of every season. It doesnt mean the Browns actually have a bright future it is just they way that group of people came together. Similarly the negativity here doesnt prove the show is objectively bad. Some people here lightly joke about a show they like but it sounds really negative. Other people honestly come here to sincerely bitch about the quality of a show they get for free. The obvious solution to the problem these people complain about is to stop listening to a show they supposedly hate. I mean if its so bad why are they listening at all? And why are the haters so serious the show is just light sports filler thats a nice background noise.  The bottom line there are weirdos who like the show too much and they are even worse people.  This place just happens to be a group that has a hateobsession with the show.  Its weird but haters gonna hate. ,ReallyBigShow,d3mij69,1,t5_3b8g5
