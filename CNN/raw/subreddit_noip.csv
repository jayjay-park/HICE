4423580,0,t3_3bnehs,The year that a capable consumerfriendly D printer  scanner setup is the big trendy Christmas gift item is the year IP starts to fall apart in a public and obvious way.Copyright and patents have been publicly tolerated because for the vast majority of people theyre abstract things that only indirectly affect you.
