1459093,0,t1_ciz0mvr,I really dont think you should be too worried about them getting worn down. Theyre kids and the tour managers know it very well. this european leg was just  shows. Thats childs play. I honestly expected them to pull double the shows but im happy to see that they didnt try to. I already posted another longass post where i talked about how the managers have a very serious responsibility to the girls families and the girls themselves. Theyre minors and theyre impressionable at their current age. That the girls are so functional happy and outgoing is a clear sign that the people around them are genuinely good at looking out for their well fare.I think you should only really start worrying if Babymetal is still around when Yuimoa come of age. because THATS when the possibility of squeezing the group into outrageous schechules become a possibility. as soon as Koba and the parents have a shitdown with the girls and hand over contract responsibilities to the girls and their manager still Koba theyre fair game for monetary exploitation.But i think hope that Japanese sensibilities around this sort of thing is less savagely capitalistic in nature from American sensibilities.,BABYMETAL,ciz67zc,3,t5_2xpsy

1484383,0,t1_cj2bdmn,My bias influences the meaning of the song so I may not be the best person. If anyone can addshed more info please do so. Please read this with a word of caution This is just my opinion at the moment. I have not caught any Japanese mythology references besides the red string inside the lyrics but I have not done my research.The song to me talks about sacrifice love even in the passing of a  years. Even if the body perishes they will keep of fighting  protecting for the one they love. The only line of the song that the western audience may not understand is the red string Im using DuMetals translations as I have it open Even if the red thread flowing in my hand breaks I still feel we are tied. The two people connected by the red string are destined lovers regardless of time place or circumstances. As the circumstances tear the two apart the bond is still there. This can be taken as this lifetime they were not united. They will keep on following their destiny being reborn over and over across a millennia to find fight for so they can be with the one they love. My interpretation and understanding of the song is heavily tainted due to the Folklore presented during the Legend show. My image of the song is tied to when SUMETAL turns into the crimson knight to dispel the HipHop singing BLACK METAL back to the metal sprit during the show. When KOBAMETAL pairs this up with the leaked bootleg of Endless Rain tentative my thoughtsunderstanding of the lyric may change. I have read tidbits of what the folklore using the songs but at this moment I can not recall it confidently to post here. ,BABYMETAL,cj2cco6,6,t5_2xpsy

Meanwhile this comment made me wonder if or when the next Kawaii Metal band will come up to the worldand is it possible for the band to be successful?  I know there are some Japanese female metal bands out there but they dont seem to be qualified for Kawaii Metal to compete with Babymetal. May be the Kpop try to imitate it first? Then may be blond girls? Black girls?  After all the question is that this new genre of Metal can be survived? Or Babymetal is the only Kawaii Metal ever?,BABYMETAL,cjh9q58,1,t5_2xpsy

When i finished assimilating this I was hoping for something like this. I wanted BM to go hardcore on the audience and play their heavier songs but it seems they cant even handle some of the sofer ones xD. They should have opened up with Death and follow with CMIYC gtNobody should be mad about this reviews theyre LGs fans and I dont how you could expect to be open minded about music. They wont like something that isnt in english and isnt constantly showcased to them. If they fail to notice how the kami band are skilled musicians or how much skill it takes to be singing and dancing at the same time while Suzuka is a better vocalist than Lady Gaga there isnt much of a case getting mad at them. And about that Lady Starlight this is the first time Ive heard of her but I respect her for pissing off so much people xD.

She has been spotted at concerts since Budokan dressed up as Babymetal went to a book signing to get Mikio Fujiokas autograph and pictures with him got herself a ...METAL name and has made cover videos. So Obviously a serious Babymetal addict already despite her very young age... so of course she just had to be there at Summer Sonic too. She evidently is an even bigger fan than many of us here actually.

Yes they never played in overseas metal festivals... But they were actually quite active on the scene even as early as  years ago in Japan proper. Theyre no Perfume or G with their almost ubiquitous recognition but I dont think they have to be.

2269768,0,t1_cl63rvr,I have indulged in metal music not a true metalhead and have always respected The talent that It takes tlay metal music.  I was not into Jpop or idol music But have always been open to all kinds of music as long as I liked it and has a good beat.  I came to BABYMETAL through YouTubers react probably as most had and thought it a bit weird but liked the music and the dancing.  I dismissed it and carried on.  A few months ago I found myself checking out BM again and realized they had more songs... Now I am hooked... After checking into it more I found Karens Girls and finally SG.  I found that more than the music and dancing it was the girls and their friendships interactions and personalities that intrigued me the most. I actually look forward to the.posts about their personalities likes and yes the kawaiiness.  But I do love the music and my BABYMETALSG playlist pumps me up through the night while stocking groceries and I am not afraid to play it loud or put my kitsune up in front of my coworkers...

2311942,0,t3_2lread,Id have to agree with you on some of those points. I do blame the venue for the pisspoor queue management they should have had way more staff outside and having the vip queue next to the queue for ticket collection just caused chaos. Dont count on having a vip ticket getting you a better place either. I ended up about fourth in the vip entrance queue more by luck than judgement. Even after picking up vip merch and buying other stuff I was still fifth or sixth in line waiting to get on to the main floor but somehow when I got down to the stage there were about thirty people already there. I could have stayed in the second row but as usual everyone was about a foot taller than me and I wouldnt have seen anything I dont blame anyone for that Im just really short so Im used to it I retreated to the first set of barriers next to a couple of girls who were even shorter than me and thought I would get a decent if not perfect view but as the show started more and more people pushed their way in front who were all taller. A couple of guys stood right in front of the girls I was next to had a conversation with them even wished one of them a happy birthday but then carried on blocking their view without a second thought.When the show started so did the moshing. Dont get me wrong its a big part of the crowd participation and I was glad it happened but when you dont want to be a part of it it gets really annoying really quickly.  Again I blame the venue. If they had taken out the barriers there would have been more room for a better organised pit.After about three songs I had to retreat to the right hand side fortunately although Im short Im no weakling so I actually ended up being a snowplough for others who wanted to exit. I got a better view from the side but youre right the sound wasnt as good there. I still had a great time and got a few decent photos just not as close as I would have liked. Most of my issues cant be solved unless I have a sudden growth spurtwhich is unlikely or BM start insisting on arranging the audience SG style but that wouldnt be fair on people who happen to be tall.I think next time they play London Im going to have to choose what sort of experience I want from the night and it may mean joining you on the balcony. Okay I wont be a close as I would like but Im one those people who is happier watching the performance than being part of it.TLDR Didnt have it as bad as you but had some frustrations.

After viewing videos from some of you guys im pretty sure it was just a bad spot.We were on the left side and it was exactly as you described it was kinda irritating. The sound levels were so bad the girls mics drowned out a lot of the instruments. still cant figure out if it was a bad sound tech or just a shit spot we were in however Ive been in a similar position at Brixton before without any sound issues.gti dont feel like i even was there. I dont feel like ive now heard the music livegtAnd the rest of your post.This is pretty much exactly how I felt after the show the same kinda feeling you would have if you stupidly decided to stay at the hotel instead of going to the gig. I wish Id got there earlier. The combo of walking round London for  hours Queuing for  hours pissed wet through the unenthusiastic crowd in my area and the dodgy sound quality in my area put me in a bad mood which isnt the best state of mind to be in during such a short set.I had a decent time and Im definitely coming back next time theyre in the UK.

Id say Babymetal wins respect from me because I can go from Amon Amarth to Babymetal to Agonist and it holds its own very well in the mix.If I talk about Babymetal its generally explaining what it is or what they have accomplished.

Thats why its usually a bad idea to translate songs word for word or sentence for sentence. It sounds forced.

So that agencies or artists will not makes a red by live concert but in the other hand the fee is not so high.  It is not unprofitable but it does not have high profitability as people would imagine for both promoter amp agent and you cant host a kind of live concert in monthly basis.

He maybe a douchebag for doing that and rightly deserves a proper thrashing but killing him isnt the answer. Babymetal concerts should be known for fun and a mind blowing time not for random fan death although he probably deserved it.Also we all have cameras on our cell phones. He would be filmed and identified as the dumbass of the year on you tube or win some other type of award nobody wants. His nickname for life on Youtube would be Pissboy Moron or something like that.

3993596,0,t1_crbhbvv,During the extended Kami band intro techs were scrambling around the stage and the band were gesturing at them to make adjustments. Im not sure CMIYC was planned to be the opener but suspect they had to start on time and hadnt finalized the set up. That extended solo was just cover.I saw a set list tweeted that had CMIYC as the second song so I think this confirms my suspicion.Also Just after the intro and Sus prelude to IDZ Mikios guitar went out completely. He and a tech were scrambling furiously. It looked like a problem with the cabling to a pedal. But they got it all plugged in and he gave the audience a big smile and plowed forward.,BABYMETAL,crbi4p4,6,t5_2xpsy
4001811,0,t1_crcdlfu,While i can agree that a band has to cater to its audience i think some bands go and overdo it. Dragonforce are constantly remaking the same song and Iron Maiden has ONE highpace song over the past  albums. I fucking LOVE that but its getting very uniform. The latest Nightwish album gave me the sickest case of Deja vu ever recorded.Catering to the existing audience can get a band stuck and burn their audience out on them. While Metallica might have abandoned their audience they were already stagnating as it was.gt What really matters at the end of the day is the bands dont owe anyone shit fans dont own so defending them is not a right its a choice.Amen to that. Which is why i am baffled that you said that BM needs to start giving back. How? The girls are tied by higher authority and said authority are tied by the simple fact that theyre minors. That has SO MANY connotations. One being laws about childlabor hindering late working hours and the fact that ultimately everything has to be run by their parents. You wont see direct interactions such as meet and greets and with their level of english it wont be gratifying anyway.Then theres the blatant consumer exploitation. But even then the consumer is free to not buy every release at their own discretion. These are the two areas i perceive as places where BM is lacking and i dont see either getting changed for both good and incredibly bad reasons. Could you elaborate on what you meant?,BABYMETAL,crcfrun,3,t5_2xpsy

I used to be into all that hardcore street thug music because that was the environment I was surrounded by before I decided to change my life.Being a music producer the first thing that surprised me about BABYMETAL was the amazing production quality of the music. Its sonically one of the best albums I have heard in my life. Every instrument is crystal clear and equalized to near perfection and Sus vocals are some of the most beautiful vocals I ever heard.I know I trip people out now when my playlist goes from Three  Mafia Tear Da Club Up to Sakura Gakuin Heart No Hoshi LOL.Oh and I highly recommend to see them perform live.

We THE ONE are more or less addictedobessed lol and like to watchget all DVDsBDs and CDs but what does this offer to the regular fan dont know how to describe it better?  I dont see the importance of releasing yet another live CD for the general public which offers only  new song. You can get the studio album and live Budokan Red Night. Same as for the shows you can get IDZ Legend  Budokan and Live in London.  Another point could be the fact of Awadama Fever being featured on the album and the SSA show.

4929123,0,t1_cufpokm,Thanks for that. And I had thought that the Hindu religion was more likely the source of the multiarmed goddess. Everything you say is very plausible. For me though after a brief rooting through Wikopedia it started to get complicated. There is a thousandarmed Buddha named Avalokitevara who is depicted variously as either male or female but not both. In Chinese Buddhism this particular Buddha is depicted as female named Guanyin Kannon in Japanese apparently which has some sort of significance to the how the Canon camera company got its name who puts the departed into the heart of a lotus for transport from this mortal realm to the western pure land of Sukhavati yes this gets weirder by the second. This is by the way all new to me and I guess this may explain why the lotus flower appears in the illustration. So continuing Avalokitevara also means sound perceiver or the one who looks down upon the sound reference to SuMetal in her commanding position on stage?. Apparently the sounds are the cries of sentient beings who need help. Yup SuMetal certainly brought me back into the heavy metal fold after many decades lost in the wilderness. Clearly my cries were heard by a being possessed of great power. Finally one story attributed to Avalokitevara is that she was on a quest to free all sentient beings from reincarnation many doovers of life until we get it right if I understand the concept. As a result of her overexertion her head split into  pieces. Another Buddha gave her  heads and a thousand arms so that she could reach out to all that needed her. A Tibetan version of the story pegs it at eight arms each with an implement and there is a mic on a boom and a micknife. Both are tools though which would fit the story.OK yes this is probably some of the most ridiculous things I have ever posted here but given that the artist is one very smart person I think there is merit to either a Hindu or Buddhist reference. If I ever make it to Japan I am going to buy this guy many beers to find out what he meant.,BABYMETAL,cufustj,1,t5_2xpsy

So I hemmed and hawwed and found another way to show their growth in terms of Japanese popularity since honestly theyre not aiming to be another Momoiro Clover Z or AKB and as such the post that I had before isnt too accurate and neither is trying to follow the Nikkei Talent Rankings.Luckily Nikkei had it solved for me!Every year Nikkei Entertainment which is a fantastic magazine for figuring out the current snapshot of what acts are popular in Japan releases a chart of the most popular idol acts with one axis showing sales and the other showing concert attendance. This is the chart from last year which as an FYI is dated post the release of the Babymetal CD so this is actually a really good point in time to reference. This is the one released this year in June. So from the chart you can actually see that while sales have slowed just a tad I mean its really hard to beat bestofs in Japan their attendance has increased multifold. ,BABYMETAL,cvar1hy,2,t5_2xpsy

5533567,0,t1_cwiycyf,I dont think were on the same page here. I just meant that they dont play a role in the same way as they did in the early concerts. They show themselves as they are. Interact as people instead of characters. This has been underway since at least the Budokan concerts. The names are probably gonna stick same with the whole mythology deal. But they ARE gonna become less stiff and start speaking with their own words and generally become more and more in control of themselves. I wasnt talking about PLS YUIMOA LRN GITR! like some people do. But look at Perfume or other smaller Idol groups. They are way more outgoing and have a bigger personal impact on their own activity onstage and offstage. I think thats an inevitable outcome as they grow up. Much like the Potterkids who used to be very closely directed to such a degree that you could claim that Chris Colombus actually played their roles in the first two films.TLDR Im not thinking that theyre gonna be all srs shit or deviate from the style of BM but theyre gonna come out from Kobas shadow and start shaping their own image simply by being social on stage. Bringing their own charm rather than the preplanned one from legends . Just take another look at that gif up there.

I will be on the same line as ualfiealfiealfie I appreciate your honesty but I dont agree with you releasing the trailer. I do respect you removed it swiftly again though.

7099301,0,t3_4cfeph,The metal factor has been upped in spades on this album and I keep using the word maturity to attach to the song structures but its truly fitting. Rather than talk about how awesome everything was Ill just point out the things I thought were odd. TBH the only song Im struggling with is Amore and its purely a stylistic thing as Im just not into happy campy power metal anthems. RoR was different for me as it has a harder edge but this song was like a majestic Pegasus taking a rainbow dump on my head. It was kinda awesome but not really my thing if you know what I mean. I can respect that other people will no doubt love this song though so Im happy for them. Also Meta Taro was even more bizarre than Tales for me.

7102696,0,t3_4cfeph,. Road of Resistance  Ive always loved this song. Nothing more to say that hasnt already been said.  . Karate  Of the songs that were performed at Yokohama this was by far my favorite and Ive listened to the single so many times already.  . Awadama Fever  Choco Part . Its effervescent and addictive.  . Yava!  I like it and the subtle yavas are really fun. I still think it should have been named Chigau though.  . Amore  Su sounded great although I dont think I cared for it as much as Akatsuki. Still very solid though. Great instrumentals.  . Meta Taro  Playful at least. Not my favorite.  . From Dusk Till Dawn  Wow! Im a huge fan of this kind of atmospheric metal. Amazing song.  . GJ!  Rapping MoiMoi! Awesome. Still very fun like Onedari and  no Uta but a lot more sophisticated and heavy. Love it.  . Sis. Anger  Brutal instrumentals. Really dig it. And MoiMoi sound great. BBM really hit it out of the park on this album. As much as I love Onedari and  no Uta I have to admit that they were the weakest songs on the first album. Well they may be a high point on this one.  . No Rain No Rainbow  Ill be honest its a good song but of the other old songs they could have put here there are a couple others that I would have preferred more. Sus voice definitely shows how much it has matured on this song though.  . Tales of the Destinies  I get that they were going for a math rock sound but the electronic elements were jarring and made it a little too irregular. Without those I think that it would have been a lot stronger.  . THE ONE English  Flawless. Absolutely flawless. This to me is a concert ending opus like Hey Jude. You can stretch it on however long you need to and everyone can and will sing along because they are THE ONE.,BABYMETAL,d1lgoqg,4,t5_2xpsy

In such a sound it comes to in divided. I guess there is also a factor that has been accepted. In fact I often heard in coverage of Western media I I What do you think the BABYMETAL. I will still do a surprise for the other side of the people. Well But I think it is a great if supposed to widen the frontage.I to have been an increasing number of itself that the Japanese bands go abroad in Takasaki now.

8216695,0,t3_4rvy2a,I kinda like ChopShop but I cant seem to find any other musicians except this Professor Elemental guy. Since I still listen to rap a little bit because it was mostly what I listened for like  years. And Japanoise is something that Ive found from Sonic Creepypasta games if anyone knows these. Pirate Metal or just Alestorm as a band actually got me into Power and Folk Metal but I like Folk Metal better and now its one of my favourite genres alongside BlackThrash and classic Heavy Metal.And for BABYMETAL theres no comment.... They were weird to me at first but when I realised and got a little deeper into the history of Kami Band and BABYMETAL they are something special for sure....

8231801,0,t1_d56hene,So lets assume that If Yui wants to wear a bikini outfit then a year later escalating to something even more revealing for their gigs and shows would you be OK with that?  Would the fan base be OK with that?  Would Moa and Su be OK with it?  I know that is taking it too far as Im sure its not what Yui had in mind or perhaps she did but can you see the problem therein?Of course you are right about supporting Yui as she Moa and Su are our babies but would I continue to have the same enthusiasm for Babymetal if they became contrary to the design they had worked so hard on?  Probably no but who knows.And yes there is also the important factor of evolving and what could be more relevant to a  year old girlwoman of wanting to discover herself.  Yui is growing into a beautiful young woman and she will be thinking about boys and that kinda stuff so if she wants to dress sexy in her own time then I dont see the problem with it at all so long it doesnt make its way into Babymetal.Babymetal will evolve their music will change their styling will also but the theme has to remain or else it wont be Babymetal anymore.,BABYMETAL,d56j4yw,2,t5_2xpsy

8443086,0,t3_4vakdf,The guys in the Kami band are probably comfortable with their own individual profiles. Mikio can go out with his family and not have to worry too much about personal security. BOH can go for quiet drinks with his friends without paparazzi buzzing him as he leaves. All the Kami guys are old enough experienced enough and mature enough to know the pitfalls of their job. They have to wear the stage uniform the stage makeup and NEVER talk about the girls when out with friends let alone tweeting.Mikio does some tuition for Young Magazine and he has recently to my surprise gone on record about his stage gear with Babymetal which I am pleased to see. BOH has done similar. ISAO regularly does clinics for Line  Helix. I genuinely think they are at a level of exposure they are happy with. After all they signed on to be sidemen not headlining act.An interview involving Moa amp Takayoshi for example might prove awkward. Takayoshi might not want to spill any beans about Moa and vice versa. They seem to have a friendship through the work the whole Babymetal amp Kami unit seems happy with each other. An interview involving the whole stage band would drive the translator Nora nuts as she tried to censor some saucy comment or banter into a more diplomatic response!Over time some of the Kami guys may leave. We know the chances of LEDA making a Kami appearance at this stage is very low yet he was a regular for a while there. To me its been pleasurable to delve into who these Kami musicians are away from Babymetal and their various professional works.,BABYMETAL,d5wxaho,5,t5_2xpsy

8790902,0,t1_d74ew7n,Yes the YuiBot AI Platform shown in this picture is three years older and while it has since been upgraded to YuiBot  even in  the platform had a selflevelling and calibration feature for the stabilizing gyroscopes. The need for this arose out of the close proximity to the Kawaii Pulse KP that emanated from the then unshielded MoaMetal. The early genetic enhancements to MoaMetal were largely experimental and as a result the necessary protocol to control the pulses and direct it towards the audience and not a  degree saturating field had not been established.In this shot we see the emanation of a powerful field off of MoaMetal and the YuiBot has detected the signal and is looking to the horizon to establish a new level and subsequently restabilize the gyroscopic balancing system. If this recalibration were not done the YuiBot platform would start to dance on the walls and eventually end up on the ceiling. On the one occasion where this destabilization happened it took about  hours to get YuiMetal to walk in a normal upright position and not spend her time crawling on the ceiling. We still have not heard back from the publicists who came to interview BM and encountered a growling YuiMetal upside down and crawling on the ceiling.,BABYMETAL,d74jekm,1,t5_2xpsy

Erina is probably the most popular out the group.TRIO does hike up prices like crazy because they know foreigners like to go there for exclusive things and they know they will have the money for it. If you can find the same things on auction or proxy sites it can save you money especially if you are doing a large order.

Strap on your guitar or whatever and try to play the melodies to BABYMETAL songs like No Rain No Rainbow Amore etc.  I learned a LOT doing this.  And if Jazz is baffling like it is to me I cant read music for example try playing along with KPP songs.  They are kind of loungejazzlite mixed with circus music.

Or maybe they all got gifts but each one got something else thats why when Moa said she got a bracelet it makes sense for Su and Yui not to say me too.,BABYMETAL,daow29h,-1,t5_2xpsy

What thing do you see on your horizon that a course in Japanese Studies would help you achieve?  Do you want to be an ambassador? An evangelist for Japanese culture? Do you think the course will help you solve a specific set of problems by looking at them from a new perspective?  BABYMETAL could certainly be the thing that triggered you to consider the possibilities that an indepth study of Japanese culture could afford. Discovering them certainly has changed some of my objectives in the past year.,BABYMETAL,daxlt5j,4,t5_2xpsy

However a decent amount of us used Japanese stuff and never won.In smaller events Im not sure if theres much of a focus group to know. However foreign fans did win Black Mass in .After Tokyo Dome the tldr version is now simply that if they dont want foreigners winning they wont win regardless of what precautions we take.Obviously if the only option of shipping is a home address no combini pick up then youre gonna need a japanese address anyway.,BABYMETAL,dci6oss,5,t5_2xpsy

11272440,0,t1_df7qtwg,now Im no expert just throwing that out there so dont take my word on anything as fact but its more a community wide decision on how everyone sees the group on both a musical and aesthetic level as to whether they would be more along the lines of traditional idol or perhaps given the term alt which in all honesty holds no weight and is just a useful tag used to group idol groups who share similar aspects in deviating from what idol is usually associated with like idol groups performing music along the heavier spectrum of metalpunk or featuring harsh vocals as well as the groups aesthetic and lyrical concept mental illness depression and other dark topics are covered usually by some alt groups general attitude and behaviour and where their lives are held its all one massive grey area so take it with a pinch of salt  but once you kind of know what your looking for youll have a rough idea of what people are referring to roughly when they say a group is alt idol. I dont believe its even used by the Japanese crowds at all they just know what groups they like and what they dont guess it just makes it easier for international fans to find more groups they may be interested in if they share a common description other then just idol.,BABYMETAL,df9pqil,1,t5_2xpsy

Must have something to do with the stupid Brexit thing and the decline of the currency.To LA it would be   which is a good price. If I pay that now then I can put something aside for JulyWith Babymetal..its so difficult NOT to go.Ive seen them  times last year and it still wasnt enough well you know how it is...But when I manage to get tickets for the July shows in Tokyo I will also try to catch X Japan again in Yokohama shortly before they play Yokohama Arena  nights in a row.Seen them at Wembley last month and they were epic!So I wait for the THE ONE results first and then decide.

11490386,0,t3_640ovv,I dont think its viable yet to put the amount of production associated with their Red NightBlack Nights into  overseas shows. Wembley was super hyped and had a lot of PR to get people from all of Europe and even a lot from Japan and several other countries. Most people cant do a trip of that scale every year so its better to do smaller shows in several cities it reduces the cost for fans though it leads to less quality relative of course to  Arena shows.,BABYMETAL,dfyfmnl,1,t5_2xpsy
11493899,0,t1_dfym4c2,nope it was one song per year while all  members were in SG.  DDM was their first in .  Iine  and headbanger Kimi to anime is a bit weird as its mostly a cover.  also checking the back of my physical it has a release date of march   which is very close to Sus graduation from SG.  DDM did have an official single release which im not sure of the official release date but iine did not.  Iine was just thrown on one of the other singles Headbanger megitsune or IDZ.edit Sus grad wouldve been march  not march  so the kimi to release does coincide with her time but IDZ release on January  was very close to Sus graduation that march and was never included on an SG album was my main point as kimi to anime was not featured on an SG album either.,BABYMETAL,dfytzbm,1,t5_2xpsy

11508407,0,t3_63zw8n,I think all of the points youve listed are important. Since youre talking about Babymetal to people who dont know anything about them its key that you start from the beginning so yeah Kobas concept is a great way to begin. My advice would be to tell it like a story. Allow everything to flow together so that it doesnt sound like youre just going down a checklist and hitting key points. Fewer stops and starts each topic should link into the next and overall it should follow a logical progression. So youre starting with the concept and by the end your audience should have a firm understanding of who Babymetal are where they came from and what they have planned for the future in terms of their message and quest to unite the world and break down language barriers with their unique blend of music.I think explaining their message is really important. Give examples of how Babymetal have influenced lives and brought so much positivity into the world. Feel free to use me as an example for that. In October Im starting University studying Japanese for the first time. Babymetal have taught me that anything is possible and you should chase your dreams work hard to make them a reality. This might be a great time to mention The One and the message of unity conveyed in the lyrics. Also Karate and its positive message teaching us to never give up no matter how hard things become.Injecting humour is a tricky one yeah because most of the joke are inside jokes with fellow Kitsunes. Perhaps it doesnt need to be super funny just informative with an inspirational story. Three girls humbled by their experiences living the dream and bringing so much joy and positive energy with every performance all over the world.Good luck! ,BABYMETAL,dg0h9qk,1,t5_2xpsy

Why did you choose to take part in these communitiesprojects and how did you get involved with them?After we got out own picture taken care of and were in pure defending mode I threw pixels at our neighbors who were in need of help from vandals.  We made allies from surrounding subs and agreed to help each other maintain our work.gtWhat moments in rplace do you feel like you most reacted to or were most fascinated by?The endless threat from the Void our image was so pristine so much of the time we often became targets.gtHow would you describe your community social interactions related to rplace?This place is already pretty tight knit more of a family than a random gathering of like minded fans.  And during the Place event those only became stronger.  The whole vibe here changed during that time everyone banding together really made our already close family even closer.  It was unlike anything else during that moment.gtWere there any forces in rplace that you worked to actively oppose? What sparked your reaction?The Void mostly we had endless vandals but one or two pixels here and there were easy to counteract but the threat of a full on assault was always on our minds.  Since this sub has fans from around the globe we had  hour coverage to keep up defenses.gtWhat was your real world involvement like? ie. Did you actively participate in communities and coordination for many hours just occasionally place a pixel when logging on or participate in the background whilst doing other work?I was probably over involved lol but whenever I was home and near the computer I was spamming refresh and helping build and defend.  I dont want to know how many pixels I threw down. ,BABYMETAL,dg42ikd,3,t5_2xpsy

But these shows are more intended to fans they already have that want to see them but cant due to age or gender they are afraid of getting into the mosh pit for exampleBut all of BABYMETALs Japanese shows sell to The One first this is just in line with that. They could have made these shows ONLY for The One members if they were intended solely for fans they already have.  I think of it more as a situation where they want to use these shows to ease people who might not have gone otherwise into the BABYMETAL live experience.  gtAs for a large Arena event like Tokyo Dome    I was thinking of something more like an Arenaother larger venue tour.,BABYMETAL,dggw0fb,1,t5_2xpsy
