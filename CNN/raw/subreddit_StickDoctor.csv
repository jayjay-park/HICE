3757464,0,t3_33f7jf,Im not sure what you mean by not doing too much to the stick but if you want to shift high to low with the pocket the whole sidewall will need to be redone. As others have said stringking Ustring is a GREAT resource and will at least give you something to start with. ,StickDoctor,cqkku8h,5,t5_2x8xr
4245517,0,t3_39jdjt,Not to shabby for a first stab at it. Next time try throwing in some skips on the sidewall. This will help you get a deeper pocket without having to have a really loose throat string. It will also shorten up that tail so you dont have to cut it. Have fun with it man I love stringing!,StickDoctor,cs46h3l,1,t5_2x8xr

7963261,0,t3_4o5kgg,This looks really good but from the picture it looks like the top string might be shifted everso slightly to one side. This will make the channel uneven and lead to inconsistencies. But other than that the pocket shape is really nice good job man!,StickDoctor,d4b5aa8,1,t5_2x8xr
11118767,0,t3_5xep8l,Looks good.  What kind of strings do you use for your topstring and sidewall? Are they just spool stock from the local shop? Do you know what size they are?  The stuff at my local shop is thinner and Im not a fan.  The package stuff normally has thinner too. ,StickDoctor,desaxs1,1,t5_2x8xr
11619853,0,t1_dgd4acj,Okay thank you that picture idea sounds great especially since my last head on my shorty was super low whiplike insanely low whip and it will take me a little to get used to a more whippier stick and I wont know if it is me or the stick. Thanks for the help.,StickDoctor,dgd4de1,2,t5_2x8xr
