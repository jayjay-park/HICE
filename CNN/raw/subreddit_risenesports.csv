11622772,0,t1_dgd6buv,From my teams communications with MA they have multiple people who have work on weekend evenings which makes it very difficult to schedule game times.When we DnD tried rescheduling with them the only times that could work for them were super early in the morning eastern which doesnt work for our team as we have a player me in the Pacific timezone.Its really unfortunate as we were looking forward to the challenge and I hope their team can figure something out.,risenesports,dgdgajq,2,t5_3jiw6
