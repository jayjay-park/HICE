9916284,0,t3_5he31b,Having self esteem would mean not caring about your short comings in the first place.Its a strange question because youre judging yourself on your own defined values and levels of qualification and deciding you dont meet them. A friend of mine is so stupid and lacking in self awareness but has the highest self esteem of anyone Ive ever met. He chooses what to base his self esteem on or perhaps he decides hes awesome and doesnt think any further than that. Self esteem isnt something than can or needs to be measured for any reason. When you say youre not attractive or not smart whos standards are you deciding that on? And ultimately why is your self esteem tied to that? Theres a goal you want to achieve youre not meeting it possibly due to your perceived short comings and this makes you unhappy so you round it all off with low self esteem. Youre more attractive than some people and smarter than some others definitely both together in some circumstances. So youre saying Im not as attractive or smart as id like to be. I dont reach my own standardsThe definition of low self esteem is being concerned with the opinion of others. ,selfesteemsupport,db046t9,1,t5_37vje
