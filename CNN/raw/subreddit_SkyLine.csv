3148134,0,t3_2sfepn,Lol I pay  a month in Washington for full coverage. They didnt have a skyline in their system so its in there as a nissan sentry. Legally they have to pay for any damages because its a mistake on their part so I dont have to worry about anything.,SkyLine,cooaubm,1,t5_2suj1
3987685,0,t1_crakjo4,Apparently its a C in door sedan body style. Didnt know such thing existed but according to the Skyline Wiki and according to this car I posted its real. I guess they just converted to lefthand drive for safety reasons and as for the other changes.. I guess as time goes shit happens and you never know what you will have to change in a car. The entire region there is isolated so they dont get a lot of new cars. They do a lot of work to keep their cars running for a VERY long time.,SkyLine,cratxuv,1,t5_2suj1

6436065,0,t3_43ukz9,Found this sub and thought Id share. Picked it up in Canada last May and brought it to the US. Kid I bought it from had the boost cranked to high hell and by the time I had it home it was not running great. Put it back to stock boost and drove it some trying to fix the misfire and after a compression test found that the rings are fried on cylinder . Right now Im trying to decide if going the cheaper route and dropping in another RBDET is the way to go and get it going for about  and then have money for other goodies or upgrade to an RBDET and that clocks in at about  tune but kills my budget for the car for the year.,SkyLine,czl0zp9,2,t5_2suj1
6574044,0,t3_45o3yz,This would work temporally. You cant just drive your r over the border and they smile and wave like youre an astronaut that just landed back at earth. You have to give them a lot of information at the border and if you didnt cross back over at some point theyd come looking for you and the car. If you did cross back over and then came back theyd figure out your scheme. The real question is do you have enough money to afford an R and property in Canada? ,SkyLine,czzb71m,2,t5_2suj1

8695760,0,t3_4z2uuv,Yeah coils from the sound of it is what I would be checking out first. If your car has never had them replaced then just due to the age of them they can play up a bit in Skylines. Splitfires are great. After that Id check your AFM that the correct readings are being met and clean if necessary. Check your spark plugs too and alter their gappingreplace if required.  ,SkyLine,d6slmmn,2,t5_2suj1

9741944,0,t1_dad9sxz,How long is a piece of string?That depends on where you live the condition of the vehicle and its past history. If youre in JapanAustraliaCanada where parts are everywhere its easy to get it fixed in a decent amount of time about a week and back on the road. In America youll be waiting sometimes for a few weeks for parts.Its not a reliable daily driver. Shit will break. Its a  year old Nissan. Youll need a second car.,SkyLine,dadwnru,2,t5_2suj1

11714057,0,t1_dgnrsc2,I have dealt with them. I purchased sports cars for my customers from Europe. Not as old as  y.o. though. And I was at their yard. I monitored their Skylines inventory for years. Looks like they have sold hundreds of Skylines since then with photos taken near their yard. But be careful buy a car only if it has all photos and they are taken at their yard like one at the link you provided. Otherwise youll have to wait for  months  Ask them for a video to prove they own this particular car and it is ready for shipping.,SkyLine,dgntfzo,1,t5_2suj1
