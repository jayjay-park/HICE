CSM is fucking retarded and its focus for the exam is minimal.  Just know what each of the different functions of it are.  I use CSM to manage  firewalls at my job now and all i use it for is image management and config backup.  Its good for managing nonsourcefire IPS but other than that its a piece of shit.  .  There is an SSFIPS book you can get.  .  If you want to learn about ISE get the SISAS book for CCNP Sec. its actually a really good book and easy to follow along.  You can get trial of ISE as well...I took the CCNA Sec exam and I know where youre getting at with this.  I also read the forums and see the complaints people have about the exam.  My CCNA Sec exam did have things that were not in the curriculumblue print but I work with that stuff everyday so it didnt snag me.  I would def. get the SISAS book and read the first few chapters up until chapter  of the book and you should be good maybe read about the ISECertificate handling and device management.  Might be worth it to also get the CCNA Sec Lab book.  I really enjoyed it and it helped me pass for sure.,ccnas,d1bn3nj,4,t5_2t5vi

7878844,0,t3_4if85p,Just purchased and loving them so far.  Their ASDM exhibits are very similar to the actual exam. Just wish theyd let me close the ASDM dialogs with the Cancel button instead of making me click the X in the corner. Annoying.,ccnas,d41nlez,1,t5_2t5vi
