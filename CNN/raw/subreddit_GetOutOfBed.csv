161460,0,t3_1vxqsl, Prepare the night before Make sure youre not sleeping too much. If you go to bed at pm you should be waking up at am or am. You only need  to . hours of sleep per night When you wake up put some coffee on put some music on take a shower do some pushupssitups etc. Anything you can do to get your blood flowing. Try experimenting with different thingsroutines for a little while. This will take time. Try as hard as you can to do this for  days as thats how long it may take for your body to accept your new habits. Try not to go on Youtube or Reddit at all. I still do this from time to time but if you get in the zone and get off to work you wont even think of sitting down to look at that stuff. Take note of how long each task takes you.  minute shower  minutes to get dressed  minutes for breakfast etc. This way youll start to know which tasks take longer or ones that can be combined or made more efficient.,GetOutOfBed,cewtnb3,3,t5_2tant

4000118,0,t1_crc8ek5,Yeah the Kindle might not have the same accelerometer that a smartphone has. Not a device but check out sleepyti.me If you go to bed when you say you will the time it recommends is pretty good. Its not based on your exact sleep but it based on optimal  cycles. Ive felt so good when I woke up with its suggested time before.,GetOutOfBed,crc8tym,2,t5_2tant
4021080,0,t1_crdyrdz,It would depend on how invasive and uncomfortable the mask is.  Ideally you want something you can use every single day and something that travels well.  For me I want a device that I can nearly forget about.  I want something that is good enough to wake me up at a decent target time even if I dont get all the bells and whistles of a slow and calming wake that simulates sunlight.  Where I would look to a device like yours is if other options first failed.  To me it is more in depth and invasive than Id imagine wanting but I would seek it out as a Plan B if other devices didnt hit the mark.Im looking for something  to  for my solution which is reasonable because they are mostly built off of using existing smartphonecomputer interfaces.  Youll likely need to do the same to stay competitive though I imagine something like youre pitching could go for .  Most of our gadgets last a year or two maybe three before theyre dead or replaced and we seem mostly okay with this.  If you were able to come up with something that looked and felt sturdy something I could rely on for  to  years I would easily pay in the  to  range but its easy to be skeptical of new gadgets when they come and go so quickly.  I have a hard time committing to new gadgets because so many have proven to be disposable and specialty items anymore are a tough sell when things like smartphones often have similar though less complex features.Hope this helps.,GetOutOfBed,cremtmr,2,t5_2tant
4595179,0,t3_3dybif,as someone who hates getting out of bed myself the only way i find that gets me in a normal sleep schedule is to do some kind of physical work for a good portion of the day that makes me tired.  that forces me to go to bed early hence not feeling like shit the next morning.as far as the actual getting up process is there something you can plan for the next morning that will be exciting for you?  I struggle getting up unless I know something exciting is going to happen that day.  for me this is often going on a hike or something like that.  I wake up refreshed and ready to start my fun and exciting day.  otherwise its all groggy and grumpy for me.since you slept in until  youre going to be a bit tired but if you keep up a habit of getting up early I swear it does get a little easier.  this is much easier said than done for people like us   Not sure what your life situation is as far as being a student or working a summer job or a full time job whatever but having a set schedule for things helps with my sleeping.HTH,GetOutOfBed,ct9tber,9,t5_2tant

4730169,0,t3_3fo1ur,Day The time is  here the sun just rose and it is amazing to be up so early. However sleepiness when I woke up caused me to miss taking a picture I was too focused on doing my morning scheduele and getting off to the gym Since I didnt wake up early yesterday I went to bed relatively late only getting around  hours tonight. So tonight I will be sleeping early! By the way I think I will add a  or  minimum sleep. If I go out or otherwise am delayed I will adjust wake up to ensure minimum  hours of sleep. if I first get home at  am I will put alarm at  instead. Otherwise I will simply die! ,GetOutOfBed,ctqs2gy,3,t5_2tant
5281605,0,t3_3nbti8,I have the same issues well not the hyper thyroidism. It takes me several hours to fall asleep and my schedule always ends up going to bed at  out something unless my life strictly requires a different schedule. I also work a similar schedule. I have often pushed my sleeping schedule back around the clock until over reached a same hour haha. I even tried a polyrhythmic sleeping cycle once  min nap every  hrs. And that worked ok but I didnt stick with it. You have to be strict about the nap and its just not practical. The times when my sleeping schedule has been best ironically has been when traveling. Also living with a girlfriend helps haha. Now that my life has neither Im back to  AM bedtimes. S,GetOutOfBed,cvmsbw6,1,t5_2tant

10857968,0,t3_5v4pav,Your subconscious thought processes are overpowering your willpower. Right when you get up you are not in the right state of mind to accomplish your goals. At least that was the case for me. Funny thing I tried. I started doing mobility exercises daily. I start with this video and go on to do my entire routine. I started out by doing this routine first thing when I get home from work. Because I simply couldnt force myself to get out of bed on time to do it first thing. But I really wanted to prioritize this and my health and do it first thing.I set alarms earlier but I never would get out of bed. My subconscious mind didnt care about my goals.The video I linked before it has a really catchy tune playing imo. Well I started getting the mindset when I hear that song I feel like I can take on challenges and I can focus on my health. I get the mindset that my goals and my health is the most important thing to me. More important than being a lazy slob. So I trained my brain to hear the video and music start and I would shift from my lazy subconscious mindset to an active and healthy mindset.Then I got an idea. I downloaded this song in MP form to my phone and I set it as my morning alarm. The next morning the alarm went off and I heard that song. I IMMEDIATELY got into the mindset that I am going to accomplish my goals no matter what. I immediately got out of bed and went into the living room and started my exercises. The music was simply a trigger for my mind to get into the proper place to achieve my goals.Im saying you need to find tricks that cause you to do whats right for you without any effort. You need to get your mind in the right place and make it easy to achieve this. Then you will be successful.,GetOutOfBed,ddzx8ev,2,t5_2tant

11356237,0,t3_61xltg,Im with you these are the things that have helped meWhen going to bed I try to create a very peaceful environment no caffeine in the PM no blue screens no sounds. If you like caffeine you can make some before bed and put it in a vacuum thermos so its ready when you wake up. You might try a sleep meditation or binaural track when falling asleep.When waking up what made me feel better was the app Sleep Cycle it tracks your sleep cycles and wakes you gently at the best time. A lot of people on here also recommend the app Alarmy which makes you do things like stand up or solve a math problem to turn the alarm off. Theres also an android app that wakes you up with light that apparently makes a big difference. ,GetOutOfBed,dfj7ini,1,t5_2tant
