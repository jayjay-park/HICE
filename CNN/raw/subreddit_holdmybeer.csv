There should be some weight on the tongue of the trailer which would have given him more grip on the rear wheels.  Ive got a wd halfton shortbed and I could pull that thing no problem in low gear with a little air let out of the tires.Having the boat too far back on the trailer would explain why it bounced off the ball hitch in the first place and why they had to hook another truck up to tandem tow it.

He was about lbs soaking wet.  The idea was that the buff guys would do these feats of strength and Jimbo would match them by praising steroid jesus.  So he blew up a big balloon to match their hot water bottles.  He sat there for  minutes ripping pages of a phone book until he had torn it all in half.  He would break a stack of scalloped landscaping bricks with a hammer to match them breaking cinderblocks on their head that type of thing.The grand finale was brilliant.  The idea was that Jimbo would juggernaut his ass through a row of  gigantic blocks of ice about  feet tall by  feet wide and  inches thick jesus trumps physics remember.  I mean it was painfully obvious to absolutely everybody there even to us kids that it wasnt going to work.  Still they claimed he was going to run right through them using the power of HGH jesus.Here I was a kid in a fucking church about to watch a man commit suicide and I was ecstatic.  Anyway he hit the first block and he crumpled.  I mean sickeningly.  He folded completely in half his ass hit the ice above his face which also hit the ice.  Didnt even crack it.  Dude was moaning and rolling all over the floor.  I dont think he was actually supposed to do it the bodybuilders looked shocked.  They rolled him off to the side and while everybody was mulling around him trying to figure out what to do ... one of the muscley dudes decided he had the power of christ and he did this awkward stifflegged topheavy run across the stage and tried to break them himself.

3753280,0,t1_cqk1pnc,believe it or not some people like to play chicken with trains.  People will stand on tracks and then move at the last second.  Others will park on the crossing while waiting for the red light to change.  In my experience a good  of objects people or people in cars will move before the train hits.It is a pain in the ass to stop the train because you ALMOST hit something.  In some rare cases depending on curve of the track switches etc placing the train in to emergency can sometimes derail said train.  The other issue is by FRA rules once a train has undergone emergency the length of the train must now be inspected.  So Now I have a train parked in X number of crossings not moving until I complete my  mile walk.,holdmybeer,cqk3n4d,6,t5_2vi9f

Express your interest in learning the art and science of display fireworks and special effects pyrotechnics.  Tell them youll work cheap or free just to get your foot in the door. This is hard work outdoors in the brutal heat of July th and  ice cold of NYE.  The equipment is heavy the hours are long and youll be working while everyone else isnt.  The pay can be good depending on your skill level and the company or crew you work for.  Very few licensed pyros have full time jobs as shooters most are contract technicians that get paid a flat rate per display usually a percentage of the value of the show plus some expenses.  No one gets paid by the hour. The good contract techs shoot a dozen outdoor displays a year along with some indoor FX.  Im semiretired I do consultation site surveys safety training shooter training site inspection tech seminars.  I also have a full time job in commercial property management.

7799920,0,t1_d3sreck,You bring up a good point. One that ultimately kills your case. Mentality. Let me ask you. Could you live with your self killing a shooter like that? Because I guarantee you cant. The biggest issue that you gunenthusiasts never seem to talk about is the damaging effect killing a shooter is.  I am sure you are going to argue that Oh you are doing the right thing and saving lives and blah blah blah. All that tells me is you dont understand what they go through. So how about you just keep your head down and wait it out. Because if you fire that gun either way you are dead whether it be physically or mentally dead. I think this is a good point to stop this argument because you arent going to change your opinion anytime soon nor am I. So have a good rest of the night or day or whatever time it is where you are.P.S.

I was in a club over the summer and when the lights came on at closing I looked around and saw all the sweaty drunks stumbling out across the grimey floor covered in spilled drinks and broken glass and I the felt disgusted. It was a really nasty scene.It made me feel kinda sorry for myself because that is what I was doing with my life.

Fortunately you can feel traction with a fair amount of ease most of the time. If you feel like the front is going to go it should really be obvious that you shouldnt use that brake. What I dont think has been mentioned is his weight distribution which seems to be a factor in the fall. Far from his wheel sliding out from under him the guy does a stoppie and falls forwards while releasing it. Im not sure how it could have been averted after that point as his foot was already off the pedal but it probably could have been averted earlier without him having had the front brake issue. If anything this is a lesson in gradually easing off the brake though.I dunno its always been a bit instinctive to me ever since I was a kid barelling down through pine forests on the way home from my friends.,holdmybeer,da9yuan,2,t5_2vi9f

When driving across large frozen bodies in heavy vehicles you generate a wave in the ice that moves along with you.  If your wave runs into the wave of another vehicle the ice will rupture where those two waves meet.  This is why you have to keep a certain distance from the vehicle in front of you.What might have happened here is the ice didnt have enough room to move.  The shorelines are very close so wave got reflected.  This would have compressed the ice more than it could handle and it ruptured.Either way the driver wasnt very smart.

As he is peeing we hear a girl say oh no its raining. Then she screams. She notices that its not rain but piss.
