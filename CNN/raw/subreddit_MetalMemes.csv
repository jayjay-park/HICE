We know generally WHAT but not HOW or WHY in most cases.To claim that divine or supernatural interference has shaped the universe is most likely a misguided interpretation of the facts but to claim that forces beyond scientific comprehension do not exist is just blatantly ignorant.Im not saying theres a God of any kind Im just saying we shouldnt be surprised if there is.

9222345,0,t1_d8kf1gc,as a lover of metallica fuck off everyone else in this sub please dont start that argument again even i really enjoyed it  it shows the band at pretty much inarguably their lowest point ever and doesnt back down from showing every awkward and painful decision made in that process.they dont edit anything out and let this stuff out publicly to show their fans what their mentality was going into that period. i love watching it from the standpoint as a wannabe musicianwriter because it shows how unglorious that kind of spotlight can be but its also great to watch just as a metal fan or documentary fan because its so unabashedly honest. but since everyone hates st anger they often times skip this documentary or go into it with the self fulfilling prophecy mentality of hating it. which isnt fair in my opinion when the film itself is great and nonreflective of the album it was a part of. ,MetalMemes,d8l00dt,11,t5_2t1af

9849870,0,t1_darcolt,It is more distaste. Darkthrone was part of the early Norwegian Black Metal scene along with groups like Mayhem Emperor amp Burzum. Fenriz the brains behind Darkthrone was friends with Euronymous the guitarist from Mayhem who was murdered by Varg Vikernes of Burzum who owned a record shop called Helvet Hell in Norwegian. Euronymous said and Varg Vikernes said the same thing later that they only had Metallica records in their store for the posers. In Black Metal thought especially in the early days true heavy metal was supposed to be Satanic dark evil and repugnant. This was not Metallica. Metallica was to them Enter Sandman and The Unforgiven. Music for MTV and Hot Topic. Stuff teenagers would like.Venom early Metallica loved them and there are several photos of both James Hetfield and Dave Mustaine wearing their shirts took them on tour. Cronos the singer of Venom described Metallica as spoiled brats and bitches. The bands I listened to didnt really like Metallica. Even the legendary Dave Lombardo of Slayer said he threw Metallicas Black Album down the stairs and said what the fuck is this? when he first heard it.I suppose I should have been more careful with my words earlier. I dont consider EVERY person who likes Metallica a poser. Only the ones who only like them and not other heavy metal. I dont consider Metallica posers either. I guess in my mind they are to heavy metal what Green Day was to punk rock...a Hot Topic ready band. This is my objection to Metallica. Not their music so much even though I dont like them its their ethos. I mean Lars Ulrich is a douchy fuck who had the gall to accuse Slayer of being the true sell outs for not changing their sound. That to me is pompous arrogance that only bands whove gotten too big for their own heads would display.,MetalMemes,darglp0,3,t5_2t1af
