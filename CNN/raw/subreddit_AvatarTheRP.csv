4972113,0,t3_3fxxpc,Name Togo IskuGender MaleAge Bending Element NoneAppearance Drawing. He is  feet tall and weighs  pounds. Personality Despite Togos appearance he is a sophisticated polite and charismatic individual. His mind for business and technology gives the impression he is intelligent and strategic by nature. However his sense of moral judgement is low and he lacks empathy towards many people. As a result he often uses others to get what he wants usually by lying or blackmailing them to his own advantage. Essentially his loyalty goes to the highest bidder or more accurately the one that can help him achieve his goals. In addition he is a big risk taker believing that to make great strides you must be willing to bet everything. Togo may understand much but his habit of over complicating things can lead to simple flaws in his plans. While he is able to keep his composure in even the direst of situations he is also quick to give up when at a disadvantage. He is also a disorganized mess When it comes to work space and attire and a great Inventor. All this combined with his sense to see the bigger picture and his brutally competitive ways makes him one of two things either a competent leader or a backstabbing snake.TLDR Polite and charming on the outside deceitful and manipulating on the inside.Bio Born in the Dragon Flats of Republic City Togo was only  when he made his first design an automatic soup maker. A relatively simple device but none the less valued. His father was the cofounder of Isku Industries his mother the other cofounder. They produced a wide variety of valuable technologies for everyday use from kitchen items to new model Satomobiles. For a brief time they were the largest manufacturer in Republic City. However at around the peak of their companys life both the founders were killed in what appeared to be a test run gone wrong. The couple were displaying their latest Satomobile the Raiko when it suddenly combusted in the parade. Togo to this day does not believe it was an accident. With his parents dead Togo was thrust onto the corporate throne at only age  where he tried to lead the company the same way his father and mother did honestly and generously. Without much guidance the companys success began to plummet. People had to be let go and the workers became furious at Togo stating he is nothing like his father. Shortly after being forced to close down Togo was blown out of his office window by a great fiery explosion. He remembers nothing after sitting down at his chair and pulling out some files. When he next awoke he was under surgery glass impaled in his skin and his flesh burnt to the bone. A few surgeons operated on him and placed his fathers prototype mask over Togos face to keep him alive. The last thing he remembers before blacking out again are the words Stay with us We need you alive.When next he woke he was face down on the concrete just outside the docks. A letter left in his pocket read Dont disappoint us bring back Isku Industries. Your friends. Togo found a nearby phone and called a number Hello Id like to open up a new business account please.TLDR Parents owned a successful inventing company they were killed in an accident. Togo placed in charge and does a bad job company goes bankrupt assassination attempt on Togo but he survives. Wants to revive the company through any means necessary. CombatAs he is often involved with shady dealings Togo has learned to handle himself in a fight. While not being able to bend any elements he uses a variety of gadgets to aid him in combat. These gadgets can range from simple shock gauntlets to electric grounding rods and crossbows. The drawback is that these gadgets are often experimental and as such are prone to failure or backfire while the obvious advantage is their utility. However Togo is also skilled with fast kick techniques and handtohand combat if he gets into a close up encounter.,AvatarTheRP,cul9sls,1,t5_39e25
