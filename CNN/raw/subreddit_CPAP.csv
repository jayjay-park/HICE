425305,0,t1_cfou4ld,Hmmm I do have  cats but theres no way I wouldnt notice them playing with the hose. Its almost like the machine is silently hiccuping but not affecting the air flow. It MUST be originating in the machine.Picture a water pump sucking from a hose when the water source runs really low the hose will sort of cough as it runs out of fullon suction and grasps the dregs of the water left. I know that might not make sense but I work with pumps and thats what it reminds me of. And then it just stops as strangely as it started. NEVER happens when I first go to sleep,CPAP,cfouj8m,1,t5_2s99h
908807,0,t3_24is0a,Probably not. A CPAP machine uses more power than it takes to charge a mobile phone. To give you an idea... a volt deep cycle marine battery will run a CPAP machine without humidifier at cm for approx.  hours providing youre using the correct DC cable.Most CPAP machines will draw around  amps at start up and  amp per hour whilst running.,CPAP,ch7l584,1,t5_2s99h

2640611,0,t3_2q61ib,Thanks so much for your feedback.  I called the DME this morning and they went through the very complicated bill with me and showed me the adjustments I was getting and the final amounts due.  They did essentially bill every item in the set separately even for the headgear  they billed the bundle for inventory purposes but then billed the separate items as well.  However after the credits they had to apply for my insurance company the total bill of  came down to . for everything CPAP and headgear and then my insurance company paid a chunk of that. They also switched billing systems between the time they logged my services and sent the bill so there are multiple identical credits and debits for each item. Very confusing. I appreciate everyones help here in helping me get it straightened out.  It looks like they just have a very confusing way of billing things but the final totals I am seeing now are in line with what I was expecting to pay.,CPAP,cn39d37,1,t5_2s99h
2821553,0,t3_2sekm0,Is your mask option set to nasal pillows? Sometimes that will make a difference in regards to the smartstart stop feature...also if your pressure is very low to begin with the auto feature doesnt always work. Theyre a little touchy in my experience. Its a win if the auto start stop works about  of the time...,CPAP,cnosycp,2,t5_2s99h
2929556,0,t3_2top07,Yes data is being sent out.  Its stored in an account that your cpap supplier can set up for you.  There is an app so you can look up things like mask leakage info time used  etc...   I find it useful to print out my own papers to take to the doctor for checkups instead of taking the memory card in.  This uses some wireless carrier that I have not dug into what company it is but Im sure it wouldnt be very difficult to find out. ,CPAP,co13osb,2,t5_2s99h

3626111,0,t3_31w5ap,When you are not used to the CPAP therapy its sometimes common to happen. Since your brain is not yet used to using CPAP it perceives the machine almost as a threat to your body and will force you to take it off even without your knowledge.This is why often times people will mention how they had no idea they took it off because they had no memory of doing so whatsoever.,CPAP,cq5lr4i,2,t5_2s99h

6677567,0,t3_472lnt,I have also recently switched from a nasal mask to pillows. My main issue has been that the air feels so much more concentrated into my nostrils and feels drier now that I use the pillows. Guess I will get used to it. Maybe I will adjust the humidity setting a bit.,CPAP,d0a0oky,1,t5_2s99h
7223461,0,t3_4eb260,My theory is gas. PAP therapy can sometimes force air into the stomach aerophagia. That can swell the digestive tract and put pressure on the Vagus nerve.The Vagus nerve is responsible for a ton of things and runs from the carotid artery area down through the heart and into the abdomen in two branches.Gas pressure in the stomach can cause anxiety and sometimes results in people calling  fearing they are having a heart attack.,CPAP,d1z94r5,2,t5_2s99h

7611723,0,t3_4jke6y,As long as youre not blocking the vents you should be fine. If youre somewhere thats prone to outages and you want to keep it running get a DC battery cable a deep cycle marine battery and a Battery Tender.  Hook the machine up to the battery through the DC cable and the Battery Tender to the battery.  Youll run off the battery  of the time and the Battery Tender will keep the battery topped off.  A Ah battery should give you a few days of run time with humidifier.  This setup will not even flinch in an outage or have an alarm that will wake you.  You wont realize there was an outage until you wake up and all your clocks are flashing.,CPAP,d37evsv,2,t5_2s99h
7683943,0,t3_4i42hw,I am uninsured due to the ridiculous cost of insurance and bought a CPAP for myself using Craigslist. I never had a sleep study done but my Wife told me I snored incredibly loud and would stop breathing frequently when asleep.It was the best thing Ive ever done for myself. If youre looking for that positive air flow up through your nasal passage I think it would be a tremendous thing for you and I say go for it. Go to Craigslist and dont worry about finding one locally. Branch out in to different states. Ive found most reasonable people are willing to sell it to you using PayPal and if you kick in the extra  theyll ship it to you.Good luck!,CPAP,d3fm85d,1,t5_2s99h
8079858,0,t1_d4o8xv8,I tried that.  Watched a episode of this documentary series on Netflix with it on.  Ill keep at it it just really freaked me out to suddenly feel like I didnt have the strength breathe on my own when I took it off.  ,CPAP,d4o926e,1,t5_2s99h
8243428,0,t1_d57vwrf,Brilliant!  about    on amazon for the battery tender.  The marine battery is also not overly expensive locally available at discount and boating shops  and a cheap solution to avoiding the expense of buying a full fledge generator for emergencies.

10509621,0,t3_5qhl4w,I had a similar experience with mine in the beginning.  I use the nasal pillows and for the first few weeks I was definitely finding I had to open my mouth and take a few deep breaths before I was finally able to tolerate the new sensation.  One thing that helped me is that my doctor reduced the pressure rating.  That made it less likely for my brain to freak out and think I wasnt getting enough air.  In the beginning if I found that I just couldnt get over that sensation for the night Id take the mask off and try again the next night.  That really helped as it led to less stress in thinking I had to suffer through that every night.  It didnt take long before I was wearing it longer and longer and now I only have very rare moments of thinking I cant breathe.  And the only time it ever happens is right when I put the mask on.  If it does happen it only lasts a few seconds and then Im fine.,CPAP,dczdl3e,2,t5_2s99h

11600327,0,t3_641ehu,The first month of CPAP was terrible for me. That being said it was just me getting used to wearing a mask. I highly recommend getting some CPAP nasal spray. Even with humidity it just helps with that uncomfortable feeling of air.Wearing it while at home or watching TV is a good call too. It just helps you get used to having it. Youve been sleeping without a mask for xx years and now you are wearing this weird mask thingy. It will take a while before you get used to it.Resmed has a warmup setting that Id also recommend. Run it while you read before bed. If it doesnt I suggest warm water in the tank.I definitely struggled with the feeling of not being able to breath out properly. There is also certain machines that ease the pressure as you breathe out. Definitely recommend that too.,CPAP,dgawmeu,3,t5_2s99h
