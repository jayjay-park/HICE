4642007,0,t3_3dwex0,I have a K RGB I just bought with reds and I dont particularly like them. Everything on the keyboard is fully working with LEDs etc however I bought it after it had coke spilt on it and spent about a week cleaning it every day to restore it to its former glory. Every single key now clicks very smoothly BUT the keys with stabilizers. I have read a lot about lubrication being a necessity for smooth stabilizers but I cant seem to find any such product in the UK unfortunately. I would definitely consider negotiating something like a swap but I suppose it would depend on how comfortable you are with lubricating the stabilizers Ive definitely not found it to be a dealbreaker and still happily use the keyboard but the stabilised keys could definitely be smoother. The spacebar and enter key just feel a bit heavier than the rest of the keys although frankly its not really noticable. Outside of that they keyboard is in pretty good condition and I just had the keys replaced with brand new corsair key caps.I know this sounds longwinded but the guy I bought this from did a shitty job describing the condition and it ended up being a MUCH bigger task than hed suggested really pissed me off.,HardwareSwapUK,ctfow7e,1,t5_2sp1c

6636824,0,t1_d05rie8,There is a story behind that. I actually had to rescue the laptop from a friend. He well didnt look after it. He allowed it clog up with dust and grime and trust me it looked worse than that. I had to clean the outside as best as I could. So scuff marks or scratches on it are from him.I did replace the paste on both CPU  GPU so temps dropped considerably. The battery also doesnt get as hot now. So I did the best I could out of a bad situation.Im honestly not too sure for the price as Ive never sold a laptop and struggle to see any other prices I could go off.
