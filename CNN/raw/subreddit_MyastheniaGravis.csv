10310878,0,t1_dccntca,Actually! I just remembered that on the third day there was an issue with the line going to the sodium chloride. I had a bag of sodium chloride the first two days and was fine but the last day when I got my horrible migraine I got up to go to the bathroom and nearly slipped and fell on the floor as the bag was just emptying out onto the ground. They fixed it after that but Im betting that was a big reason I got a headache and just didnt think about it. Ill be sure to check in the future that I do get that sodium chloride though as I guess in hindsight it definitely helped!,MyastheniaGravis,dccsljd,1,t5_2vhvf
