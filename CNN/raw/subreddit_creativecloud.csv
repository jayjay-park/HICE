5377305,0,t3_3omf0k,I dont know if you can combine two plans or not. I dont see why you couldnt. It just wouldnt make sense if they had to be separate.And there are no pared down versions. If you get the Photography plan you get  real Photoshop and Lightroom. That being said you might want to consider the full  package. I originally only needed Premiere Photoshop and Lightroom. But now that I have the full package I learned to use SpeedGrade and  After Effects. There are also tons of side benefits of a CC subscription like mobile apps typekit creative cloud storage etc. My regret at paying full price went away very quickly.,creativecloud,cvz0f92,2,t5_2wwjo

7675197,0,t1_d3elxh6,Sounds like something wasnt downloaded completely. Try uninstalling and running the Creative Cloud Cleaner Tool to get rid of any residual files. Then shut down your system completely and do a cold boot before signing into Creative Cloud and installing from scratch.If you can try using a hardwired connection instead of a wifi connection.  Also if you have any kind of virus scanner software a software firewall or adware scanners running shut all those off or disable them before you install anything. ,creativecloud,d3emhqe,1,t5_2wwjo
