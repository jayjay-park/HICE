7651104,0,t3_4k3thr,f Hillary Is ProWomen Why Does Her Foundation Pay Women  Less Than Men?By Brianna Acuesta | May  The Clinton Foundation pays women in executive positions  less than male executives yet Hillary is publicly stating that she wants to close the gender pay gap.Credit MisesIt comes as no surprise especially considering the article that True Activist published recently with a video of Hillary Clintons biggest lies that Clinton has been found guilty of engaging in gender pay disparities between her own employees while she delivers speeches about closing the pay gap.The Daily Caller recently investigated the latest tax forms filed by The Clinton Foundation and found that women in executive positions were paid  less than the men in similar positions.If that number isnt shocking enough perhaps breaking it down into concrete salaries will be. On average the top male executives earn  more than the top female execs in Clintons organization.After going through the foundations  IRS Form  it was found that Frederick Post Director of Sponsor and Marketing received  in annual compensation. He was the companys highest paid executive.The highest paid woman of the Clinton Foundation is CEO Virginia Ehrlich whose pay was less than half of Posts at . Not that this is a low salary in general but there is a serious disparity between Ehrlich and her male counterpart.Bruce Lindsey a chairman on the Board for the foundation is still paid almost double what Ehrlich owns earning  annually.Of the eleven executive positions in the foundations CSuite eight men and three women fill the roles. All eight of the men earn above  while the female CEO of the foundation is the only female who earns more than that by only  more.As far as pay gaps go this gap is huge and in the hundreds of thousands. In  female fulltime workers earned  less than male fulltime workers meaning The Clinton Foundations  pay gap is nearly double the national average.Yet as the election goes on Clintons supposedly firm stance on closing the pay gap continues to make its way into her speeches.In a speech from last year she said Too many people view it as a womens issue as opposed to what it truly is  its an economic growth issue. And it will be great for the American economy when we finally close that gap.Just last month she delivered a speech in Silicone Valley and remarkedIt is way past time to end the outrage of so many women still earning less than men on the job.As if this evidence of furthering the gender gap within her own foundation isnt enough Clinton also has a history of paying women less than men in both her Secretary of State office and Senate office. While she was a senator the pay gap was about .Its truly disappointing that as a female candidate Clinton is publicly pushing heavily for equal rights for women but isnt willing to put in the work to close the gender gaps she has control over.More ,hillarylies,d3bvz7f,1,t5_3agou
