He has nice synergy with Theodred out of the box for new players and I think he will reemerge as a new favourite in Dnedain decks for this cycle.

5557084,0,t3_3r8e46,I think we all feel your pain. The core set is an extremely limited taste of deck building options and of fun frankly. On top of that the cycles and Hobbit boxes are somewhat geared toward specific archetypes like going  dwarves like you mentioned. It gets better though. I really had fun for the first time with this game when I played with the pre made Hobbit solo deck from the Black Riders. I also picked up the pack with Fast Hitch and that was amazing for the hobbit deck. From then on I knew there was hope for this game in my collection. For an example of combat It is totally legal for you to attack an enemy with Gimli ready him with an effect Unexpected Courage then attack the other enemy engaged with you. There are really only a few windows in the game where you cant utilize an Action ability. Off the top of my head these windows are no actions between drawing encounter cards you may use actions before or after all encounter cards are revealeddrawn no action while dealing shadow cards unless a card specifies otherwise no action while resolving shadow cards unless otherwise specified. So you may trigger an action before or after resolving each and every attack or defense. Oh and also pay attention to the type of action mentioned on the card Combat Actions can be triggered anytime during the combat phase but not during any other phases.Sorry if thats confusing. Someone please correct me if Im wrong or forgot something.,lotrlcg,cwlwoao,2,t5_2w7hi

There is no difference between engaging an enemy and being engaged by an enemy. Effects that trigger after an enemy engages you will trigger at the same time as effects that trigger after you engage an enemy.In your example the Umbar Assassin does engage you.
