If it had over  patients on it and was not reported and you did not say that it was you your employer may have already violated federal law to the tune of millions.  By law you have  days to report a breach of over  patients and you MUST inform all patients whose data may have been breached of how it happened and what has been done to prevent future breaches as well as reporting it to the media.  For under  you MUST report the breach to HHS within the first quarter of the following year in an aggregate report of all breaches under  patients.If it was over  and not reported and someone knew that it was supposed to be reported its Willful Neglect and automatically carries a  fine per patientincident up to .M maximum per offense they can catch you on.  I see at least three offenses possible at a glance  failure to report a breach failure to notify patientsmediafollow breach notification rules and failure to encrypt PHI.  . million in fines possible without even investigating and if there is as much bad stuff going on as you said this is just the tip of the iceberg.

Ill preface this by saying that I dont have experience with the sort of software that a small business uses but Id imagine that its not too different than more expensive software.When checks come in they should be recorded on the books. Applied to accounts and all that. This is usually as easy as looking up an AR account entering in check info and applying it to specific invoices. They are then deposited in some way. Either a check scanner or deposit slips with a carbon copy or any other method. At that point they are considered deposits in transit. You can get a report from the bank that lists all deposits made and generate a report from your accounting software listing all payments received. At that point its as easy as comparing the two in order to figure out what is missing from the bank report.Of course this is all assuming that some semblance of proper procedure is followed.

As my day job revolves around giving advice about the intersection of two difficult fields information security and law Ive found I have to dumb down my statements to nontechnical people.

Her payments doubled but she couldnt be bothered to read the contract.    I told her her best outcome was to negotiate a better price for her new car. Her hairdresser convinced her that shed get a free car and a big settlement in addition.

501783,0,t1_cfwqyyf,gt You can only go out of the box once you have explored the entire inside of the box. Even if you already see that the solution to your problem lies outside the box.While I generally agree with this theres two reasons I didnt want to do the song and dance.  The wind storm was obviously the problem as the internet was noticed being slowdropping the very next morning and the branches partially blocking the dish for half the morning probably didnt help either.  We called specifically to ask that they send a tech out to inspect the physical dish for damagemisalignment on our dime. I dont think I can stress this part enough  we were more than willing to pay the fee to have a guy come out because we were worried another wind storm may rip it off the roof due to any damage the tree andor wind may have done. It was a violent enough storm to sheer a healthy young maple off at the base! So we were far more worried about losing the dish itself entirely in the next storm than the internet problems. It had started with annoyance then inspection of just how close the tree got were positive one of the thicker branches hit the dish or pole and then a look at the roof shingles cemented our worry. Wed rather have a tech who knows what theyre doing resecure the dish than try to do it ourselves especially if it needed to be realigned again.I stated that from the start and was STILL told I had to do the basic trouble shooting despite the fact it would not have told us if there was physical damage to the dish and its mounting or not which was the entire concern. Looking back I really wish I hadnt even mentioned the dropping signals it might have gotten me off the phone sooner!,talesfromtechsupport,cfxb1bb,4,t5_2sfg5

Of course things didnt always work right. Most of the time it would just be one compressor which would put us slightly above  but with some fans and spot coolers it was manageable. The fun started when a whole unit would go down.I can remember days of working in a F datacenter with all the PSUdriveeverything failures that come with operating in that temperature range. The servers would be so hot that you basically needed gloves to pull them off the rack. We would have the windows open yes our DC has windows and office doors open with fans trying to pump the officebuilding air into the DC.With all the hardware failures came the inevitable wave of support requests. So we would all be hot sweaty and crabby from both the heat and the number of tickets and running around like crazy.

867765,0,t1_ch2vse3,I could understand if it were a simple configuration issue but adding a bad antenna to a wifi card or any other radio doesnt make it transmit garbled information any more than adding a W incandescent bulb to a fixture for a W fluorescent lamp makes the bulb emit purple light. Theres no way to explain this in a short and concise way so this may be a bit longwinded. And if I seem condescending at all sorry  Im just trying to cover all the bases.Also Im guessing you may not have actually used a ham radio antenna but for the sake of this discussion Ill assume you used an antenna meant for the most popular ham band  the m band   MHz. Even then there are many different antenna designs and manufacturers it could have been from hell it mightve been a homebrew for all I know but Ill assume its a Diamond X which is a popular wavewithgroundplane antenna on m.Radios operate on a given frequency  duh. That frequency varies from one type of device to the other  standard WiFi Bluetooth and many RC vehicles occupy . to .GHz FM radio is . to .MHz CB is MHz and so on. The reason data transmissions occupy areas of higher frequency is mainly because they tend to be more lineofsight and can pack more data into the same bandwidth  but thats outside of our current scope.Now there are some fundamental properties of waveforms and RF energy takes the form of a wave. Those properties are frequency measured in hertz i.e. oscillations per second amplitude the energy of the wave in watts and wavelength any measure of distance but most industry insiders and amateurs use meters and centimeters. Amplitude isnt important to us at the moment but the other two are.The way an antenna is used to transmit is by driving an AC current of the desired transmit frequency into an antenna of a given length usually measured in fractions of the wavelength of the desired frequency. The antenna since its length is a relatively even fraction of the wavelength wl wl wl etc. resonates at the frequency of the input and releases RF energy at that frequency. But what happens when the antenna isnt precisely cut to match the frequency of the transmission? Some of the energy gets reflected back through the coax to the radio.This reflected energy is what you need to watch out for. You see what happens is some of the RF energy not all  some stays in the antenna and gets transmitted gets reflected away from the antenna to the RF amplifier in the radio then gets spit back out by the amplifier back to the antenna the antenna bounces it back and so on. Hence the voltage of the energy in the feedline oscillates. The ratio of the highest measured voltage to the lowest is called the antennas SWR  or standing wave ratio. Now obviously no practical antenna is going to be the perfect length  hell in practice an SWR below . is nearly impossible  but fortunately pretty much any radio will be able to cope with an SWR up to . or so. Obviously the lower the better since it means more of your radios output actually gets transmitted but itll still work. Unless your SWR is above about . or so in which case you will have a bad day.Now lets get back to your past dilemma. The antenna Im assuming you used is . inches long or just under cm. The frequencies WiFi operates on have a wavelength of about cm. Hence on .GHz the Diamond X is  of a wavelength long. Needless to say this is fuck outta whack. This is just an estimate from personal experience but thatll net you an SWR of about  to  maybe slightly less if you account for feedline loss. This kills the RF amplifier. Explaining why one of your WiFi cards got burnt out  your antenna fucking demolished the RF portion of it.But you said you tried it again with a different card  Im assuming with the same antenna  and it worked. .GHz and all other microwave frequencies are very prone to feedline loss and its possible that the extremely high voltage from the mismatched antenna may have in that one case dissipated in the feedline before reaching the radio. That and some radios are more resilient than others.Now the thing about microwave frequencies is that theyre very much line of sight  sure they can go through walls but not too many of em. And obviously a highup antenna is going to be mostly clear of obstacles. hence why your misconfigured card even with such a horrible antenna was able to reach so many other devices. Even if youd been using an antenna designed for .GHz you wouldnt have fared much better in terms of range.I hope this helps  makes sense. de KKYXV,talesfromtechsupport,ch2x49b,3,t5_2sfg5

He was the type that had worked up a righteous indignation over not being helped that he wouldnt comprehend that he was in the middle of being helped.Since we were a small local business we were trying to bend over backwards with our support.  We also tried to give this guy extra latitude because he was deaf and we had calls that went  hours with him on a regular basis.  For a while it was sort of fun to hear the operators relaying some of his vitriol in the most blase detached manner possible  Ben Stein would be jealous.It got so that when wed get the call we let the op know up front that we were familiar with the process we knew the caller and to basically buckle up because this was going to be slow going.I remember one call where the op just said I dont know what the fuck his problem is and I knew that it was him and not the customer.  Since it was at least the th fbomb in the call I doubt any flags were raised.We finally did have to find ways of keeping him from eating up so much time so we set a profanity warningcall termination limit as well as a strict scope of what wed help with  basically only the Winsock or TCPIP settings.Fuck you Bruce.,talesfromtechsupport,chkb951,6,t5_2sfg5

1133506,0,t1_chx0ly3,gtgt Thats not three factor authentication. The possible factors are something you know something you have and something you are.gtgt Three factor authentication would mean the user enters a password enters a code from an RSA dongle and swipes a fingerprint reader.gtYou can argue that it isnt three completely different factors but it is three factors total even if it is using one style more than once.You could but that isnt the original meaning and is more likely to be am attempt to hide a lack of security behind some misused buzzwords. gtBTW biometric scans especially fingerprint readers are a form of something you have and a weak form at that as you cannot replace it and it can be copied much more easily than an RSA dongle.True. I didnt want to get into the problems with biometrics especially when they involve remote usage. gt...gtIt is much easier to brute force or dictionary attack or anything else like that that first situation than the second situation and Im willing to bet that most people will have an easier time remembering and entering two  character passwords than one  character password.gtNow that wont provide protection from other problems e.g. social engineering however to say that it is not more secure is just inaccurate.Yes adding another password does increase security a bit but not as much as adding additional factors. Part of the reason for multiple factors is to require an attacker to have multiple successful attacks to gain access. You may have multiple passwords but if you use a password manager app then both passwords will be in the same place.Adding a deadbolt to your front door means there are now two locks to pick instead of one brute force but both keys are still probably on the same ring. A key and an access card would be better but not much. A better way to increase home security would be an alarm system something you know or a big dog something you are. ,talesfromtechsupport,chx4nlh,3,t5_2sfg5

Not even from a generation where those things werent considered wrong I dont think hes  yet and I quit the job  years ago.  I dont know quite how he came on with the company but he was buddies with the call center operations manager and so they put him in charge of a project.How he didnt get us sued out of business is beyond me.  Sexual harassment was a regular thing  I heard at least  people went to HR to file complaints and somehow most of them were talked out of it.  The most blatant one I saw was when he walked into our reception foyer and told the girl working the desk that she looked very breasty in that sweater.  He also hired a girl with no technical skills who was applying for another project to be on his team so he could make awkward passes at her while she was tethered to her desk via the headset she wasnt allowed to take off while on duty.  Hed routinely come up behind her chair and start trying to give her back rubs and tried to get her to go drinking with him.  Given his pharmacological habits a roofiecolada wouldnt have been out of the question either.  And then there was the time at a mixed gender business dinner with the clients from Utah where he asked if anyone wanted to go to a strip club afterwards and showed off all of the hotel key cards he had collected and let everyone know which strip clubs they would get them into without a cover charge.Despite the sexual harassment and the drugs and the booze and the office he would routinely lock himself into to take naps and the meetings that he would miss and he was often the organizer of them and the various other stunts he pulled he somehow stayed on and was promoted repeatedly to try and find a position he would do less damage in until the top four managers of the department were summarily relieved and he was laid off.

1220955,0,t1_ci6umud,Heh. I was going to put long story next to the SBS thing cos I knew someone would ask.Yes theyre still using SBS  because Ive moved them to hosted Exchange . I did THAT because the owners balked at the cost of a real antispam solution and they constantly complained about connectivity issues between the Exchange  server and their iPads and iPhones. So now its outsourced oh your ABSOLUTELY VITAL TO THE BUSINESS iPad cant get email? Let me make a call.Without Exchange all the SBS Server does is typical AD stuff and some light network sharing. I expect to it last at least  more years.Keep in mind that the owners of this company are the kind of people who get halfway into a project then decide they want to go in another direction Back in  they put  down on a new phone system. The vendor ordered it and was totally ready to do the install. But the owners a husband and wife couldnt decide who would do the voice prompts on the system. They argued about it for days which turned into weeks which turned into months. They finally decided the wife would do it but then she got a monthlong cold and refused. The whole thing was then forgotten about despite the vendor occasionally calling and asking when they could install the system. I dont think the telecom vendor is even in business any more. So  totally down the drain.   They wanted to do ecommerce but they didnt want to spend more than  on the project. Thats OK... except the products they sell are mostly custommade. Im not going to mention what they sell but think of something like custommade mens suits. Just one of their products might have  million possible combinations no joke and they sell thousands of similar products. Plus they wanted the site to integrate with vendors sites like fabric companies so customers would know what fabrics were in stock or not and orders could be placed immediately. And by integrate I dont mean open the vendors site in an iframe they wanted all the data from the vendors site sent to their server and displayed as if it were THEIR site. Another problem many vendors in their particular industry have a minimal online presence. They also wanted some kind of weighting system so customers could determine what theyd wait for and what could be substituted so order  doublebreasted mens suit if fabric A from vendor  is backordered use fabric B from vendor  and if vendor  is out of pewterplated buttons use nickelplated buttons UNLESS the backorder is estimated to be a week or less in that case just wait and line the inside of the suit with fabric D and if its unavailable cancel the order. Did I mention that they also wanted the website to fully integrate with their existing DOSbased POS system from ? I told them such a system would cost a minimum of  they scoffed and said that it COULDNT POSSIBLY cost that much. They eventually found their own vendor and asked me to sit in on a meeting with them. The vendors estimate with support contract and training? . Its never been brought up again. A year or two later they FINALLY decided to upgrade that POS system. However instead of using a big vendor I suggested QuickBooks POS they chose an obscure company whose product was specialized for their industry. But within days of my client putting down a  deposit for the new software the POS vendor went out of business. My client was able to find a former employee of the POS vendor to act as a consultant and get it up and running but it took almost  years for the software to actually go live. The new POS app is really just a Firebird database with a pretty frontend. The owners have repeatedly asked for an iOS app for it so they can use it with their MISSION CRITICAL iPhones and iPads. Ive tried explaining that theres no magic fairy dust I can sprinkle to make an iOS app appear out of the aether and that having the database open to the Internet is a huge security risk. Ive set them up with the GoToMyPC app but the owners complain that its too small to see. The POS consultant has even told them that theyd have to pay someone to write an iOS app and come up with some way to make it all secure and that some form of remote desktop is the way to go. But the owners still grumble secretly wondering why they just cant go to the app store and buy a . app for their custommade POS system. Lastly I made them aware of the Windows XP EOL on several occasions. They said they couldnt afford to buy  new desktop computers at the time. But they also kept complaining about the workarounds I had to do to get Outlook  to work with their new hosted Exchange  setup. I told them that new desktops with Office  would fix all those little annoyances and that if they could just deal with it for a little while and upgrade the problem would fix itself. But no they asked me to ditch Outlook  which was paid for and install Outlook  which costs .monthuser from the hosting company. I told them that once they signed up for it they could never stop paying the . fee because if not how would the hosting company know if they were using the software or not? What would stop a dishonest customer from signing up for Outlook installing the software on  computers then cancelling it a month later?. Not TWO WEEKS after I installed  on the XP desktops they called me and asked to order  new desktops from Dell with Office . So theyre paying an extra . a month for their Exchange hosting because they couldnt wait two weeks.If you think all this is bad... you should see some of the stuff Ive been able to talk them out of.

When the company replaced hardware that was too oldcrappy to have any resale theyd offer it to employees. Inevitably the toner in the the exprinters ran out and the employee would pop around to IT to ask if they had any. Oh yeah IT would say. Support has a room full of that old stuff.

1521595,0,t1_cj6xi9p,I am not an attorney and this is not legal advice just some random guys opinion.That said Jack cant sue OP for wrongful termination as OP was not his employer only the company. Further this does not rise to the level of a wrongful termination.   Based on OPs description there was no discrimination and Jack does not appear to be a member of a protected class. OP never mentioned anything about race religion or other membership Jack may have in a protected class so to claim such a protection is contrary to the facts as we understand them.  As there is no discrimination there is no viable retaliation claim.  Jack was not fired for refusing to commit an illegal act.  The company presumably followed standard termination procedures. Even if it did not that is not OPs problem but the companys. Even then Colorado is an At Will state This means there should be no advance notice required in the abscence of a contract. I can virtually guarantee that interns are not hired on a contracting basis. Further as an intern assuming this is a legitimate internship and not a job labeled an internship then Jack is not protected by the vast majority of federal employment laws. While there may be some unique state laws that apply in this case unless you can cite a specific statute that would suggest this was somehow wrongful termination the claim that OP would be in serious legal danger is unsupported and contrary to general legal norms. In short the act of revenge is not criminal nor sufficient to bring a tort. The closest you could come would probably be some sort of tortious interference argument claiming OP was entirely responsible for Jacks termination but that would be one hell of a thing to prove since at absolute best Jack was at least partly liable for the harm since he himself did the acts that caused him to be fired. However in this case the employer has complete latitude to breach the relationship with Jack because they reside in an atwill state. Jack would also have to prove that OP did not have the privilege to do what he did which I think would be pretty damn difficult. OP was the resident IT guy. One of his job duties was undoubtedly to monitor employee use of company tech resources. OP did exactly that. Thus if OP was acting within the scope of his duties In my opinion it would be very easy to argue that he did especially given that the script he ran was on a computer he clearly had full access to and control of as part of his job duties Jack wouldnt have a legal leg to stand on. Even supposing Jack could prove all the elements of tortious interference as an affirmative defense OP could strongly argue that his existing relationship with one of the contracting parties the employer was being harmed by Jack. Further Jack would have to prove that OP was the cause of his termination something which would be difficult to do even with this post. For one thing Jack was a major contributor to the harm as without his own actions browsing those pages OPs actions would not have cause any damages. OP could argue then that he was just one of multiple causes reducing any damages he might suffer by whatever the finder of fact determined to be Jacks degree of responsibility for the harm. Any damages claimed would be at best lost future wages. The wages from an office internship are likely to be tiny especially since a couple weeks had already passed. IN short without a specific legal theory to describe what OP did that rises to the level of a tort or what jack did that violated some specific criminal statute there does not seem to be any serious legal liability. Just sayin.,talesfromtechsupport,cj70cdh,15,t5_2sfg5

You could watch them going through the  stages of grief as we explained that their final project was gone. Forever. No hope. Start from scratch. The worst part was the transition between denial and bargaining where they thought that if they could make us understand that the project was due tomorrow or that they had worked for months that things would somehow change. Nope. In this cold harsh reality there is no benevolent power to convince.

I dont recall encountering a specific instance of ME coming default installed on a system not approximating its reccommended spec.Now while ME was a steaming pool of bad with a single copperbronze pip lost admist a sea of corn A few years ago Microsoft offered me and my peers  to install a copy of Windows CE on our own personal devices and  above software cost for each device w CE sold clients thereafter presumably we would buy or build the host device with the seed money with no expectation that we would keep WinCE installed and develop new hardware for it. I asked them directly during the sales pitch if there was a penalty should we use the  as a subsidy and also install linux parallel to WinCE.  No There is no penalty!

2103058,0,t1_cl74szh,I was working in the IT department of my old high school over the summer.It wasnt ITs idea to roll out iPads  someone at the district level apparently thought it was a good idea and we have to deal with that. I still dont trust Lightspeed to roll out apps properly particularly with the Apple ID issues. iPads just arent meant for this. Plus we replace equipment on a  year cycle. Those  year old Compaq s we just got rid of? Not that bad and they ran Windows  just fine. Even the random few s probably  years oldPentium D that we still had were at least usable and ran Win. The iPad s mostly just some test carts that we have? Totally unsupported at this point and that includes lightspeed management. Stuck on iOS  as I recall. And unfortunately we were buying iPad s from when they came out up until the most recent batch of equipment we bought since Apple finally stopped selling them and now the iPad th gen is the cheapest thing we can get. Not sure what were going to do if were supposed to keep all of them through  years even the more recent ones since Apple is bound to drop support sooner or later. Just a disaster.And to top it off most of the students think that iPads in education are pointless and rightfully so. Chromebooks are a godsend in comparison.Now dont get me started on the mass rollout of Apple TVs were doing to every single classroom. Not that useful to begin with and half the teachers dont know how to use them although I see the appeal of being able to switch rooms easily. We use them for airplay. Plus the student iPads can access them  plenty of legit uses for that in class but also ripe for vandalism  you can Airplay to an Apple TV in another class. And as I realized theres one in the conference room  Im amazed that kids havent messed with that one yet.And to top it off iPads are standard issue for teachers. Laptops are not because they cost more to manage. Never mind which is actually useful in this environment... not to mention that the HP Probooks we buy are probably  in bulk anyways vs a little under  for iPads.Needless to say shiny ! better.,talesfromtechsupport,cl757hy,12,t5_2sfg5

2338428,0,t1_cm0pwij,I worked on a college campus that had haunted buildings.  I normally keep it to myself when talking to people that never went to the campus but every security officer and most people that went into the worst buildings had stories and would believe yours.Copypaste from the last time I shared it on Reddit.  I swear Im not crazy that campus scarred me for lifeI was a campus security officer that worked night shifts by myself PM to AM.The college campus like many campuses in the States used to be a military fort. This one had been around since the Revolution starting as a wooden fort then in the civil war was a granite block fort then by WWI and WWII was an impressive dirtandconcrete stronghold with massive artillery batteries and hidden tunnels crisscrossing the campus.It had a bloody past with people dying from disease and one guy being shot for mutiny.Many of the old brick buildings were still standing including the old hospital barracks and officers house. The hospital and barracks are now classrooms while the officers house was converted into a hotel where people could pay to stay while students learn hosting management and drink mixing interesting program to say the least.Now on night shift youre alone. You have to go through all the  year old buildings with nothing but a flashlight phone and a set of keys since the college didnt want security to have mace or anything. If you find a dumbass doing hard drugs hope you can dial the police in time theres a story for another day.the hauntingsthe hospitalOne night someone left the lights on on the top floor of the hospital. The hospital is only  stories tall and there were lights on in other places too so I just took the stairs. As I closed the stairwell door behind me and made my way up the stairs I heard a man asking me a question. With the stairwell throwing the voice around I couldnt make out what he asked.But I know it came from the basement.I went down and couldnt find anyone. No radios signs of people or anything. But it was very very cold and I felt dizzy.Looking back I now realize what I was looking around in and why nobody likes going down there. What do hospitals keep in the basement? The morgue.the hotelThe hotel was definitely the most haunted building. While you could hear voices and get chills in several other buildings the hotel was one where people would actually see apparitions and I was lucky ? Enough to see one too.That building scares me to this day and I havent been there in years. Footsteps when youre the only one there mumbling from the basement dragging sounds... you name it. The worst one I remember is hearing a child laughing when I asked who was there. After making sure I was alone.However as scary as it was I was and still am fascinated. I would keep going back. Sometimes I would be lucky and have another officer with me for the first couple hours of my shift. Wed go in turn off the lights and make sure the doors are locked then jokingly ask if there was anyone left inside.One night we got an answer. In the form of a dragging sound on the second floor and the sound of someone screaming close and distant at the same time.One of my last shifts I was going through the hotel as two workers were finishing cleaning up. They were both downstairs one with me the other in the basement.As I was finishing making sure the doors were locked so they could just leave and close the doors behind them I looked up at the second floor banister above the lobby. In time to see what looked like a woman in a black skirt dark stockings and black heels walking from right to left.Without any sound.And straight into a wall where she melded into the wall and vanished.You guys are the only ones here?Yeah.No guests tonight at all?Nope!Walked around confirmed nobody else was there NOPE DONE IM OUT. And thats just the hotel and hospital. There are still the stories I have of shadows running across the graveyard yes theres a graveyard on campus a soldier staring at me from the top of the battlements shadows dancing around the machinery in the welding shop and voices calling to me from the darkness in other buildings.But those are stories for another day.,talesfromtechsupport,cm0qqcw,7,t5_2sfg5

Freezing does cause condensation build up which is why you should always attempt to put the HDD in as close to an air tight bag as you can get.  Technically speaking vacuum sealing the bag is the way to get the highest chance of success.  Like all electronics HDD suffer from heat build up and that can cause metal fatigue and the platters stretch moving the readwrite head out of alignment.

RAWs typically have superior color depth the white balance isnt fixed in areas that are over or underexposed and got clipped in JPG conversion you can often have usable information in the RAW and thus adjust the brightness and preserve the information etc.Take the following image for example   you can consider the before on this what you would get out of the camera with JPG.  After is what you can do with a raw.  Note the After is actually more accurate to what my eye balls saw.  full image link  Even without adjustments a JPG created from a RAW on a PC will be superior to a JPG created from a RAW on Camera  This is because the firmware in your camera has a fixed time allowance per frame for JPG processing and so will trade quality for speed.  Your post processing application on your PC does not have this restriction and so can spend more time.Your camera is always shooting in RAW it just doesnt necessarily save the data  RAW is the data from the imaging sensor without interpretations.Your Cameras RAWgtJPG settings are largely fixed.

3136471,0,t1_con32x8,It depends on the type of webpage. A lot of dynamicallygenerated pages like your Facebook feed for example are difficult to capture for an offline format. However static or partiallystatic pages  like a news article or a Wikipedia entry  are much easier. You can do Save As from IE and it will save the whole webpage to a folder along with all of the accompanying pictures CSS Javascript  everything your browser pulls when it displays the page. Alternatively you can even save it to a single .mht file. The layoutformatting might be a little messy depending on the site but the information will be there.But perhaps the best solution is to just teach the users to bookmark the pages so they can come back to them as they need to. With a little organization they might find it to be even easier to use than having  tabs open at once.

3354922,0,t1_cpal77j,Im gonna upvote you despite you being downvoted because I dont believe that fanboyism should derail meaningful conversations.Fanboys will see this as a binary issue. Either Android copied iPhone or not. AND either Apple copied Android later on or not. The reality is a lot more complicated than that. It definitely isnt a binary issue. And the evidence that it isnt is that over the past  years weve seen endless lawsuits over multiple issues between parties representing both Apple and Android and each lawsuit has had different results.It is important to start by saying that the iPhone isnt an invention. It is a product made up of hundreds perhaps thousands of inventions. From the flash memory to the capacitive multitouch screen to the software behind multitouch fluid gestures and search algorithms. These are all inventions in the legal sense of the word practical implementations of an idea that are protected by law under a patent.Just to reiterate an invention is not an idea. It is the implementation of an idea. So even though keyword search might be an idea that is not new to the computer world the way it is implemented in the iPhone is unique and that implementation is the invention that is protected. Same goes for all the other hundreds of inventions that together make up a smartphone.Next thing to consider is that most of these inventions were not invented by either Apple or Google or the Open Handset Alliance which made Android. Most of these inventions were made by smaller companies later acquired by either Apple or Google or Googles partners. Others were invented by third parties such as Microsoft or Sun Microsystems who later licensed these inventions to either Apple Google or their partners. So Apple had a particular implementation of a multitouch gesture software. They released it to the market first. Later on Google bundled to Android their own implementation. Since the implementation itself was different it was a unique invention and thus not infringement. Just because they look or behave the same doesnt mean its a ripoff.Google has been taken to court by Oracle for their implementation of the Java VM. Google and its partners settled with Microsoft over use of some its code. Google and its partners were brought to court by Apple over a particular implementation of systemwide search earning Apple an injunction and forcing Android to remove that particular implementation off the OS. Apple sued Samsung not Google or Android over many things around the world but the most memorable case was the one in the US over the look and feel of the Samsung Galaxy S. In that case Apple won the lawsuit but it was appealed and damages significantly reduced.So yeah you could argue that some of Googles partners misued one or two of Apples patents in making their own smartphones but they were punished for it. Still I remind you a smartphone is a product that is a collection of hundreds of inventions. This means that most of Googles partners have NOT ripped off Apple in any way and those who according to the court system have have done so in a very minuscule way. So small that for all practical purposes the Android platform can be considered its own unique product and not a ripoff.But thats not the only conclusion here. Remember ideas are not inventions. So Sony HTC Samsung Motorola even Google themselves and many others implemented some of ideas that were first presented to the market by Apple. This is a fact. However for the most part these ideas were implemented in their own unique way and the fact that it was done with their own unique implementation that makes it an independent invention. This is also a fact. So Apple later saw and implemented in iOS some ideas that Android or its partners brought to market first such as notification center or the share button or thirdparty keyboards or others. This is also a fact. But since Apple made their own unique implementation this means it is also not copyright infringement and they are unique inventions. This is the final fact of the day. The iOS presentation in WWDC last year was so focused on the changes to the innards to the iOS platform precisely to showcase how special and unique Apples implementation of thirdparty sharing and thirdparty keyboards were to demonstrate these were Apples inventions and not ripoffs of Android in the same way that AOSP . wasnt a ripoff of iOS ..So in summary the answer is complicated because even though both platforms have been copying ideas from one another and undoubtedly Apple arrived first to the market an idea isnt an invention and so Apples position that they stole our invention is dispproportionate to the reality of the situation. Android copied ideas from iOS but implemented in their own unique way and thus made it an independent invention with only  known exceptions. On the other hand Apple is now doing the same thing with iOS copying ideas from Android but also implementing them in their own unique way and thus making them an independent invention with no known exceptions.And because the above summary demonstrates the complexity of the situation then the answer to your question is yes it can be argued that Google didnt steal Apples phone. In fact it has been argued in court dozens of times with almost all of the times except for  times that I can remember with the parties either settling or the courts siding against Apple.,talesfromtechsupport,cpaop6b,12,t5_2sfg5

Plus depending on the project and PM we may have no idea who coded a particular feature or feature set but we do have experience using the software in nearly as many ways as the clients.  I always seem to find the most difficult bugs because I ran through as many of our edge cases as I could in the allotted time  meanwhile the developer was hitting the  most used paths and all worked fine.  To be fair most of the developers Ive worked with reach the  mark easy with most of their code after a year or two on a project and catching the edge cases becomes even harder.  But those cases are always there.  Personally I enjoyed finding the most head scratching bugs and ending up having to sit with engineering for a bit until they saw it through my eyes.  No its not just because I toggled A and D  see this patient? Same setup but no problem in the workflow.  Patient  breaks each time if I toggle A and save and then toggle D and save but only breaks when I return to that patient a third time.  Something is wrong with that second save or maybe that retrieve.   Want to see it again?. Unfortunately my last manager didnt agree and preferred I just failed it and moved on meanwhile engineering is asking repeatedly for help reproducing the bug and thereby interrupting me because my ticket and screenshots helped but not enough or on their environment its working fine but they cant access ours.

For passphrases they are based on the assumptions that the attacker knows the word list the random words are pulled from.  Just the same as the attacker being assumed to know the character set of a randomly generated password.  Yes I know tools used words lists passphrase security assumes they will and so did the xkcd example.  The assumed security of a passphrase is not damaged by that.  Thus random words are just as effective as random characters with the benefit of being more memorable to some users.  I have done extensive research on the topic and would be happy to answer any questions you might have.TLDR The attacker needs to brute force a word list which is essentially equivalent to brute forcing a character set. ,talesfromtechsupport,crxceo4,0,t5_2sfg5

However the weapons true devastating power comes not from its physical form but from the ethereal strands of web it conjures when used.  ampnbspampnbspThe whip acts as a  magical whip whose enhancement bonus is added to attack and damage rolls made with it. If you roll a natural  on an attack roll made with this whip instead of rolling normal critical hit damage the damage is equal to the combined result of a number of ds equal to d   plus any normal damage modifiers. Additionally if the attack roll on which you rolled a natural  is against a creature that creature must succeed on a DC  Wisdom saving throw or perceive itself to be wrapped in ethereal webs. A creature who fails this saving throw is restrained and may repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns ending the condition on a success.Edit minor text edits for clarification.,talesfromtechsupport,cuvklzp,11,t5_2sfg5

5311831,0,t1_cvqmmzr,Definitely could be right. Ive got a friend whos moved around a bit and has gotten access to a bunch of IT stuff. Hes sent a bit of it to me so I can fix my own problems. Through one fortunate instance I was given local admin rights. I rarely use it to do anything I couldnt do anyways but it seems especially important because everyone in our group recently had their computers lifecycled and thus we had all our shit reinstalled. Well many of the core programs that interact with each other are installed wrong. With the files I was sent I can install it myself or fix it myself and now I can do that for other people as well only if they have local admin rights. One common frustrating part are printers. Now Im not talking normal printers I install those on my own. Hell Ive installed network printers  km away and printed stuff for people there not actually that big of a deal I know that. Its the plotters I cant install or at least dont know how. Unfortunately it seems few of the IT people register the difference and try to install them like anything else which either leaves the ticket closed with nothing fixed or with somebody trying to figure out whats wrong for a week when it was just a specific driver issue or something. Thats why we like to contact one person normally only for stuff that are  minute fixes or less. I once got him in trouble because he spent a lot of time trying to fix one of my problems. Although I wasnt asking him to continue if it was going to take longer than a short fix I told him Id make a ticket so it was official but he assured me it was fine.Whoops I guess I wrote a wall of text.,talesfromtechsupport,cvqncqt,6,t5_2sfg5

Beyond that if I can find several solutions online that dont exactly meet my and ultimately the endusers criteria and then still only automate something thats done with a few clicks not going into the final form I want it to go and still have a problem running despite being a socalled turnkey solution throwing errors with the descriptive power of concrete doesnt exactly make me put a lot of faith into the language itself. the fact that I can create a workaround in another language in half the time I was not getting it fixed in VBA getting to  of the final stage seems to indicate to me that yes Python is a better language for what I wanted to do then VBA even if VBA is bloody included with the bloody software to begin with.

From small towns to castles from musty taverns to grand organizations. Meddlers are known as such because they are often skilled in healing but with that comes knowledge in how to kill. They have no explicit code or loyalty and have been to known to be employed from one source while simultaneously being hired by another competing faction. Meddlers are often brought into the trade at a young age often coming with either a self taught skill or some level of advanced training. They often start as basic healers loyal to those who have given them the opportunity but as time progress they grow increasingly more devious. Youll never know you were betrayed until it is too late. As their knowledge base of healing increases so does their knowledge base of lethality.  Youll often find them on a battlefield administering care to both sides or possibly in the corner of a tavern awaiting their next target ready to carefully strike with poison leaving no discernible trail. Be wary of seeking a Meddler for your adventure although their abilities in healing cannot be understated it may not be worth the risk of letting one too close to you for so long.,talesfromtechsupport,cx7epj9,3,t5_2sfg5

Doing this internally or contracting it out doesnt really matter too much for some it might be cheaper to contract it out and for others it might not and even if not cheaper it might not be an option because of security reasons. If they contract out help desk theres generally only one layer of bureaucracy.However when it comes to desktop support even if charged ridiculous amounts its often cheaper than still having someone on full time. Id often drive to towns that only had a population of a couple thousand or less and it wouldnt make sense for these retailers and banks to hire me or anyone else full time at any of these locations because Id be sitting around idle  of the time. Even if they had me on to support a bunch of locations Id still be idle  of the time.This is why my contractor contracted out someone else to contract me  it doesnt make sense to keep a rural presence for them and its much easier just to get someone else to take care of the hassle for them and theyd probably save money in the end even if they didnt take a cut of whenever I did work for them even though I highly doubt they didnt take a cut.,talesfromtechsupport,cxf4myj,4,t5_2sfg5

Unless someone puts a lot of manhours into manually organizing documents and removing outofdate documents its very hard to find anything.

The interface is clunky  there are more steps than the simple create page gt copypaste of a wiki or the drag and drop of Dropbox. It cant do everything that developers and endusers want and its difficult to add functionality.My personal impression is that it was fine when it was released in .

Rebooting a server is something that should be last resort after giving up and listening to your nonIT executive superiors bitch at you. Now you run into the issue of support not being able to replicate the issue.Edit I should also add this if the software support team cant figure it out when it does happen keep on escalating until they bring in the one guy on the planet that coded that one part of that one module of that program and hope for the best. If they end up calling in help from someone like Cognizant or Infosys then best of luck to you and your job.

Its not that youd necessarily want to move it from room to room on a regular basis  just the idea that you can buy a rack ready to go with hardware and software preconfigured and not need to worry about building out a server room or maintaining your own IT systems.I can kind of see an application in companies like Valve though where people are constantly moving floors and offices.In a traditional office everyone would get gigabit ethernet and the artanimation office would get some Fibre Channel or G ethernet laid in direct to their cluster.At Valve a D artist or animator could be moving on a regular basis as they work on different projects.In that case youd either need to run Fibre or GbE drops to every single floor for them to patch into inefficient given the cost of Fibre and GbE switchesinfrastructure or you could have a little cluster that follows them around and can be patched into directly.I dont know whether Valve do do that but it seems like a use case that could exist niche but existent!.Also lets say you had two nearby officesstudios and couldnt justify two clusters in the days before it was realistic to get a Gb leased line between sites it might be practicable to have the cluster at one location whilst the cut scenes etc were done for one project and  months later move it across for another project. Youre not rolling the thing around on a dailyweekly basis but its more mobile than a static rack.

However as the OS got older and thousands of security patches later that inventory was so large it was crippling the average PCs ability to complete an update.   Heres the Ars Technica about this issue.Also preWindows  many programs and drivers were very bad about cleaning up themselves even if you uninstall the previous version.

Personally I was forever emailing myself with stuff mostly things that I needed to remember to do at home and the occasional shopping list.This meant that they manually put the disclaimer on their email addresses. Thus whenever they sent an email to anybody outside the company two copies of the disclaimer would be sent.Worse the wording in the company guidelines that were sent out with this information in had for some reason decided that the term was eMail. It quite possibly hadnt been updated since the s except the company name which changed on the merger.

Heck for all they know you are working on the very problem that they came to you for and interrupting you will only slow the fix down!I agree that the faster you can get information from them the faster you can prioritize and fix it but I dont think ignoring someone who is just trying to be polite and respect your workspace is the most efficient use of anyones time. If you really are just shooting the shit over IM why wouldnt you just immediately acknowledge them so they know its ok to talk to you? That gets them to go away makes them feel like their problem is being worked on gets you the info you need and makes everyone happy.

I think the maximum was  extra asteroids the default was . That option still exists alongside the new infiniteprocedural option which lets you pick between high medium and low densities of procedurallygenerated asteroids.At this stage planets are not procedurally generated although the game is able to procedurally generate them it simply takes too long to do so which is why its disabled. Unless you spawn in your own planets the only way to get them is to play one of the planets scenarios.Yes when I say build a ship that means block by block build whatever shape you want.

The fix was simple  remove the tray slide the guide back to the marked spot put the tray back GENTLY and press the start button. The users kept calling to report the printer was broken again. I would start explaining the fix and they would say can you just come by and do whatever you do I dont have time.

I worked a lot with MRI and the university had recently spent . million on  new scanners. The big white circular bit of the MRI is just the magnet all the interesting stuff amplifiers and so on are stored in another room.The amps for one of the MRIs were stored in a room under the entrance ramp which was known to flood. Which it did regularly. When it had rained you would open the door to the room and step into a flooded floor. Estates department refused to repair this until something was damaged the never mentioned the risk of electrocution. Naturally this was pretty unsatisfactory all the more so because we would not be compensated for any damage  figures to replace each bit of kit.We solved it in the end by getting our workshop team to make perspex boxes with a drainage tube in the corner for the top of each ampbit of equipment to drain the water into a bucket.TLDR University wouldnt pay a few K to protect its investment so we had umbrellas made for our MRI equipment.Edit formatting FU,talesfromtechsupport,d3kpdmx,7,t5_2sfg5

I did a lot of government work processing forms back in my misspent youth and one of the things which always struck me was that unless a person was very familiar with a given form and knew where to look for this or that field almost every government form gave the impression of being a huge visual mess.Even experienced public servants when confronted with an unknown form could spend entire minutes trying to find a particular piece of data let alone knowing what a specific field label actually meant or what format it should be in.Betterdesigned forms dont try to cram everything onto a single page they tell people where to locate the information they need to write down and give examples to follow along with.Likewise far too many dialog boxes are not actually all that clear to newbies about what theyre asking.

All because I made the mistake of pointing out that the old uniforms were wearing out hadnt been replaced in years and had the old company logo on them.

The volume adjustment wasnt working and would only work when pressing the Fn key. Easy fix.I got it all ready to go for her she came in to get it. Paid and left. A day later she calls in and is furious that I charged her. She claimed that her computer got screwed up recently because of me. I instructed her to stop using Edge and use Firefox or Chrome because if Edge gets hijacked the only fix is a complete reinstall of Windows unlike Firefox or Chrome.She said I was being malicious and that because I told her to not use Edge I caused her computer to no longer be secure and in effect caused it to get so jacked up it needed to be wiped.Apparently the only thing she wanted fixed was the function keys. I told her if she wanted she could come back and I would be more than happy to refund her and put her computer back to its previous state. She didnt like that very much.Good riddance too.

8612402,0,t3_4xpvy9,This sounds like when we used to get escalations from level  support.Background a user with special privileges changed a project database name because they knew what they were doing. Vendor provided a step by step fix that was to be run by the level  and  guys on each affected machine. We documented the fix provided an example script for it to be run on all machines remotely and made a note of when a member of our team would be available for escalations if anything went wrong during deployment and forwarded the case back to level . gt Lvl Hi nowhidden I see you are scheduled for escalations today. We have another issue with application. It would be really nice if you guys could just fix this properly because we are still getting heaps of calls about it.gt Me Hi Lvl. The problem was resolved last week as per the notification sent out from our team. It also detailed what the issue was and how to fix the problem. We have not yet been contacted regarding the change window for the fix being rolled out. I personally assumed that meant you guys were fixing the machines manually.gt Lvl No! The fix you provided doesnt work. You guys clearly have no idea what you are doing.gtMe Actually the fix provided by the vendor does work. We tested  it in our test environment as detailed in the notification we sent out last week. gt Lvl Well I am in front of a machine and I have applied the fix and it isnt working. So you are wrong. The fix just does not work.gt Me Can you show me how you are applying the fix in a remote session?gt Lvl I am not stupid. I know how to follow instructions and these ones dont work. You arent my boss and you cant make me do this all over again just because you dont know what you are doing.gt Me OK well youre right I am not your boss and I cant make you do anything. But you asked me for help here not the other way around. In the time we have been messaging I have recreated the issue on a test machine and applied the fix and confirmed it works. I can send you screen shots if you like. gt Lvl Dont try and be smart with me. I am escalating this to my manager because you clearly have no intention of helping me. gt Me OK no worries Ill send them this chat history and attach the original emails with the vendor as well as the screenshots I took while fixing the problem myself just now. I will also include the vendor noting that this issue was entirely client side and had nothing to do with the server side of the application which means your team could have fixed this easily yourselves if you had bothered to call the vendor support instead of just escalate it because it was too hard. Have a nice day. ,talesfromtechsupport,d6i5b0q,41,t5_2sfg5

8616687,0,t1_d6im94f,I dunno if its still the case but in the late s and early s some of the NYC camera stores had websites that wouldnt let you place an order from  on Friday until  on Saturday because they were owned by Orthodox Jews. Jews are forbidden from doing work on the Sabbath. This is why most ovens and refrigerators come with Sabbath mode and why elevators in Orthodox buildings run continuously with their doors open stopping at every floor on Friday nights. I guess the logic WRT the websites was that the webserver was already powered on and by letting people browse the site you werent doing any actual work. Kind of like people walking down a street and looking in your shop windows. But allowing them to actually place an order would violate Halakha so was forbidden.Again the last time I noticed this was in the late s early s so something might have changed since then.,talesfromtechsupport,d6ionfl,9,t5_2sfg5

She said insurance usually covers it and its not that much but Im not completely sure.  Like WTF lady its an arm sling they are . on Amazon all day for a half decent one.  I figured it wouldnt be a big deal.I got the bill on Saturday my OUT OF POCKET COST after the insurance paid its portion is  dollars!  The best part the sling the doctor sold me actually was too big didnt immobilize my arm and caused me extra pain because my arm was allowed to move around so much.  I ordered a new sling that was smaller on Amazon for . with same day shipping while I was riding in the car in the morning.  It showed up at my door before I went out to dinner that night.

9965716,0,t1_db5j1be,I worked at a small airline where we did  hours days in the winter with a skeleton crew who would work really hard for most of the day but have a couple of two hour windows where our job was to sit around and wait for all the outbound flights to return literally there was nothing else we could do during the winter we didnt even have busywork to fill the time. One solace that we had during those windows was playing flash games online particularly an ATC one that we would all try to set a local record on.One day the managers at the home base decided that the pilots and rampies shouldnt be allowed to use the internet during our downtime so without any announcement or warning they set up a filter and redirected our traffic through it. Unfortunately the IT dept decided that the best time to do this was using remote access during the day which we found out about when the Ops guys mouse started moving erratically while he was trying to schedule outbound flights followed by a phone call to stop fighting me Im trying to do something...Now I wasnt a trained IT guy but I had been the goto person for friends and family for a long while and my Googlefu isnt half bad. I knew enough that when I watched him change the first computer I had a general idea of what he was doing which was confirmed to be a filter when the Ops guy couldnt reload the music site he was listening to. At that point I wasnt sure how it was done but I had two things going for me. First I was an underpaid teenager who spent about  hours a day out in the cold and snow inhaling deicing fumes from the neighboring ramp who had to watch one of the only luxuries we had get stripped away without warning. And two I had the opportunity to watch it get stripped away on the next four computers in that room with the foresight to take notes on what I was seeing.Later that evening I discovered that undoing the redirection to the web filter was relatively easy to do and proceeded to fixevery computer in the room by following the notes I had written in reverse. A couple days later the computers had a filter set up again but there was still no mention from anybody stating that we were supposed to have a filter so once again I fixedall the computers when nobody was around.Our long days meant that we only worked  days in a row each week so I went home that night and came back  days later to find a filter back up. However this time there was something different. The icon to go to network settings had disappeared. This is the point where it transitioned from small acts of civil disobedience to being a puzzle for me. A game that I began to look forward to each day being a new level of difficulty over the last. I spent the better part of a month looking forward to finding out the internet had been filtered because it meant that a new challenge had been prepared for me. I had found the replacement to my flash games as the computers at that citys operation room became more and more locked down until the DoD would have been impressed with the level of security. But I had been fixing the family computer since I was in second grade. I had accidentally discovered paths to configuration settings that were so convoluted any actual tech would have looked at me like I was crazy. I was the silent hero known only to a few who would show up and give the gift of the internet to bored teenagers and pilots alike. This continued up until the upper management finally tried a new tactic and sent out an email to the entire company asking that we please stop disabling the filters on the computers theyre supposed to be there. I had finally been informed through official channels that the filters were intentional and there had been a please in the email with some kind of threat tucked into the later part of the message. So I took it as an official concession walked away feeling victorious and never touched the internet settings on any of those machines again.To the IT person who would have been at this small New England airline a few about  or  years ago if you ever happen to read this I hope that I made your job more enjoyable with this daily competition as opposed to frustrating.

10405611,0,t3_5owo3u,There was a story that was once related to me about the New Zealand Navy working with the US Navy. During a replenishment at sea RAS an enormous hose would be strung between the tanker and the vessel being replenished. This hose would have an enormous metal nozzle.Naturally this giant nozzle is the perfect place for sailors to place their mark.Unfortunately the Americans did not appreciate the Kiwis parting gifts and could be seen scrubbing it off as soon as the hose was recovered.Not to be outdone the Kiwis fabricated a giant kiwi stencil much like the one that adorns the funnels of their ships. The next time the hose came across the stencil was immediately placed and generous amounts of black spray paint applied.  As they pumped fuel across for the next hour or so that paint dried in the hot equatorial sun.Once the process had completed the hose was retrieved and the Kiwis could see the Americans beginning their attack on the nozzle.A week later the ships replenished again. The hose came across and...  The Kiwi was still there. Beaten faded but despite the obvious attempts to remove it it was still defiantly visible.  It may not be true but it makes for a good dit story.,talesfromtechsupport,dcnjklc,19,t5_2sfg5

10469312,0,t1_dcuom0y,Well once I pointed out that wed have to have all of the businesscritical applications completely rewritten he changed his mind and that dumb idea never progressed any further.I mean they were terrible applications and needed to be rewritten anyway but he would never pay for it. Seriously  a server application thats meant to handle tens of thousands of messages per minute and its singlethreaded? I tweaked the database as best I could to get query time down because that was the majority of the apps functionality but eventually you just cant fight poorly written SQL queries.  I mean the implementation was okay standard SQL injection attacks failed  but the developer repeatedly insisted that it was better to pull thousands of rows of data into the app with a SELECT query then loop through that data and have the app run an INSERT for each row whereas writing a single INSERT that uses a subSELECT to add multiple rows would be faster easier for the system to execute and less prone to unnoticed failure.The company had so much potential but you can only spend so much time trying to iceskate uphill. In one performance test I ran simulating normal operating conditions it was literally four hundred times faster to run the INSERT with a subSELECT. By easier I mean that there is one query to be executed which the SQL Server can optimize in its execution plan stage  whereas with thousands of simultaneous queries the SQL Server has no ability to optimize beyond a single row. There is also an upper limit to how many queries the database can execute simultaneously so queries will be queued affecting the performance of any other applications that need to access the database. When the database is flooded with INSERT queries all trying to lock the same table the likelihood of one or more queries being cancelled as the deadlock victim is very high. However if ONE row of thousands is not correctly INSERTed in to the database it is very easy to miss. With a single query affecting thousands of rows the lock contention is vastly reduced meaning being the designated deadlock victim is incredibly unlikely  but even if it was THOUSANDS of missing rows of data is far more likely to be noticed.  So much wasted potential... If only the company had insisted on owning the source code to the applications theyd commissioned we could have fixed it all.Why I could rant pretty much all day.,talesfromtechsupport,dcusxz2,8,t5_2sfg5

Technically it is possible for the police or the jury to do that  but that doesnt make it legal or right.If someone on the court found out a verdict was manipulated due to nullification or jury members rejecting the law on the books  the trial result would be immediately be thrown out requiring a new trial or the prosecution would be given a chance to appeal  And jury members could potentially face sanctions or charges for disobeying the courts instructions.,talesfromtechsupport,dcwwlok,1,t5_2sfg5

Just like someone with the  by their name in this story.

He explained The quintessential nature of photography is to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars on camera equipment  but no matter how much you spend it will never be enough. No matter how good your camera is youll always have dick envy for someone with a bigger one.So based on that experience I have to conclude that a photographer getting their camera stolen would be akin to someone having their dick stolen after they put  of jewelry on it. ,talesfromtechsupport,df3o7rp,8,t5_2sfg5

The CxO would be welljustified in reprimanding possibly firing whichever managers made the call or failed to object to the call to immediately turn off all accounts and completely disrupt business operations to correct backend security weaknesses.While open safe IS a major security risk  and should be recognized as a breach event   since the problem has been in place for two weeks  it cannot be considered a breach emergency   its a risk that should be cleared within   hours.Having all users with admin access might not be as big a  risk to the business as you think it is  provided the other proper protective security controls are in place  How does your organizations security plan prevent  the legitimate Domain Admins  from abusing their powers  to launch inside attacks?   Those legitimate accounts can be compromised too.. If you have trusted your employees for  weeks  you can likely trust them for  weeks   day.If not you should have backups.And clearing the security risk sooner does not fundamentally reduce the amount of labor that will be required for postmortem investigation and  complete review of audit logs to decide if there is any damage or  improper access  to be dealt with.,talesfromtechsupport,dg5x5bx,2,t5_2sfg5

We basically have to teach our users how to use our products specialty printers so Ill make them k in commission from busting my ass all week in a client only for them to buy me a  sandwich as thanks Long story short you can guess how often I try to upsell now lol  Luckily Im one of the most senior employees here and am basically the only one who knows my job through and through so I dont worry about my s ever.

A hardware based attack like that would be more likely as part of a targeted effort but then getting the right fan to the right peron becomes quite a bit harder. At some point any other device is just as easy to compromise.  I wouldnt really worry about it  at the same time fans and the like should just be powered directly from the mains anyway and that eliminates that particular risk at no additional cost.,talesfromtechsupport,dgkwboq,16,t5_2sfg5
11693114,0,t1_dgl4oh0,Your phone van tell a dumb charger that it will draw more power by first checking the data line status when it is plugged in and then will see that the dumb charger is not actively signalling and that there are static defined voltages on the lines telling the phone it can draw more than mA out of the port.A power aware BIOS will also sense USB power draw and if a device on plug in draws more than mA it will disable that port and keep retrying. The fan probably is a regular V fan which draws around A of power and thus this will trip the power management as it likely on start up is doing aggressive power management  fans are not yet tested as to function so all power is limited to prevent damage and this A load will trip the board into a safe power off state.,talesfromtechsupport,dglfl6s,3,t5_2sfg5

11739725,0,t3_672d56,Welcome to call center hell. I spent  years working for a company that allowed this kind of abuse because they were afraid of losing a single client. As a result I became a bitter cynical phone support rep who stood up for myself steamrolling over and often disconnecting calls of this nature.rantHell one time we had a guy call from an unlisted number and kept demanding that we replace his telephone. He wouldnt give us any information because the cable company knows me when I call in so you should too. He was rude disrespectful and tried to bully my female coworkers into giving him a phone then wouldnt tell them any info to give him a phone. He even went so far as to tell a Spanish speaking rep that he should go back to Mexico and learn English even though the caller kept hitting the number in the automated system for Spanish. Important point here we were all in the same building on the same floor with no one more than  feet from anyone else.Eventually I had everyone roll his calls through the system until I was the only person he would speak with at which point I was polite then slightly insulting then down right rude and eventually told him if he called us back our company would press harassment charges. This stupid sumbitch had the audacity to say that he was being unjustly persecuted and that he had never been rude and had never said anything disrespectful. We got our IT dept. to finally block all unknown numbers. Still makes me mad after  years.rantSeriously if you dont have a supervisor that backs you up get ready to defend yourself. Look for clever ways to politely let people know that theyre calling you for help and if they want to be rude they cant shove it where the sun dont shine. Sometimes you have to just ignore the caller and finish a sentence.,talesfromtechsupport,dgqq7j5,2,t5_2sfg5
