Search by zip code . Its a quick commute to Eden Prairie. In downtown Linden Hills theres a famous childrens bookstore called Wild Rumpus fantastic breakfast and dinner spots two coffee shops and a few little stores. Youre right by Lake Harriet which has walking trails beaches and the bandshell which features live music most nights of the week during the summer. Southwest Minneapolis schools are the best inner city schools in the city. Youve got the diversity because theyre public but theyre high quality because of the area. Youre also close to quite a few private schools. Its also my understanding that this area hasnt been affected by the poor housing market and that the houses have kept their value. I can tell you just from being in the area that houses dont stay on the market for long. We just had our first baby and I havent joined a moms group yet but I know there are a lot of SAHMs in this area for your wife to meet. My husband and I live here and we love it. Were in our early s and still getting established so we can only afford to rent in this area but its our first pick for where to buy a house once we can afford one here. ,Minneapolis,cg9987j,3,t5_2r3bl

It also mentions rush hour but I think th is more crowded when people are going to the lakes  on the weekends.And Im a biker too I want more bike lanes.

It isnt the same as it would be from a Chinese restaurant as it is breaded instead of battered but the care and quality is higher than that of Chinese restaurants in the same area which is known for Asian cuisine. The initial reason for me going here was that Quang was too busy and I didnt have time to wait to eat there. It is at least as good if not better and they make excellent Chinese food as well.

Sure black people commit more crimes when you look at statistics but that doesnt explain the issue and that it is a socioeconomic problem. Its going to take good education to get these kids out of that world. If its an extra step before kicking them out of school to try and find out what the real issue is and the motivations for suspending them I dont see why thats such a bad thing.Your stats arent wrong I just feel like they work more in favor of an argument for extending some of these kids a little extra guidance intervention and maybe a second chance here or there.Also looking at your comment history you seem to comment a lot on specifically black people crimes in a variety of local subreddits. rvirginia rdelaware rnewjersey romaha rmaryland rmichigan  rStLouis rNorthCarolina and I am sure many others.

3161182,0,t1_copcw7s,Your original comment sums up my thoughts on the issue nicely. And in FAR fewer words than the WaPo article. I agree with you weve got a long way to go.However the WaPo article is clearly designed to be a lot of scary and very little analysis. It does an even poorer job than the Atlantic article did in investigating root causes. The first third of the article is just rehashing the Atlantic article which he could have linked and summarized in a paragraph instead of .Next some bare bones comparisons between Mpls and other cities. Not even analysis just listing numbers.Then talks about a Berkely study thats completely unrelated as far as I can tell. It doesnt even mention using data from any of the metropolises hes referenced just SEGREGATED CITIES ARE BAD. Which nicely sets up his scary maps at the very end of the article designed to show MAXIMUM SEGREGATION without doing any analysis on how it compares to other cities.All this so the author can set up the bomb the mic drop the elephant in the room of every education policy maker in MN the education gap. As you said Betsy Hodges acknowledged it first thing after the Atlantic piece.Fixing the education gap and other racial disparities in our state is going to be hard complicated and take a long time. Bullshit rehashed stale articles designed more to scare or elicit an emotional response than inform arent going to help. Theyre going to make it harder to have a rational discussion based on facts.Makes me so glad weve also got Minnpost a great homegrown news source that does incredible data analysis.

3162633,0,t3_2wb0kg,I think the sailboat is emblematic of the lakes here and by association of Minneapolis. We are afterall the largest city in The Land of  Lakes. Other large Midwestern cities have skylines grew up along major waterways and river confluences and they might even be lucky enough to have great parks systems and lots of bicycle trails. For a large Midwestern city though the small freshwater lakes in Minneapolis are relatively unique. Chicago may be butted up on Lake Michigan but the little lakes that Minneapolis has grown up around are calmer warmer and generally more accessible to the general public for day to day recreation. Id argue that while Minneapolis is currently known for having a great parks system and an active cycling community  the legacy of sailing is more unique longer running and iconic of the lakes our city has grown up around.   ,Minneapolis,copt05y,2,t5_2r3bl

However we also have to remember that a bunch of stupid kids is what that was... a bunch of stupid kids.  The problems being addressed lately were about black people being treated unfairly and this incident doesnt change that.

If youre renting and have the choice go with the  Lofts building over  or ... rooftop community room is the advantage.  There are a few pretty cool buildings right on Washington in the NL that are quite nice.  This new building looks really nice if I was looking to rent downtown again I would go here The Nic   I really never enjoyed going out in Uptown and the streets are miserable to navigate in the winter.... I found that  of the time my friends would come downtown to our place rather than me head out to Uptown.Also a lot of the North Loop is free parking after p and weekends non Twin game days which is great for visitors.Things I would recommend looking for in a place Underground  Heated parking ... for k you can have this and its worth every penny The following amenities are nice to have  elevators community rooftop patio andor pool and private balcony Live close to where you have fun at... for me it was downtownnorth loop... its so much nicer to walk home after a night out than deal with trainscabs.

5189757,0,t1_cvbin2w,gtgt What is an hour of my life worth?gtThat is the point. By asking what it is worth is by definition asking what someone else values it at. Im going to stop you right there. Youre not saying what their life is worth youre saying what the work is worth. And even that is a negotiation. And as far as what my life is worth no one else gets to decide that. In an egalitarian autonomous world only that individual gets to decide that. And in a world where traditional work is not mandated in order to simply survive or even in the case of someone born into modest wealth a person is free to decide just that.You are arguing from a position that dictates others get to decide what youre worth if you happen to be working class. Ill give you that it is in fact the world we currently live in. But you should also realized that the minimum wage is a regulation weve collectively accepted as a reasonable correction to that problem including occasional hikes as a market correction. Unless you want to talk serious population control policies fostering labor deficits closing all immigration and instituting a minimum basic income then you wont see actual fair wages to the working class because of the uneven playing field which is why the hike is necessary.Edit Spelling,Minneapolis,cvbk1wj,1,t5_2r3bl
5195106,0,t1_cvbkubc,Im only going to address one thing and that is this idea youve got of worth and thats only because Ive realized youre only really interested in debate. Totally okay Im just not interested in that. Im interested in stating my views in hopes that others see them and evaluate them.What one hour of work is worth is solely dependent on an agreement between two people. The person needing the labor performed and the actual laborer. Thats it.If you own an ice cream parlour and you decide that its only worth . to scoop out desserts but you cant find anyone to do the work at that low wage it clearly isnt worth that wage.However if you live in a country where labor is in surplus wages are stagnant prices on goods have skyrocketed and theres a serious lack of labor laws and rights there will always be someone who will take that work. And its not due to value or worth. Its due to desperation. Mild desperation maybe but desperation nonetheless.This is the point we are at. This is the world weve created through policy. The system with its minimum wage as is does not enable real value or worth to be derived from the work available because the tables have been so heavily weighted in favor of one party at the negotiating table.,Minneapolis,cvc7d75,2,t5_2r3bl

If neither catches my fancy I might go check out Austin for a month too though.But yeah your turn to answer one of my questions . Im trying to figure out where the best place to live in NYC is where I can get a room subletting from someone who has an open room for month where would you recommend? From what Ive been researching it seems like maybe Ill have to live in Bushwick SunnysideWoodside the border between the northernmost part of Upper East Side  southernmost part of East Harlem maybe between th and th or Washington Heights  far Northwestern Manhattan.

7106895,0,t1_d1lub4x,I dont think it matters where they learned it or if the MPD approves of it or not. It was a basic takedown. I was a wrestler purple belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu and also train Judo. The takedown the officer used was pretty much the same takedown they teach first day students for selfdefense. For good reason its a simple and very effective takedown. Should the officers start using complicated andor less effective takedowns?gtGenerally seems to me that any strategy for taking someone down where they have the opportunity to grab your gun is probably not the best one to employ.True. However from the rhetoric I hear surrounding this takedown it seems a lot of people think taking someone down is just a matter of which technique you use. When in reality taking a person down that doesnt want to be taken down is a very difficult thing to do no matter which technique you are using and rarely does a takedown go exactly as planned. I think whats being missed here is that reaching for the gun has nothing to do with which takedown was used. Its not the officers fault someone decided it was a good idea to resist commands and grab for their gun. ,Minneapolis,d1lxwdc,1,t5_2r3bl

I guess if you want to define fully transitioned to be something that has to occur on a genetic level then yeah no one ever fully transitions. But you are literally the only person who defines it like this and I imagine if you werent trying to win an argument youd readily admit how ridiculous it is to believe that someone who has undergone hormone therapy and sex reassignment surgery hasnt fully transitioned because of their DNA.gtAs I said as it was for centuries and still is in the vast majority of the world you kick males out of womens restrooms and locker rooms and charge them with a crime.If a dude is indistinguishable from a women aside from having a dick how would you figure out they werent a women? Youd have to check the genitals of everyone going into the bathroom which is a much graver invasion of privacy than anything that would be prevented by the law. You know how weve actually been doing this for centuries largely without any problems at all aside from frightening social regressives? Weve been letting people use the bathroom that fits with their gender presentation. Your law would actually upend how things have been for centuries.gtSoooo much name calling which is why I am done replying to you. Hope you feel like you accomplished something here though. Bottom line is you react with anger and name calling when you are met with actual arguments.I didnt call you a name. I pointed out that your response was mostly posturing. I made an observation about your response. If you cant separate yourself from your response then you should work on that because you are more than just the text you write.And in any case I imagine the real reason that youre done replying to me is that you cant actually respond to any of my points and thats frustrating for you.

8236822,0,t3_4s2mh4,Ive lived in the west metro for most of my life and currently coach in Edina. Edina is a good school and a safe place but it can be VERY pretentious. Its convenient to get to downtown and its safe and such just know what youre getting yourself into.Due to where Ive worked Ive never used mass transit so Ill limit my thoughts on that to saying you should look into the Park amp Ride locations. If you use that you can broaden the area you look in for housing. That being said I have a lot of experience as well as input from friends that teach andor coach in the west metro. Here are the school districts in the west metro that Id recommend looking into based on my experience Eden Prairie good schools but the high school is huge Minnetonka Hopkins cheaper housing but still good schools. If you bike there are a couple of very nice and convenient trails that can take you straight to Target field Wayzata very good schools but the high school is huge also it has a bit of the Edina pretentiousness Maple Grove a bit further out but more recently developed. Good schools in a growing communityIve seen some people say Plymouth and while it was ranked  city to live in for its size a few years back Id recommend western Plymouth over eastern Plymouth. Go far enough west to get into the Wayzata school district. Last I checked district  doesnt limit open enrollment so theres a lot of riffraff that get bused into the schools on the east side. It has a good reputation but things have gotten a lot worse in recent years.,Minneapolis,d575pk7,1,t5_2r3bl

Nor do I need you to brosplain the success of the LGBT movement to me. I mean seriously. LGBT liberation is about freak liberation. Its about expanding possibilities rather than conforming to the expectations of heteropatriarchy. Rather than fixating on how white people can be goaded into accepting black people by framing black peoples lived experience in palatable terms for white people. White people in Minnesota and beyond need to let go of their prejudice and learn to accept difference. ,Minneapolis,d579s99,0,t5_2r3bl

The precedent is pretty clear.Whether or not the city has the power to raise the minimum wage under state law is a another question one that will probably have to be settled in court.  But the argument that the city can only regulate business through ordinances not the charter is baseless.  The old charter clearly demonstrates this.I never said that the city attorney was personally opposed to hr.  But her job is to represent the city government in legal matters and the mayor and most of the city council currently oppose hr.

It could reasonably be assumed anyone working at least that much is working a job meant to support them. High school kids retired people etc who are basically just working to get some extra spending money are much less likely to work  hours a week. Obviously there could be issues with employers trying to cap hours at week but that is already happening to avoid other requirements.

When was it racist to make a distinction when it applies to the argument.  By these communities I mean the communities that BLM is most active in.  This is the crux of it Sometimes BLM is just wrong in its philosophy and misinterprets the numbers and the events.  And yes the black community is struggling now how is it racist to say that?  Lastly said IF the system were racist IF thats important.  I dont apologize for the justice system either.  All this comes down to the people who make up these institutions and organizations.  The justice system is not infallible and neither is BLM.  I tend to question some of the things I hear if I have seen something contradictory with my own eyes and Im not going to recount every instance with you here just to prove a point.  Some of the things BLM does are obviously good but right now I think that it has attracted some bad attention from people wishing to take advantage of the message.  That and I think that there are those within the organization that are more concerned with convincing people that they are right over the actual truth.  Its like saying that one group has a monopoly over what people know to say anything to the contrary is seen as ignorant and I guess this makes BLM especially angry when anyone questions their sense of an event.    ,Minneapolis,d69clk8,1,t5_2r3bl

And why shouldnt traffic lights in highdensity areas be built with pedestrians in mind or even prioritized? If the goal of certain areas is a vibrant street life that should sometimes come at the expense of carfocused intersections.

You wont be able to find the kind of rent you had in Omaha in the city but you can find some deals in the suburbs. In the West Id suggest Wayzata Excelsior Chan and Chaska.

It sounds better to call it a Womens Rights March than an Im angry and bitter my candidate lost March. Calling it a womens rights March gives it validation rather than just being a bunch of petty children upset they didnt get their way. Trump has said a lot of sexist things because he is an idiot and people are mad especially women. However many women still voted for the idiot.  of all white women voted for Trump and  of his total votes were from women. If he is such a sexist man here to oppress women and set the country back  years why did so many women vote for him? Not all women hate him. That is a fallacy. The March was from liberal women who are mad a Republican won and a woman lost. I have no issues with the protest because it was non violent and a lot of people men and women got to vent some frustration after a very bitter election.

I think the best approach is to take on as much as we responsibly can. I believe that we dont talk about this balance  because the issue is so polarizing. People assume there are only two choices  Take on every last immigrant in the world or  block them all. Its way more greyscale! Every state can do its part but not more than it can handle. Also whats wrong with the idea of helping people fix their own countries? Theres nothing wrong with this. My gut reaction is that were just not that good at it. Im trying to think of instances in which our foreign policy has really helped a country develop.  We need to stop bombing other countries and start helping them develop. YUP! YUP YUP YUP.

Theyre not wrong. There are many of us and were by and large more affluent than other demographic groups. Perhaps only second to teenage girls who have proxy power over the funds of and are able to inflict duress upon their white straight middleaged American Christian raised fathers.Many look at that reality above and say its unfair. Yep it is. Its life its not fair and that sucks. Some whinekvetchpost on Strib comments some ignore it and do their best to persevere and try to beat the odds and some try to do something about it by attempting to change the world around them.My suggestion to you would be this  look at this committee which is really just some people getting together to make a list and giving it to someone to look at not as an affront to your causes. It is not lesser or greater just different. It is not meant to be divisive they just want to bring attention and resolution to their perceived injustice like you would to yours. You dismiss it summarily as a madeup wedge issue and in the same dialog complain that your concerns are dismissed unfairly. You must see the irony of such a stance do you not? If you have a cause you feel strongly about like access to support for white males in poverty champion it! Youll likely find that others do care and want to be those helping hands. Dont shit on people for having the will to take action and attempt change join in and make the change you want to see in the world.,Minneapolis,ddqzhdr,1,t5_2r3bl

The argument is how long from CLOSE which means the property is sold that the owner moves in or takes possession. You quoted an article about RESPA laws which is lengthening the time from an accepted contract until close. Which has nothing to do with move in or possession.
