11039007,0,t3_5xmqbw,Now robotization is subsidized in most countries or by taxrefunds while like banks all companies are parasites of the peoplecustomers tax and resources of a country so its not innovation much more starvation.Politics are always in favor of the big moneycompaniesEU!  thats why costs for people have gone up and for companiesbig money have gone down. Thats also reason people now cant have as much kids as  years ago cause they have to work both. In those days you worked  day in the week for costs of a house so you could support up to  kids and go on holiday. Solution . No longer subsidize robotcompanies by any means . Let every robot its company pay for every hour it works like its a employee a robotsalary which money goes into a statefund which pays part of it budget for the people for it. Foreign companies have to pay a robottax which goes into the same fund. That why robots and their companies contribute to the people and countries instead of ripping them off.  Btw im not against robots esp. if they perform tasks tat are too dangerous for people but if they only benefit the companys profit and hurt the people lost jobs and country misuse of resources its like i said more starvation then innovation.,russiawarinukraine,dej930m,1,t5_38bei
