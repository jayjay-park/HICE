2966335,0,t3_2u5bhv,It was done in the episode about NPCs. I am not sure about the excat time at which they talk about it but here are the video links for part one and part two  If you want a tldr or a tldw the basic is you have to know what they want and why they want it but keep things simple. Everything that is not discovered by the players basically does not exist thats very short if you want the full explanation watch the vod,beingeverythingelse,co5ad7j,3,t5_32v70
3000562,0,t1_cnvyh1d,Being able to separate character information and player information is really important if you dont want to censor the interaction. To me its an issue of trust  the more you setup a campaign where having advantage over other players is important the more you have to consider how much you trust each other.I dont like it if as a player I get to see how a certain NPC works without earning it as a character first. I dont want to know how much armour the enemy has because the number is added to my roll in DnD or how exactly difficult a skill test is in Numenera. On the other hand if a GM is keeping an eye out for cheating while he keeps rolling his dice under the table that pisses me off. A friend of mine GMs like that and fudges rolls from time to time  I sort of get it because he GMs for a bunch of kids but Id rather look for a better system that offers the least amount of volatile rolls instead of fudging when something stupidly unrealistic happens.,beingeverythingelse,co908gi,1,t5_32v70
