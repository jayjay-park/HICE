7436413,0,t3_4h12kt,Looks like Sfakianakis is teaching the online summer course. Ive taken a class with him in person and it went fine though he tended to read most of the power points and talk about different things. Taking an online class means that you have to manage all of your own time and make sure that you get everything turned in on time.Georges assignments are wellassigned and hes fairly lenient on due dates like accepting them a few hours late.,grossmont,d2nh0m1,1,t5_2spa5
