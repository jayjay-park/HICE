1467536,0,t3_2an7p3,We never talk. She ignores me most of the time the moments we once had are only memories. I sleep on the couch in the living room thinking about when we used to share the bed. The walls of our bleak one bedroom apartment once looked peaceful and kind. It only now reminds me of the misery our relationship has become.We had slowly started to fall apart after the affair it sealed our fate together. We could never afford to move out based on our current wages so it become to seem like I was living with a stranger. I still feel for her but I know it will never be the same. We tried to make it work for the babies sake. We had both came from broken homes and promiced to not make the same mistakes. This is not how I planned but how it turned out is remarkably similar to my parents own life situation. We fool ourselves from time to time with therapists and group talks yet never helps. We are to narrow minded to admit defeat and divorce. I know shell never tell me that she is still sleeping with the man who apparently broke our marriage. Needless to say the love was already gone and to put the blame on someone else was easier than telling each other that we werent ment to be. I cant say I have been faithful either after the moment I turned to a series of hopeless affairs. Sleeping with women who were the real world equivalent to a Barbie doll. Blonde tall dumb and full of plastic. I havent been the best person but this place kills me.I hate what my life has become I loathe this shitty apartment and despise what will become of me if I stay here. There is no hope here no life worth living and certainly no chance for love.,FinishInTheComments,cj08bqz,1,t5_30mjp
