Just down and to the left of the first electricity pole on the right side.Here are some traditional sticks.Most modern sticks are made out of plastic. They are mostly shorter red with a white reflex element to them. They do vary a bit though to denote dangers like boulders or bumps etc.,NorwayPics,dghqtmv,5,t5_3339j
