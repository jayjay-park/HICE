I will have to look into it in more detail.Discusses the two schools of thought on heraldry  Encyclopedia Britannica  The two schools of thought are that heraldry has always existed and people were using devices etc. on their shields to denote individual families.  Some hold that the old colors symbols etc were only connected to military units and did not become related to families until the th Century.Here is a wikipedia link for the Origins of Heraldry sorry its wikipedia,heraldry,ck1ibfu,2,t5_2r04o

2360125,0,t1_cm3ew8t,That comment just made my day. No he was descended from a bastard line of the Great Clan Ciakai. This is sort of a mixture of two styles in that matter as the diagonal stripe represents bastardy in Titianician designs and the black and red is more to represent the low nature of the Clan Lazin. Black is considered the color of ash and the red shows that they have mortal blood. Clan Ciakai instead was more or less two white rings on a field of gold. On the astronomer note the Lazins where excellent astronomers due to their time out on the sea commanding their treasure fleet which they where exiled on. The treasure fleet in question was half a gift and half a challenge as Tianzi Oato the brother to the father of the first Lazin was friendly with Lazin but had to exile him due to political reasons.

It doesnt have to act as a pictogram with something from every aspect of your life.Now thats all just IMHO.The biggest issue I see is the azure on sable field. Yes I see the fret is outlined in or but its still kind of low contrast. There are always exceptions of course but the general rule in heraldry is metal on colour colour on metal never metal on metal or colour on colourThink street signs.

The same as  but in this case I would take it out.. Argent a cross voided Gules inflamed Or overall a rose cinquefoil? of the second seeded of the third. In this the only issue I see is having the flames Or on Argent because while it doesnt break the rule of tincture details such as flames dont count they are just not visible.. Argent a raven Sable facing dexter crowned Or in its chest an inescutcheon Azure a bordure of the third. Chief chequy of three rows by default Sable and Argent Nothing to say maybe except the legs of the raven which should be black not grey and its head that usually faces dexter.. Per bend Azure and Or a threelegged cock Proper. While proper is not well regarded as its a cheatcode its still lawful.. Azure four pallets Argent a rams head affronted Argent horned Sable. The rams head should be Sable to avoid breaking he rule of tincture.. Sable three mullets of eight points Argent. This is a winner! One of those rare cases of Nah don use this its so simple Im sure it already exists that in fact isnt taken.. Or a chief Purpure. Overall a lion Gules eyes teeth tongue and nails Argent grabbing a sword Argent in fess with its dexter. Better put the lion on the field not on the partition.. Argent a pale Gules. Overall a horse passant regardant of the same mane and hooves of the field collared with a crown  of the same. Not really bad but Gules on Gules..
