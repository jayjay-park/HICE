3776387,0,t3_338nfl,I didnt get around to playing this map today but thought of a couple of things based on what I saw in others matchesBugs You can shoot arrows onto the world spawn tripwire platform from within the arena. This seems to cause some problems with the redstone. As you cant place any blocks above it I suggest an invisible barrier wall in between the arena and the platform or a command block constantly deleting arrows which are out of bounds.Possible issues None! DImprovements I like the bow and arrow addition it gives a bit of variation to the weapon and how you have to use them.To me this seems like a pretty polished game in the end. I hope it gets received well. ,minecraftplaytesting,cqmqi7e,2,t5_37wtf
