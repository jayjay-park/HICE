5374074,0,t1_cvykr8l,Ah must be some serious impatience on my part then. I know the green squares filling up the entire grid is a pretty big representation of progression on the whole but when I look at them I still think of them as single rows and when they fill up thats it bye row.Im coming up on building  now still no clue when I should stop prestigeing and just let the rows fill up.
