2939565,0,t3_2ttl21,I dont know if the curriculum at your uni will be the same as mine Saxion University in The Netherlands but here is my advise.From the looks of it youve already got a head start of everyone when youll start at uni. If you want to prep more on the calculus side you might want to look into the Laplace transform and integrating in general. Im planning to do my minor in bio mechatronics as well but I cant tell if its worthwhile job wise. Mechatronic engineers are very popular in the job market general from what Ive heard so I guess itll be the same for biomechatronics.Hope this answered your questions ,mechatronics,co28p8e,4,t5_2qjim
