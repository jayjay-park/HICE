4739142,0,t3_3ftp1r,Gagging I look around at anything but the splatter of blood but there wasnt much else to see. After weeks spent holed up the only thing of value left in my flat is a long black singleedged sword with an unraveling grip. An old lover had given it to me back before. He had purchased it on a whim from a traveling merchant who swore to its authenticity and I never had the heart to tell him that while it was certainly a foreign blade it was not from my homeland as he had thought it was but a neighboring country where the people also looked like I did. Like many of my lovers he had been piqued by my foreignness and at the time I had been young enough to be willing to indulge him.In the end though this sword outlasted both that relationship and also every other weapon I ownedwhich I had ended up having to sell one by one to support my recent prolonged hermitage. I kept the sword not due to sentimentality but because it was frankly speaking a piece of junk that was made to be displayed not used. I would probably eventually end up having to sell it for scrap metal. Ah well I preferred using my fists anyway. ,YouEnterADungeon,ctrwvk7,2,t5_2y9ea
4743524,0,t3_3flyb2,Ah! Im Fitzpatrick Roth! Pleased to make acquaintance... I do hope it is mutual?His chocolate eyes curve upward in the corners as he gives a little smile the rows of tiny yellow teeth lining the front of his mouth only on display for the lack of lips covering them. His skin pulled tightly around his face leaves little else to move in his expression.The lack of ears on his head the lack of hair on his visible body and the stretched pale flesh makes his face reminiscent of a jackolantern. In the chair he sits in his height makes him shift here and there to adjust his legs for comfort. His wallet holds an Employee ID card for a London library years old showing a bearded man by the same name and approximately the same height listed. Fitzpatrick Roth of then now a tall Nosferatu with a polite American accent curving his words.He attempts to lift a hand rattling the handcuffs on the table and quickly lowering it to not break them. Oh do excuse me! I dont mean to be so rude when I ask but... why am I here? I was simply taking pictures! The museum was so beautiful I just had to He takes a gasp inward Had I done something illegal by taking them? I only had exterior shots...Backstory Fitzpatrick works for none of the NPCs mentioned yet is open to work for whichever offer depending on what they require him to do.He is a former librarian turned Nosferatu by a moderately influential kindred who was quick to abandon him. His sire is by no means influential in his unlife in this current day having disappeared into the shadows and never returned. He was  at the time of his Embrace with no immediate family and only the involvement in many clubs and little activities to fill his life aside from his work.In light of the horrific disfigurement the Nosferatu curse brought he was able to fall in with a group of kindred that traveled around the world broadening his world view beyond what he already knew so well from his books.Abilites DexterityCelerity Vs StaminaFortitudeDue to the combination of his height and the tightened skin over his body his dexterity isnt the best. He must be careful with even some minor activities such as lifting a mug lest his condition betray him and cause stiffness or strain. A brisk walking is his best method of quick travel and any spending of blood to make him go faster than what his body is prepared for would only end in disaster.His skin and natural build do provide protection despite the downfalls. Despite his flexibility and speed of his body now being quite impeded his stretch skin and body are able to take more than the average kindred. Social Knowledge Vs Book KnowledgeHe is a scholar and collector. A man of the arts and of words damned be Fitzpatrick Roth if hes wants to manipulate anyone. His vast base of knowledge seems to be his downfall in certain social situations even creating issues of spotting obvious remarks of sarcasm despite all his knowledge as he may read too much into things. Fighting StyleWhilst he may have the barest knowledge of firearms and their maintenance putting a gun in Fitzpatricks hands can be dangerous for all parties involved as his fingers can lock up from the repetitive pulling of a trigger thus making him swear off of the weapons. The safer bet and his more comfortable option would be to place a blunted or bladed weapon in his hands. His body takes those closecombat hits well yet his bodys restrained flexibility has him compensating by relying on rehearsed maneuvers to respond to attacks upon his person. So whilst Fitzpatrick may not be prepared for a Matrix style fightscene hes most certainly able to read others enough to react in defense. Arts Crafts amp Stories Vs TechnologyWhen one has time on their hands and lack of internet connection in travel the traditional crafts and the writing spell help with entertainment.Fitzpatrick enjoys many manner of crafts from scrap booking to bookbinding sewing to photography etc. etc. Writing the odd poem or short story also comes to him from time to time though these things are more of an added flair to his simple tastes rather than a glorious activity.Concerning technology whilst he may be able to fix the mechanical bits when it comes to computers or other modern tech hed much rather the old to the new. Tech is the only thing he doesnt care to expand upon in his base of knowledge beyond the occasional internet search for craft inspiration and research to understand methods of modern security for safety.

Or something like that. Whatever the actual reason you find that while you are still effectively tethered to her you dont have to actually hold her hand to get the healing effect. When you mention Emmas angel showing up in the morning he nods. Yeah that fits with what weve noticed  when the power changes it seems to do it at sunrise. God knows why though. Claire laughs and it takes him a moment to catch the accidental pun giving her a wide grin. When you ask to speak to their leaders he nods agreeably and says Yeah sure we can get the Guardados together. We dont really have formal leaders you know? But were the closest thing to it I guess. Follow me yeah? He flashes a bright smile again and pivots on a toe lightly stepping off into the air at a pace slow enough for you all to follow on foot. For a lot of it hes flying backwards so he can maintain casual conversation apparently trusting his angel to steer without hitting anything. As before the volume increases as you approach ground zero. The power hisses violently loud pops and earpiercing squeals intermittent along with the immensely deep rumble and the ceaseless roar of static. Emmas angel keeps their hand on your shoulder a constant presence easing the pain and renewing your concentration. You can still hear very faintly the didgeridoo and heartbeats of the boy and the lively orchestra of Claire behind it all. Any more than that you cant hear over the static. Assuming you have no other actions before reaching the heart of angel territoryBy the time you reach the tent city where you stopped by with the Juggernaut yesterday the angels touch is only just enough to keep the pain at bay and can do nothing for your concentration. It feels like youre standing under a monumental waterfall a constant everpresent force assaulting your mental sense. Even if youre not physically in pain its extraordinarily distracting and its a challenge to even hear normal conversation even though theyre somehow coming through entirely different channels. Youre met by Carlos Robert Rubio Todd and another two Guardados introduced as Jos a cheerful young man apparently a schoolteacher and Sara a pale thin young woman who mentions shes a veterinarian. Mary is absent  you imagine she doesnt want to remind you of who youve lost as per Emmas improvised excuse. There are introductions all around.

As I begin to lift myself up I realize that the only thing I know is my name and theres something else. Nope I lost it. I part my lips and speak my name Emanuel Rogers it sounds foreign and my voice is hoarse I dont really recognize it. I sit up indian style and look around. Im sitting on a hard slate floor staring into the refrigerator door it reflects who I am but I dont recognize myself. All I can recall is my name. Staring at myself in the shiny chrome of the double doors I take stock carefully tracing my features on the mirror like surface. My face is puffy almost fat darker brown but I guess with my name thats to be expected. Bushy eyebrows protrude off my face shading dark brown eyes deep set and perched over a large bulbous nose. A dark mustache and beard hides my dry cracked lips. The strangest thing is on my head a white puffy hat like a chefs hat or something. Am I chef I ask myself.I dont answer.I hear a clatter behind me a few rooms away. Still sitting and not quite sure I can stand at this point I look around for something to defend myself. A glint of silver beneath the fridge reveals a large knife I grab onto the handle it fits my hand just right. The balance is perfect and it feels as if it was made for me. Inspecting the knife I see the my initials engraved in the handle. I stand up my legs shaking and I grab onto the counter top for balance.

We are searching for bandits. A specific group in fact. Weve been tracking their movements for some time and just a few days ago we found our first good chance at finding their base of operations because of a mutiny among one of their scouting parties.

Filing it away for later I continue to wildly speculate.There must be Breaks out there with nonobvious powers that use those powers for profit. Gang activity seems random but it could be organized by some master stringpuller. A stringpuller who really really wants someone to burn people alive so they know whos boss.Remaining independent is going to be hard. Heroes on one side being all Use your power for good! And villains on the other side with Burn people for me!I need to take steps to hide myself and my previous identity before I go fly off into the sunset. Several ways to do that most of which will be tested when I get to the Schoolbuilding. One off the top of my head to to make my superidentity a differing gender. If some guy drops out of college and people report a collegeage guy flying around at the same time theres gonna be problems. Differ the genders and its a bit more confusing. Then again anyone bothering to go that far to find me would be able to assume that I disguise my true identity given that they are just as paranoid as me. Or mindread me.The idea of mind readers raises the hairs on my neck. Lets think about that a little later.I should also obscure parts of my power. Only shoot fire from my handsfeet to make others assume that is all I can do. Smoke ominously before firing to suspend the myth of a buildup before a release. Making certain parts of my facehair catch fire to make it seem like my power mirrors my emotion.More research!Are there any Breaks who can read minds and control thoughts?Breakwise who is the biggest threat to the nation as a whole?How does one join the TRUP?

However it is the last known location of the original Kyrakes Divinations.Mati Corperp Marjorie enter cautiously with Mati leading the rats. The air smells of musty moldering books. The party can hear water dripping and a faint susurration as they approach the shelves. Mati sends the rats an image of the book as the librarian described it to him and they dash off into the archives. The three humans split up.Corperp sees something golden shining down a corridor and heads straight for it. He finds a book on a stand. Its cover is inlaid with gold and gems and has a large ruby in the very center. Corperp looks around pulls out a dagger and starts prying out the gems. The book wakens with a scream deafening Corperp and bursting his eardrums.Marjorie flits down an aisle of scrolls and stops when she sees one hanging on the wall. Cramped dense writing alternates with intricate drawings of strange creatures. The text seems to be in a foreign language at first but when she comes closer she realizes she can read it. She starts reading the story aloud and the drawings begin to shimmer. Shes so engrossed she doesnt notice at first when claw by claw a manylegged serpent climbs out of the scroll. She notices when it wraps its tail around her and begins to squeeze.Mati wanders into a section with books bound in what looks like human skin and bones. He has the experience and good sense not to touch or read anything and rushes on. One of the rats finds him at the next intersection squeaking and leads him to a dusty pile of books. There he finds Kyrakes Divinations. Then he hears two screams.Mati gathers the rats. They find Marjorie and free her from the serpent then go to help Corperp who is curled up in a ball clutching his ears.The Library of Runes thanks the party for obtaining the book and the librarian takes notes on everything they encountered in the Twilight Archives.

A river in the distance and a few small farmhouses and at the very back you can see some enormous snowcapped mountains. On the other side the city stretches out below you. You studied it as part of your assignment but the descriptions and images certainly dont do it justice.The city is roughly circular completely surrounded by the large wall youre standing on. You estimate a diameter to be about a mile. Countless buildings crowd the inside.In terms of landmarks you see the large castle in the middle of the city where you know the Regent rules from and from which you plan to unleash the blight. In front of the castle they are apparently planning to hold their Blessing of the Harvest whatever ridiculous ceremony that might be the day after tomorrow. At the northern end of the city near some hills there is a large templelike building which your guide tells you is the bathhouse. They are apparently very proud of the fact that it has warm water. You see many smaller squares on one of which is a small stone building with a tower supposedly this is the Guard Office. Beyond that all manner of other buildings are to be found as one would expect from a city this size.

You tried to check the timer again but could only get a disoriented uncomprehendable response from the computer. A giant red glow in the sky emmiting though your window however told you that the blast was coming a lot sooner than expected. After securing the passengers on your ship as well as your robots you helped Aria get into position. Once Im through the anamoly Im afraid I wont be coming back Aria said I may end up on a completely new side of the universe or trapped in the innerdimensional space within it. Dont worry for me though the Persephone has always been my home and Ill be happy wherever I end up. Goodbye sir and thank you. With a dying spark of fire the engine mustered all its strength to push the massive vessel back into the strange fold of spacetime from which it came from. The burning light of the supernova grew brighter and soon you had no choice but to warp out of here. Your story was found outlandish back on Earth though you had eyewitnesses and evidential logs the general public couldnt simply believe that you found the legendary vessel or that the things you saw were even possible. Perhaps it was better this way perhaps the Percephone worked best as a legend to keep the mystery of space alive and inspiring.
