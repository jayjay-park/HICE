5047511,0,t1_cuuemt2,can is very clear its optional.  If you allow two rerolls thats fine but it isnt RAW same as allowing the flag reroll before the shooting of a guy.The soviet union book comes with one...A conscript squad carrying a flag to lead them onto victory for the Motherland while a Commissar and NKVD squad strolls behind them is about as iconic an image as you can get.  Surely your gentlemans games promote such imagery.  I field one in the conscripts and another in my tank riders as who doesnt want a man riding a tank flying the flag for the motherland?,boltaction,cuuezqm,1,t5_2wpcf
5183921,0,t3_3m03qt,You might want to pass this along including photos to Warlord games. Offer to pay the postage and they might rectify the situation.As an alternate you might want to dig around and get a plastic kit in the same scale from another manufacturer. Likely with a little conversion and green stuff you can hack together a replacement set of wheels.,boltaction,cvaup58,5,t5_2wpcf

6073327,0,t3_3yo51g,I started out by buying the rules and playing the game using coins as proxies to see if I like the rules. I did so I bought a box of US Army Rangers and US Army infantry standard box and just went to town with building and painting them.I used a mix of Tamiya Humbrol Vallejo and Coat d Arms paints.My group dont buy the official vehicles as they are a bit expensive so we buy  scale Tamiya models and just adjusted the rules for range and stuff.,boltaction,cyfp7pa,2,t5_2wpcf
6429338,0,t3_43r7mu,That really depends on what your thought on a good idea is I suppose. You will almost certainly be outnumbered even by a regular veteran force as Brandenburgers are very very expensive units. It could make for a nice fluffy list though and some of their special rules can be killer!Check out what some of the guys over at Warlord did for the Ersatz series of captured and converted American vehicles to be sneaky with as the Germans. Is this the kind of minmax build you can make to win tournaments? I kind of doubt it. But I love the idea of a bunch of elite disguised German units wrecking havoc on the enemy. Chances are it would be quite fun and I am sure you would get a positive reaction from players in your area.,boltaction,czkby5c,2,t5_2wpcf

6965824,0,t3_4b3m1s,Looks more green than red. Seriously though for a first effort its not bad. Id actually recommend how to pain citadel miniatures while normally GW is terrible and it does intend for you to use their minis it actually helps a lot.,boltaction,d15wu53,2,t5_2wpcf
7067814,0,t3_4btgc7,Ill be honest his list isnt too bad aside from the  inexperienced mortars that are obviously taken as inexperienced to game the indirect fire rules.  Take some flamethrowers HE and a recce vehicle and laugh as his units get torched or obliterated and his panzerfausts can never hit your recce vehicle.  A man cavalry unit on outflank will also probably force one of the units to stay back to protect the mortars and if they dont just eat them up with your  charge and  attacks in combat.Taking all that could be seen as outcheesing but a FT an armoured car and howitzermortar combo are pretty standard.  ,boltaction,d1hhzci,1,t5_2wpcf

7339694,0,t1_d2cbcw1,I will say one thing I dont regret purchasing are these  Im not sure theyre any better than the Arm amp Hammer stuff other than not needing paint but theyre this weird sort of slightly plastic feeling cloth that behaves very similarly to what youre describing.  Of course not really worth it compared to the amountprice value of the AampH stuff.,boltaction,d2ch1jp,1,t5_2wpcf

9136437,0,t1_d89jlkg,Per the second edition rules when shooting an HE weapon at multiple models on the same base you pretend there is a mm base under each individual model and place the HE template accordingly. So yes by the rules as written how you choose to model your Pakzispounderwhatever can actually decide how vulnerable it is to HE fire.,boltaction,d8a3ym4,1,t5_2wpcf

9739295,0,t1_dadcb90,its a fact that most tiger kills werent actually tiger kills allied crews and troops referred to pretty much any large german tank as a tiger.the reason for the pz specifically is that from a distance when it has schurzen and the long  equipped it looks pretty close to a tiger,boltaction,dadkx2f,1,t5_2wpcf

9854936,0,t3_5fpfhj,A little late to this but my general rule of thumb as America is to always make use of the Fire and Maneuver rule. Always equipping plenty of BARs and Rifles. With second edition now in I tend to pack in at least a bazooka I primarily fight Germans and Soviets  of the time. and possibly a single armored vehicles normally at  points its a Bazooka Jeep M Greyhound or M Sherman. I also tend to use the USAs rule for MMGs and tend to deploy  to  per platoon. Infantry in the army usually revolves around Marines Regular Infantry or Rangers. I reserve Airborne and other veterans for larger point games.,boltaction,das4d5c,1,t5_2wpcf

10380210,0,t3_5ollav,uSnazzyer has good points. The  AT rifles could be used to pin down some enemy units but your going to struggle to actually destroy most enemy armour. I find some HE is good to add to the list as it is versatile. If youre opponent brings no tanks than they can still be used against their infantry but they can still do damage against tanks. You could also replace one of your mmg or sniper teams with a mortar.,boltaction,dcknt11,2,t5_2wpcf

11533668,0,t1_dg3bsex,Vet armys can be great. One of my strongest armies is a vet japanese army. However given the composition of your army to me it makes more sense to take the regular guys and get an extra dice. But yeah get on the table and play some games. Everybody has different preferences and you wont find yours until you play. I bought units and vehicles when I first started that I never used again after playing my first games. I feel you though. I also have Jagpdanzer IV painted. Those expensive tanks are very feasible to use when you get up to the  point games.,boltaction,dg3cdjr,1,t5_2wpcf
11653106,0,t3_66a8fj,I painted  different AFVs starting with  Kingtiger only with a brush. Buy an acryllic thinner thin your paints at least  with it water wont work. This way you will have paint that will not automatically obscure details.  layers of base coat are enought. I do not recommend cammo pattern with this try to go with single color and focus on highlighting drybrush is essential but dont be scared of lightening some panels on top to simulate shadows. Use Varnish before applying washes and decals and seal everything again in matt varnish and you are golden ,boltaction,dggw71e,4,t5_2wpcf
