8039830,0,t1_d471xvr,Eh. The anime flattens the characters a good deal honestly.

8113804,0,t3_4pz2vf,Gotta say I like Emilia a LOT better when she isnt some perfect character but rather a character with feelings that feels betrayed hurt pride everything instead of a one dimensional perfect character.And I love Subaru so much more as an MC who doesnt just try to save the heroin.

Also we havent actually learned why she wants to be in the race in the first place and this would provide a motive. Secondly about the name Im sorry but I just personally do not buy the explanation and the rationalization that Subaru comes to in the anime. I stated my reasons for believing so in the opening post. As for the gem shinning thing  we know thats not all candidates start off with the insignia because of Felt. She must have gotten it somewhere. ,Re_Zero,d5aq5kv,1,t5_3e076

8318912,0,t1_d5hef8n,This I find is more common in people who like to root for the protagonist. Not necessarily selfinsert but its more accurate to say its sympathizing with Subarus plight. Given that we primarily see characters from Suburas view and they treat him like a nuisance toy or a tool they seem like assholes. They appear wrapped up in their own issues and generally uncaring of things unrelated to what they want or value.Of course you could make the argument that Subaru really only cares about his desires as well which the anime has pretty much bashed into our heads.,Re_Zero,d5hf4rq,2,t5_3e076

8350578,0,t1_d5fuaaf,gt The most thing i liked about this episode  is that when Subaru couldnt tell how he know all these info about the attack of the Witchs cult  she said nothing .. she asked nothing  she trusted him completely to the point she didnt even try to think about it  Not like how Emilia reacted when she asked him to give her a reason to make her believe him or why he is doing what he is doing to save her!!  all what Emilia could think about is that he is doing all this for his own  this is why i hate her  she is ... stupid  and she dont deserve Subarus love  But Rem know he have a reason  she trusts him  this is what Love is  she LOVES him lti forgot to mention this  Rem is the best in this show  this anime is really good  alot of feelings in this episode  really Romance and Drama episode  and when she trusted him  i really liked this part,Re_Zero,d5ldixr,1,t5_3e076

8562142,0,t1_d6bsmj8,Yeah I did watch the anime and I understand their reasoning but it sucks. All I see is people harping on about how realistic the characters are but lets be honest putting your total unwavering faith in someone who throws themselves head first into a dangerous situation that only works out because someone else shows up at the last minute Roswaal is just idiocy yet its presented in the story as a reason for being best girl.Imagine if you replayed the story from her point of view where she doesnt know what happens in the other time loops. It just doesnt add up. The whole thing reeks of plot holes and conveniences to draw out a romance that is completely unessential to the story you could do away with it completely and there would be more time for actual plot. It wouldnt even be so bad if they actually did the romance differently and had good scenes to show it unfolding not endless dialogue about the same things over and over.There was potential for this show to have a really solid plot and then develop a romance on top of that but theyve done it the wrong way around developing a weak plot on top of incredibly shortsighted and convenient romance. Its not much better than a trashy romance light novel at this point. Whats this? The show actually used to be a trashy romance light novel that didnt even sell well? Just goes to show how easy anime audiences are to please nowadays. The only other reasons this show is still popular is because of its much stronger start fantastic animation and the sore lack of other good animes this season.Im not kidding about the stronger start either I wouldnt be on this sub if I didnt like the show. Everything up to episode  was enjoyable which is why Im so frustrated at it now. Where did the mystery go? The last arc has been so drawn out that Ive stopped caring about any of the mystery or suspense at all and this is after they cut out a lot of unnecessary crap from the LN.,Re_Zero,d6bufuy,1,t5_3e076

I did that once to my GF saying things pretty similar plus i was very Narcissistic  years ago just like Barusu. And i really felt horrible later. A good thing i like about Subaru as a character that even being a character to self insert he its not the character were just  type of person can feel empathy with it. All of his traits and flaws appeals to a wide range of people and i think thats his main point when you love him you cant leave him. And thats a dirty move from the director and author of this story it makes you care at a personal level and it works. And im fucking tired of reading critics sayin that nobody can empathize or like Subaru god fucking damn it these people dont even know who powerful are these type of experiences that when you see someone similar theres like an instant connection.

8718999,0,t1_d6vc74a,Well going by the assumption that the witch loves kirito I guess every girl ever becomes part of his harem then the story wouldnt be that different from what it is now except that in arc  his cool demeanor would make him seem suspicious since the beginning and arc  wouldnt be as brutal because he isnt a stubborn hothead maybe he could become a knight due to training with Reinhard.But going by the true personalities of the characters it is easy to say that Kirito isnt the kind of guy who would appeal to Satella there is something unique about Subaru that caught her attention and made her fall for him. Actually there is an odd part in arc  where Emilia mentions that she doesnt know what love is and that kinda interwines with Satella saying that Subaru taught her about love...I mean Emilia isnt Satella but it is a bit oddwn,Re_Zero,d6vijm2,1,t5_3e076

Was there ever a contest over ownership?A LOT of great info gleaned from the events for Subaru.

If Ram really cant convince Roswaal or Roswaal cant justify himself to do it I dont know what to say anymore. Like bruh Subaru cant bang Rem because of the situation. But in this case both Roswaal and Ram want to do it but they still dont fucking do it. Seriously? To be fair I dont know much about the relationship between Ram and Roswaal but from what I know he does care about Ram even though it is unknown that he loves her romantically or not. Either way it should be more than enough for both Ram and Roswaal to do it because it is their wishes anyway. I did read the second manga but I didnt like it that much because the Rem in that manga looked and behaved so differently from her in the anime. Also one more thing I disliked is that Subaru was portrayed as a total pervert and his characters were different from those in anime as well. But the art is lovely and story is great though so I still enjoy reading it.,Re_Zero,d7w3lbc,1,t5_3e076
9023380,0,t3_53utal,Thanks a lot for sharing ltThis should be the scene where the nd season starts. Although with all the skipped stuff about ploygamy and the confession of Flugel tree this proposal will seem very sudden and out of the blue for anime only viewers beacuse I cant really imagine how they would handle it the best way.I think Rem and Crush conversation and the battle against the bishops should be shown in a flashback after the who is Rem.,Re_Zero,d7wgw9w,8,t5_3e076

9065196,0,t3_54fv9c,Alright to give you a rundown First off he thanked the whole team that worked behind the animation. He said that the praise is deserved since its not the author who animates voices sings and does the composition He gives some insight into the production such as that the prep time for the anime season started about  years before its release which was around the time the LN started to be released  So as the LN was released the talks for an anime adaptation were already made  He said that the production became so busy at times that he had to visit Tokyo two times a week to help out at screencomposition and dubbing meetingsNow about the WN LN and his plans He apologizes that he didnt update the WN at least once while the anime has aired but he really didnt have the time for it. If he had also updated the WN hed have basically no life anymore He also says that he hasnt written any content in advance so the latest chapter of the WN is the latest content he himself has written. He didnt have the time to write new content because he doesnt think writing new stuff while being under such a pressure would in result in anything but bad or uninspired stuff Tappei also says that while he think arc  is really interesting he made it far too long.  My guess is since Tappei has the tendency to show off everything he has right off the bat like some proud kid he plans to be a bit more spacious with what he reveals. I also think many things couldve been brought across in less words so he will probably be a more efficient with how he brings certain things across  For almost a year he has worked about  hours a day on ReZero and at this point it has become a part of his life He promises to try to end the series in another  years At the moment he is working on Volume  and two book as a bonus for the BDDVD purchase  A NovemberDecember release seems likely ,Re_Zero,d81hnmg,78,t5_3e076

9594013,0,t1_d9vh3mu,Well the anime skipped many more things originally in the LN important to the plot. Doesnt mean those things arent gonna happen.Maybe the anime will show those things in a second season in some kinda flashback in Subarus head?Tappei has already said hes decided whats gonna be the story so what the anime did doesnt really matter.And okay look Rem and Ram are really close yes of course considering theyre siblings and have always been together. But IMHO cant be split apart is taking things too far. She still can be with Subaru and Ram. Why does she have to abandon Ram for that?And then you really still think teamrem did it?A. Tappei released whatif albeit noncanon but Tappei himself did it.B. Subaru sees Rem in Carmilla who shows people who they want to see the most.

It did not give them a single thing to complain about. Mostly.Subaru Pretty cool day huh?Rem Yes Subarukun. The day is fantastic.Subaru I didnt mean that but yes. It is a fantastic day. Although I didnt bring as much as I should of though. My neck is getting a bit cold.Rem Rem had a feeling Subarukun would come unprepared. Here.Rem pulls a scarf from her jacket and wraps it once around Subarus neck. She pulls him closer to her so she can adjust it so that it is comfortable.Subaru Woah. Easy with the pulling there Rem.Rem Stop complaining Subarukun. Youll catch a cold if you dont come prepared for cold weather. And Rem is being careful she brought this scarf just in case didnt she?Subaru blushes a little while looking away from Rem in slight embarrassment. Rem sees this and just happily smiles.Rem Hey Subarukun.Subaru Hmm? What is it Rem?Rem Can we have more days like this in the future?Subaru !..... Of course Rem. We can have as many as youd like. Rem Thats not what I want.Subaru Hmm? What do you mean then?Rem I dont want to have as many as I want. I want to have as many as we want. Were together arent we?Subaru stares at Rem while he processes what she just said. He cant believe that he has Rem in his life. Always looking out for him from big things to the smallest of things. The source of his happiness.Subaru Youre right. Lets have as many of these days as we want. Okay?With a huge smile on her face Rem nods in agreement.Rem Yes Subarukun!,Re_Zero,d9xyilw,16,t5_3e076

The LN adjusts to how the anime ended and the big reveal for the anime only wont happen until it happens in the LN  even though if happened already before and after the whale fight. So ep  of season  wont show it probably since the LN didnt show it. From what Ive heard the LN makes this whole matter look really dumb and Subaru looks like an complete idiot and coward about his feelings for Rem. Im just waiting for the next LN vol which should include the CarmillaFake Rem scene and yeah lets see if  this will be the big reveal or if theyll fuck it up as well. ,Re_Zero,dcqcx2k,2,t5_3e076

Beako wanting to die was really sad  I understand though being locked up in isolation for  years... poor girl. Subaru went through some pretty gruesome deaths TT. And then of course... Emilias body being used by the Witch of Envy... Emilia completely breaking mentally Roswaal is a piece of shit  and then seeing her witness Subarus deaths in the nd trial all got a bit too much had to take a short break of a couple of days before continuing xgtPlayedLeague of Legends and Zelda... The Wii U version was ok but good lord those FPS issues really took me out of the game a lot... so I went out and bought a Switch . Its better but there still are issues when playing docked  pretty disappointing. Besides the technical issues the game is a masterpiece and currently in my top  of best Zelda games but those problems shouldnt have been present after such a long development cycle Watched... nothing except for SteinsGate e. Have to catch up with Konosuba   episodes but Ive been too busy playing Zelda and reading ReZero to care about other stuff...gtFavorite heroine outside of ReZeroThats a really tough question tbh...

People need to stop comparing the two and just accept theyre two different things both with their pros and cons.

11634554,0,t3_660nq5,Both Bouya no Yume yo and Stay Alive are very special to me... but out of the two I listen to Bouya no Yume yo the most by far so I put that for . Its also the only Japanese lyrics I know by heart. While I really love Stay Alive I avoid listening to it too much for multiple reasons...The rest was actually quite hard to rank... I really like MYTH amp ROIDs music in general so all of them are pretty high up there but REDO is also amazing.... Bouya no Yume yo link is full version with JAPENG subs . Stay Alive. Styx Helix. Theater D. REDO. ParadisusParadoxum . Wishing why didnt they release the slower piano version used in the OST?!. Straight BetI swapped Styx Helix Theater D and REDO around multiple times before keeping it like this... pretty hard to choose one of them as  because I like all of them pretty much equally.,Re_Zero,dgesfgy,3,t5_3e076

11736824,0,t3_673hd7,This might be the weakest episode so far it felt kinda unengaging. The framing and directing felt weird a lot of times. This was more obvious in the beat upkidnapping scenes. I dont know if its because I dont like Faris or if its because while the episode had an interesting core idea of Which one should we sacrifice? it rushed it and it ended up feeling lackluster and not particularly a big dilemma. If you think about it Faris had every right to just refuse to let her father die who can decide which life is worth more? You could say that Fariss father was originally going to die and therefore letting him die is letting the world continue normally but the same exact thing goes for Mayuri as well. It is Mayuris fate to die and changing it is the same as changing the fate of Fariss father. Faris is selfless and so decided to pick letting her father die in place of Mayuri  although its hard to think of refusing Rintarou given that Rintarou is the one who allowed her to use the time machine from the start so refusing him is errr being ungrateful to say the least. That super rushed romance crush thing was unneeded is this episode from Faris route or somethin. And Faris had a weaker unexplained form of Reading Steiner seeing that the Reading Steiner ability is yet to be explained I assume it will be explained later. Next episode preview is with the trap huh heres hoping it will be better than this episode. ,Re_Zero,dgqed71,1,t5_3e076
11791302,0,t1_dguwrz4,gt No one said that? They are mentally ill you are saying that they have bad personalities and thats why they are killing which is factually wrongNo it isnt. You dont need to be mental ill to kill someone and youre very naive if you think that. Its their choice to do what they do and quirks in their personalities factor little into it. All the Archbishops have warped ideologies but few of them are legitimately crazy. None of them would be nearly as bad if they didnt get powers that allow them to act in any way they wanted. If you cant bother see the naunces in that and you just gonna instead pump out blanket statements in effect disregard what is the text to substitute own then there is little point in further discussion.  Tappei called them scum for a reason and that was to set the record their actions are not solely justified by how much or little their are disturbed. Nobody is calling them healthy but their hardly insane people with little to no selfawareness of the actions. We have already seen what a completely mad Archbishop looks like and that is Petes. The only one remotely close to that level is Ley.gtSaying that Regulus and Capella would only be annoying when they dont have powers is completely wrong unless the witch gene magnified their bad traits and made them more compulsive.Then please tell what either of those can do same scale without their powers because  all I see is a jerk who would have been thrown in jail a long time ago and narcissist twit who probably would have been punched beaten up violently for her actions. Fear from going through a lone would change her. gtAlso the witches and the archbishops are very different the witches seem to have manifested the sins in themselves whilst the archbishops are taking them in.Not really. None of Witches are right the head either this even said be Subaru himself and you can barely hold a conversation with most of them just like the Archbishops. Your is pure speculation. We have no idea what the origins of the Witch Genes are nor Tappei hinted at it.,Re_Zero,dgwl0z1,1,t5_3e076
