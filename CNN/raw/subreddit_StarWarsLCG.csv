159215,0,t1_cevsam9,There were approximately  people at the SWLCG World Championship many of which were quite dedicated and excellent players. Based on your other Reddit activity it appears that your primary interest is in posting funny dark or edgy replies to the posts of others. I understand that that can be fun and entertaining. So this post is not so much a reply to you as a notice to others who might read this thread that Dennis did indeed play several very long days of SWLCG against an extremely competitive group of about  players from all areas of the USA and some from other countries as well. Congratulations to Dennis and thanks to The Living Force for doing the interview! I look forward to seeing Dennis champion card!,StarWarsLCG,cewkg0i,5,t5_2vjoo
167749,0,t1_cexj6qa,Netrunner is overwhelming filling almost every table on LCG night...though that may be just because theres a Netrunner league on. About a month ago or so it was the GoT league and THAT was filling almost every table. Despite the current Netrunner domination there are two or three tables for other games like HeroClix or whatever. Last time I was there there were two guys playing Game of Thrones on one of the tables despite the Netrunner everywhere.Im told this is the general LCG scene everywhere Netrunner and Game of Thrones dominate with Netrunner having a small edge but a LOT of people who play both and Star Wars in a distant third. Warhammer Invasion has stopped doing new releases so its obvious that theyve basically sputtered out and died. Call of Cthulhu has stopped doing packs and is only doing deluxe expansions its probably on its way down too. Lord of the Rings is a special case being a cooperative game rather than a competitive game its not that it doesnt see much play so much as it doesnt see much play outside of small groups of friends playing in their homes. The coop aspect makes tournament or league play a nonstarter and organized play options past that are extremely scarce. Its reasonably popular but its not an LGS kind of game.,StarWarsLCG,cexjg58,1,t5_2vjoo
170802,0,t1_cex9edx,I should have qualified my other response. Anyone can play at an FFG Worlds Event. But it does require registering for the event ahead of time and paying a fee which I believe has been  in the past I cant remember what I payed but it wasnt very much. The fee for the Worlds Weekend is a flat fee and then you can compete in any of the competitions that you want. Many people play multiple games and so compete in at least a few big events. So you dont pay per tournament you pay one fee to attend the entire weekend event and then play in as many tournaments as you want. ,StarWarsLCG,cexvy0m,3,t5_2vjoo
1583708,0,t1_cjesix3,Not at all.Nothing in there that would make me play this especially as a Navy only restriction.EDIT The Escort carrier is OK but at HP its way too vulnerable to everything. Unless every card here has  or more force pips this will never see play.,StarWarsLCG,cjesrv5,0,t5_2vjoo
2220569,0,t3_2i0eb5,Im not a competitive player as to me the travel time to the closest place that runs Star Wars tournaments is not worth it. I got into this game having no one else to play it with other than anyone I knew that was willing to learn. I have one buddy who is interested in it and another who has  Core  EoD. I order my cards online as the closest gaming store is  minutes away and barely stocks the game. Also its cheaper.,StarWarsLCG,clm35rc,1,t5_2vjoo

3491304,0,t3_305tn2,I am going and Im down to bring some decks. I am sure that there will be down time between stuff so might be a smart play! ,StarWarsLCG,cpq8f7f,1,t5_2vjoo
3849876,0,t1_cqtzqcp,This is correct. Though honestly part of the reason Between the Shadows released is that the scum pods introduced in Edge of Darkness just werent good enough. If what uWSable cares about is making strong competitive decks between the shadows is probably a better place to start.,StarWarsLCG,cqv4d05,2,t5_2vjoo
4015282,0,t1_crdtd10,okay and a second Edge of Darkness?I got an offer for a Core set for  incuding shipping. should i go for it? i know you will tell me GO FOR IT  but i dont know if i prefer diversity through force packs and deluxe expansions rather than having the same cards of EoD and Corei really like Scum ... i have to admit,StarWarsLCG,crdz0p7,1,t5_2vjoo
4491657,0,t1_cswni6l,They didnt realize that the ability to capture enemy units without enhancements for  cost as many times as you want was not a big deal?,StarWarsLCG,cswu13z,3,t5_2vjoo
4957921,0,t3_3irs9b,It would certainly be good to get more discussions and posts in this subreddit. However I think with just so few subscribers that weekly would suffice. ,StarWarsLCG,cujhib3,1,t5_2vjoo
7040326,0,t3_4byj27,OCTGN has resources for card images. Also FlipTheForce.com has a great library of card images,StarWarsLCG,d1edlxh,1,t5_2vjoo
7791913,0,t1_d3rs6zp,I cant tell how serious youre being but the sets enhancements have a few points in their favor. Both are cheap so if you lose one you havent lost much. If Rogue  is out you also get to draw a card. And since the set wants to be run with fighters youll likely have the chance of drawing a Rebel Assault or Rapid Fire to deal with Tarkin.,StarWarsLCG,d3rv9ym,2,t5_2vjoo
8368113,0,t1_d5ndw8i,I think you suggested it I know I never had an event. Id always wanted to have one but never got around to it or had enough cards that were both ready and playtested. Esseles! Thats a great idea! Just let me go back and play through it again... I barely remember anything out of that flashpoint Edit Just finished it! Now its time to start designing!One thematic thing that amuses me to no end is that Meteor and Jace Malcom both leaders of Havoc Squad really dont get along together... Malcom makes the best of the difficult to plan situations but Meteors already dealt with the logistics and Malcoms just sitting there kind of sad feeling like hes missing something  ,StarWarsLCG,d5nkc93,1,t5_2vjoo
