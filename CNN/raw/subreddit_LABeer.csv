6287759,0,t3_41q2ex,Great beer I just dont really think its worth the amount of hype it gets. I live by one of the Lucky Baldwins in Pasadena and have been able to get pours of it the last two years theyve hosted. Worth the wait if you look at it as having a late breakfast with the option of a handful of other RR beers on tap. If they have Supplication again this year Ill be there for sure. ,LABeer,cz4cih8,3,t5_2vr14

7897352,0,t3_4nexub,Heres Bravery Brewings original post on the matter I think it this explains this situation wellAttention all lovers of Craft Beer Liberty and Logical deductionThe Lancaster City Council is moving to pass Ordinance No.  which will completely prohibit the sale of single serve alcohol cansbottles within the city limits with the following exemptions sqft retailers e.g. grocery stores big box storesType  breweries e.g. Kinetic Brewing Bravery BrewingType  wine growers packs and  packs of bottlescansThis is a completely misguided attempt to combat the supposed issues of vagrancy loitering public drinking and public urination that plagues our city.Your local liquor stores many of which have elevated their Craft Beer selections over the years will no longer be able to sell you single bottles of your favorite beers. Single serve container sales are such a high percentage of these liquor stores gross sales without them they will no longer have viable business models and will be forced to lay off employees if not close their stores entirely.Lancaster is a supposed Business Friendly city but this ordinance will lead to devastating effects on  liquor stores that have contributed jobs taxes and placed money back into the community through the various vendors they use AC repair exterminators plumbers etc.Saying that mom and pop liquor stores can not sale retail items that big box stores can continue to sale is insane and its a gigantic slap in the face to small private business. Also restricting the sale of alcohol does not make the homeless and impoverished go away. This ordinance addresses a symptom not the cause and will hurt far more innocent parties instead.There is a public hearing on Tuesday June th at pm at Lancaster City Hall. I urge everyone that is able to attend to come and voice your opinion. Members of the public are each granted  minutes to address the City Council. Let our voices be heard over the nonsensical rants of Neoprohibitionists that want nothing more than to see the AV become a dry community.Do not let the City Council destroy the Craft Beer community in our city. Do not let the City Council destroy the businesses of many hard working honest tax payers. Voice your opinion. Please share this post and join me on June th  pm at Lancaster City Hall!,LABeer,d43qi3p,6,t5_2vr14
