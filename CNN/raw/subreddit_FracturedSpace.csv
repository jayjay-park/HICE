3726362,0,t1_cqgwccf,True true. Ships sneaking through asteroids truly have been my bane so far.Yet compared to all the other vessels Ive flown so far well only the Hunter and Flagship really getting kills appears to be extremely easy. Heck I can even hold an entire sector on my own if I only encounter  or  ships which are no direct counter.Feels a bit... well cheap maybe? But what can I say still enjoying it so far.

3759850,0,t1_cqku06u, I know. Thats not what Im saying. For example if I see they have flagships and I want to be a sniper I dont change to sniper until the last moment because if I do some might switch away from flagship to something that counters me. Tournaments of games like DOTA allow teams to pick their ship one at a time so they can see what the other team has in a fair way. I know that a lot do. Almost all do. The point is that they shouldnt  it hurts the game. See any of the many counterstrike threads on the topic. For strategic games where KD isnt the point e.g. not for COD showing the KD is detrimental. Oh I know now. I wrote them all down on a sheet that I keep next to me. Should a nb have to do that? In match theres no way to check. Thats just bad design. This isnt a problem that I want help with.

Where do I think the cloaker is now?Keep in mind ships that can stealth want you to never see them even when they are visible. Their best ally is you paying attention to your current target. As you grow and improve your skills you hopefully will quickly learn how to deal with situations where an extra person shows up out of nowhere.

10256737,0,t1_dc6jlpv,Yes in a real PvP environment you want the range. This is especially true with the new shield that has been an effective nerf due to its heavy energy demands and the loss of the boosted jump speed.The Protector is in a bad place right now and its generally considered inferior to the Paladin.,FracturedSpace,dc6noav,2,t5_33y1y
10681458,0,t3_5squko,i think the best solution is to fix the damn MM. myself and  other friends have essentially quit FS because the only game we played the last few days was waitandpraythatmatchmakerworks. well it didnt so  drops later we all gave up.,FracturedSpace,ddhpmka,2,t5_33y1y

10890932,0,t3_5vmtmm,Pretty sure they are currently locked out and being reworked or something to that nature.  Its not just you...,FracturedSpace,de3bm5b,1,t5_33y1y
11003267,0,t3_5x4l7l,Its a vs space shooter thats quite slow. Its inspired by MOBAs but only slightly. Goal is to destroy the enemy corebase you get levels for kills people have tankhealerdpsspecialists roles. Thats where the similarities end imho.Loadouts are  sidegrades. Customization beside those sidegrades is rather before the match its a carbon copy of dotas rune system. During the match you can choose damagehputility on level   you take with most ships damage because the others give so little benefits.Game is quite steady in playerbase. Devs wait for a marketing push until some problems are fixed.You could buy the Arsenal pack which are all ships  the most recent . I would see it as buying a boxed game. But wait till you played a dozen games till you make that choice. If you bought all ships with cash you can channel all credits into implants and crew The LoL runes in FS.Ship types are somewhat like classes. Good teams have  tanks  healer  dps. All ships are very unique and somewhat comparable to heroeschampions. The differences between Colossus and Destroyer are as large as Shen vs Vladimir in LoL. Game is definitely not dying. Today a huge update was released. I guess FS could become a very big thing and it will probably blow out Dreadnaught out of the water.,FracturedSpace,def6sx0,5,t5_33y1y
11023021,0,t3_5x65q7,I didnt even get my login reward yesterday. I have also thought some gold drops vanished. The ones from level ups pop up and when you hit OK they seem to all go to inventory but I think that some daily pods have bugged out on me.,FracturedSpace,dehfgw3,1,t5_33y1y

11193886,0,t1_df0ly09,i understand what you are saying. it sucks getting outmaneuvered. but that is why we have other teammates to have our backs. going out in a ship with limited firing arcs solo is a bad idea anyways. but for me personally if i am soloing an area in something like a glad i will do it defensively and stick around my bubble for the heal and use the glads resistance ability to buff my toughness. and while you do loose half your guns you can use the station shield as a bumper of sorts to keep the brawler from being able to reel you in.,FracturedSpace,df0tawr,1,t5_33y1y

11560400,0,t1_dg6d7ay,i can understand that. i would think even with that a ghost user could eek out k damage before being killed. provided they arent sitting still letting the enemy endeavors turrets go to town.,FracturedSpace,dg6djda,2,t5_33y1y
11590714,0,t3_65egi3,As far as missiles go the Raider missiles strike a very good balance between hitting reliably and hitting hard when they do. Considering its an important source of secondary damage for Raider theyre not at all weak.,FracturedSpace,dg9td9r,1,t5_33y1y
11687636,0,t3_66olen,Better yet Keep Ramming Damage since thats a real thing! and simply increase projectile speed again. When they increased ship speed then reduced the lane sizes ships with slow projectiles Destroyer Im looking at you! certain ships lost their viability. Increasing everyones projectile velocity would restore viability to ships. Or better yet restore ship speeds to where they used to be. Big lumbering capital ships should be exactly that... Lumbering slow graceful. Not roaring around the sectors like TIE fighters.,FracturedSpace,dgkt7p4,3,t5_33y1y
