2970051,0,t3_2u6kxm,Now that the inlet and outlets have replaced exchangers for interacting with hull temperature Im not sure theres any way to maintain a higher temperature outside of constant manual adjustments.  Itd be nice to see a way to make the system stable at some temperature other than  so that the newish upgrades can have an effect.,reactorincremental,co5pjye,2,t5_365ap
2973437,0,t1_co62n8o,Yeah sorry I realized that and edited my answer,reactorincremental,co63fu4,2,t5_365ap
2992762,0,t3_2ug9si,So... some kind of crafting system? I guess that could be good... Keeping in line with the whole nuclear thing breeder reactors and all that it would be interesting if highertiered fuels all had to be crafted somehow... Lots of interesting possibilities but another balancing nightmare for the dev unless theres a usercreated mod system,reactorincremental,co874oe,1,t5_365ap
3036667,0,t1_cocok38,The power gains from the x heat end up working out pretty close.  On build  I was around Ttick after playing the entire time the game has been in development using  double nefs.  On build  Im at .Ttick using single nefs after only  hours you can see my design thread for info.  The main thing that it changes is that you can make a ton of power off of cheaper and lower heat cells.,reactorincremental,cocr05v,1,t5_365ap
3062024,0,t3_2v7z42,Had to adapt it to accommodate my lower level skills but it works really nicely  Heres mine I have the double power and Heat upgrade too hence the extra outlets,reactorincremental,cofdjgx,1,t5_365ap
3065761,0,t3_2v9p5t,gt Ive also .. fixed an issue with vents being greedy.What do you mean with that?,reactorincremental,cofrh9b,1,t5_365ap
3070706,0,t3_2vc1qx,A new prestige upgrade which offers some starting cash based on its level sounds great.,reactorincremental,cog9xha,3,t5_365ap
3077200,0,t3_2vepmi,Not bad man! You gain exotic particles over time. I believe it happens when you hit a new milestone in power or heat produced. These milestones are T TTetc.To prestige go to options. One of the buttons is Prestige for X Exotic Particles and clicking it twice will reset your game and give you the particles.,reactorincremental,cogy6rh,1,t5_365ap
3077248,0,t1_cogyb60,this is a setup from another redditor Im rather fond of usingreplace the cells with any type youre capable of handling with  vents maybe replace the reflectors with more vents if neededAnd dont forget one plating or else a rather nasty bug will hit you p,reactorincremental,cogyd67,1,t5_365ap
3108198,0,t1_cojm5cj,Did you buy your exotic upgrades while the game was bugged for a  hour window yesterday?  I dont see any way that k particles could buy you level  of Infused Fuel Cells.  Even level  for me is k particles.,reactorincremental,cok5w8k,1,t5_365ap
3217569,0,t1_covheia,Intentionally or not the Capacitors Heat up based on the potentional Power the could Sell so for most people around  so they will go boom after  Ticks even without any Cells being around.My ExtremeC produce Qa HeatTick so its nearly Impossible to take them to good useBUT if you really want to mess around with them and try new Stuff cut down on Improved Wiring the Upgrade that x the Cap HeatPower Values so you have Caps that will exceed an handable amount of Heat.I really hope to see some valuable Builds with them but as of now I cant really see them to put an End to the All CapSyndrome we still need lots of Caps to Overcharge the Vents to be able to reduce the Heat the New Caps produce.,reactorincremental,covi3wr,2,t5_365ap
3252173,0,t3_2wzm5p,I hate to say it but I think thats the point of games like these.  Ive just finished unlocking everything in AdVenture Capitalist and that took me several months.  Im guessing the dev is looking for that longterm playability.,reactorincremental,coz3ivk,1,t5_365ap
3255879,0,t3_2xebr9,What you dont trust executables uploaded by a random person on the internet? What is the world coming to?!Seriously though I get where youre coming from. Heres the source.

3284170,0,t1_cp2kzlb,Actually the Way it works you will most likely never have higher Heat than Power in Overall cause the Script count the full produced and not only the Sold Power so no matter your Limit you get Full Value for the Statistic where Heat is clearly limited by your Upgrades and Stuff.So basics is still better for the Sake of getting more Heat out.Cant say if its wanted that the Heat of the XCaps gets parked in the Reactorcore like that but as long as youll need to put up so much Platings in addition to the Inlets because of the parking I cant see how you can Produce more Heat with them as you do with just an plain FullUltimate Build.Ultimate .Qaout of .Qi Generated Autosell  .Qa HeatXCap .Qa AutosellGenerated  .Qa Heat ,reactorincremental,cp2meky,2,t5_365ap

3473043,0,t1_cpo0zpe,Yeap im nearly fully idle because im only reset fuel cells and nothing more. And even with this i replenish them not so fast   times in a day morning early evening and before im going to a sleep.Upgrades  maximum of fluid hyperdinamics FH then maximum of QB a little of UFC right now its only  for  of FH and even with this i must to use outlets not just  vents and  cell then cheaper upgrades last  IFC to get more power and get to experimental cells faster. And thats all. Im in  min go to nefastium gaining from monarchium of protium enough money and place my first rainbow cell after that i just go and build that scheme But i have much more EP as i can see M EP and i can get enough power and money to afford a rainbow cell for you it can be harder. But in vast late game before reset full night of rainbow grinding of EP is cool enough.,reactorincremental,cpo5hnx,1,t5_365ap
