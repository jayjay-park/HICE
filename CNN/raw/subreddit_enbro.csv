7876370,0,t1_d41ddne,Thanks for the reply! My interpretation is that hes very clearly surprised at your presence and lack of jailer appearance. Youre no jailer and the emphasis he puts on the no lead me to think that hes keenly aware of the Jailer enemypurpose and quite taken aback to see anyone but one of them show up. Who knows whatll unfold in the dlc though!,enbro,d41dkeo,2,t5_3ey80

7915008,0,t3_4now98,I loved and adore dthe original PS I still have that copy...   sadly I cant afford the game till next month at the earliest... I have though played the Demo and God Damn... All the characters feel very different to me but in universally good ways. I oddly think that Gwyndolyn has improved the least From what little Ive been able to see of her from the Demo  maybe its just the skills her demo build has not jiving with my play style...? Cornelius was always fun now hes AMAZINGLY fun. I love his Guard BreakDownSquare charged.  Hes even MORE mobile  and he still has a down stab thing thats a bit different from the old version mor elike Shovel Knights actually... and a really good player with the new cornelius could do some amazing play...Mercedes feels like shes changed the most getting some neat projectile attacks and some aerial moves. Her bolts no longer slide along the ground when fired down while flying but IMO this is a good change that makes her more challenging to play. That said  I definitely like that her pow meter recharges when she lands and you dont have to manually do the reload thing with her anymore. Oswald was my least favorite character in the original  I hated his  relatively bad mobility and his general style of play... Hes been completely revamped with dark attack skills and a Berserker mode that builds up over time and can then be used lasting much longer than it used to...  He also has one of the coolest forward dash attacks and I love his guard break too on a coolness level. Velvet was always my favorite and she continues to be awesome IMO. I cant wait to see other skillsabilities for her because I have high hopes based on what Ive seen for other characters.  I love her  new charged guard break but similar to Gwyndolyn I feel like half the skills they gave her in the demo dont suit my play style for her that said the other half IE the chain slam and the  PS versions chain launch Squarehold attack are right up my alley... Really looking forward to getting the full game when I can...,enbro,d45q07j,2,t5_3ey80

7950731,0,t1_d49i22x,Good work on the episode Marcus. The Londor questline is my absolute favorite in this game. There are so many ways it can play out youll probably have to commit a few playthroughs to see them all. Not to mention the lore aspect of it.Also for raw damage on a dagger the Corvian Greatknife is well great. If youre going for plat anyway might as well farm it on a dagger run.,enbro,d49qk9y,6,t5_3ey80

7972640,0,t1_d4c6ahf,That would make sense in the plot of the game in which the lords of cinder are refusing to take their thrones. Although its quite confusing why the Abyss Watchers would want to bring forth the age of the dark.

7974670,0,t3_4ogj59,That is an interesting perspective considering he is found at Archedragon Peak or someone that admires him.However in ds there is a lot of lore showing that Havel didnt like dragons at all especially Seath. Now if it was just Seath that he hated it may be possible he hates him because he betrayed the dragon if he was aligned with the first born.However I dont think thats the case because in ds Havel or an admirer of sorts appears to have just slain a dragon when the unkindled faces him. Looking at that I think it could be likely Havel was close the Gwyyns first born before he left to go join the dragons assuming he is in fact the nameless king and after he left that could have led to Havels hatred of dragons.,enbro,d4cffv4,1,t5_3ey80

7979560,0,t1_d4cxsnf,I like this idea too! When I first wrote this I had forgotten the torches near the door light up. If I were to force it into my theory I would say that going through Farron and putting out the flames is a way to literally pass the torch from the former gods to the Undead Legion. The responsibility of the Abyss is now their responsibility and if you have proven yourself capable of finding and snuffing the flames you are capable of joining them to contain the Abyss.Also your English is really good!,enbro,d4cz790,1,t5_3ey80

8138697,0,t3_4qmkr5,Honestly after playing DS through a couple of times I went back to play Bloodborne and I gotta say weapon arts pale in comparison to transformation in fact the difference is staggering.Its weird because initially I hated how few weapons there was but every clever design idea From had was put into every one of those trick weapons and I still havent played with every one of them. Theres less variety yes but every weapon feels unique and special and I cant say the same about DS because they went for quantity over quality. I mean yeah theres a limited number of builds you can make in BB tbh there are a lot if you want to get into the nitty gritty but if youre gonna play PVP in DS theres like what? five viable builds? And magic is stil not viable.Dont get me wrong if you arent doing pvp then theres a lot of cool stuff you can do but the problem with that is how you cant immediately get the weapon you want like in DS.And as far the level of detail in the worlds goes DS just doesnt hold a candle to the level of detail and consistency in BB And Ive seen some ridiculously esoteric things people have found in the game even recently its actually fucking crazy Eileen is Mergo btw and theres actually a road that leads out of Yarhnam that you can spot in several locations through the games.idk I feel like if you asked Miyazaki which game is the best hes made or that From itself has made I think hed say BB because if you think about it DeS is like the formation of an idea DS is putting that idea to the test while also trying out different things with it same can be said for DS if you want to go down that road. BB is the maturation of that idea and a growth away from certain elements that didnt make the idea work like BB is the Loveless to Miyazakis Isnt Anything which is DS. And DS is great but it feels like m b v I hope at least one person understands this insanely dumb comparison and because of that its always going to be compared to Loveless er I mean Bloodborne in terms of combat mechanics at least.God I just fucking love BB and DS almost hits the mark in several places but it just doesnt scratch the itch.And lol when you were talking about mainstream game youve been playing I was sure you were going to talk about Overwatch thank gods sad to see that Bait is gonna go but Platinum shit is not worth it dude. Just like the Chalice dungeons arent worth it...,enbro,d4uvs7r,2,t5_3ey80

8360906,0,t3_4u07cp,I agree she is the most like the player character out of any from soft game and that provides the best sort of fighting because you both are capable of similar things. The large boss fights by comparison are either overly difficult due to the camera controlstheir strength of attacks while a fight like Maria is so memorable since you both are on even footing. The ramp up of the phases is also super cool and well done teaching you as you fight as to how to beat her. I personally love the feeling of parrying her to death it shows you know her timings and have the reactions for them.,enbro,d5mnyj2,2,t5_3ey80
