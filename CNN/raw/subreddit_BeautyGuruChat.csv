2912914,0,t3_2tgijo,I make videos so I have a loooot that I dont enjoy... . A lack of music in the background.  This may just be me but I now can rarely watch a video if theres no music softly in the background ESPECIALLY if I can hear the tssssssssSSSSSS of their microphone that they havent removed.. Overly using certain words obsessed buttery pigmentation goodies adore super I looooove etc etc.. Doing the same makeup look in every video just with different colours or a different lip colour or something then trying to pass it off as something new or different. Alternatively falling into a rut and only releasing videos with a very similar looksimilar colours.. Only using highend makeup amp seeming like youre bragging about it Theres a girl I know who does this and it annoys me so much.  Who are you bragging to? People on the internet dont care that you have MAC etc.. Pulling faces while doing lip swatches.  Im here to see how they look on your lips you poking your tongue out at the camera really isnt helping.  OR when the lip swatch only lasts for about  seconds.  I cant even see the colour enough in that time.. Lack of info in the description.  I include a general rundown of the video the products I mentioned w prices the music I used the makeupnail polishtop Im wearing my contact info Facebook Instagram email etc. and a short disclaimer.  I hate when people dont list the products mentioned amp their prices.  Especially in hauls.  Uglkhjdlfdgdlkfjl.. Terrible lightingaudio.  amp I mean this in the opposite of someone who doesnt have any lightingmicrophone I currently use natural lighting amp the cameras microphone because that stuff is expensssssive. but theres one person I watch amp I seem to be the only one who feels like her microphone kind of sounds like shes under water.  I also really dont like super bright lighting that washes out everything so you cant see true colours etc etc.. The fact that everyone does the same thing.  Like if you type in Kylie Jenner Tutorial theres probably about  tutorials if not more I didnt type it in but I wouldnt be surprised. I understand it was a trend but her makeup isnt even difficult and we dont need EVERY beauty YouTuber doing it.  I looove YouTubers who do something different.. In regards to blog posts I love pictures.  Theres been so many blogs Ive stopped reading because theyd only have  picture up the top of all the products theyre going to talk about then just a massive wall of text.  I cant even tell which products are which in the picture generally so I love  giant picture then a single picture before each product or maybe even a collage.. Also in regards to blogs I dont like a lot of typefacessizes most people use.  I already have my screen zoomed in dodgy eyesight wooh! so if I have to zoom it in EVEN MORE to read your blog Im just going to leave.  . I was only going to do  but I remembered something Bad grammarpunctuation and giant walls of text.  Holy gosh.  Please please please proofread your writing and add some gaps between your paragraphs.  I lose where Im reading amp become infuriated with all the mistakes obviously  or  is fine but if your main thing is writing I normally assume that youre good at it... Though that may just be the authoreditor in meNot gonna be surprised if I have a mistake or  in here that someone picks me up on haha!,BeautyGuruChat,cnz7fgc,15,t5_3606k

3253353,0,t3_2xdg08,I definitely think it is okay to have a large collection.  If it is their fulltime job then I have expectations of them to be qualified to do their job including skills such as product recommendations be able to discern qualities of good and bad products and to know the recent changes and updates in productscompanies.  As a researcher I collect published articles related to my field and am expected to have knowledge of changes and advancement in my field of work.  As such I would expect that a full time bloggerguru should be knowledgeable of new products and changes and this means having the products to usetest to then pass that information along.  They should be uptodate with new products and the old for comparisons base knowledge and skill.  If it is a hobby then they can collect whatever they want.  I scrapbook in my free time.  Having a collection of stamps paper tools and decorations makes my hobby fun and more enjoyable.  I can understand why makeup as a hobby can be presented as a large product collection.  Some people collect stamps and coins others collect lipsticks and blush.  There is nothing inherently wrong with collecting makeup as a hobby unless it becomes a real addiction in need of intervention then I hope they are able to receive the help necessary,BeautyGuruChat,coz7xs5,7,t5_3606k

I found her a while back and at first I love how chipper she was and her makeup  videos were pretty thorough. Then I started to notice certain comments that put me off. For just one example she talked about how her husband went out and surprised her with the Too Faced Chocolate Bar Palette and she didnt even touch it or swatch it or anything because she didnt like the packaging.

The Chocolate Bar was my first reasonably expensive palette and I loved it when I got it but I pretty much never touch it now and have returned or sold nearly every other Too Faced palette or single shadow Ive tried. Even from YouTubers who enjoy the palettes Fleur de Force loves the Bon Bon palette Im never particularly impressed with the color payoff especially compared to the amount of fallout. ,BeautyGuruChat,d032uit,3,t5_3606k
6699037,0,t1_czt41wf,I work in the consumer packaged goods industry and typically brands spend about  of their revenue on marketing. And marketing usually includes stuff like package design promosdiscounts advertising digital print tv consumer research sampling etc. So when you look at it like that the amount they spend on a trip like this is probably quite a small fraction of their revenue and theyre probably banking on a certain amount of sales lift from the wordofmouth and brand halo theyre getting from this stuff. TLDR The money they spend here is likely chump change to them and wouldnt make a difference in pricing if they chose not to spend it.,BeautyGuruChat,d0c8la7,1,t5_3606k

6770814,0,t3_48i0w8,I only have one Morphe brush and two liners. I went to their store when I was in LA I swatched the shadows and the singles were bad but the palettes looked okay. If you were new to makeup I think itd be a good starting point. Their brushes had a range of quality some felt very poorly made but others seemed to have been made better but for the price Id pay a bit more for a nicer brush. I personally only have one brush and its good for the price.I really love MUG both as a consumer and as a blogger. I loved them when I first tried them and as Ive worked with them they have also been great especially since I am a smaller blogger. Their eyeshadows are one of my favorite textures I also like their blushes and contour powders. I did find the packaging of the sparklers to be disappointing and personally wont be reviewing them until the packaging is resolved since they are SO messy.I like colourpop quite a bit. I bought some of the shadows which are fun cause they can be so metallic. I wasnt a huge fan of the highlighters. I really enjoy the liquid lipsticks since they are the texture I like very thin and dry very matte. I have a few of the matte lippie stix they are pretty nice but I dont reach for the often over other brands.LA Splash has some nice products and some misses. I love the pigment liner liquid lipstick and glitter base I have from them. I,BeautyGuruChat,d0jr46p,5,t5_3606k

And as you grow more and more popular you dont even need to spend money on products because they get sent to you and you even get paid to shill for them which means your investment is now  and you make  profit.

There is no right or wrong way to show support and no matter how she did it shed be exposed  positively as negatively. I bet you read the post on JS donating money as well the thing is there will always be someone who gets offended rather than try to see it from these peoples view. So I think you need to take another step back and ask Is she allowed to show her respect? because she is. In her own way on her own platform to her own fans. ,BeautyGuruChat,d47u20z,4,t5_3606k

I adore how she treats drugstore brands and higher end brands the same. Not to mention when she did the palette video recently she takes about  bug palettes rather than milking them for more videos. And Temptalia! I never ever buy anything without checking her review first. I read her blog every day. She tags how she acquired the product she tells you the price and breaks down the cost of palettes. Her swatches are great she always posts pics of the products actually on her face.

What you are saying is true that one need not be defined by their jobs. My thought is why demean a job to that level?Im sure nobody aspires to a minimum wage job but it is an opportunity nevertheless to get started back on your feet.To someone that has never needed that minimum help it might not seem like much but to someone who is destitute and has lost all hope some job ANY job is an opportunity.Perhaps my perspective on this matter is different amp more intense than one would deem necessary as I am from a developing nation and have seen people in the worst possible state imaginable. Homeless in India is not the same as being homeless in the US it is truly a deplorable state to be in. When you see  year old kids begging to clean your cars for pennies it changes your perspective for sure.I can see that my response might come off as too much Perhaps if I grew up in the US it may not have affected me as much?

8229403,0,t3_4s3hxo,Oh crazy timing. Anyway current drama aside and the drama is pretty much trainwrecky at this point Ive watched Cassie before. However I find her videos really uncomfortable. The issue with her videos for me is the fact she seems so comfortable not ever leaving her house. I find it a bit triggering for lack of a better word. Ive struggled with depression and agoraphobia before and her videos always reminds me of the unfortunate comfort of not leaving home. Im not diagnosing her by any means but I wish she left her house more or just took the montages of her not leaving her house out of her videos. It would make her videos feel less claustrophobic and uncomfortable for me. And that fact makes me trust her reviews less even though I think she does a nice job showing wear. Ultimately staying inside is not a good gauge of how makeup will wear you know outside. I know I sound crazy. I know I shouldnt even mention this but its been bothering me lately. Its made me stop watching her videos. Now I wont watch any more of her videos because of drama but I stopped a few weeks ago because I just felt weird about them. I do think shes pretty much having some sort of small breakdown. Well see how all the drama plays out. ,BeautyGuruChat,d568cul,47,t5_3606k

So unless he comes out and admits he made a mistake and he has offered payment and the details are being sorted there is no way he can come out of this in any good way. Of course though he wont do that or ever say a true apology to anyone. He doesnt have it in him to do. And after saying it was all lies and propaganda he really cant even admit he was wrong either.

She lists Morphe and at the time of the post she was known to work w them. She had her own palette from them at one point. The Becca products may have been sent her way and I think that was around the time her own product from Becca released. The Natasha Denona palette was known for being sent out to bigger Youtubers funny how no one talks about it now.Im sure a lot of the products she does like but Ill be skeptical because she is a decent businesswoman and wants good relation.

My proof the INSTAGRAM.Hes making himself laugh with the five pumps of foundation. Five! Thats insane. So hes chuckling at how bad it looks but upset that it doesnt look terrible to the camera. He puts crazy heavy makeup on her then fucks with the lighting to make her look flawless and inhuman. Basically saying no one looks like this in real life but people are falling all over themselves trying to recreate these looks.I honestly dont think hes intending to say pale women are better or more popular just that they can wear tons of makeup and mess with the lighting and create this look that everyone wants but its impossible to achieve.This all seems very innocent to me and done with good intentions.,BeautyGuruChat,d6knrre,37,t5_3606k

8763868,0,t3_5031ep,Jeffree Star is getting away with his crap for the same reason many powerful white men get away with crap hes a fixture in the industry now and a popular public figure. Refusing to ally with anything hes allied with or denouncing him publicly when you arent as powerful as him yourself may potentially have you frozen out in an industry that is all about relationships. And no one is willing to fall on their sword. Stephanie Nicole was able to publicly denounce him ON HER CHANNEL because Youtube is not her full time job but she does have to continue with Beautylish because THAT is related to her full time job. If your full time job is Youtube and you are the focus of Jeffree Star ire well good luck getting into any public event hes involved with or being in good graces with the large clique around him that dominates the Youtube scene right now that will and does circle the wagons around him. It sucks. I know if everyone has that attitude. I agree. Unfortunately it seems almost everyone DOES have that attitude. I dont know what the answer is. I just know that when someone has power and influence they seem to get a very big pass and other people often find they have to fall in. They will perform amazing feats of personal rationalizations in order to fall in line without admitting that they just dont want to deal with the limiting factors to their careers that may come with taking a stand. ,BeautyGuruChat,d7158b3,12,t5_3606k

That said for certain positions it may be an actual draw to the applicant. Really depends on the place the position what the content they see is who on the committee sees it and their opinions. Even if there is no drama or anything just the exposure can be a drawback for some committees. Like super active social media they can bring up especially Twitter can be the killer. It really isnt so much her peers looking her up and caring but the hiring committee that will determine if she would present what they want as a uni teacher. It will depend on the place but Im most familiar with the UC system and it can be an arduous application system for this reason.Yeah GG is a bit much. Like more than a bit just a horror show.

I try to pretend like I have all this selflove and I even act like I believe it sometimes on social media but in actuality the basis behind most of my photos isnt Look at me this is a photo of my life its Look at this girl she is what I wish I actually was. Its sad. Yeah its unhealthy but I justify it somehow in my head because its like my one claim to fame. I was a nobody my whole life up until  I got into a certain social circle and started being social media present and once I discovered the key to mastering social media somehow managed to get thousands of twitter followers and become Instagram known even though Im literally just a regular  year old college kid?! it became that one thing that made me feel like appreciated. My whole life Ive been a nobody watching popular people around me have a glamorous mystical air about them and it just feels good to know that I have some of that now because Im getting out there and being active on social media making connections in the community with people from many social circles. For someone who grew up with immense depression and loneliness its almost like a drug. But to tie this back to Nikkies editing because thats ultimately why Im even mentioning my own struggles I feel like some people can be so carefree in how they present themselves on social media because I will go on certain peoples instagrams and see a photo thats just not ideal to society and even I will think Damn did they just not care that they looked like a slob here? are they just really confident in themselves or really clueless about society? There are people who notice right away they are meticulous in pinpointing the little things in their own pictures that could possibly be badmouthed. I sometimes get anxiety that people are going to catch on to my editing and honestly I know some people Im close to might have. But they dont say anything. Im constantly insecure I cant win one way or the other and I think Nikkie probably feels very similar. If she doesnt edit she will lose a large demographic of people who are just unwilling to take makeup advice from someone who doesnt have the airbrushed finetouched look of a celebrity. She might even get called a slob her skills might be viewed as lesser to some people and she will seem more like a regular girl who can do makeup as opposed to a famous beauty guru. But on the other hand her editing is getting all this scrutiny too. People saying I hate her because shes fake. How is editing a photo making HER fake? Its still her just her distorted vision of as close to perfect as she thinks she can get. Its honestly really sad. She probably tries to have as much self love as she possibly can but sometimes seeing the edited version of yourself can warp your own perspective on who you are so much that the lines are just blurred and you dont really ever want to cross back to your old untouchedup self.This is called Body Dysmorphic Disorder. Im not saying she has it but it seems very close to being possible. I dont even know if I have it but I deep down feel like I might. Ultimately I hope the people who suffer from body dysmorphia learn to achieve true self acceptance. But they will never ever be able to do that unless society takes more active steps forward as opposed to bashing people right away for editing. Has anyone ever considered that editing photos can be almost just as addicting to some people as an eating disorder is for others? Its almost like a temporary solution to peoples insecurities. Its addicting. Its not like shes sitting there with a sinister smug smile editing her photos saying Ha! I fooled these idiots. Its really addicting to feel beautiful the way society wants to see it. Those likes on instagram are much more than likes they are constant affirmation that people like what they see and want more. You feed into it. Its a cycle. Annnnnd I talk too much lol ,BeautyGuruChat,d8lwpc5,14,t5_3606k

Theres actually a lot of theories out about the current color wheel being incorrect. Theres tons of different color wheels too not just the standard one most people know.Obviously her eyebrows arent going balls deep into color theory but they dont look bad is my point.

Did she have another post about it or did she do the same thing last year? At this point its just willful ignorance. I mean yes there are bigger things in the world to be up in arms about but that doesnt mean that you stop caring about the smaller microaggressions that impact lives daily. I think its especially insensitive given the current issues with the DAPL pipeline. Yes Alison its just Halloween for you but cmon. These are real people with real struggles.

Filings and paying court fees copies serving documents is necessary and costly. Any money donated to these administrative needs is appreciated.Working with DV is extremely heavy on the soul. Not everyone is cut out for the job and it is completely understandable. If they can only donate a check I rather they do that than do nothing at all.With most big companies doing charity because of tax breaks a self serving action her doing it for whatever reason is frankly not my problem.

Hes been documented to be racist and misogynistic in the past on top of other shit RockyRoadKill incident KVD incident. What kind of priviledged life are you living to be able to just say oh lets not talk about his racismmisogynyhis person and just focus on the products!! He also has not addressed the situations of him saying racist shit or being misogynistic. Its as clear cut as that. Im not going to go ahead and be okay with throwing my money and supporting someone like that ESPECIALLY when hes the image of his company.

He promised mass deportations within the st hour which would be hugely expensive and will be inhumane. And pretty impossible tbh. Hence why people are afraid and blaming you for putting them in danger.

9623582,0,t3_5ctnq2,This is a vlog from Jackies NYC Maybelline sponsored trip. Overall its a good video. She gives good insight into the trip what activities they participated in and obviously her makeup and clothes.There were some other YouTubers on the trip I think NikkiTutorials and....others. Jackie didnt really give much screen time to them. Not in a shady way but its a vlog from her POV.They got to stay at the Maybelline townhouse and were gifted with cute robes and tons of makeup. Their rooms were decorated with balloons with their initials.They got to go to the Maybelline lab and custom make lip glosses. A cute part was when there was a gold sparkle and Jackie was like LABRONZE!!! Because her nickname is LaBronze James.They also made cakes went on a dinner cruise and had some champagne.The only things that I didnt care for were the wig she wore its the Halloween Beetlejuice one. It just IMO doesnt work for her. Its ashy blond and she has like five different hairstyles going on in that wig.And sometimes the camera was out of focus or she was out of frame and wonky.

The reason he hides it is because he doesnt want people to realise he is shilling for Clinique every th post. Yeah some people do have wars in their countries but does that mean we cant call out shady practises online in ours? They arent related at all.

9808499,0,t3_5fmgf9,On the one hand this is hilarious. I died at the MannyJeffree mashups. For comedic value this is  would watch again. It is apparent that Manny kind of latches onto people and morphs his personality to fit theirs when hes around them. I think this is pretty common for insecure andor peoplepleasing folks which Manny obviously is a la please dont fucking watch it! on every.single.video. On the other hand the end of this video kind of took a weird spin where it went from seeming like a sort of tongueincheek joke about Manny morphing into J but then it turned actually serious? I dunno. The surgery stuff is pretty weak too. Their appearance is their job they have the means to fix insecurities so why not go for it if you want? No one singles out lady gurus for all having lip injections veneers botox etc. Its just part of the industry. And I think that hairline transplants are fairly uncommon so it makes sense that Manny would only really learn of it through Jeffree. ,BeautyGuruChat,dam3vxa,14,t5_3606k

9945158,0,t1_db3uye2,This point is still really odd to me. I also live in a really liberal city New Orleans and have for most of my time since realizing I was queer. I have also participated in pictures expecting them to remain private and done some risky things at clubs just because maybe I was drunk at the time that wasnt reflective of my closet status. LGBT people usually expect other LGBT people to look out for them in places of that are considered safe spaces even though all of which let non LGBT members in because its impossible to police that. Its just really odd to me when nonLGBT or even LGBT people try to police what those in the LGBT community can or cant do to be defined as closeted and thus their safety and privacy is moot. Because its impossible to know what he does on the regular to look out for his closeted status outside of this one night. I understand if this is not an experience or feeling that you can relate to but if that is true please try to listen to the experience and voices of those that can understand why even someone in the closet might slip. As the closet is a stiffling and confining place to be and often times can result in slipping and slipping hard just to try and push back.EDIT A wordAnd one edit just to clarify Also the closet is not a black and white thing. Like I am out to my friends some of my family but not at all professionally. Yet I still behave like what a nonLGBT person might picture a person fully out of the closet. There are shades of gray with people in the LGBT community and all are allowed flaws and mistakes and different situations for different people. Its wrong to just throw a blanket across an entire community and say If you dont behave within my perspective of what you should behave like you get this definition.,BeautyGuruChat,db3vnce,26,t5_3606k

Well from the footage of them smoking weed and partying in the factory Id say theyre treated too well if anything as Id never get away with that in work haha. Theyre not put through slave labour and you know that so please dont imply that just because you dislike him. The fact is his products ethically are not the worst. There is so much worse going in so many industries and I think having a tantrum everytime a guru or another brand dont speak in outrage towards J or like his products is horribly petty. If you care about ethical practices educate yourself on whats going on instead of being self righteous which you are being towards others. I mean you claim to care so much about morals but didnt even know about apples slave labour which is widely known it sounds like you just jump on the bandwagon if youre not aware of issues.,BeautyGuruChat,dc2y9vk,4,t5_3606k

I dont like JH though I did when I bought it but that is my all time favorite highlight. I dont highlight on the regular but when I do its either that or a different Becca highlight because theyre so good. I think that collab was what really started the whole explosion because it was VERY good quality normal Becca standardformula it was beautiful it sold extremely well  to the point where they brought it in permanently because everyone loved it so much. So every company was like holy shit look at that success of a release we gotta do that once a month to make the same revenue!! Now every collab is made in some sketchy backalley warehouse with a crap formula is promoted without pause by the influencer who never touches it again after its been released and then mysteriously has  unsold units found in the warehouse about  times after the first release so it keeps coming back. ,BeautyGuruChat,dcgopqx,3,t5_3606k

And they ended up finding out that the friend was the reason they didnt like each other something about how that person is no longer in their lives.Reading all this Rezy stuff is just sending me back to that video like a Vietnam flashback.

10437476,0,t3_5pg3fk,Youre like me! The way Sephora does their foundation shade matching is really helpful for this because it lists the undertone first then the shade.

If I get into shades that start with R they start to look a little off on me almost ashy or gray. And anything Y or higher makes me look jaundiced. I like to look at Sephoras Color IQ section of their website even if Im not buying there. Once you find a good match you can use Findation.com to find others.

Both Hispanic and Latinx are accepted terms but when it comes to discussing race in a modernday context I think Latinx is more appropriate to use given that it focused on South and Central Americansand THOSE are the people whether brown skinned or whitepassing who people like Trump focuses on insulting. Hes not talking about Spanish people from Europe oh nothose people are seen as pure by most of the world. Hes talking about Mexicans and Brazilians and Colombians and Cubans the people that are always stereotyped as dirty and lazy and drug cartels and rapists and whatnot. I have no idea why huevs is arguing that Kat is white when Kat is CLEARLY a Latina by birth and blood and when she would CLEARLY mark Hispanic on legal documents in terms of race. When we say white people we mean Europeans aka Caucasians. Being white passing doesnt make someone of the white race otherwise KathleenLights would also be whiteBUT SHES NOT. Shes a whitepassing Latina woman of color just like Kat.,BeautyGuruChat,dd7zmtk,2,t5_3606k

Thorough? Sure. Fair? Not in my opinion. To only highlight ones shortcomings and excessively focus on them in a negative manner is hardly fair and not very representative.

She was saying she loves pumpkin spice lattes and wearing leggings under shirts and ugg boots and falland theres nothing wrong with that.  I call myself a basic bitchwhite girl all the time.  I think its mildly funny and I generally enjoy the things associated with that trope except for ignorance which does come up.I think the palette is stupid in the same way I dont care for Too Faceds aesthetic and Tartes weirdass fellow kids vibe lately.  Beyond that I dont know that the colors really go with what I perceive to be the basic bitch aesthetic except perhaps that its just another sort of neutralbrowny palette.I do get why some people might be offended at being called basic lots of people down in the thread have good explanations.  My approach is to emulate Lauren Duca and just fucking own it while shooting down assholes.  I can love basic shit and be smart.  We can talk thighhigh boots and politics.  ,BeautyGuruChat,de6cd2c,6,t5_3606k
10922395,0,t1_de67m11,the worst insult for a man is to insinuate they are not  hetero guy. which still puts being a woman or being treated like a woman as a bad thing. ,BeautyGuruChat,de6khrk,5,t5_3606k

10938791,0,t3_5w7ufy,I have the Maya Mia ABH palette and its gorgeous. It had quite a few warm orangeybrownish shades so it was pretty ahead of the trends at the time. Fantastic quality too. I dont follow her but from everything Ive seen she is pretty talented and has been doing beautiful makeupeye looks for years. ,BeautyGuruChat,de89csr,6,t5_3606k
10938918,0,t3_5w5ugc,Tbh I know what E! is but I still read that as ecstasy and didnt bat a lash until I reread it and was like oh..........the tv thing.....oh.,BeautyGuruChat,de89tqx,2,t5_3606k
10946711,0,t1_de8wze0,Personally I think most people who give her CC even if theyre polite about it are not people who do or will watch her videos subscribe etc. Its this weird thing when a person has a fixation on her but doesnt support her. Thats a lot of energy to put toward a person they say they dont care about you know? ,BeautyGuruChat,de92qo3,26,t5_3606k

10957818,0,t3_5wc9le,Ive never seen her before but judging by the thumbnail Im not surprised. Too Faced does lots of cutesy packaging... and that seems to be an aesthetic that this person goes for what with the Disney Princess poster behind her.,BeautyGuruChat,dea7yq2,7,t5_3606k
