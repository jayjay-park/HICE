7987841,0,t1_d4dw0th,I disagree but just slightly. While I concur with the notion that absolute hard counterspells are unfun to play against there should at least be one card that allows for a sense of accomplishment when you stop your opponent from playing something.Using informal language it could be something like the followinggtAs you play this card choose a spell then you may pay any amount of resource. The controller of that spell may pay that same amount of resource. If he or she doesnt counter the chosen spell.Basically the effectiveness of a counterspell would depend on how much effort the user of the counterspell puts into playing it rather than just meeting a relativelylow resource payment.,letsmakeatcg,d4dwr7o,1,t5_3f3dp

8176325,0,t1_d4zigt7,Its not tapping as a mechanic that we need to worry about  its the legal issues of using actual tapping. Turning a card  degrees to indicate its been used is patented and will get us sued. We need an alternative thats all. Turning stuff over YuGiOh! style maybe.,letsmakeatcg,d4zl9nj,1,t5_3f3dp
