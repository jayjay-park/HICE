He is a good hitter even though he doesnt have the power numbers he is usually in the tops for doubles though since he plays at Kauffman  of his games. Is he great? No of course not and yes he does hit into a doozy amount of double plays hes been keeping them down over the last couple games though. There is a lot of hate for Billy because of his lack of power but with Greinke being the asshole he was KC only had Billy to look up to for quite sometime he and Sweeney have a special place in my baseball heart for that reason.,KCRoyals,ch0bqhj,1,t5_2s8ut

The universal theory on why Colon isnt playing is because he is the Super Utility guy meaning he could come in to replace Moose Esky or Infante. If thats truly the reason he could still start and replace either Moose or Esky and have Infante come in at second.Then again as I was typing this out I guess there is the fear that he would be the one to get hurttossedetc. and then Moose or Esky would follow suit.Still I think the risk is worth it.

The plate discipline was always there. With Moose theres nothing. Also how in the hell is this going to fix him? Mooses OBP was still . in the playoffs. Hes flat out not a good hitter. This is a haphazard attempt from Ned to break him out of his funk. Guess what? There is no funk. Hes just not a good hitter.Heres to hoping he proves me wrong.,KCRoyals,cq2tgvt,4,t5_2s8ut

3660708,0,t3_32aqnn,Its a product of pitching inside  which is something teams do when they think batters are crowding the plate and are hard to get out on an outside pitch.  Now on the one hand the Royals could do the same but that really isnt necessary if they are getting people out.  Perhaps we should take to heart what Chris Russo said about it in re the White Sox throwing at the Royals paraphrasing They can hit whoever they want it wont win ball games.  Now if they start to throw intentionally or harder or someone gets hurt by it bets are off.  You may well see someone have to rush the mound and put some knucklebumps on someone to show that the Royals wont put up with it.Now in Cricket if they hit you with a ball that is going to hit the wickets youd be out leg before wicket although that kind of play is frowned upon and almost started a war between England and Australia once see  but I digress.,KCRoyals,cq9jo5t,2,t5_2s8ut
3662186,0,t1_cq9jo5t,I believe Guthrie was doing it also last night. It was clear on certain batter he would pitch on the inside and I think its to get a mental up on the batter too.

The manipulation  a shoot screwjob in professional wrestling parlance  occurred without Harts knowledge and resulted in Hart the reigning WWF Champion losing the title to Michaels in Harts last match with the WWF before departing for rival promotion World Championship Wrestling WCW.

3789747,0,t1_cqo8giv,Personally if theres just white black asian hispanic etc. Ill check Hispanic because its what I most identify with. But most forums dont consider Hispanic to be a race its an ethnicity. This causes a lot of conflict for me so if I have the opportunity to check black and Hispanic I will. Most Dominicans are mixed race. Some are very light skinned but others are very dark. Its so complicated. Indio is the preferred term for our race which the overwhelming majority of people identify as. This of course doesnt really mean anything because its mixed race but which races are mixed? The shocking thing is that last I heard more Dominicans identified as white than black. There is a shocking amount of racism in the Dominican Republic and a lot of people are reluctant to identify as black. This is in part due to the abundance of Spanish cultural influence our language is Spanish our architecture is inspired by Spanish architecture we are Catholic etc. There is not a great deal of recognition regarding our blackness. Most historical figures are white washed to appear more white than they really were. There is a deep hatred of Hatians that influences this line of thinking as well. Theres a really good documentary series on Netflix that covers this topic its called Black in Latin America and the Dominican episode is well researched. Its hosted by Henry Louis Gates Jr. a black man who also wrote an article on this issue called Dominicans in Denial. He is not far off with that headline.We are indio. Hatians are black. Most Dominicans can conceive of no other way. We will recognize the Taino in us the indigenous but not the African slaves that we came from. There is a great denial of race and heritage in DR. ,KCRoyals,cqo9exv,2,t5_2s8ut

3935791,0,t1_cr4r0az,There are a few angles to this.The Royals were the secondbest team in baseball from .  The problem is the Yankees were the best.  In those days there were  divisions in each league and no wild card. KC lost to NY in the AL Championship Series in   and .  KC beat NY in  to get to its first World Series.  Personally my hate for the Yankees was born in .  Freddie Patek was my first favorite player.  He was shown crying in the dugout after the Yankees beat the Royals in the deciding game  best of  series of the ALCS that season.  Fucking Yankees made lil Freddie Patek cry.Beyond the obvious rivalry that was sparked by  great teams facing each other with the pennant on the line every year there was the fact that before Kansas City got its first franchise the As it was home to the Yankees AAA affiliate the Kansas City Blues so people in KC naturally had a little bit of a younger brother complex. A couple of other elements to the rivalry  during game  of the ALCS George Brett slid into third base on a triple and Graig Nettles kicked him which led to George popping up swinging and the benches emptying.  Also Bretts famous pine tar incident happened against NY just another example of the Yankees particularly Billy Martin being a conniving evil villain or a smart savvy manager depending on your perspective.,KCRoyals,cr4wya9,1,t5_2s8ut

But the second we get players up top allofthesudden we have to debate who deserves to go.  Thats bullshit.  Theres literally zero criteria on the fan vote.  The vote is who do you want to see start? not who do you think deserves to start?.Also its not like these people who say that Donaldson deserves to be ahead of Moose didnt also vote for Bautista  even though he in no way deserves to be a starter.,KCRoyals,crsyl79,8,t5_2s8ut

You can find it hereEDIT  If you vote today be sure to VoteFrazierEDIT  PER UVERYstuckWhen a pitcher does something wrong  Better dump his contract Stems from the massive deal the Reds gave Homer Bailey. Hes not a terrible guy but it wasnt exactly the smartest thing in the world to give him all that money. Doesnt help that hes missed a significant amount of time since signing the deal. This is mostly said tongue in cheek can also be said sarcastically about a pitcher that is performing well.Tucker Barnhart is referred to as any sort of combination of words that start with T and end with B. I dont remember when this started but its fun to say things like Trigger Barnacle and Tippytoing Blissfulnesses. This is generally done is a kind and generous spirit.When the Reds do anything  How does that help the Reds?Bryan Prices now famous expletive laden rant has many wonderful quotes. This one is my personal favorite.When shit hits the fan  Fire Dusty Dusty Baker was blamed for many things.

4613946,0,t1_ctc60bl,I read the rules youre right. The ball has to hit the ground for a rulebook double to occur. .d A fair ball passes over a fence or into the stands at a distance from home base of  feet or more. Such hit entitles the batter to a home run when he shall have touched all bases legally. A fair fly ball that passes out of the playing field at a point less than  feet from home base shall entitle the batter to advance to second base onlye A fair ball after touching the ground bounds into the stands or passes through over or under a fence or through or under a scoreboard or through or under shrubbery or vines on the fence in which case the batter and the runners shall be entitled to advance two basesf Any fair ball which either before or after touching the ground passes through or under a fence or through or under a scoreboard or through any opening in the fence or scoreboard or through or under shrubbery or vines on the fence or which sticks in a fence or scoreboard in which case the batter and the runners shall be entitled to two basesg Any bounding fair ball is deflected by the fielder into the stands or over or under a fence on fair or foul territory in which case the batter and all runners shall be entitled to advance two basesh Any fair fly ball is deflected by the fielder into the stands or over the fence into foul territory in which case the batter shall be entitled to advance to second base but if deflected into the stands or over the fence in fair territory the batter shall be entitled to a home run. However should such a fair fly be deflected at a point less than  feet from home plate the batter shall be entitled to two bases only.,KCRoyals,ctc62as,2,t5_2s8ut

4614664,0,t3_3e7ef0,So heres the thing I dont see us trading Herrera or Holland. If we were going to do that it would have been in the off season. But at the trade deadline bigtime relievers are pieces that only end up going to contenders. None of us want to live in a world where we have to face the Herreracane or the Dutchman claims Royal souls in the playoffs. GMDM doesnt either.Expect any trade we made to involve prospects only. GMDM comes from the Braves school of thinking in which you do not weaken a strength to strengthen a weakness. The guys with the club are not going anywhere.,KCRoyals,ctc9axg,24,t5_2s8ut
4614750,1,t1_ctc9cgn,Yes it does.  The major benefit in making trades like this is to put you over the top to make the playoffs.  CC Sabathia in  for Milwaukee.  Toronto will likely make a trade like that this year.So many teams have traded for an ace trying to put them over the top to take them deep in the world series and it just doesnt work.

While the south is now largely republican in nature it used to be largely democratic but with a racist twinge that would get you thrown out of todays democratic party.  Their fiscal policies would not allow them in the republican party.  So today they wouldnt exist.  Oddly enough they DONT exist because they refused to change with the times.  Thus the reason the correlation was made between old people not changing their minds and southern democrats.

4969730,0,t1_cukyvl4,gt Sporting Charts explains Stealing SignsStealing signs is not always against the rules. Major League baseballs prohibition pertains to stealing signs via electronic means only. Attempts by a team to steal signs during the game simply by observing or by other allowable means are permitted but obviously risky and unpopular. There are a number of unwritten rules in baseball one of them being that teams act in a sportsmanlike manner inferring that sign stealing is a breach of etiquette. In reality it is a baseball tradition to gain the advantage in a game by any available meansand there has certainly been evidence of sign stealing when not strictly against the rules.gtWith the advent of live camera footage and large scoreboard screens teams have done their best to keep signs hidden whenever possible. The most obvious example of this is when players meet on the field and cover their mouths with their gloves to prevent lipreading by anyone observing them. While sign stealing seems a serious offense most players and managers tend to take it lightly as long as official rules are not breached as its all part of the game.Source,KCRoyals,cukyzjs,5,t5_2s8ut

5047727,0,t3_3k28n0,I posted about this yesterday and after looking at data video looking at his history and the environment around him Im almost positive hes not hurt.I took video from his CGSO and his last outing and watched them side by side. I had to do it frame by frame to see it but there is a slight difference in his motion on his  seam. His shoulder and hip are both turned slightly towards first on his last start. That coupled with moderately mph increased velocity tells me hes over throwing the ball. Why? Well I cant say for sure but since he got called out for his motion hes been a lot more pensive on the mound. He doesnt seem to be having near as much fun. He looks tight confused even. Im thinking he tried to tone down his motion and because he lost that deceptive property in his game hes consciously or not trying to blow by hitters.The fix? Get the guy to calm down. Throw his game. Use his motion because its not illegal. Still listen to sal but if youre feeling a pitch over another let him know it. The dude just needs to get his groove back,KCRoyals,cuufxht,5,t5_2s8ut

In Game  it was a second or two ahead in the first inning and then went back to the usual  seconds ahead.  I wonder if perhaps they were intentionally delaying their audio so it would sync up with the TV better for people who were watching TV but listening to the radio like I was.Right after Morales I caught the ball now WTF do I do moment s audio had some digital stuttering in it for a few seconds.  It then cut to a lowerquality audio feed like an analog phone line that didnt have the stuttering.  I dont know if they changed the delay because they were talking about the pitching change they went to commercial and when they came back the higherquality audio was back and it was only a second or so ahead of the picture again.,KCRoyals,cwj78wf,3,t5_2s8ut

And honestly mil a year isnt that much.  Especially for a switch hitter with so much fielding diversity.  Keeping him gives us the versatility to slowly bring up some of our minor leaguers in the next couple years to fill in the other holes that will be appearing.  Without him or Gordon the option is likely to put in some youngster and wait and hope they develop or get someone that is below Zobs value and suffer the lose in talent while saving money.  We set records in attendance for the club this year and two years straight of post season play.  A contract like that will not break the bank.  ,KCRoyals,cxkc0zn,14,t5_2s8ut

What is your reasoning behind always having a baseball in your pocket during games? or do you have one with you at all times of the day?. There was one particular broadcast where Ryan was talking about how you and him just started working together and you were in a hotel together. He claimed to have seen you in nothing but a towel talking to the hotel maid and snapped a picture. During the broadcast the producers planned to show this picture but never did. Does he still have the picturecan you share it? I thought the story was absolutely hilarious!Keep up the great work in being one of the most entertaining sports broadcasters in baseball!

7256112,0,t3_4emzcr,Great rebuttal and really well written.  In the end I literally dont give a shit what a  year old Cardinals fan thinks about our fan base.I grew up a Royals fan and moved to the Chicago area in .  I would pay attention to the Royals at the beginning of each year and start losing interest as the seasons went downhill.  Id go to a SoxRoyals game every year or  but that was the extent of my fandom up until .  Why pay all that money for Extra Innings or MLB.TV and spend all that time watching games just to see a bad product?  They literally hadnt made it to the post season my entire life until .  It was not worth it IMO.  Ive endured many bad seasons by the Chiefs in that time period but I only have to watch th the number of games to do so.  Now that they are worth the time and money to watch I have a MLB.TV subscription and I watch most of the games.  That probably falls under bandwagoning but I really dont care.  It would be absolutely silly for me to put this much money and energy into a shitty team.  If they get as shitty as they used to be Ill probably stop getting my subscription.  I dont think that makes me a bad fan I think it makes me a logical human being.  I really hope that doesnt happen.  I never thought I would enjoy watching baseball games on a daily basis but I do and I love it.,KCRoyals,d22yv5s,2,t5_2s8ut

10549688,0,t3_5r1iio,Dayton Moore spoke about the Dyson trade at my companys quarterly leadership conference a week or so following the trade.  He talked about how hard it was to make that decision how Dyson was so much a part of the family that it genuinely hurt him to have to trade him.  He spoke about how the whole team has been on a roller coaster ride with him over the years how he was forever getting clean then going back on drugs.  He said Dyson was consistently on the cut list over the years but Dayton kept him because he knew for a fact if Dyson was cut he would go back home and he would wind up either dead or in prison.   He said now with the WS under his belt now was Dysons best chance at getting a monster payday and that was only going to happen if he got a good trade.  Now was also the right time for the team so we could leverage his worth to build the team back up in other areas.  I was heartbroken to lose Dyson I loved that guy.  But take sentimentality out of the equation and I really do think this was the best move all the way around.  ,KCRoyals,dd3xbon,30,t5_2s8ut
