10035008,0,t3_52oi41,Im new to Reddit so Im just getting acquainted with the various communities on different subs. From what Ive seen on other subs having dedicated moderators might help generate interest because it would show long term stability of this sub. uscottydg have you thought of making people moderators?Another way to generate interest is to connect students and Alum. Im in Sacramento CA and this sub is about the only way I stay in touch with the SU community outside of checking in personally with old classmates. Ill try to ask a few of them to post on this sub their postcollege amp professional experience and students can ask questions about the future after SU.As an Alum one thing I would love to hear from students is the news on campus. Since I graduated in  I heard a lot of student activity regarding teachers unions Matteo Ricci College protests and request for oil equity divestment just to name a few. At Alumni Events we only get the news from SU representatives which is often not a fair representation of the student perspective. Maybe have a regular post that says Monthly Student Update January  for example to get out the student point of view?,seattleu,dbfl6jk,2,t5_2s4vx
