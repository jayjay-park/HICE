The work consists of  tin cans filled with faeces each  grams and measuring .x.cm with a label in Italian English French and German statinggtAt the time the piece was created Manzoni was producing works that explored the relationship between art production and human production Artists Breath Fiato dartista a series of balloons filled with Manzonis breath being an example.gtA tin was sold for  at Sothebys on May   in October  tin  was offered for sale at Sothebys with an estimate of . It sold for . The cans were originally to be valued according to their equivalent weight in gold   each in   with the price fluctuating according to the market.gtOne of Manzonis friends the artist Agostino Bonalumi claimed that the tins are full not of faeces but plaster in contrast Manzonis girlfriend Nanda Vigo who helped him produce the cans claimed the contents really were faeces. Vigos assertion is disputed by Manzonis brother and sister. An art dealer from the Gallery Blu in Milan claims to have detected a fecal odor emanating from a can.gtThe piece received media coverage due to a lawsuit in the mids when an art museum in Randers Denmark was accused by art collector John Hunov of causing leakage of a can which had been on display at the museum in . Allegedly the museum had stored the can at irresponsibly warm temperatures. The lawsuit ended with the museum paying a DKK  settlement to the collector.about | uComicDebris can reply with delete.

Like the voting system is often fudged once it gets to the higher numbers. I assume if they fudge the input the votes its less work than to adjust the whole ranking algorithm? Allowing for smaller subreddits to maintain a realistic chance at an appearance on a personal front page? Though that problem could be solved by redoing the ranking algorithm. Im guessing its the result of a stapled together process that has developed through changes over the years andor an effort to preserve historical posts in the Top of All Time for any given subreddit.,woahdude,ces0417,8,t5_2r8tu

He and Jim Davis became popular at about the same time and while Jim sold Garfield merchandising rights to basically anyone who asked Bill never did.  From his wikipedia articlegtFor years Watterson battled against pressure from publishers to merchandise his work something he felt would cheapen his comic. He refused to merchandise his creations on the grounds that displaying Calvin and Hobbes images on commercially sold mugs stickers and Tshirts would devalue the characters and their personalities. Watterson said that Universal kept putting pressure on him and added that his contract which he said he signed without fully perusing it because he was so happy about finding a syndicate willing to give him a chance which two syndicates had denied Watterson was so onesided that if Universal really wanted to they could fire him but continue Calvin and Hobbes with a new artist. Wattersons position eventually won out and he was able to renegotiate his contract so that he would receive all rights to his work but later added that he had become so burnt out by the fight that he took a ninemonth sabbatical in .Source,woahdude,cexz3g7,27,t5_2r8tu

For real pool players itd probably drive you nuts but its still a neat idea.If you could rig a cue with sensors you could probably account for cue angle speed of shot location of shot on the cue ball and actually get it fairly accurate.One thing this would be good for is if it was modified to offer tips on shape because learning that is the difference between a good player and a great player.Check out the shot at  Thats all top spin with your cue low so its all forward momentum. Tables can be fast or slow depending on the rails and the rag. Some cloth is smoother than others so the balls will grip better and you can get better spin.All that stuff could be accounted for.

Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. Its like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen. I vary the sentence length and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm a lilt a harmony. I use short sentences. And I use sentences of medium length. And sometimes when I am certain the reader is rested I will engage him with a sentence of considerable length a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo the roll of the drums the crash of the cymbalssounds that say listen to this it is important.via Rob MacDougall,woahdude,cg0v3d5,1,t5_2r8tu

What they are interested in the the economy infrastructure education and opportunities  These are all things that are not and were not a part of Mexico and were not built on the backs of Mexicans as they like to claim If the US economy was built by Mexican labor then what is keeping Mexicans from building a better Mexico?.If the USMexican border were to be swapped overnight to the location CanadaUS border Well outside of Mexican land claims they would still be lining up to cross into the US.Im sure this will not be a popular comment but its the truth.Instead of simply down voting me why dont you post a counter argument?Keep down voting and refuse to counter point cabrones covardes,woahdude,cgwnix3,-24,t5_2r8tu

892739,0,t1_ch5qv7d,This is a good reply I hadnt thought of the idea that time could be compressed here so that is a bit more of a relief if there are others waiting for me to wake up. I do agree and I have chosen to live here and try to make the most of it believe me. The troubling thing is that this reality isnt exactly giving back what Ive put in. For example I spent two years working on a game that was released last year. I had hoped that this game would be successful enough to alleviate my poverty and allow me to continue making games. However that was not the case. Im currently broke and jobless with about  to my name and I had to go on food stamps to survive which is humiliation in itself. Lately Ive found it hard to be motivated to do anything because all of my past prospects have failed me despite the tremendous amount of effort that was put into them. Now is that just coincidental bad luck or something more? If this life were truly real wouldnt I at least be able to make some sort of progression instead of burning myself out in a hamster wheel going nowhere? As for therapy Id love to go but as I already pointed out Im not in a financial position to do so.

894699,0,t1_ch5rifh,Its a childs skull.  The roots of the primary teeth are long because they need to be in order to stay inside your mouth.  When a tooth becomes loose its because the roots of those primary teeth have been dissolved during a process called exfoliation.  Thats why the teeth we lose when we are children are so small because the roots have been dissolved to help the teeth fall out as painlessly as possible.  ,woahdude,ch5zced,3,t5_2r8tu

The bowl is attached to the cap of the bottle as you pull it up and light the buds pressure milks the hit then you unscrew the cap and suck it but very little sucking is involved since letting the bottle drop forces the smoke out of the top pretty much instantly.

1044705,0,t1_chmwsrs,I wanted to believe you but I did the research myself and this quote is more or less accurate. ,woahdude,chn1d5x,2,t5_2r8tu
1046022,0,t1_chn2gg3,Well the speculation is that there could be hundreds of billions of earthlike planets in our galaxy alone. This would theoretically account for all carbon based life in our galaxy. On top of that there is something like an estimated  billion galaxies in our universe each with their own billions and billions of earthlike planets. Now consider that there could be all sorts of life that isnt carbonbased and as such dont need to inhabit planets that fall under the same parameters. We could be talking about trillions and trillions of civilizations that currently exist with trillions more that have passed and trillions more to come. On a scale this large the evolutionary history of earth as well as the sum cultural history of human existence would probably seem incredibly minuscule and mundane. Not to mention that the number of variations found in carbonbased life forms might be dwarfed by the number found in say siliconbased life or boronbased life. To continue with the bee analogy we could seem not even a distinct species but just a very very temporary and slight variation on the bees found a couple trees over. To them the entirety of human existence could seem like a footnote in an encyclopedia in a library of trillions of encyclopedias or less. What might seem to an unknowable amount of data to us could be the equivalent of  minutes of reading to a grander alien species.Look in real life even the most passionate biologist doesnt document the minutetominute life of every single organism of a species hes studying that he encounters. Theres a threshold of novelty that needs to be breached before time and resources are spent for research. The original topic was on whether these superior aliens would attempt to stoop down to our level to communicate to us in a way that would make us cognizant. I think that when you really look at the scale of the universe you cant blame this theoretical superior civilization for not wasting their time. And even if they did think to come down and make their presence known to us in a way we can comprehend this event could easily have occurred millions of years ago or could occur millions of years from nowtheres no reason to expect them to have shown interest within such a short period such that you or I would be privy.,woahdude,chn6rec,1,t5_2r8tu

The XPOST system is flawed and surprisingly destructive to sharing content on Reddit.gt That being being said xposting content from other subreddits is totally fine and encouraged. Just dont label your xposts as xposts. If for some reason you really feel the need to tell people you found the link elsewhere on Reddit say so in a comment below your post  NOT in the title. You are required to do this if the content is original content authored by another redditorgt TLDR version of the reason behind this policygt Lots of people have been receiving downvotes and nasty comments by other people accusing them of content theft because they didnt use xpost tags. Thats obviously silly since Reddit automatically tags all xposts in the discussions tab at the top of every xpost. This kind of downvoting and hostility has been such a negative and prevalent force on reddit that the only fix seems to be raising an awareness about the issue by banning xpost tags and getting people to drop that weird accusatory and pointless system.The full explanation for this policy with examples can be found at our wikiIf you would like to try again follow these steps. Delete your post. Repost it with a proper title. that does not include the words crosspost or xpost or any variation of those wordsNote If you dont delete your post you wont be able to repost the same link.Thank you for your patience and assistance in ridding reddit of the harmful xpost tagging system.I am a botrAutoModeratorcommentsqpuwhatisautomoderator and this action was performed automatically.

1225830,0,t3_284yhm,This is inaccurate.  Hollow point ammunition rarely acts like this.It will open up and cause a very large wound cavity due to the energy being transferred to the soft tissue but it rarely breaks apart unless it hits something hard like bone even then its rare to break up this much.  This is most likely a frangible bullet designed to break up upon impact so as to avoid overpenetration.  This type of bullet is used by the FAMS.This is what a hollow point looks like in ballistics gelIt opens up and creates a large wound cavity but does not break apart.As for the OP  the tiny flecks dont do nearly as much damage as youd think.  They cause internal bleeding which will cause you to bleed out over a long enough period of time but unless they hit an artery the target will most likely survive.  If you look at the wound cavity in the hollow point picture if that were inside you the damage would be catastrophic.  It would tear apart any soft tissue and force your organs around very violently.  This can cause tears in pretty much every vital organ and cause what is known as Hydrostatic Shock this is basically when God turns out your life switch.

1229639,0,t1_ci7xrcq,yeah. thats what I was thinking. I think women would be more conscious of not looking in certain places when they know they are being recorded. Not to mention this system seem to equate  how long you stay on a certain place. Meaning all the women could have taken a quick peek at the crotch but it wouldnt show since they didn t linger. Im not trying to make a point on men and woman but more that the correlation of this data might represent where genders look when they know they are being recorded. Rather than when browsing in their home.Correlation is a scary thing they use to prove thoeries all the time. One could easily say that men read and understand type faster than woman. Or depending on what data was collected. You might find that more woman in the study had poor vision and need to linger longer to read it. Also I dont understand why the red on the supermodels face for the men and woman is the same. If the woman split their attention with the type then you would think the face would be less red or the mens would be really red. Either way they shouldnt match.Also it would be interesting to find out what ad the supermodel is infor the men vs women. Depending on the subject matter it might just be something menin general find less interesting.I thought at first the red logo was HampM but not so much after going back.,woahdude,ci7yaar,4,t5_2r8tu

The XPOST system is flawed and surprisingly destructive to sharing content on Reddit.gt That being being said xposting content from other subreddits is totally fine and encouraged. Just dont label your xposts as xposts. If for some reason you really feel the need to tell people you found the link elsewhere on Reddit say so in a comment below your post  NOT in the title. You are required to do this if the content is original content authored by another redditorgt TLDR version of the reason behind this policygt Lots of people have been receiving downvotes and nasty comments by other people accusing them of content theft because they didnt use xpost tags. Thats obviously silly since Reddit automatically tags all xposts in the discussions tab at the top of every xpost. This kind of downvoting and hostility has been such a negative and prevalent force on reddit that the only fix seems to be raising an awareness about the issue by banning xpost tags and getting people to drop that weird accusatory and pointless system.The full explanation for this policy with examples can be found at our wikiIf you would like to try again follow these steps. Delete your post. Repost it with a proper title. that does not include the words crosspost or xpost or any variation of those wordsNote If you dont delete your post you wont be able to repost the same link.Thank you for your patience and assistance in ridding reddit of the harmful xpost tagging system.I am a botrAutoModeratorcommentsqpuwhatisautomoderator and this action was performed automatically.

1330089,0,t1_cij41s9,The somewhat funny thing is we cant conceptualize nothing were simply not capable.Also there is no need to put a god somewhere in the equation really. I mean you can call it whatever you like be it God be it Nature be it Cosmos be it flying spaghetti monster or Carl Sagan. Its a normal process of human abstraction and an indicator of human creativity ingenuity and its inherent thirst for knowledge. The problem as I see it is when religion starts meddling with societal forces and starts to dogmatize that new abstract information preventing it from growing beyond its weak and baseless assumptions. thats why we have science as a magnificent toolSo call this vast beauty of Cosmos God if you want to just dont ever see anything as an absolute and be always open for change and growth as a being and all of the beauties of life and existence will simply unfold beneath you and the religion will simply fade away.Edit formatting,woahdude,cij93b2,0,t5_2r8tu

1429111,0,t1_civbvp8,If an electron where to pass through the nucleus of an atom it would have an extremely high probability of being absorbed turning a proton into a neutron while releasing a neutrino. This can be demonstrated with potassiumargon decay. This also normally occurs with the L and K orbitals though an electron in a s may be captured if it is in an isotope with a lot of protons that is missing neutrons so is lighter than than the nonisotope. The s of a hydrogen does not exist inside the nucleus because the nucleus is only a proton. Okay there is some probability but all space has a nonzero probability for the existence of an electron. Think of it this way. The electron is the electrical field of the atom emanating from the nucleus and the electron in its most ground low energy state must still exist outside the nucleus otherwise it would cause the atom to decay.The term empty space is the real question.

1429452,0,t1_civg73c,I understand your confusion. It certainly isnt very intuitive. In the quantum mechanical sense disturbing the system refers to actions that can alter the quantum state of the particles in the system. You might be familiar with the uncertainty principle which basically says we cannot know both the position and momentum of a particle at the same time. To be able to measure anything about the particle we need to interact with it in some way. This interaction may or may not alter the state of the particle and so a second measurement will be measuring the system after the interaction from the first measurement and may not reflect the initial system we wish to measure.So to answer your question it is possible to move these particles so long as you can do so without interacting with them in such a way that will alter their state. Youll have to ask someone more knowledgeable how they do this.,woahdude,civgj3v,5,t5_2r8tu

What about dino fossils being found next to human fossils? I could go on but that is a bit much to munch on.EDIT It seems from the downvotes that people are assuming I am saying something I am not. I am asking for people who think they know what they are talking about to explain to me the things that people rarely ever actually understand. These are questions not much else. You can imply all you want. Downvotes and negative behavior is no way to convert someone to your way of thinking.

The site claimed they were inter dimensional beings invisible to the naked eye  hence why they only showed up in pictures  or moved so fast they would kill you if you were hit by one. Then they had some story about a guy who was impaled by one while driving because rods move so fast and slip in and out of our dimension. Weeeeeeeeird shit. ,woahdude,cj95idv,3,t5_2r8tu

I dont think the salt is actually curing the bite which what would that really be? To cure a bite you have to remove or damage the chemicals causing a reaction.

If she wants to do that its her right and I hope it makes her happy but this TO ME just comes across as a reckless decision that doesnt account for the fact that things CHANGE in life. Whether or not she chooses to have kids is irrelevant your body changes over time in ways that are usually pretty hard to predict. Based on that I just think its silly to get something as prominent and precise as a geometric fullbody tattoo if you KNOW ahead of time that it has a bestbefore date.

1985368,0,t1_ckselwo,That Allah is lying to you. He is not merciful at all. He does not love you. He does not want the best for you but the worst. The Koran contradicts and is unfair. Why is it a sin not to believe? Maybe Allah should show his mercy first before we  can believe in it. Why does Allah give all these rules? Every aspect in life is controlled by the Koran or Hadith. Allah is not a personal God not a logical God. You never know if you will have salvation or not and imho Allah is not capable of giving you you salvation because Allah was created and is not an uncreated being. If Allah was a loving God he would have great interests in the wellbeing of his creatures all of them including woman and even jews. He would want to put the things he loves directly in your heart not following unbendable laws. There is no forgiveness in Islam. One mistake and in some countries you loose your arm of even your life. You have work really hard in Islam and every human being fails at that ... and even if you would not fail .... will you go to heaven? Only Allah decides. How is that mercy? Thats random and being unfair. And so muslims are allowed to take shortcuts to go to paradise by hurting the enemies of Allah. But why would Allah have enemies? Has he not created everything? Why would he create enemies? If I have a stupid it does not become my enemy its to stupid for that. Why would we ever be a threat for Allah? I know the answers to this question. Because Allah is a unclean spirit who tricked and deceived Mohammed.  A creation that desires to be worshipped by all man without deserving it. Allah lies about being the creator. He is not. And Allah will not escape the fiery pit at the end of times.  Everything is reversed in Islam and it works very well in deceiving people because when you put a lie directly in front of the truth the truth is hard to see. ,woahdude,cksfr2h,0,t5_2r8tu

2164748,0,t3_2jshro,Fun fact  The Marylin image contains only low frequency gradients information and the other only contains high frequency information edges.  As you downsample the image or step away from it the high frequency information in the Einstein image is lost and the low frequency information in the other image is sharpened through downsampling.  With large enough images you could stack them one on top of the other and see multiple images in one based on how far away you are from them or zoom out if your room isnt big enough.  Check out Laplacian Pyramids to see how this technique is used in image compression.,woahdude,clezmrt,1,t5_2r8tu

If it was  billion light years away when it set off then it will have taken longer than  billion years to reach us. The reason people assume light would take the same as the object is light years away is because normally were talking on the scale of our universe or even our local group where the distances are small enough for the expansion of the universe to have a negligible effect. ,woahdude,clyjmff,1,t5_2r8tu

2607487,0,t1_cmyhmec,Theres a lot of things wrong with what you said but Ill address it all.gtHelium is more dense than this material. density is not constant is it less dense than helium under massive gravitational force or the same amount of helium spread out over  lighter years?gtThis material has open pores to accept air so it allows air into it. Helium doesnt allow air into it because it is a gas not a solid. You cant add air to helium.I dont think you quite understand how any of this works and I have no idea what logic youre using to come to this conclusion so Ill try and explain everything.Helium doesnt just float around as a big ball in the atmosphere as soon as you release it from a container it will spread out and rise in the atmosphere. Even a single atom of helium will float as it is lighter than air. Gasses essentially make their own pores they voluntarily lose density as much as possible and will spread themselves out. Just because there is air within the boundaries of what we consider the object does not mean the object gains the mass of the air. The atoms of this material are heavier than air and will therefore not float within air it is that simple.Just go look at periodic table helium is lighter than all solids at room temperature.,woahdude,cmyxpfo,0,t5_2r8tu

This mutation may and probably will give an advantage to the snake by means of feeding escaping death and ultimately reproducing. If this guy reproduces theres a chance his off spring will also sport the same mutation and so on and so on.This is exactly how mammals slowly emerged from the oceans billions of years ago. Fish turned into amphibians which then began to grow legs and climb trees etc. Obviously not as simple as that and not nearly as quick but its a good representation.I am not a biologist or anything close this is just an average guys perception on evolution.

2989894,0,t1_co7lctv,After a while you meet your future self  also with the GoPro on. You compare both of your footage and decide to trade your GoPros. After that brief encounter of the th kind he leaves you and you continue your journey in a ship where everything is white.You cant help but peek at his footage. In your head you think of all the cool futuristic shit your future self did. So you connect it to a TV and playback expecting some really cool stuff.And it delivers. By god it delivers.Your future self is a dank classy man whos done all kinds of fantastic things. You see his view as he figures out how to save human kind by finding them a new planet to live on as he rebuilds colony after colony so there are secondary measures in place should the planet fail as he goes around the galaxy in his pimped up ship and shakes the hands tentacles and fins of various leaders of alien species to further peace and trade between humans their kind.Just when it cant get any better you see how mesmerizing he is to look at in the mirror. Whenever he slows down and checks his hair in a reflective surface you cant help but leak from your pipe.By now humanity has spread across various neighboring solar systems. Terraforming is a thing. So families can move to nearby planets. Close enough for visits from uncles and aunts but far enough so your inlaws cant fucking come over to your house every fucking weekend.Your future self is basically the guy who represents humanity. All the other leaders either want to sit in their seats and die of natural causes or govern from their own planets. But youre an adventurous soul. You cant be held back by promises of leadership nor be bounded by the beauty of any single planet. Your heart desires exploration as if your previous efforts werent the testament of god itself.So you venture on. In your white ship along with your trust robot sidekick. He navigates you to meeting newer alien species and to planets with some really cool looking brothels. Because you can only do your robot so much.But suddenly the tape fizzes and static cuts off your current journey. Your friend Dave taped over your existing cool adventure. Classic Dave. Who knew GoPros would face the same problem as something as niche as VHS from the th century. But moving on. This video is about you your girlfriend Rose because women in the future have really cool names and Dave returning from a trip. Dave continues to film seagulls eating fries right over your space adventure footage while you and Rose are holding hands and walking back home. Its late and Dave and yourself decide to drop off Rose at her house and head back home. But just as your enter the front porch and ask for some water Rose turns around and tells you I dont think we should do this any more. She pauses so you can take in what just happened.Your girlfriend is dumping you. You who has singlehandedly saved the human race from extinction. You who has traveled to the furthest reaches of space and discovered planets so bizarre not even Neil deGrasse Tyson could image them. But nope here she is a simpleton of Earth breaking up with you. As if all of that wasnt enough.She says Youve been away for far too long. Im seeing someone else these days and I dont think its fair to keep me waiting for someone who only visits once a year and doesnt even use Skype. I dont even think I love you any more.You tear away from the GoPro footage. Your present self clutches your chest as a dull throbbing pain passes you. Your miniature heart attack is the least of your worries though. You cant fathom that your girlfriend broke up with you. Youd been together for almost  years. After this journey you were about to ask her to marry you. But no. That isnt going to happen. So you tell your robot to turn the ship around back to Earth. Your human companions aboard the ship protest against your actions but you pull out your gun from the hidden compartment in your robot and shoot them in the head.And since robots have been domesticated in your current time period your robot sidekick has to listen to you. So it turns around the ship and the two of you zoom back to Earth. The ship lands in the your high schools football field actual football not the American kind and you run towards Roses house. You ring the bell frantically and she opens up after the third. Standing there stunned she puts her hand against her mouth stifling a choked cry. But tears escape her eyes as she sees you returned safe from your venture into space.Just as she leaps to hug you you hold up a hand and shake your head. Having witnessed a heartbreak you cant bear to do it again but you tell her its over. Find someone else. Without saying another word you leave her on her front porch the very same which your future self got dumped on. But due to the inconsistencies of time travel that will never happen again.You board your ship order your robot to continue the journey find the planet and save humanity. After finding the planet you pursue the same course of action traveling from planet to planet albeit one change. Now your life is devoid of human presence or company. You parents died when you were young so no one bothers sending you a message. But you prefer that because youre a lone wolf. You and your robot thats about it.Due to your nature of travel time on Earth passes by faster than what your life is going through. Therefore Rose lived a happy life married Joseph the average looking guy who got As in all his college classes. But you dont feel the jealousy you had for him then. Because in your mind you were always the better looking of the two despite two of you having almost the same generic face. You meet alien leaders and continue charting the world for humankind. And to top it off you even get fancy brothels where you have sex in positions you couldve never imagined.But all this amasses to nothing. You live a lonely life and one day or night. Well night because its pitch black in space your heart gives way and you die a painless and fast death. But without your orders your robot sidekick switches into hibernation mode and the ship continues drifting into space where after a hundred years it gets pulled into the heart of a giant supernova and you go into what you once came from. All this because of love.BECAUSE LOVE TRANSCENDS TIME AND SPACE AND EVERYTHING ELSE. YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT BY NOW!,woahdude,co7weoy,81,t5_2r8tu

3033359,0,t1_coceiaj,Yes most protein shape changes are extremly rapid. In order for you to even be reading this signals are being sent along your optic nerve from your eyes to your brain. The signal is propagated through axon fibres that make up this nerve. The amazing thing is theres nothing flowing through the axon only ions flowing in and out of the axon through protein channels. Its more complicated than this but essentially the channels wont change shape and open until the one before it has. So the signal from your eye is millions of channels opening one after the other all the way along the optic nerve to your brain with each opening being a structural change.Now bear in mind that in your brain alone there are  billion of these axons and the signals can travel as fast as ms which as fast as the fastest production car in the world all caused by proteins changing shape and ions flowing in and out through them.,woahdude,coceml9,15,t5_2r8tu

We spent a day or so with a whiteboard just playing with ideas then C.J.  Our Art Director and Project Manager for this project did most all of the coding and design for this himself. Then we collaborated on graphics sounds little extra animations to give is spunk and a lot of testing and calibration. Total we did this one in about a week  keeping in mind we had to work during the night since the arena is used during the day. Its also worth noting that C.J. is very good at the program we used and it would likely take someone less skilled at it much longer.And I totally did make that shot albeit I wont say it was my first attempt haha.,woahdude,coj1jnq,2,t5_2r8tu

So with a calculated light source the top of the cube is being lit just enough to match the value of shaded area on the white side of the cube.

3248811,0,t3_2xah40,I made a movie to try and show why some are seeing it one way or the otherHow I interpret how a camera would deal with the exposure of that dress is based off knowing how most lowerend cameras work. To the white amp gold people which I was originally thought about how a real camera not a cell phone photo would look like a situation of when you want a photo of a sunrise and just end up with a glowing white sky because the camera correctly exposed the dark houses. To the black amp blue people they saw it as the oopposite  they saw a situation in which the camera was overexposing the dress.The thing is BOTH are true  the camera that took the photo of the dress overexposed the dress AND the background.So heres a video of me in Photoshop attempting to show you guys how the perceptions were different pay attention to how wrong or right the colors look of the rest of the screen in comparison.,woahdude,coyqxkb,1,t5_2r8tu

In  the democrats received  million more votes but won  more seats in the house.  those numbers were  million votes and  seats respectively. In  those numbers were . million more votes to  more seats. In  republicans won  more seats than the democrats riding their  million more votes to take control of the house. For those of you scoring at home when the democrats were in charge of the house every million more votes they received than republicans was worth about  seats  . million more voters  . more seats in the house. When the democrats were in charge of the house republicans had to receive five million more votes just for  more seats or roughly . seats for every million more votes they got. Fast forward to a republican controlled house after a brief democratic majority Republicans receive about  million more voters than democrats win majority by  seats. Thats about . seats per million voters less than the total need by the republicans in  but the democrats were in the majority for significantly less time in  than they were in .  Republicans receive about . million LESS votes than democrats win majority by  seats.  Republicans receive about . million more votes than democrats win majority by  seats. For those of you scoring at home thats about  seats million more voters . seats per million voters or roughly the same advantage the democratic majority enjoyed when they were in charge of the house.For reference when the democrats unseated the republicans in   years after republicans won the majority the democrats received about . million more popular votes than republicans but gained  seats or about . seats per million voters or roughly the same as the republicans needed to unseat the democrats in .Edit tldr Shit be cyclical yo,woahdude,cp07yt3,1,t5_2r8tu

If you have a cup of water in your hand and go up to the third or fourth floor of a building it doesnt start boiling right?  But if you put it on put it on a balloon up to  feet and assume that the temperature is the same up there which in reality it isnt then it will boil.  For the ft problem the weight of the water pulling down will lower the pressure of the tiny bit of air stuck at the top of the tank until it reaches the same pressure you would get at  feet.

Feel free to link me to a journal or video documenting the case you speak of unless it is just a hypothetical assumption.  I actually think it would be interesting to see what the crow would do in that situation.  Actually I think the crow would make several attempts at getting the treat. These attempts will likely fail as crows are not mythical geniuses.  Despite this limitation I suppose that the crow will eliminate poor choices for acquiring this treat eventually ending up with some kind of solution for obtaining it.

I also hate the burn of aftershave if I can avoid it. I have a tube of expensive but awesomesmelling aftershave lotion from Baxter and I wanted to see if I could make something similar on my own so I did a little research on the ingredients. Turns out using coconut oil and aloe vera as a base along with orange oil allantoin and peppermint oil does pretty much the same thing and you can add your own fragrances or ingredients as you see fit. Plus there are no worries about allergic reactions or longterm side effects and you can swap ingredients or add as you please. Dont like coconut? Use another vegetable fat. Dont like aloe vera? There are a ton of skinsoothing agents you can use. Hate the smell of peppermint and citrus? Cool you can use patchouli or cinnamon oil or pretty much anything you choose. And you only need a little to get the smell. You can add tea tree oil and witch hazel for disinfectant and even lavender. tldr I like making my own because the possibilities are endless I know whats in it and I know how its made because Im the one doing it. ,woahdude,crgkh6w,2,t5_2r8tu

Art Lebedev were innovators but being too early can be as bad as too late the OLED displays were brilliant albeit in hindsight bad choices.

If they were picked when ripe they would be mush by the time they made it to the store.When picked before they are ripe they have not absorbed all of the nutrients necessary to bring them to their full potential yet. And because they are no longer connected to the plant they cant get any more.

Again Zayne Carrick at the very least had a weak connection but became hella powerful. In turn both Ben Skywalker and Anakin Solo were themselves pretty mediocre force users despite being direct descendants of the canon most powerful Jedi that has ever existed.And to further expand Jedi have legit made life and created a method for like force immortality? I wouldnt say the Sith have the market cornered on force innovations.  On top of that ObiWan is considered by Yoda to be the greatest Jedi of all time and hes not exactly the most powerful. He beat Darth Vader and like yeah he had better positioning and experience but that just indicates that theres way more in play with power than the genetic stuff if thats even a factor at all. ,woahdude,ct65vu4,1,t5_2r8tu

4966381,0,t3_3ixn9q,First I did not build this. But have made similar rigs with HeNe lasers back in the s.Second This is based on something called a Lissajous pattern.Basically you control the spin on a mirror mounted on a well controlled motor that hits another mirror one is the X axis horizontal the other Y vertical. The Z axis the D part was probably added by a third mirror.The sound and mirror timing for each is controlled by a very cheap chip called a  timer and this whole thing was basically controlled probably by just turning knobs potentiometers.You could probably build one of these rigs for maybe  or even cheaper with a Raspberry Pi if you already have a soldering iron and some basic hardware but massive credit to the guy who did.Here is a video of what just two basic circuits can do with  mirrors and motors and no sound circuits Enjoy!,woahdude,cukju1r,1,t5_2r8tu

5505105,0,t1_cwf8kl3,Exactly. One of my art professors had a cerebral hemorrhage and completely lost the use of one side of her body I forget which side. However she still continued to paint despite her disability. She treated her practice as physical therapy and has regained some function to the paralyzed side of her body. She can even stand and walk now but still needs a chair to get around. Her brain literally rerouted itself to regain function of the dormant side of her body.Furthermore I majored in art and took AP art classes all throughout high school. I was considered good but I am also my toughest critic at times.I didnt see an improvement in my art until I made the decision  years ago to paint or draw everyday. Its not easy and many days I dont want to. But I force myself to do it everyday. If I step up the canvas make one swipe with the brush and if I am just not feeling it Ill walk away and either make music or write...but  times out of  once I start I dont stop. Which reminds me I need to get off my ass and paint.To those wanting to learn how to draw stop using pencils. Use a pen instead so you cant erase. It will train the muscles to make the mark you want to. Do this for a year or two then return to using a pencil. You will be amazed at how easy drawing becomes.,woahdude,cwfbu8c,10,t5_2r8tu

5634601,0,t1_cwvi8pq,Around the nucleus of the poop there are minipoops. Scientists used to think that they had circular orbits but have discovered that things are much more complicated. Actually the patterns of the minipoop within one of these orbitals takes into account Schroedingers wave equations. Minipoops occupy certain shells that surround the nucleus of the poop. These shells have been given letter names KLMNOPQ. They have also been given number names such as think quantum mechanics. Within the shell there may exist miniminipoops or orbitals with letter names such as spdf. Some of these orbitals look like spheres some like an hourglass still others like beads. The K shell contains an s orbital called a s orbital. The L shell contains an s and p orbital called a s and p orbital. The M shell contains an s p and d orbital called a s p and d orbital. The N O P and Q shells each contain an s p d and f orbital called a s p d f s p d f s p d f s p d and f orbital. These orbitals also have various subpoops. Each can only contain a certain number of minipoops. A maximum of  minipoops can occupy a suborbital where one has a spin of turd the other has a spin of crap. There can not be two minipoops with spin turd in the same suborbitalthe Ferguson exclusion principal. Also when you have a pair of minipoops in a suborbital their combined shit fields will cancel each other out. If you are confuse you are not alone. Many people get lost here and just wonder about poop instead of researching further.When you look at the solid aromatic outputs it is hard to see why they are so different form the elements next to them in the toilet. It is generally accepted that solid aromatic outputs have large poop moments because of unpaired minipoop in their outer orbitals. The spin of the minipoop is also thought to create a minute shit field. These fields have a compounding effect so when you get a bunch of these fields together they add up to bigger poops.To wrap things up on how do poops work? the atoms of aromatic materials tend to have their own poop field created by the minipoops that orbit them. Small groups of poop tend to orient themselves in the same direction. Each of these groups is called a poop domain. Each domain has its own north pole and south pole. When a piece of poop is not magnetized the domains will not be pointing in the same direction but will be pointing in random directions canceling each other out and preventing the poop from having a north or south pole or being a poop. If you introduce currentpoop field the domains will start to line up with the external poop field. The more current applied the higher the number of aligned domains. As the external aromatic field becomes stronger more and more of the domains will line up with it. There will be a point where all of the domains within the poop are aligned with the external poop fieldsaturation no matter how much stronger the pop field is made. After the external poop field is removed soft poop materials will revert to randomly oriented domains however hard poop materials will keep most of their domains aligned creating a strong permanent poop. So there you have it.,woahdude,cwvixrk,177,t5_2r8tu

Ive spent a lot of time on both but most of it was while doing something else. You can easily get in  min to an hour of nunchuck practice while watching TV and I just keep a butterfly knife on my desk at home and practice while redditing waiting for games to load working from home whenever. And the dexterity required for each is quite different. Im really good at nunchucks but the knife is a struggle. My SO who is not the most dexterous at all picked up nunchucks really fast. Ive trained a lot of people and Im often surprised who is a natural and who isnt. Ive seen people who were far better martial artists than me who struggled too. Both are super fun though and the badass feeling is totally worth a few bruises or nicks here and there. ,woahdude,cxco79f,1,t5_2r8tu

6045793,0,t1_cyc33n6,. or even . with it having a tendency to be higher pressure rounds with more powder is not a good deer round. It can work yes you can kill a deer with .LR out of a  barrel revolver. It is far from optimal. It travels very fast is a very small diameter round with a projectile that typically is around only gr. This all combines to make it poor at several things that are important with hunting. It has great penetration but since Fma it is very quick and very light. This means both from branches if you dont have a firing lane clear and from bone specifically shoulder because you are going for lungs and heart you are facing serious potential for deflection.What round is best for you depends on whether or not you handreload what distances are involved what terrain is involved and most importantly what game is involved. For my area for example in WV we dont have a ton of real true long range shots and the terrain is mostly trees and brush and rapid elevation changes. For hunting whitetail in these conditions . Remington or . would be optimal. Many other rounds would be close to as good or equally as good... but many more would be like the ARs . NATO. Remington argument.

The  is fly by wire but flight envelope protection can be overruled by sufficient force on the controls from the Pilots.Airbus A.....no not in normal flight.I say normal flight because there are several levels of flight control law with the Airbus FBW system Normal Alternate Direct Emergency mechanical backupI believe if the flight control mode has been degraded to alternate law bank angle protection is lost and the aircraft can be commanded into a roll.The problem with the roll manoeuvre performed in that film is the load factor applied to the aircraft or basically the g force acting on it.

Possibly better off used in the leg arteries but for sure not in the heart. Although they seem like great ideas. The length and difficulty of deploying any of those devices would greatly increase the chances of unforeseenunwarranted difficulties to an already high to medium risk procedure. I myself have always wanted to have a percutaneous fogerty type device for clot removal in the cardiac arteries. Ive done lots of procedures and I have to say dealing with blood clots in any vessel be it a vein or an artery is the biggest pain in the ass. Think about trying to remove small chunks of jello from a drinking straw using. It doesnt aspirate easily its doesnt plastyballoon easily and clot buster drugs take time to resolve it.

6111512,0,t1_cyk0w1y,Great answer thanks! You got me in a mathsy mood so heres my version of your answer in a more mathematical form Looking at your first link the circumference of a planet is pi r. It has n teeth so theres  pi rn distance per tooth. The outer ring has a radius of r and x teeth. To find x as a function of n we notice that the distance per tooth must be the same for both planet and outer ring i.e.  pi rn   pi rx which gives xn what we expected!Now we apply the same approach to your third link Again the radius of a planet is r and its number of teeth is n. The outher rings radius is R and its number of teeth is again x. What is the relationship between nx is what we want to find out. Using your drawing with the two triangles we find that Rrsqrt rrsqrt. Again using the relation  pi rn pi Rx we find that xnsqrt. Since we only are interested in integer solutions for x and n this is a diophantine equation and I dont know how to solve those but plugging in n we see that x.... and thats apparently close enough to an integer to allow it to work IRL. Again all credit to uFetchFrosh!EDIT Warning Might not actually be a diophantine equation I told you I didnt know anything about them! since the coefficients are not integers. It would be nice to show that there are either no or some integer solutions.. Im looking into it right now! EDIT It is not a diophantine equation.. But if anyone would like to show whether or not this has integer solutions for n and x Id be grateful! EDIT No integer solutions since yx is irrational courtesy of thisEDIT Actually n would have yielded a better result since this gives x... dont know why he didnt go with that instead. EDIT Hmm someone in the video commented that this would cause some problem with the teeth ramming into each other but I dont quite get it..EDIT Ive found a sequence that gives the numbers xn xn... which produces the smallest distance to the nearest integer up until that point  the further you go up the sequence the closer to an integer you get when plugged into yxsqrt. If we let ksqrt then the sequence is xnxnk. Starting with x and rounding for each number produced the sequence becomes       .... Ive also found a kind of attractor and its beautiful but I dont know much about these either so I cant say much about it yet.,woahdude,cykbe7a,2,t5_2r8tu

When you step or run you load  of your weight onto  of the skies thus pressing the middle area of the ski down onto the area that has grip wax.This allows you to glide effectively when you are balanced between both skies and use the grip wax underneath your foot when you load that ski with weight.,woahdude,czbm873,5,t5_2r8tu

6402764,0,t1_czhcstz,Those are superficial veins and youre not disrupting the deep venous system which is much bigger and more important. Spider and varicose veins look the way they do because theyre dilated and not very functional and blood is backing up in them. Shutting them off doesnt lose much function.To give you an idea an old treatment for recurrent DVTs or clots in the legs was to tie off the inferior vena cava the biggest vein in the body that collects everything from below the rib cage and connects it to the heart. You get really bad leg swelling but you still survive because of whatever collateral circulation you already have andor can develop. We dont do that treatment anymore because weve got better therapies with less shitty side effects but you can pretty much destroy as many veins as you want and mostly all thats going to happen is chronic swelling if any side effects happen at all.,woahdude,czhfgxi,35,t5_2r8tu

Browsing woahdude has become intolerable on some devices because of unnecessarily enormous GIFs.On the other hand HTML is almost  the file size of a GIF.

Youve probably heard the story of the causeway? if not and for anyone else here it is taken from Wikipedia. there are a few stories though but the second version said is probably the best known occasionally we Scots like to portray the Irish giant as the big and stupid onegt According to legend the columns are the remains of a causeway built by a giant. The story goes that the Irish giant Fionn mac Cumhaill Finn MacCool from the Fenian Cycle of Gaelic mythology was challenged to a fight by the Scottish giant Benandonner. Fionn accepted the challenge and built the causeway across the North Channel so that the two giants could meet. In one version of the story Fionn defeats Benandonner. In another Fionn hides from Benandonner when he realises that his foe is much bigger than he. Fionns wife Oonagh disguises Fionn as a baby and tucks him in a cradle. When Benandonner sees the size of the baby he reckons that its father Fionn must be a giant among giants. He flees back to Scotland in fright destroying the causeway behind him so that Fionn could not follow. Across the sea there are identical basalt columns a part of the same ancient lava flow at Fingals Cave on the Scottish isle of Staffa and it is possible that the story was influenced by this.,woahdude,d03mczh,26,t5_2r8tu

Octopi is really just getting things wrong and trying to use a Latin pluralization on a Greek word but people do it so often that its often been grudgingly accepted. Its still poor form to do so and people will decline invitations to your nacho parties if it becomes widely known that you do.People will understand any of them and various dictionaries will state that one or all are the correct usage but if you want to be most correct and impress people with your awesome language abilities say octopodes and avoid octopi.,woahdude,d06ysdu,528,t5_2r8tu

6655020,0,t1_d07i2w0,I think that the confusion you have right now its that all movement is relative.Say that you are in a supersonic jet the goes around the Earth but in a certain velocity so that  its always midnight kinda chasing the moon. If you look at the sky the moon will not appear to rotate since the moon its always facing you. But thats because of you reference or vantage point.In your vantage point the moon is not moving because you are always at the same distance to the moon and the moon is not rotating. In your vantage point the Earth is rotating so the earth is in motion. Keep in mind all of this is in your vantage point. But its equally true all other vantage point. For a kid looking at the sky you are the one moving and the moon too. For an astronaut standing on the side facing the Earth the Earth is only rotating and your jet is completely stationary and the beauty of this is that all of these vantage points are equally true.If you look at Earth from above looking at north pole from a distance in a way you see Earth and the moon in the same picture. Youll notice that the moon is going around the Earth and its also rotating around its axis like dancing Waltz and its rotating at such a speed that one side its always facing Earth.I hope this gif helps you get the picture.,woahdude,d07oqgj,11,t5_2r8tu

6686500,0,t3_476gys,My parents were moving into their first house and decided to have a movinghouse warming party. Got a keg and invited friends to help them move all their shit into the new place. Part way through the day and the keg one of them realizes theres a wasp next in the front lawn. My dads friend had this brilliant idea to take a screen from the window and throw it over the hole in the ground to keep the wasps from getting out. Another friend thought an easy way to kill them would be to pour gas down the hole and suffocate them. And of course the drunkest dude had to take it up a notch. Taking an aerosol can and his lighter he creates a mini flamer thrower and lights this gas filled wasps nest on fire. Well the guy who poured the gas down the hole wasnt super careful about spillage. A line of gas leading back to the can caught on fire. Freaking out someone decided to kick the can away. This now rolling can leaking gas started rolling towards the street. The fire caught up with it as it landed in the gutter and start pouring out the remaining gas which eventually caught on fire as well.And thats how my parents met their neighbors and the local firefighters. ,woahdude,d0axxun,9,t5_2r8tu

Thus it is unlikely that a child below age ish will have a foreign accent as an adult but I had a french friend who started attending american school at age  and still had an accent. Whereas my mom moved stateside at age  into a Spanish speaking neighborhood and you wouldnt know that she even knows another language from speaking to her.

People line up for it and they bring like  people at a time into this giant circus tent where there is a DJ playing good fun music and a huge plexiglass box. Everyone strips naked and waits  dances while the last group finishes up and then when it is clear you all crowd into this box that is open at the top and has a grating at the bottom to collect the water.    Then people up on top of the box hose down everyone with foamy soap while everyone in the box cheers and dances and scrubs the dirt off themselves  their partner or friend. After a little bit they then hose off the entire box with cold water.

The smaller you go from his handspan the greater that will become. Putting your thumb anywhere but the back of the neck compromises total reach and range of motion and reduces the amount of pressure you can put on the strings as well as forcing you to squeeze your palm against the sides of the neck which will cause injury over time. Its only if you already have exceptional ability in those be it from hand size flexibility the size of the thumb itself or all three that it should become an option to trade them away.I can reach an th on the piano and using my thumb is a massive chore as well as being painful.

The full moon is half a degree  arcminutes where arcminutes are th of a degree wide when viewed from Earth. Jupiter is  times as wide as the moon so Jupiter would take up about  degrees of your field of view. Thats about as big as the Orion constellation. If you just imagine that the entire Orion constellation being blocked out by Jupiter then maybe you can picture it in the sky. I cant find an actual visualization of the Jupiter in the moons orbit but this should actually be to scale. If you put Jupiter in the moons position and draw an angle between Earth and the edges of Jupiter it should be about  degrees. ,woahdude,d4dd800,1,t5_2r8tu

7999975,0,t1_d4f8gy4,Color and wavelengths are still two separate things. Consider Descartess classic skeptical argument that it is possible that everything you are experiencing is a fiction being fed to you by an evil all powerful demon. This fiction he is feeding you may have no relation to reality. It is possible that this is actually your existence and there is no way to prove it is not. A more modern example of this is the Matrix. In this scenario light and their wavelengths may not exist at all they might just be something that the demon made up and decided to feed you. There may be no photons at all. In that situation you could sill with  certainty say that color existed simply by the fact that you experience it directly. Just because the light causing it may not exist does not mean the sensation of color that you are having does not. Its the same as if you hallucinate Godzilla Godzilla does not exist but your sensory experience of Godzilla certainly does.Color is a sensation that you feel light and its wavelengths are a possible cause but they are not one and the same. If color equaled light then in the demon scenario it would be required that light and photons to exist for you to experience color but it is not required. They are not the same thing color requires you to sense it to exist light may exist independently of if you are around or not. Just to clarify I am not saying I believe that we live in the Matrix or that our lives are some demonic fiction. It is just possible. I do in fact believe light is real and we dont live in the matrix.,woahdude,d4f9ul0,1,t5_2r8tu

The pool on the roof of WG is at about the same height as the letters on the AON Building nearby which as the diagram shows are about m below the roof height of USB. Now which building is taller One or the New York Times Bldg Clearly One is taller but heres the spire height trick One has a roof height of m while NYT has a spire height of m. While a spire can be used for aesthetic purposes like the Chrysler Building it seems like a device used these days to cheat on building height. Just look at the NYT spire!

Over the healing process your body treats ink like the foreign substance it is and will compartmentalize it within cells to protect the body from it.

8158157,0,t1_d4x3qpm,Animals are scared shitless of owls. Thats a given. Butterflies often fly above things that eat butterflies. Suppose one of those butterfly predator organisms single creature as opposed to the population of organisms often called species in this context mistook a particularly eyeish shape on the bottom of a butterflys wing above it for the glare of an owl triggered an oh shit! and the animal immediately bolts before it realizes wait thats not an owl.Now we have a seed for evolution to work on. That one butterfly survived and passed on its genes  the genes which have a somewhat owleyey shape on the wings. This set of genes could move around in the population over several generations or more before the next incident of oh shit its an owl! that saves another butterfly. But it happens eventually.So these genes which are slowly being selected for by these predators are now all around in the butterfly population in that area at least and so most butterflies will have eyeish looking shapes. Now all that has to happen is another mutation to push it further into the shape of a photo of an owl. Remember there are tons of mutations happening all the time. Most of these end in stillbirth or whatever the butterfly equivalent is because the mutation breaks something important and few just dont affect anything important genetic drift but fewer still will act upon the genes that determine the eyeishness of their wings. If the mutation pushes the look away from owleyes those butterflies are more likely to not be balked at and instead eaten so they cant reproduce due to death. If the mutation pushes it toward owleyes then those butterflies with that mutation are even more likely to be balked at and more likely to pass on their more eyeish genes. Lather rinse repeat until you get that shape.Its like how Japanese fishermen selected crab carapaces to look like faces,woahdude,d4xbgc5,8,t5_2r8tu

Where Im from tower cranes are pretty rare. Many tower cranes these days have their own bathrooms coffee machine and microwaves though.Have I ever dropped a load on someone thing? No. Havnt killed anyone or caused any property damage.Its still an extremely stressful job you have to be  aware of what your machine can do. You have to understand how a load on a piece of cable  feet long will move when you move the boom and how to stop it from moving. You have to beable to feel  hear the machine talking to you watch parts of the machine moving watch the load watch the computer and communicate with workers. How to get into it? Work construction on a job with a crane make friends with the operator and start asking questions. Im from NY and to get a chance to test for my license I had to prove to DoL that I had been working with cranes for  years and  hours of experience. ,woahdude,d6ss3b7,2,t5_2r8tu

9104269,0,t1_d85o4gc,This is the right answer.  Above  if very difficult because thats the threshold that the FCC decided was the highest you could possibly need unless you have a very compelling reason.See Wiki here gt In the United States the FAA and the FCC must approve all towers exceeding  feet  m in height. Furthermore it is very difficult to get permission for structures over  feet  m high. The FCC presumes them to be inconsistent with the public interest while the FAA presumes them to be a hazard to air navigation resulting in poor airspace usage. A significant burden of proof is placed on the applicant to show that such a structure is in the publics best interests. Only when both agencies have resolved all legal safety and management concerns is such an application approved. ,woahdude,d866qm9,19,t5_2r8tu

It really isnt true New Yorkers are some of the best and kindest people but we socialize differently. Its like living on a crowded elevator. We avoid eye contact and dont make small talk with strangers because social privacy is all we have and it is rude to violate that privacy without permission.That actually applies ti most big cities and is part of why people from capitals are often considered rude by the rest of the country yes I know NY isnt a capital.

9669920,0,t1_da4xvkx,No construction workers bust their ass.Im involved in the constructionlumber industry in Canada well not exactly I am the head of IT for a largeish company and am involved in some of the projects that range from condos to group homes to warehouses to big box stores etc. and I provide IT support to a number of construction companies and engineering firms. Open shop places work hard pay well if you work hard offer good benefits because its competitive and you want to attract and keep the better crews and are trying to get the job done quickly and to code so you dont waste money fixing your fuckups so you can move on to the next project youve bid on and so the engineer involved in your project is willing to work with you on the next projects. That was a professionalgrade run on sentence.I have seen bad contractors and I have worked with good contractors. Often I get to talk with five or six private companies while they watch in dismay as they are forced to wait for the city crew to complete some  hour job over the course of two weeks and thus allow them to proceed with their construction project. The city crews always seem to be built from nepotism and protected by union reps almost universally in the US and Canada. And the city halls seem to have planners and engineers with no idea how to put time bonuses and penalties on contracts they bid out or how to plan for a  hour work day on any project or to grasp that paying  more to get a job done today is cheaper than paying  more four or five years from now.I could rant for hours.

I subsequently dove at them with everything I had the sleek but heavy frame of the UH screaming towards the still unsuspecting crowd blades of the chopper extensions of my very body and soul. A collective scream rose up from the crowd as they realised what wrath they had just brought upon themselves. It was too late.People eviscerated in the tens limbs organs and vitriol spattering any who survived the initial assault in a thick chunky stinking mess. Alas they did not survive for long. The helicopter exploded in a blossom of fire and molten shrapnel tearing all who remained into stringy pieces of flesh and shards of bone.

Literally everything else is the same because locks are spring based not gravity based.If having a lock upside down made lockpicking any more difficult it would make using a key more difficult because they are doing the exact same thing raise the key pins to the shear line so the tumbler can turn.

Secondly Im not saying this happens overnight in some glorious spectacle Im saying that black holes most definitely do pull most things into them but over trillions of years as I already said once. Also us being in a stable orbit with one of the most middle of the road and stable stars weve seen is a lot different from a blackhole spinning x faster. Our current understanding of the universe is that every cell of super clusters will eventually drift away from each other faster than the speed of light while everything inside the cell very slowly pulls towards whatever has the highest mass. This will inevitably be a blackhole which will make it grow more etc. Blackholes also most definitely do eat unparalleled amounts of matter and suck things in. Assuming that everything that flies towards a black hole is gonna orbit it is pretty ridiculous. Achieving a balanced orbit is pretty dang hard. ,woahdude,ddu2t9d,4,t5_2r8tu

Youll notice on their website that they dont show the full process of threading the tape through the machine or starting and stopping a run. This thing is about impossible to tear off after youre done laying it down. It results in a tangled mess on the end because you cant tear the tape cleanly without pulling the gun up off the floor.You actually can buy an adapter to use other gaff tape brands but it didnt work very well either.

10954529,0,t3_5wg1yf,The only reason it is floating is due to an upward air draft from the HVAC system. It is extremely light but it is not lighter than air.When solids are labeled as lighter than air they are saying that if they were sealed and the interior structure was filled with a vacuum instead of air which it inevitably is the total density of the volume would be lighter than air.Imagine a large aluminum foil sphere filled with water. That would sit nicely on the bottom of your pool it wouldnt float because it is filled  with water and the aluminum itself is denser than water.Instead now the aluminum ball is filled with air that same sphere will now float in the water. Because the volume of the whole space is less dense than the water. The aluminum is more dense but the air is a lot less dense. The same reason a steel ship can float.Now the same situation as a waterair sphere can happen with an airvacuum sphere or other construct. Its theoretical at this point because we havent made anything with a low enough density that can maintain a vacuum that would allow a solid object float on air. But there are some solids that if they could maintain a vacuum they would be capable of floating on air. But as of now they are a boat full of holes sotospeak.TLDR Carbon nanotubes are more dense than air but they can be developed into materials that in a vacuum are less dense than air but none of them are capable of maintaining a vacuum in air.,woahdude,de9vr46,275,t5_2r8tu

By not jumping up and coming down onto the bouncy he keeps his momentum lateral as much as possible making his inertia easier to deflect upwards. If he jumped up and then came down onto the ball he would have to fight the energy bringing him down before he could launch back up. If done with proper technique called a block in HJ an athlete can convert their lateral momentum into vertical momentum with pretty good efficiency.,woahdude,dfa3h47,14,t5_2r8tu

11398058,0,t1_dfntzwd,To slightly add on to this the basic idea comes from something called the Tusi Couple Its basically rotating a small circle inside a circle twice the diameter by having one point on the circumference of the smaller circle stay on the diameter of the larger circle. This in turn can get extrapolated into a larger Tusi motion which shows the dots moving in a circle. This gif essentially just doubles down on the sheer number of points and adds a color spectrum into it. Part of the reason this illusion works of course is do to our tendency to observe the global motion as opposed to local motion. If you want to get more technical we end up forming a gestalt of the circle and thereby not just watching individual points progress down a linear route. ,woahdude,dfnyeak,15,t5_2r8tu
