11323623,0,t3_61lm5m,In house is expensive. I usually use the HD to try an opera or performers Im not familiar with. Plus they show old productions occasionally like Julie Taymors Magic Flute which you cant see live.You have an unbeatable view because the camera zooms in on faces. This can also be a negative because you dont get to choose where to look. That being said you cant beat the live sound and theres something more special about being at the Met and seeing your favorites in person. I just wouldnt do that more than a few times a year because of the cost. Anyone whos interested should just give it a try. Its a  risk and there are tons of available dates. ,NYCopera,dffiii6,3,t5_3egkf
