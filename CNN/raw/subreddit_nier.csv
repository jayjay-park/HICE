3597964,0,t1_cpnb5la,Drakengard  is the only game thats really connected to Nier.  Nier takes place after the last possible obtainable ending in Drakengard .  You can think of Drakengard  and Nier as happening in different timelines that split at Drakengard .Drakengard  is a prequel to the the entire series.Overall Drakengard  is a game where the gameplay is very dated.  It gets old and boring quickly.  On the other hand the exposition and narrative almost rivals that of Nier.  If nothing else you can always read the wiki and tv tropes to get what the Drakengard series is about.Grimoire Nier is also a really good extra book of reading for Niers universe.,nier,cq2e7dp,4,t5_2w4iz

Hes either moving the camera midcombo or repositioning B during an evade to create an angle where its easier to judge distance. gt Youre explanation of them is very nice by the way.Thanks. Years of playing fighting games taught me to keep my notation clean so its easier to relay information.gt Now how to pull off that weapon switch ha haUnfortunately theres no shortcut just good old fashion practice.

10502381,0,t3_5pzyv4,If you like this games combat I highly recommend trying Bayonetta  at some point if you can get ahold of a Wii U.I was on an action game kick recently I played through all three God of War games for the first time and briefly checked out Dantes Inferno and DMC and . Afterwards I popped in Bayonetta  for the first time in about  years just to remind myself how good that game felt. Holy moly good LORD that is a goodass action game. I think I can confidently say that Bayonetta  has the most viscerally satisfying combat of any game Ive ever played. Everything from the depth of the movesets to the sheer meatiness of landing hits I think hitting things with the Takemikazuchi is more satisfying than hitting anything with any other weapon in any other game ever and the enemies reactions to being hit to the genius ways in which it solves everything thats frustrating about the God of War games to how many radically different weapons you get... I think Bayonetta  has simply solved the whole genre. Im not really sure where there is to go from there its damn near perfect.Anyway I was also impressed by the Automata demo. While it wont match Bayonetta which is an incredibly unfair expectation anyway it certainly feels just about as good. It just wont be as deep and the weapon movesets will be much smaller unless there are a ton more moves and combos to unlock in the full game which to be fair could be the case. It got me to go play through the first Nier and I am so glad I did and its my second most anticipated game at the moment only slightly behind Nioh and that might only be because Nioh is so close.,nier,dcyk13k,2,t5_2w4iz
10632620,0,t1_ddcnyc4,Ive read the previous Nier game also had a very good story and Im all in for a game that has good gameplay with nice single player story mode so NieR Automata fulfills my requirement.I definitely appreciate that other action RPG developers are emphasizing on good combat mechanics in their games like FromSoftware does especially what they did with Bloodborne.

10962485,0,t3_5wf6lm, hours  quests complete  lore complete have most of the weapons seen all of the major endings and have a handful of the very extensive easter egg content done.God tier best of its subgenre and easily one of the best computer games ever made. Go slow explore everything do everything dont rush.Played on PSPro had no technical issues or bugs minor very minor slowdowns in the heaviest combat sequences and some occasional hitching while streaming near a zonezone crossing point.Graphically competent although LOD is a little aggressive in some areas for my taste. Skin shaders and animation is gorgeous and some of the area design is stellar. That being said fps gt eye candy for a game like this imo and where others will probably find fault I was happy to see sensible compromise texture detail for example. Gameplay wouldve been horrid at fps see Drakengard  p Will certainly doubledip on PC for maximum fidelity presuming its a good port.Definitely recommend reading up on the original Niers story beforehand. Not because you need it as such but theres bits and bobs that will seem a little disjointed compared to the atmosphere if youre not familiar with earlier eras of the setting. Therell also be a lot of stuff where the significance will be lost on you. For that reason briefly delving into Drakengard lore as well wont hurt either. Almost everything major from the Flower through to the final fight above Tokyo is referenced.No need to read up on the YoRHa stage play however  its lovingly summarized in a novella presentation ingame. Very thoughtful of the team tdlr gonna be a long time until we see another RPG title of this quality. Up there with Planescape Torment and FFVIVII for me.,nier,deapbhu,2,t5_2w4iz

10997106,0,t1_dedy23p,I think its more specifically that SquareEnix lets him be himself because they know the fans come to him for his specific vision. Drakengard  was made without him and at least as far as the western fanbase is concerned its the least interesting game in the series and usually ignored. Whatever problems he or his games may have there was at least SOMETHING that was interesting in all his games that Ive experienced and when he is at his best he is practically unmatched. No other game I can think of really had anything on the level of the D ending in Nier for example in my opinion its easily one of the most brilliant uses of game mechanics as storytelling that I have ever seen. This on top of the very distinctive and memorable characters and excellent story hook with the second playthrough. It had some structural issues in the story and stuff I thought could have been better explained but even with those flaws I still think it has better and more interesting writing than the vast majority of JRPGs out there.People have been mentioning these other big games coming out in the same timeframe but the only game Im particularly interested in besides Automata right now is Breath of the Wild and as much as I expect to enjoy the game I doubt Ill enjoy it as much as Automata.,nier,deehl3w,6,t5_2w4iz

The game is very vague with the DoD connection presumably because a lot of Automata players wont have played the Midgardside stuff.The eyes are definitely a direct reference however. Eves tattoo plus Terminals throwback design to ManahOneBrother Oneetc. Plus if you look at Adam and Eve next to each other and take the parts of their clothing from each side of their body you get a total look that is stylistically identical to Gabriella.We know in the lore that all maso was supposed to be summoned back to Midgard or the Watchers realm? Im not sure if it was specific in a ritual prior to Nier. But that clearly has exceptions because of Emil and .During Space War the aliens then fight  million billion? I forget Emil clones meaning theres bound to be a lot of maso influenced material knocking about. It doesnt surprise at all that the machines which seem to have cannibalised Emils clones for their machines then end up under the influence of maso and the Flowers power.,nier,detd4b3,1,t5_2w4iz

Its not that bad at p but it gets worse the higher you go. I took some screenshots to show what I mean since I havnt seen this being brought up yet.At p there is noticable low res light effect going on around edges same applies to the heat effect in the dessert god rays etc.at p it looks like this a lot better especially around BBut this is how it should look like at higher resolutions and not just pThe whole UI is only p as well.

While I dont think its close to being on the same level as this game Valkyria Chronicles easily ranks in at  for best single player story driven game for me.My biggest problem with the game was that the gameplay kinda fell flat halfway through there wasnt much of a reason to actually play the RTS aspect when there were a few OP characters that could literally solo entire missions. You were usually better off just taking a few dudes for the command points they gave you and just constantly piloting one or two characters throughout the entire mission.Lategame Alicia was probably the biggest gameplay killer all of her abilities were stupidly broken and if you did the extra missions to get the special scout weapons then her gun became stupidly broken as well.I actually have a series of videos I put on YouTube of me just completing every single mission in the game in literally a single turn just using Alicia.,nier,dfcpvdg,3,t5_2w4iz

11415965,0,t3_62wdue,spoilerIMO hard and very hard are not challenging but annoying. Often than not you will be placed in a cluster fuck where its almost impossible for common people to take zero damage. For example the first Emil fight underground is literally impossible on very hard. Theres no way for you to tell where the head is coming from and its just too messy to even try dodging.Also hard forces you to equip defensive chips. If you dont theres almost no difference between hard and very hard as you will get oneshotted frequently either way. Basically hard and very hard also takes away the point of chip system.I finished my game on both hard and normal and hard is really not that great. But after certain levels difficulties other than very hard wont matter anymore because nothing can do damage to you anyways.For best experience start a new save and play on normal. Dont equip any defensive chips and limit your offensive chips so you dont slash through everything with two hits. This way you actually have a very pleasant challenge and the later you go the harder the enemies become. Edit Also dont use enhancement items. Use only small recoveries and limit it to  per fight.,nier,dfpzl39,1,t5_2w4iz
11416802,0,t1_dfpu0v1,Havent seen Cyborg. TY for the reference and info though.ampnbspYknow I would actually choose a human wife over an android because of the full potential of what humans are capable of. We are also programmed to not betray each other and to always love one another these conditions happen automatically when human partners resonate with one another on a mental physical and spiritual level. Humans are capable of not ever getting sick living extremely long lives telepathy... and thats the tip of the iceberg. This is also not unrealistic. It was common in more ancient civilizations but weve lost touch of it now and are taught to be more materialistic  also being taught beliefs about life and society that literally retard us from our full potential.The way humans as a collective species act now its probably indeed tempting to say that an android programmed to always love you is the best way to romantic happiness but humans are naturally capable of the same  without a forced command. Look at how S logically wanted to discard humans but was programmed to want them  and suffered. Look at how Devola and Popola knew that human extinction wasnt their fault but were programmed to feel constant guilt  and suffered despite their logic knowing otherwise. In other words that programmed love has the potential to stifle their true desires potentials interests and has the potential to contradict whatever level of chemistry theyd have with you. I bet you could totally imagine some abuse doujin thats like this guys vile and is absolute scum but I have no choice but to love him she says as she gets throatfucked by the stereotypical  pound sadistic shadowyeyed hentai male.Both sides of the relationship would be happy if the love was everlasting based on the byproduct of fantastic chemistry not based on a directive that pigeonholes their thinking. ...and the chemistry thing is realistically possible for everyone!ampnbspNot sure if Automata would be fitting for androidhuman pairing. I mean... where da humans at? Id suggest going back thousands of years to the days in which the replicants were in love with the likes of Popola and Devola.

11548521,0,t3_64rrvw,While replaying the game for the third time I took notice of a particular line of dialogue that occurs during route B.The line occurs after defeating the final group of golden robots in the flooded city.A line about revenge the thing that part of him wants and yet at the same time doesnt. The way his tone changes so much after the initial conversation with the pod the fact that hes talking to himself rather than replying to the pod and the particular track that happens to play Mourning which seems to be associated with dark events that relate to S as it plays both after the Amnesia quest and during the segment in S memory region as A at the end of route C gives me the feeling that this line is yet another indication of S awareness.After being told that revenge was considered justified in certain circumstances he quietly says to himself And yet I.....And yet despite what he knows E has done to him not only does he not want revenge he doesnt even feel it to be justified.Perhaps Im looking to get too much out of a single line of dialogue but what else could it be relevant to ? The machine he just killed ? Hes felt no remorse killing the other members of the golden robot family despite them also having clear intentions of avenging their fallen family.Even after killing the last golden stubby his first lines give no indication of remorse for his actions.Out of the  possible contexts for this line I think my interpretation is far more likely.,nier,dg51054,17,t5_2w4iz

11614168,0,t1_dgc4j02,If you stopped before the game was fully installed for the first time you might be ok but database rebuild is what actually fixes the issue which means that it still might be necessary in your case if you ever want to use the . patch. Try updating to . and if the menu issues dont come back then youre most likely fine. Still theres also an almost identical problem in the hacking minigame but in this case it breaks main questline for route B so watch out for that too as those bugs even though theyre similar and likely caused by the same issue arent linked. First location you can check for the hacking bug is the Amusement Park bossfight in route A.From what I understand about this bug PS database has some kind of filelist or download manifest for NA which is then overwritten with incomplete version from . patch which prevents some required files from installing. If you had those files installed previouslyas in full offline install before patching like in point  then those files are physically available only not marked in the manifest and the game will be able to use them but broken data manifest means that PS cant fully manage the games files and to resynchronize the consoles DB with actual contents of the hard drive you literally have to wipe all traces of NA from your console then rebuild the DB then fully install from disc while offlinetakes up to hr then patch.,nier,dgch55h,1,t5_2w4iz
11618545,0,t3_65sonw,I havent played it since I beat it almost a month ago. I felt genuinely empty after clearing it through endingE and I stayed like that for like a week. But at the same time what I had played was so completely satisfying I did everything the game had to offer before doing the ritual I havent had any real desire to go back because the story has already been told and the impact was already felt. Playing it again wouldnt have the same feeling and Id only be playing it for the gameplay at that point. Oh and for the record I had already played all the Drakengard games and Nier before Automata.Going to work was also pretty depressing after clearing it because of the hole it left in my heart. I didnt even want to get up. This game is a true masterpiece and I dont think there will be anything like it again for a very long time.That was how I felt then. Right now tho. I feel perfectly fine.

It was much better done by the JP VA.spoiler and went JP from there up until Ending E. Facial expressions work much better for the Japanese VO as well they are less exagerrated in regards to what they are saying. It can look a little jarring in english at times.
