451657,0,t3_1z7qzp,This is definitely CG.  It has a decent track but the compositing is pretty bad.  It looks as if its floating above the environment instead of part of it.  The lighting on the creature is too harsh and does not match the surroundings.  Its also poorly animated.  The camera man pans away slowly? to see a guy on a bike.  If I was filming a mysterious beast I wouldnt take the camera off of it for any reason let alone to check out a bike.  Assuming this was an amateur... Why a slow pan?  Why not whip over then whip back?The nail in the coffin is the poop quality of the video.  When youre compositing something the junkier you can make it and the higher compression you use help blend the mistakes you cant correct for.  Think about all of the lens flares in Star Trek.  Also Im not saying this is the free model they used but the proportions coloring and physical attributes are similar.  You could easily change the skin color with texture modifying and lighting.  ,theunexplained,cfrlohk,6,t5_2utrq
821590,0,t3_23i7gi,Not sure if paranormal or not but in the slowed down and zoomed in shot at the end it looks as if the big guy in the grey shirt looks at the figure when it passes him by. Ive seen a shadow person before this figure could definitely be one.,theunexplained,cgxo0gq,2,t5_2utrq
