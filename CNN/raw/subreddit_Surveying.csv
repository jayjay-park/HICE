Has all the vegetation grasstrees been cleared?   Reread it as proposed Subdivision plan so disregard this bit Any buildings in the way yet? How much detail do they require on the roads? Crown Lip IOK BOK? Need underground services located? Drainage Pipe ILs?     Standard detail with that size I would go hr for setting control  connecting to benchmarks property corners reference marks etc. hr to level the control if tolerances were really tight Trig heights would probably be ok for your specified project though. Then  days minimum to detail. I would probably allowquote for  or  though.,Surveying,cmta2oa,4,t5_2v46o

5387245,0,t3_3oshb6,First look up your states licensing requirements every state has requirements for both education and work experience as well as  pretty intensive exams and in some states oral examination. From reading this it seems you have the perception that land surveying is just like any other line of work but in fact it is a profession I dont mean this in a condescending way. Just as a comparison its like youve posted to a doctors sub asking hey I want to open my own business as a pediatrician... Youre probably going to be in for more than just a  year walk in the park with an associates degree to get licensed. The fact is youre not going to be able to run a surveying business without a license under any circumstances in all of the states Im aware of its against the administrative rules of the state licensing board to allow anyone without a license to run a surveying business even with a licensed surveyor working under them.However if youre willing to do what it takes to gain the necessary school and work experience I think youll do well. Any amount of business savvy and the ability to network well will inevitably lead to success in this business. Just know that theres a lot of liability tort or professional liability in everything that you do and youre going to have to oversee a lot of the details of every project to ensure your ass is covered either that or pay someone else a lot of money to do it for you.As far as starting a business goes I wouldnt worry about the whole hiring a grizzled veteran thing. The whole point of the licensing process is that youre supposed to have a full understanding of the process before you can start working in that owner operator capacity. I think the best attitude to have would be to focus on becoming that grizzled veteran if youre really serious about becoming a land surveyor and starting your own business.,Surveying,cw0a4jg,6,t5_2v46o

What theyre likely checking is the alignment of said monuments and their relative positions to ground points not located on the dam to see if the dam moves or shifts.

Literally just start cold calling surveying firms near you and ask if they need a newly learning survey assistant part time. It will help out your academics as well.Also most firms will pay you proper wage for work experience. Just be clear from the get go that you are starting from scratch.Also dont make the same mistake I did when I started a new job and call a mm error not that big.

11110367,0,t3_5yft7e,I also forgot to mention that you can perform a scale from grid to surface in TBC before exporting your CSV along with translation and rotations. You can also use excel to scaletranslate if need be. You can also perform rotations in excel but it gets a little complicated there.Another thing to consider is a field calibration when youre using GPS where once completed enables your survey crew to work in surface or even in an assumed coordinate system in the field.Create a clean calibration file where the calibration is applied and when working on the site just copy the calibration file and rename it to your standard field file name each time you start a new job file in the field. You can have as many of these as needed for different scale factors at different jobs. This also ensures that the crews and the techs are always working with the same coordinates avoiding giving a crew stake outs in surface when theyre working in grid.,Surveying,dercmtj,1,t5_2v46o

11673997,0,t3_66kf03,Ive only been able to get OPUS accuracies of  .. Mind you this is at the sigma  confidence interval.I had a long discussion with another surveyor and we both agreed that RTK GPS is going to probably give you better results than a levelloop at more than two miles. If not its certainly more timeeffective for the result.If this is a force main just say fuck it and OPUS the two ends. The contractor is just going to slap that thing in.If its a gravity main how flat is it going to be? Minimum slope for gravity sewer is . Which means you need at least ft of fall over three miles.Since I assume youll be construction staking this line later What I would do is use RTK to set control along the alignment. Hit everything twice with the base in different locations. OPUS the bases. You can finalize the elevations by doing weighted averages of the data or just pop it all into StarNET.If you want it better RTK a third time with the base in a third location. Itll still be faster than running a loop.,Surveying,dgj9i8q,3,t5_2v46o
