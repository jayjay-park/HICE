363160,0,t3_1y6k85,What ever happened to buds? I liked the place for watching games despite somewhat terrible service confused themes drag bingo in a sports bar? and mediocre food. It was there and busy all the time and then it was just gone. ,Queens,cfieo54,1,t5_2r2s3
365439,0,t1_cfifzii,I had the opposite problem. My potato was overcooked to the point where it felt like I was eating potato chips. I too was excited by the idea but the execution.... eh.

571091,0,t3_20lfkc,Flushing is an interesting place Ive come to loath it over the years due to there being an overwhelming amount of people here. But it serves as the major connection point between most of North Queens and Manhattan due to the  train and the plethora of buses that have their terminal station here. Union St. is pretty much the divider of all things Korean and Chinese. West of Union St. You will have most of the Chinese shops and anything East is pretty much all Korean. Most of the Korean shops are set up along Northern Blvd. Auberndale and Murray Hill are the two areas where youll find a higher concentration of the Korean night life they have a ton of bars restaurants and KTVs. In terms of museums and zoo there isnt really one in Flushing most of them are in Manhattan or Bronx if you want a zoo. However we do have a few  parks Flushing Meadows Park I believe they have a museum in there Kissena Park and Queens Botanical Garden. If youre planning on moving here I would definitely suggest you visit both areas to see what you feel would fit best for you.,Queens,cg56ryc,1,t5_2r2s3
607878,0,t1_cg91opl,Awesome googling it right now!  Thank you.  This was what I was looking for.  Ive been googling apartment buildings and property management companies everything but I know Im missing a lot of places that are probably good choices too just from not being up in that area.  I was hoping there would be some people in the area that would give me specific names of places to look. ,Queens,cg9d9zp,1,t5_2r2s3

1296027,0,t3_28waae,London Lennies seafood in Middle Village. I love the menu but it can get kind of busy. I have heard good things about Reef seafood in Forest Hills.Danny Brown Wine Bar tapas American is great and would probably be quieter. I guess that is in Forest Hills too. It isnt in Queens but since it is the summer I feel OBLIGATED to suggest anywhere on City Island. They have a plethora of restaurants all in different price ranges and you could hang out in Orchard Beach or Pelham Bay Park beforeafter. Traffic on the weekends it awful though.,Queens,ciff4jx,4,t5_2r2s3

Also great for Ecuadorian Peruvian and Colombian. Some Vietnamese restaurants too. Walk a few blocks west for the IndianNepalese hood. North for more Latin vibes. I live between the JH and Elmhurst ave station. Theres a few drunks but this neighborhood is not only safe but a good value for what youre getting.

3900044,0,t3_353vu9,Thanks Fox News. The teacher did the right thing by standing up to the mom and shame on the principal for caving in. If this is true you better to report it to the local news station and let them run the story to get more coverage and to have the principal reprimanded by the school board. Thats better than a bunch of angry callers flooding her phone and voicemail. ,Queens,cr0u7xz,2,t5_2r2s3
3970701,0,t3_353vu9,Generally my teachers rule was if you werent handing them out to everyone in your class then they couldnt be distributed on school grounds and you would have to mail them out. If I were Muhammads mother I would raise hell for letting a parent come into the classroom and treat my child that way and I would have the principles head on a stake for condoning that mothers behavior. My only comfort would be that his classroom teacher is looking out for him. ,Queens,cr8w5qw,1,t5_2r2s3
