3072346,0,t3_2vcepi,This is exactly what I was looking for for the last few months D I wanted to send cards to my US friends and since Im in Europe its a total pain and sometimes I dont know if theyll even get it.I generally like the feel of the site but you desperately need more card designs to offer. Having more card categories than designs per category just makes it feel even emptier.Also since youre probably printing these anyway have you thought about adding a custom design option? Customer sends you a photojpeg and you print that out? For a bigger price of course. I feel like that would make the service even more interesting.,Entrepreneurship,cogg247,2,t5_2qhww

With all of your experiences within this field you must have knowledge that would be valuable to others. I would consider creating a business around teaching others a specific aspect of the software engineering industry or you can educate people on building SaS products.gt I would start by trying to build an email list within a certain niche you have the most knowledge about. You can promote content and your products or affiliate products to this list and create a substantial income once your list has reached a certain size.So you think that taking this new job at a pay cut would be a bad idea?  I should stay with my at home job that doesnt have travel but also doesnt expose me to alot of sales networking.  You think I can do without any of that?I tend to stay away from Affiliate marketing or anything with the term affiliate in it always brings in some shady characters.    The thing I want to sell is an actual software product that other tech companies of any size can use.  Think something like Heroku or CircleCi.,Entrepreneurship,d8rwfgp,1,t5_2qhww
