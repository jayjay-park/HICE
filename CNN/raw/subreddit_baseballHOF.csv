62688,0,t1_celazwm,Thanks for the comment. Youre really making me think this through and do my due diligence on backing up his case haha.Youre correct that we probably should regress Deans rates a little bit to compensate for the lack of a decline phase. That would still leave him in a good place not top  perhaps but still very good.  And yeah I wasnt trying to say that he compared to guys like Mathewson or Johnson necessarily simply that at his best he was a lot closer than one might think.As for the two pitchers you cited as comparisons both are pretty underrated Id say and should probably get more attention than they do now. Still Id argue that a. neither dominated their period quite the way Dean did the s not to mention that both played in lesser offensive environments b. both had great years but neither strung them together in a run of dominance quite the way Dean did in his prime and c. in fulllength careers their career counting stats dont quite blow you away I wouldnt be surprised if Dean accumulated greater counting stats in a hypothetical full career. ,baseballHOF,celkez9,1,t5_2ylcx
144720,0,t3_1vfnm3,Great list. Id also add Hiromitsu Ochiai to that list. Career . hitter  HRs  RBIs  time triple crown winner  time MVP.,baseballHOF,ceuwxq0,3,t5_2ylcx

911832,0,t1_ch7wsce,I couldnt remember when I was writing the post so I said perhaps.  I knew he played a bit in the Negro Leagues and the white minor leagues before MLB but couldnt remember where the debate ended up.Either way I think I like him better than Cepeda.,baseballHOF,ch7xjap,1,t5_2ylcx

1204439,0,t1_ci52x4t,gtI would argue that Murphys best year was  not Ill buy that as Murphy also played CF in  as opposed to RF in .gtMurphy has a better peak than almost all these guys in front of him by JAWSThats a tough argument to make.  The average CF HOF scores . in the top  portion while Murphy only gets .  There are  HOF CF some of whom rank below Dale in JAWS Max Carey Earl Averill Earle Combs Edd Roush Hugh Duffy.  I think the following players have a better peak than Murphy Carlos Beltran th in CF JAWS Andruw Jones th  although you really have to believe Andruw was perhaps the best defensive CF ever and I think I do Richie Ashburn th Billy Hamilton th Jim Edmonds th Jim Wynn thMurphy does have a better peak than Willie Davis Vada Pinson Cesar Cedeno Chet Lemon Larry Doby Kirby Pucket Johnny Damon or Fred Lynn.  Andre Dawson and Kenny Lofton are about even with Murphy.  Thats leaving out the best CF of course who blow away all these guys in peak the top seven CF by JAWS are in a class by themselves.  Murphy has a peak right in line with the guys ranked  by JAWS better than some worse than others and even with a couple.,baseballHOF,ci548m3,1,t5_2ylcx
1208759,0,t1_ci56k07,I totally agree the endpoints were picked to make Rice look as good as possible and he still squeaks by.  Hes not a dominant player.,baseballHOF,ci5lqo9,1,t5_2ylcx
1368907,0,t1_cinv8nx,gtWhy would you put Sutter ahead of Henke?Mostly due to the career IP but honestly it doesnt matter a ton as Im pretty unlikely to vote for either of them ever.  Im comfortable right now with  relievers as HOFers including Rivera.  Wilhelm Rivera Gossage and  others.  Henke doesnt make the cut as hes not as good as Quiz and probably not as good as Fingers and Smith.  Throw Eck in there and Henke is out of the top seven and off my list.  I havent taken a close look at Hoffman but hes in there somewhere as well plus Billy Wagner and John Franco.  Not saying those guys are better than Henke just saying I havent looked closely yet.,baseballHOF,cinvq6x,1,t5_2ylcx

1961403,0,t1_ckpisno,Well at least for fWAR BSR baserunning runs contributed basically is factored in. Probably the same for bWAR I would think though the calculation might vary slightly,baseballHOF,ckpjuaa,1,t5_2ylcx
1977216,0,t3_2glfcx,Yes to McPhee Childs Collins Browning and Thompson,baseballHOF,ckrgdi7,1,t5_2ylcx
2129262,0,t1_clafspo,Yay for the relievers! Id add Sammy Sosa too. He is on the lower end and his peak wasnt as elite but I think that with his HR total he has to be in.  Whats your case on Olerud and Berkman? I dont really see them as quite making it but Id like to hear your view. Finally I just dont see it with John,baseballHOF,clah5c2,1,t5_2ylcx
