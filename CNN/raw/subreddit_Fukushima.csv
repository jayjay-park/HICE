10747885,0,t1_ddof4s2,I hope you and your friend are ok. I think yes if we believe our governments then we will surely be ok.... in our minds but maybe not our bodies.Just like the world trade center where the government said no worries nothing harmful there to breath. Everything is fine. But years later it was discovered that the air was toxic and asbestos was everywhere and has killed many people.Im just saying it is wise to be skeptical of governments and companies when these disasters happen especially when they are proven liars and feed the public information that later turns out to be completely false when it comes to the SAFETY of a disaster site.,Fukushima,ddok967,2,t5_2sde9
