There was one move we should have made spread to  hands at the end of the shoe but since we were sitting th and th spots we couldnt really tell it was the end. We were betting the side bet that hand and afterwards we realized that if had indeed played  hands we would have definitely won k a grand each possibly k depending how the cards played out afterwards. We came back later did everything right and decided to bet a big more than usual because some key cards were still in the deck and we had another close miss would have one if someone sat out. That second one wasnt as annoying since theres no reasonable way we would have played that once differently. Thats kk total between the two of us we were that close to getting. Keep in mind this isnt the same as getting an  instead of  or having cards rearrange in a funny order. If hands were addedtaken off the rearrangement would have gave us winning side bets!

I would start with one or both of those and then look for something more specific to whatever system you decide to play or strategies youre interested in. The wizard also has a decent list that Id check out. Oh and personally I thought Ken Uston on Blackjack was an interesting read.

10148040,0,t1_dbu5hxs,Okay. Then why even bother counting? Counting hinges on the premise that basic strategy becomes more true when the count is higher. In practical terms that means youre more likely to win a hand if the count is favorable so long as youre adhering to basic strategy. But if thats not true as youre saying then why even bother paying attention to the count? If theres no correlation between count and wins then a player should just maintain a steady unchanging bet the whole time. Or is that the whole point youre making?,blackjack,dbuaj5n,1,t5_2qrr6

For example if you have a  edge you would bet  of your bankroll. However betting full kelly carries with it incredible swings almost no one would want to stomach. So the alternative would be to bet half kelly or quarter kelly. The MIT team would bet True Count   betting units which works out to roughly half kelly.
