9216407,0,t3_56jrfn,Microsoft really needs to get more documentation and resources out for Nano. Have spent the last week trying to get Nano server running on some physical tin as a test HyperV cluster to compare to ESXi but honestly its taken hours trying to learn all the ins and outs and I am still miles off. The whole thing feels extremely unpolished and in need of improvement.,WindowsServer,d8k8xkc,1,t5_2tmlc
