11053280,0,t1_dekv82n,Interesting that must be why it was near impossible to find footage these new songs,fatherjohnmisty,dekvcfw,3,t5_2xgno
11232726,0,t1_df57hpq,I do feel as if the album gets to a more personal note as it progresses.  A question a lot of us discussed was the meaning behind the three bells at the end of In Twenty Years or So?  Anything specifically special behind it? ,fatherjohnmisty,df57q7v,1,t5_2xgno

11274736,0,t3_60tyqg,Id like to add from Paper Bag The weaker the signal the sweeter the noise.  That line is AMAZING  draws together so many things... imagery nostalgia and life truth.... so cool.,fatherjohnmisty,df9z3wa,3,t5_2xgno
11284756,0,t3_612ccs,Josh gives a good interview despite some really shallow jabs and punches from Rolling Stone. Theyre all about that click bait I hate them.,fatherjohnmisty,dfb3zgg,2,t5_2xgno

11354869,0,t1_dfj0doz,I just feel like being a Wordpress account that previously belonged to him it would make sense that he still has the login. Also there is some truly ridiculous absurd stuff on there if you spend some time with it..,fatherjohnmisty,dfj1xmu,2,t5_2xgno
11389823,0,t3_62hspj,So jealous... UK orders have just been dispatched. As I live in mainland Europe it probably wont arrive before Tuesday or Wednesday.,fatherjohnmisty,dfn0nb7,1,t5_2xgno

11724389,0,t1_dglihdg,Just listened....yeah not really that great.  Seems like it was a promotional obligation to Amazon for pushingcarrying Pure Comedy etc. The fact that they had words with him he mentions around Leaving LA and he still doesnt play probably means its just an awful promotional chore that wont really help him any so why do it.,fatherjohnmisty,dgozn8i,1,t5_2xgno
